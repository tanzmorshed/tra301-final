","What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.<br/><br/>A year passes and Juno get all the friends together to go spelunking. She lies and takes them to a cave she has discovered because she wants Sarah and her to be the ones who find the cave complex and name it. In Juno's sick mind, she's trying to perform some type of penance. She doesn't see that she's manipulating her friends to do something incredibly dangerous. Juno is a manipulator who only sees things from her own narcissistic point of view. Other people are only as real as Juno feels about them.<br/><br/>Going underground is dream imagery for going into the subconscious. This could be going into a basement under a bar as in Fight Club or even underwater.<br/><br/>Sarah is returning to the darkness that she ran from earlier. She starts to experience hallucinations (waking dreams) mainly her daughter's laugh. Her subconscious is pulling her back to the event that damaged her psyche (the wreck).<br/><br/>They get trapped and so must go deeper into the cave to find a way out. Thus Sarah is going deeper and deeper into her subconscious. It's not readily apparent but it's when they get to the deepest point of the caves (the deepest level of consciousness) that they actually encounter the cave people. If you watch you'll notice that they stop traveling downward (they may fall or are be pushed downward but the never choose to go down). Thus the cave people are the most base and ancient level of Sarah's mind. They lack all their senses. They have no problem-solving or tool-using skills but they are very strong and aggressive. They are a primal force.<br/><br/>While down with these creatures, several key events happen. The first is that Juno and Sarah's friends began to be picked off. The second is Juno's true character is revealed. She stabs one of her friends (accident) but then leaves rather then helps her (because of shock but on purpose). What's interesting is that as soon as Juno reunites with the main group, she makes a big show about she won't leave without Sarah who is missing. She acts differently when people are around. Character is what you do when others aren't watching. Juno is a person of weak character.<br/><br/>The biggest key event is that Sarah is separated from the group and ends up in the den of the cave dwellers. The heart of this lowest level of her subconscious. It is here that Juno's original betrayal becomes fully known to Sarah's conscious self. The friend that Juno stabbed is bleeding to death and tells Sarah of Juno and her husband. It's at this lowest level that Sarah understands Juno. Juno is the type of woman that would wreck the marriage of a good friend, stab a friend and leave them to die alone, and lead all her friends to certain death because of an ego trip. In short, Juno is a destructive force. Sarah kills her hurt friend to end her suffering. This is the action that Juno refused. Sarah empathized with her friend and refused to leave her in pain to make her escape. Juno did not do this. Juno felt that her feelings and safety were more important than her friend's suffering.<br/><br/>The other event that happens in this room, is that Sarah kills a cave dweller child and observes it's mother grieving over the loss. Sarah has now committed the same sin as Juno. The mother tries to kill Sarah. This is what is missing from Sarah's life. Sarah needs to take vengeance on Juno to become whole.<br/><br/>Sarah eventually meets up with Juno again and they began to make their way out as the last two survivors. After the last big fight against the cave dwellers, Sarah confronts Juno about her lies, manipulations, and betrayals. Then, Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for the cave dwellers. This the same action Juno took earlier when she stabbed her friend and left her. What is different is that Sarah makes a conscious choice to kill Juno and takes responsibility for the action where Juno avoids the responsibility of everything she has done.<br/><br/>Then there is a long sequence where Sarah is climbing upward out of the dark to the light. This is symbolic of a return to consciousness and the real world.<br/><br/>This movie has parallels with Hamlet. What is missing from Sarah is what was missing from Hamlet. They both need to take action but because of the horribleness of the action they must take, they have recoiled from it and spend the whole story getting to a point where they come to terms with what they must do to be whole."
"Youkilledmypine","9","406","562","12 July 2005"," Masterful horror film. Spoiler free review
","If nightmare inducing horror is not your bag then the less you know about The Descent the better. Geordie writer-director Neil Marshall has delivered an accomplished, well acted, out and out horror movie that comes as much of a pleasant surprise as his first major feature Dog Soldiers did back in 2002. Shot in a mere 7 weeks The Descent sees a sextet of undeniably attractive action women leaping headfirst into an Appalachian potholing adventure that goes wrong so quickly you are left wondering if any one of them will survive, let alone ever see daylight again.<br/><br/>There are comparisons to be drawn to Marshall's 'Soldiers of course - again the story is stark and wonderfully economic. Again there is group of six people, predominantly one sex accompanied with a lurking, ominous threat and again there are more nods to popular film culture than you probably realise. The Descent however has a sense of humour that is suitably pitch black.<br/><br/>Long before the cave appears we play witness to a traumatic event that underlies the plot and serves to both unite and tear apart relationships in equal measure. Mostly affected are fragile Sarah and physically strong Juno, an adrenaline junkie who leads the group further and further beneath the ground. No time is wasted in recreating the primal feel of crawling through tunnels with hard hats scraping the dust from the rocks, choking and inducing paranoia all the way as it lingers in the stale, torchlit air. It's here Marshall gets a little inventive. Playing with various different lighting techniques our heroines become colour coded through scenes via glow-sticks, flashlights and video camera. Sounds echo when visuals are briefly lost and deliciously bone crunching they are too. Events escalate quickly and the whole ride becomes what can only be described as a non-stop relentless assault on the senses that will demand repeated viewing.<br/><br/>The only thing that will ruin this movie for you is word of mouth, which ironically is exactly what this film will need to become commercially viable. But the less you know, the more you will enjoy it. Have fun spotting references to Carrie and Apocalypse Now by all means, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a mere standard entry into the much saturated genre-movie staple. The Descent will rank as one of the most unashamedly terrifying British films ever made. It was made by people that love good cinema, and it shows. The Descent was made before The Cave, and now has an alternate ending for new audiences."

","There aren't that many British horror films, so it's not too much of a stretch to call this one of the best British horror movies i've seen. It has flaws, but i've only seen a few films in my life that don't. It's incredibly entertaining though.<br/><br/>The basic premise: Fun-loving, adventurous Sarah suffers a personal tragedy, a year later her friends rally round and they go on a caving trip in the Appalachian Mountains in the US. Things go awry.<br/><br/>It's a slow starter this film, the tension is palpable from the start but things don't properly kick off for nearly an hour. Don't get me wrong, it's never dull, but the pacing of the film is similar to that of a roller-coaster. There's an uphill wind-up that builds suspense, but when it goes over the edge it just doesn't let up until you come to a juddering halt. All the horror techniques are used here, there are enough jumps (both telegraphed and not) that every pause will have you ready to flinch, but there's also fantastic use of suspense and everything about the film oozes menace and foreboding. A special mention is needed for the music. Like all good scores, it goes mostly unnoticed. But it's intertwined beautifully with the film, it moves you and misleads you, it swells from background plinks and plonks to grand, blaring orchestral pieces. The lighting is also masterful. When the girls split up, Marshall uses different lighting to indicate which person or group you are looking at. Whether it's through infra-red camera, luminous green light-sticks or red flares and torches, you instantly know who you're looking at, and that cuts down on the confusion very effectively. Flaws? The dialogue is a little clunky at the start, there's a few moments of cgi as they first enter the cave that are pretty shoddy. Other than that it ticks all the right boxes. Great acting, great plot, excellent gore levels, perfect ending. Not everyones cup of tea, but definitely mine. Hell hath no fury"
"enoonmai","10","377","540","9 July 2005"," Brilliantly tense from start to finish
","With Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall created a tight and claustrophobic atmosphere then added the scares to create a very good horror film. However, the tension was often released with humour and the audience were allowed to catch their breath and relax. At no point in The Descent are you allowed to relax as Marshall grabs your attention within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.<br/><br/>With the film set almost entirely underground, the lack of light is used to wonderful effect and Marshall keeps you on edge for 100 minutes; if you liked Dog Soldiers, 28 Days Later and/or Haute Tension and are sick of the formulaic rubbish being pumped out of Hollywood then The Descent is likely to be right up your street."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","139","196","18 August 2006"," If you go in there...
","After watching ""The Descent"", my bud Robert and I decided that spelunking would now come off both our ""To Do"" listsfor good. Writer and Director Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" crafts and sustains an unrelenting tension throughout, once you get past the suspended disbelief. As I watched the women one by one crawl through the tiny water filled crevice to enter the caverns somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, I thought, ""How are they going to get back? They've got to be nuts!"" Well, you just have to go with it. Well, kind of. Fortunately, director Marshall effectively pretexts the story. The prior thrill-seeking jaunt for the group was a white water rafting trip. Following that trip, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) suffers a life altering tragedy. A year later, Sarah and her close friend Beth (Alex Reid) join up with the gang at a cabin in the Appalachians. The 6 women are gearing up for a cave exploration trip headed by Juno (Natalie Mendoza). Apparently, Juno regrets not being there for Sarah following her personal tragedy and recovery. Juno sees this trip as an opportunity to empower Sarah. Those along for the ride include Becca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and Holly (Nora-Jane No one).<br/><br/>The trip starts out curious enough when Juno (Mendoza) discards her map of the caves. The women proceed, and are undeterred by the telltale signs of mysterious animal carcasses. Not surprisingly, the cave exploration goes horribly wrong. They are lost without a clue how to get out, and they are being hunted by terrifying fleshing eating creatures. So the women are literally in the fight for their lives. Marshall masterfully orchestrates the mood and tension. My bud Robert keenly pointed out that what really works in ""The Descent"" is that it never evolves into a trite action movie. No one screams, ""Take that you, Mother F-----!"" Granted Marshall may have intended his story as an empowerment allegory. The women are authentically terrified, and fight with all their courage and heart amidst their overwhelming fear. Somehow while they are thrashing and being thrashed by the fierce creatures, it is all strangely believablestrangely. Rather it gets you thinking: ""Would I do the same?"" Sarah (Macdonald) and Juno (Mendoza) in particular emerge as forces to be reckoned with. Mendoza's Juno warrior spirit is consistent and engagingshe is the brash leader. MacDonald is powerful and believable in Sarah's emergence as a heroic presence. All the performances are strong throughout.<br/><br/>Marshall maintains a claustrophobic feel and keeps us on edge. The unveiled details involving the cave creatures regarding their possible evolution is a nice touch. ""The Descent"" has to be one of the most gory horror movies with realistic violenceand I am not a big horror fan. However, I am a big hero fan. ""The Descent"" has great women heroes. Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza are awesome. ""The Descent"" is a wild tension filled ride. At the very end one wonders, ""What next?"""

","If you've seen the trailer you'll know what your going to get  suspenseful, claustrophobic thriller, when horrible things happen to a group exploring a cave system.<br/><br/>Sounds simple but the direction is top notch, good performances from all involved and it somehow manages to dodge most current horror/thriller clichés to deliver a well paced film, filled with enough jump inducing moments to even give this harden horror buff a few scares !

","I loved it, I went in expecting something along the lines of ""Dog soldiers"", something funny and enjoyable but instead I got a roller coaster ride of tension and fear. So often these days horror movies just aren't scary, they make you jump they have a little bit of atmosphere and that's it, well this film was scary. It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you. I don't want to go in to a lot of detail in this review, as I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who reads it, and that is what this film is an experience I came out of the cinema shaking.

","The descent is purely terrifying. It will provide you with an  experience that relates entirely to those of the characters on screen.  Each one is trapped, isolated and alone. In that theatre, you will  understand the fear of having no escape.  The film, like it's big brother 'Dog Soldiers', takes British horror to  it's deserved glory. Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete  mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable  characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious  fiction.   After a quarter of the film has passed, you pray for the characters  escape as, in a way, you will also be saved from the mental onslaught  that drives into your mind throughout.  I didn't expect anything from this film before I walked into the  theatre it, yet it is the greatest horror I have ever seen, and am  likely to for a very long time."
"NewEnglandPat","7","111","169","26 August 2006"," Dark, claustrophobic thriller hits the mark
","This tense thriller is a terrifying chronicle of six young women who explore caves in the Appalachian Mountains and find unspeakable horror thousands of feet down. A cave-in traps them with no way to retrace their steps, but don't yet know that a terrible fate lurks around the tunnel's next bend. The film is reminiscent of ""The Lost Patrol"" as the ladies band together as much as they can against a ghoulish and unseen foe, with each girl's nerves pushed to the breaking point. The movie's dark, claustrophobic look adds realism to the ghastly dangers that the young women face and the music score is effective. The girls have several encounters with the predators underground and use torches and climbing gear to fight off their attackers. Natalie Mendoza is the group's ambitious leader who misleads the other women about the caves and also tries to cover up an awful deed she committed in a wild flight to escape. The four other women on this ill-fated expedition are also good in difficult roles. This movie is certainly one of the best films of 2006."
"Larks-2","9","245","400","8 July 2005"," Magnificent gore fest
","The Descent is an exceptionally good film. I just wanted to state that at the start of this review, because it is easy to dismiss a film like The Descent as having some good gore scenes, but little else to commend it from a directorial or cinematographic point of view. However, with what must have been a budget that pales into insignificance when compared to films like Ring 2, the film packs in top class gore with exquisitely detailed 'creatures' and brilliantly claustrophobic cinematography.<br/><br/>Films with great gore abound, for example Jason X, with the audience just waiting for the next gruesome killing to end the tedium in between. However, The Descent keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout, struggling for breath as you feel the walls in the cinema closing in. This is a film to watch in a very dark cinema with great surround sound. You almost feel the creatures closing in around you.<br/><br/>I would have given 10 out of 10, but some of the acting is not top class, so that brings it down to 9 out of 10 for me. That aside, this is a must watch film for those who complain that horror films just aren't scary anymore. Just make sure that whoever you take with you is prepared for the experience. Word of mouth is sure to make this film a success."
"barberoux","8","123","199","18 August 2006"," Good Scary Movie
","When I read that ""The Descent"" featured an all women cast I expected a T+A extravaganza with spelunkers in too tight T-shirts and panties cavorting beneath the earth. I was disappointed. What I saw was a scary movie. I am not by nature claustrophobic but a few scenes of the close quarters they were climbing through left me squirming in my seat. I can't continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing."

"DJAkeeba","5","85","140","9 August 2006"," Is the studio posting these comments?
","I'm curious, because of a) the wild overpraising of this film, and b) the fact that some of the ""off-the-cuff"" comments showing up here are repeated word for word on other sites. I mean, sure, this movie has some good jump scenes, but the characters are murkily conceived and the monsters are absolutely ridiculous, resembling nothing so much as Chris Sarandon's old mid-change makeup from ""Fright Night"". If people are honestly serious and are not just shilling for the studio or for Mother England when they are praising this movie to the rafters, I think it proves three things: 1) Audiences value ""jump scenes"" more than honest scares. 2) No one is ever allowed to complain about ludicrous monsters in any movie ever. 3) Audiences don't care about plot details. If anyone can explain the line ""we all lost something in that crash""... and remember, the line was ""we ALL"", not ""she and I both""... please do so."
"soniaandree","5","35","54","12 September 2006"," Psychological thriller then gore-fest...
","Not knowing what to expect, the movie started rather well, with various references to other movies (road scene rather like ""The Shining"" etc.) and the actors were pretty much OK (What Saskia Mulder was doing here was my first question). Like in real life, you wonder why a group of women (who *so* obviously hate each other) would keep together and pretend to have fun, so the directors added a subplot based on the two main character's dislike for each other. So far so good. The caving was felt as getting more and more claustrophobic, and it was done in a way that the viewer would feel it too: dark, narrow passages, noises, flying dust etc. Then the appearance of creatures, I found, were rather too much: the directors could have relied more on the psychological tension and kept going, as the women would have tried to kill each other anyway (as it was a strong probability from the start). Then it went into such a gore, the pool of blood was such a rubbish thing to add to the scenario: the blood should have been congealed anyway. The alternative ending was like a rebirth of the main surviving character, who ends up free, so why spoil it with a birthday cake as a real ending? In this scenario, it is rather a miracle she survived at all, stuck in this manky cave, but a good reason nonetheless to decide to end it all. Maybe there's a lesson to be learnt from the movie: people can only survive in a wild hostile environment if they turn themselves into savages? For that, I'd rather watch ""Deliverance"" once more, thank you very much."

","Focusing on the fear of claustrophobia with the simple dread of the unknown, The Descent puts likable characters in frightening situations. As a horror fanatic, this film floats at the top of my list of best scary films in recent years. The setup feels like it moves quickly and seamlessly into the main storyline, but that's because it's so beautifully shot, well-acted, and scripted so that we know and care enough about the characters to worry once they belay down into the dark cave. This character knowledge carries weight throughout the movie, as the group variously splinters and works together to escape. Shocks and jolts start before the central scare appears. And props to an all-woman cast that feels totally natural and not slapped together to achieve cheap feminist self-congratulations. Well-acted and atmospheric, I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a solid, scary horror movie that doesn't reinvent the genre, but definitely strays from the norm."

","It's refreshing to go to a horror film that's not rated PG13 and get genuinely scared. I wasn't particularly keen on watching this film after seeing the trailer (which in my opinion makes this seem like a terrible B-grade movie), but I'm delighted to say that this is one of the better horror flicks in recent times.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with some nice aerial photography of the Appalachian mountain region, with winding roads flanked by dense forests (a la The Shining). The plot is fairly straight forward - an all-girl team of adventurers find themselves trapped in a cave system infested with strange looking blood-thirsty creatures. While this might seem to be rather derivative, the direction is excellent and captures the sheer terror and helplessness of being trapped in very claustrophobic surroundings. Minimal yet sufficient lighting from the torches of the members, ensures that the movie doesn't deteriorate into making the darkness as an excuse for bad CGI (speaking of which there is virtually none).<br/><br/>In fact, to its credit, The Descent is probably just as scary or even more so before the appearance of the creatures. I found myself flinching at the carnage and even rooting for the survival of the protagonists as the onslaught began. The dialog is kept to a minimum (you will not find any one-liners here) and the characters' actions are largely believable given the situations. The acting is uniformly good and does not detract from the atmosphere. The director has to be commended for making a great film with such a low budget and this is rightfully the successor to those classic Evil Dead films.<br/><br/>If you are a horror fan, this is a must-watch movie - it'll help you erase those painful memories of horrendous remakes or movies ruined by excessive use of CGI. Even for the normal viewer, The Descent offers enough to merit the cost of a movie ticket as long as you can stomach the violence that earns it an M-18 rating."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","40","66","13 May 2006"," A symbolic Descent into madness
","EDIT: There are no real ""spoilers"" in this review, but apparently someone reported me for it, so I hang my head in shame... and contempt.<br/><br/>British director Neil Marshall delivers a fantastic, chilling and symbolic horror movie that was critically acclaimed when it hit cinemas in the UK. The Descent (2005) can be seen as the reinvention of his 2002 werewolf horror movie Dog Soldiers. As opposed to the six male protagonists in that film, here Marshall lets us follow a group of six 20-something women. He has also changed setting to something that never ceases being frightening or unpleasant: a cave. In short, he has updated, amended and reinvented his last work and the outcome is something magnificent.<br/><br/>There's a tense and distinctly uncomfortable build-up in The Descent that culminates in something not-so-typical for a horror movie which throws us off-guard, namely a brutal car-crash that sets the tone for what is to come. The accident also destroys a family. In order to try to get past this tragedy, and overcome the death of her daughter, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) agrees to reunite with her girlfriends on a cave-diving adventure in the wilderness.<br/><br/>The climbing goes well until it turns out that the pragmatic ""tough-chick"" leader of the cave expedition, Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), has taken the girls to an unexplored cave system to satisfy her own adrenaline needs. The trouble is, the system caves in and the six girls become trapped with each other in a place that no one even knows about. Well, almost no one.<br/><br/>While the observant viewer can find foreshadowing devices in The Descent, it is never clear just what faces the girls down in the caves until we see it up-front and, when we do, it's a harsh slap in the face. The lurking threat is chilling to the point of setting an almost unbearably creepy atmosphere and eerie mood.<br/><br/>Conflicts inevitably arise between the girls as they're left to try to escape and we quickly anticipate a clash between the pragmatic June who brought them there in the first place and the fragile Sarah. What I love about this is that the characters do not fall prey to predictable petty arguments like in most horror films, but instead we see an unavoidable clash between the natures of the main characters that was just bubbling to come up. Their histories and personalities just wouldn't allowed them to get along. The other characters are compelling and easy to follow.<br/><br/>The Descent is not only about descending down caves and battling something ominous, although this part was of course extremely well-crafted and takes care of our primal fear. But it also refers to a descent into madness as the main character Sarah struggles to overcome tragedies in her life, but seems only to descend further into desperation as her situation worsens. The dire circumstances lead to some interesting and surprisingly advanced character development on her part, but also in the other girls.<br/><br/>I found the environment of The Descent to be completely flawless. I genuinely can't think of anything scarier or more effective for this movie. The gloomy, damp, maze-like caves play host to some truly frightening things, both physically and psychologically. To top it all off, rest assured that Marshall never shies away from giving us some good splatter-action.<br/><br/>Survive if you can."

The movie uses the human instinct of reacting to sudden changes in the environment to scare you. In other words, a sudden loud noise + quick change in on-screen action = you get scared. The mandatory monster-that-looks-dead-but-isn't-after-all and the usual bunch of expendable cast members (monster food in other words) also have their moment on screen. For experienced(?) adventurers, the girls sometimes show incredibly bad judgment (another horror movie cliché). This is the case for instance when one of the girls thinks she sees daylight and runs(!) towards the light just to fall down a deep shaft. Another instance is when a lead character jumps around a corner and shouts (apparently to scare the possible monster around the corner). This after she has herself figured out that the monsters seem to hunt by tracking sound.<br/><br/>Up until when the first monster is shown, this movie actually had a lot of promise I think. The triangle drama between the two main characters and the husband of one of them surely made for a good (although somewhat cliché) setup for conflicts to be solved deep underground. The gruesome car accident in the beginning also added some very good premises to the mix. I would have liked to see a movie that would deal with the psychological stress of being trapped underground and how this affects the group dynamics and the individuals. No monsters would have been needed, just something to trigger the imagination of the audience. The potential to create something scaring without ever showing a monster was there, which I think is well illustrated by the scene where one of the girls gets herself trapped in a transfer tunnel and starts panicking (the best scene in the movie imo).<br/><br/>Overall, as far as gore goes this movie delivers. I would not call it particularly scaring though, since after the monsters are shown it's more or less a slaughter fest, nothing more. Kudos for creating a believable claustrophobic cave environment (at least the first half of the film. In the second half, the fact that they're actually in a cave seems to be of less importance). Good sound design also. But in the end this is just another gore movie in the line of many."

","What a bunch of big girls blouses !! I can't believe how many of the reviewers thought this was a scary movie.<br/><br/>Having things jump out at you on the screen isn't scary - it's cheap. This movie did it with birds, bats, the cave dwellers and the girls themselves. AVP (not a good film) at least did it with a penguin - points for originality.<br/><br/>The cave dwellers were to be pitied not to be scared by. How can you be scared of something that's blind (enough torches in the face to prove that), deaf (you'd hear those screaming girls a mile away) and unable to feel (at one point one of them was leaning on a girls head and thought it was a rock!! Tears of laughter teeming down my face). <br/><br/>Also they could be killed by a quick twist of the neck.<br/><br/>These blind, deaf, senseless and fragile cave creatures were also supposed to be able to sneak out at night to kill moose and cattle. How did they do that then? How did they know it was night? How come nobody saw them? Why bother going back into the cave? <br/><br/>The only tense bit of this film was where one girl got wedged into a small tunnel, but what was funny was that all her mates had just squeezed through it ! Was her backside so much bigger?<br/><br/>The ending? Pure cop out."

","The descent is a disappointing horror gore-fest that is heavy on blood and light on scares and tension. The scenario is preposterous and the creature effects are beyond crap. The characters and the performances are weak. The film is not scary and the characters are unsympathetic, which is ultimately why the film is ineffective. The creatures are pathetic and look like poor versions Smeagol/gollum. The film gets worse as it goes along. The creatures really sink this film to junk levels. The attack/fight sequences look like crap and the camera work is quite inept at time. The lighting is probably the most effective element of the film. The Descent will no doubt benefit from the lowered expectations set by todays extremely low grade, assembly-line sanitized and saturated horror genre. The Descent is by no means a classic or even a good horror movie, but it is better than most of the schlock horror films we see today.Preposterous Scenario, Horrible Creatures, No Scares, Little Tension, and Weak Characters. 4/10 Avoid it unless you are a rabid horror movie fan."

"EVOL666","9","27","45","2 January 2006"," Highly Enjoyable British Horror Entry
","From the Director of DOG SOLDIERS comes a very well made ""mainstream"" horror film. I have, for the most part, given up on current theatrical horror films (with a few notable exceptions...) but THE DESCENT gives me hope that horror audiences are still interested in seeing some good ol' ""blood n' guts"" with their horror films, and that these films can still be intelligent and well-done. Although this film has not yet been released theatrically in the U.S., I hear it's coming (although I'm sure it will be chopped to death...) and this is one that I would recommend to any real horror fan.<br/><br/>Sarah and her friends are extreme sports enthusiasts who enjoy activities like rafting and caving. When Sarah's husband is the victim of a brutal accident and killed (in a scene that ""jump-starts"" the film right in the first few minutes...), she has a hard time coping with the loss. Cut to 1 year later and Sarah's friends determine that it's time to help get Sarah back on her feet and into some of her old activities. They plan an ""all-girls"" trip to explore a cave system in the Appalachian mountains. Little do any of the other girls know, that Juno, the organizer of the expedition, has planned a trip into a previously uncharted cave system in the hopes of claiming a little fame and recognition. This obviously isn't such a smart idea for a group of novice spelunkers, and things start to go downhill pretty quickly. Along with such setbacks as injuries, cave-ins, and the mental stress that the girls undergo when they realize that they may be in a life-or-death struggle just to get out of the caves - we then become aware that the group of explorers are not the only ones currently inhabiting the caves - and this is where the film REALLY takes off...<br/><br/>THE DESCENT is nearly perfect in almost every way. The tension and claustrophobia of being trapped in an unknown cave system is palpable. The gore comes pretty hot and heavy in the second half of the film, and the ending of the film is appropriately surprising and bleak, without being corny. Another big plus in my book is that the ""creature"" FX aren't over-the-top and don't rely on much, if any CGI. When I first heard that THE DESCENT was a ""creature"" film, I was kinda worried because I feel that those types of films have gone severely down-hill with the advent of the over-use of CGI...but THE DESCENT doesn't fall into that category. Some of the acting isn't the greatest but it doesn't really detract from the film overall, and some seem to think that the first half of the film is slow. Personally, I think that the early sequences in the caves are a great ""tension-builder"" as things go from bad-to-worse, and right when you think it can't go any lower, the audience is clued in to the existence of the other ""inhabitants"" of the caves and and all hell breaks loose. THE DESCENT is an excellent film that shouldn't be ignored. Highly recommended - 9/10"

","Horrible movie - the hardest fact is to decide whether the fact that the movie is so dark that you almost can't see whats happening is good or bad... Sarahs family dies in a tragic car accident, not that it matters at all but it gives an excuse for her and her friends Juno, Holly, Sam, Rebecca and Beth to meet a year after and explore some caves, and everything possible and impossible goes wrong. Of course some rock collapses and block their way out, but luckily they can check their map - oh no their leader didn't bring it cause there were no reason to. But at least they will be searched for by the rescue team when they don't return - oh no, the girl who reported their mission reported another cave system, this cave system has never been explored before. Luckily they got their equipment and lots of rope to find another way out - oh no the bag with rope was buried under the rock collapsing. They end up being attacked by a horde of wannabe Smeagol zombies on their way to find a way out. This movie is a WASTE OF TIME and doesn't even deserve one star!"
"Cutkold","3","36","63","6 August 2006"," B movie with better effects?
","wow up until now this movie has actually accumulated a score of 7.5 on average... I have to stop and ask myself how? The two lead actresses both seem to wholly overdo their parts, especially in facial expression which to many people I suppose wouldn't mean much, but to an avid viewer of Horror films such as myself, facial expression is often key to conveying the terror to the audience. Aside from this the acting was alright, nothing really notable, with as usual the best character being offed first (Holly). This all is very trivial in the scope of things. The real thing that makes this film awful is... the plot. First and foremost the creatures which suddenly decide to up and kill all of the hikers have zero background. None. We never even learn what they are by the end of the film. I was a little offended by this because I felt like this completely dumbed down the plot to the level of every B movie. There are people, along comes a monster and kills them all with no motive. Thats it. And to add to that the monsters even look like they're straight out of a B movie (either that or they were rejects for Gollum in Lord of the Rings). Now unless you plan on seeing this movie with someone who is very (and I mean very) easily scarred I would recommend skipping this movie and seeing the real deal movie by this director; Saw."

","I don't personally know the authors of this movie, but they couldn't be my friends, not anymore, not from tonight on, since I've seen this horrifically bad horror. No friends, because I just feel they wanted to tease the spectator, take the mickey out of them.<br/><br/>Simply not fair. Yes, of course he who goes see an horror film wishes to be scared; sure as hell he wants. But politely. Intelligently. You simply cannot ground all the horror in scenes with sudden screams and thunders, sudden visions, sudden whatever. I can as well come to you and shout in your ear and probably scare you, if you aren't thinking of me.<br/><br/>And this film doesn't just (try to) scare in a stupid way; it's also stupid, too. In the plot, in the characters, in the occasions created to introduce the events. I can understand that some movies just need a very basic plot to introduce amazing and entertaining SFX scenes... but besides some little pale scary monsters, there really was nothing amazingly beautiful to see or follow.<br/><br/>""It's beautiful"", says one of the cave divers as soon as she reaches the bottom. Perhaps the scene was really beautiful (an hidden cave with a rich vegetation), but not even once the director chose to show us some of that beauty.<br/><br/>Deprived of any beauty, this movie, very bad, is just and plain an ugly movie, which surely shocks you, but not more than a long series of loud bangs and explosions you could hear in your room."

","Feeling tired after work on a Friday I thought I'd give this a go on digital purchase instead of joining the others down the pub. I wish I was down the pub with the others.<br/><br/>In fact by about the 20th minute, after witnessing the OTT close-up 'action' ice-pick holstering, and pointlessly clinking the climbing hardware assertively (imagery: must be 'hard as nails') for the 10th time I wearily began to make dinner.<br/><br/>A further 40 minutes or so passed before anything really event-worthy took place. (Although there were several more assertive clinking moments and some derring-do which I didn't really understand as I'm ignorant on cave dropping). But do English women out-machismo each other and shout 'Hey guys!' to friends of same sex in real life? Possibly, but none that I have met in 30+ years living in England. Perhaps it's just extreme sports types. Or not southern types.<br/><br/>Besides woeful engagement with the characters... The opening section (5-7 mins) is actually pretty good and I hoped this may serve yo introduce a few twists later on in the film. But no. When they finally get in the cave it is one of those horrors where you could press pause, script the next 'scare', un-pause and sit smugly back whilst your script is dutifully acted out. Bats; horror-turn to see.. friend suddenly appear; Gollum/Nosferatu things that fail to scare before, but certainly after, they are killed at a much greater rate than the heroines. Wusses who can't see? why not just keep chucking rocks wherever you're not.<br/><br/>If you are thinking: The Descent or The Pub?, descend down the boozer. It will be more scary."

","Style isn't everything, but this film offers nothing else. Considering how laborious the set-up is, it's a miracle that an ounce of character development couldn't work its way into this flashy mess.<br/><br/>Somebody seemed to think that a handful of taut female bodies with a slathering of attitude would be empathetic enough to involve the viewer, but the characters in this film are so blank and uninteresting that neither I nor the group of folks I watched this with could have cared less what happened to any of them.<br/><br/>There have been worse ""horror"" films made. But I can't remember one that was more boring and pointless than this.<br/><br/>The cinematography is totally wrong. Why anyone would choose warm yellow and red scrims to color a descent into the cold chilly bowels of the earth is unfathomable. When the ghoulish action finally starts, the color scheme switches to green, but for some ungodly reason the brains behind this fiasco chose a nice vibrant organic green rather than a pasty fluorescent sickly green which might have added a hint of unsavoriness to the cookie cutter proceedings.<br/><br/>It's interesting that many English viewers rate this director's crappy movies so highly. With all the great English directors out there, you'd think they wouldn't be so hard up for glory.<br/><br/>If you choose to watch this sorry chunk of offal, dose up with plenty of coffee or Irish breakfast tea before hand. Otherwise be prepared to nod off twenty minutes in.<br/><br/>Mercifully, the story is utterly forgettable."
"helenvcs","5","29","50","11 June 2006"," Irritating
","My sister and I had some time on our hands so we thought we'd watch a scary movie... Whilst The Descent did fit the bill, it left us feeling strangely unsatisfied. For starters you want to box the ears of everyone of the girls for being so seemingly unprepared as they trot off for a day's caving. Secondly, their behaviour throughout the movie (especially in the earlier parts when you might expect some kind of rationality) seems illogical. Thirdly the ending is just so ...nnngh! Even a couple of months after seeing it my sister and I mention it now and again in a ""but why....?"" kind of way. Mind you, perhaps that could be seen as a positive, since we're still talking about it, however it doesn't feel like that, more just irritating! (very slight *SPOILER* : SHOCK!

"grahmike","1","58","110","6 August 2006"," Garbage
","I just got done seeing this and i'm not gonna beat around the bush. This movie had almost no plot. The writers tried to create some sort of back story with 2 or 3 vague references to an ""accident"" that involved the characters, but the accident is never explained and actually plays no role in the movie. I feel like i was robbed of the 6 bucks i paid to see this garbage, it was by far the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters. Other then the cheap pop out scares the only thing this movie has going for it is a slight tension because of the claustrophobic cave atmosphere. Not surprisingly the ending is even less fufilling then the rest of this trash.<br/><br/>Bottom line: No plot + cheap scares = The descent"

"bob the moo","Null","13","20","12 December 2007"," Tense, nihilistic, grim and engaging horror with strong delivery from director, cast and cinematographer (SPOILERS)
","Sarah and her friends Beth and Juno have always enjoyed adventure holidays together, despite Sarah now having a family and a more settled life. A road accident after a white water rafting holiday sees Sarah's family snatched away from her and leaves her in a hospital. A year later Sarah and Beth travel to the US to meet up with Juno and her friends for some caving. Unbeknownst to them, Juno takes them to a series of caves off the beaten track. A rock slide sees the group cut off from their entry point and forced to go deeper into the system to try and find a way out.<br/><br/>I have said it many times that I am not a big fan of gore and, that if you get the tone and atmosphere right, I do frighten quite easily. The Descent got good reviews in the UK (perhaps this is to be expected) but I decided to ignore it at the cinema and then again on video. When it was on the selection on a plane journey I decided against it, even though my girlfriend went for it; she spent the majority of the film tensed up and I felt I had made the right decision. When it came on television recently though I decided that enough was enough and went for it (well, I taped it  I mean it was on late at night for goodness sake). Having finally watched it I am glad I did as it is a really strong thriller that delivers atmosphere and tension in spades.<br/><br/>Some have said that it is very grim stuff but to me that is part of the appeal. Long-time IMDb reviewer Theo Robertson comments that the lack of charm, humour or warmth is a problem but I have to disagree. On the contrary the nihilistic tone increases the tensions within the narrative and draws the audience into it further  there are no witty one-liners, there are no comedy-relief characters, nothing to allow the audience a space that is safe to breathe. Theo is bang on the money though when he says that those that loved Dog Soldiers will probably prefer it to this (and vice versa) because it does include ""fun"" and comedy  making it more of a multiplex horror movie, one that is enjoyable even though it delivers jumps. He is right because I loved The Descent where I only thought Dog Soldiers was OK.<br/><br/>When this was released, Neil Marshall appeared unlucky to have made this at the same time as America's The Cave, but in reality his film stands up on its own. Although he needs to light his scenes and not just rely on torches, he embraces the darkness of the caves with relish. The first hour is tense, even though the crawlers do not show up until late into it. This is because Marshall is working on character issues in the background but mostly because he is introducing us to this world of darkness, falls and tunnels. We are already there once the real danger comes and because he has got this tension already working, it doesn't matter whether or not we see the creatures or not  it is the fear of the darkness and the unknown that does it (two very base fears that he plays on expertly). The creatures are really well done as well, the noise and the speed of movement making them scary more than what they do (which is more about the gore). The grim air continues unto the ending, which I consider to be perfectly in keeping with what has gone before. I refer of course to the ending of the ""proper"" version and not the ""upbeat"" one forced upon some audiences where we close with Sarah having made it out but confronted with a vision(?) of a bloody Juno in the car with her. Instead the proper version sees Sarah mentally collapsed, everyone dead and the sounds all around surely meaning it is a matter of ""when"" and not ""if"" in regards Sarah going the same way. It is not cheerful of course but if a suitably grim ending and much better than ending it on the car scene.<br/><br/>The cast are at times difficult to tell apart and some of them are just random people. Buring has a distinctive character but I did struggle to tell Reid, Mulder and No one apart from the others in the dark. At the head of the cast though are two great performances from Macdonald and Mendoza that are full of fear, fire and hurt. The car accident and the implied infidelity is not pushed to the fore but it is kept around and used to enrich some of the interactions. Macdonald loses it convincingly while Mendoza is a strong counter to her emotion (as well as being stunning). I was engaged by the way the film didn't give us a ""bad guy"" in the group and indeed I felt sympathy and dislike for both characters. Of course the main thing the cast have to do is convince within the world of the film and they do this effectively throughout, whether it is a simple rock fall or being hunted for food. Aside from them the majority of the credit belongs to Marshall and cinematographer McCurdy (and you can understand why the latter was sought out for Hills Have Eyes 2) as they deliver a tense atmosphere that really draws the audience in so that you do share the characters fear and urgency.<br/><br/>Overall a grim but superior horror film that benefits from the dark style and content. The gore is there if you want it but for me it is the constant sense of fear and nothingness that engaged me, from the first entry into the caves right through to the nihilistic (proper) ending."

A regular pitch line, an excuse to do something dangerous or go someplace where you can't ask for help, in this case both. Blocking the path behind you, forcing you to go down a path, having to face the fears, in this movie choosing to not tell anyone where you were going, going into a cave no one else had gone previously, and then the cave-in.

","I really enjoyed Neil Marshall's DOG SOLDIERS and knew right away that here was a genre director to keep an eye on . For some strange reason it wasn't until tonight that I got round to seeing THE DESCENT and felt disappointed with it . If you're after a film that delivers buckets of gore and has you jumping out of your seat then you will not be disappointed . If however you're after a film that has the same sort of charm as DOG SOLDIERS then you'll be as disappointed as I was <br/><br/>That's the problem with THE DESCENT because it lacks any sort of charm , humour or warmth and unfortunately if you liked one of Neil's films you'll probably dislike the other . The one problem I had with DOG SOLDIERS is that it took a long time to get into its stride and it's possibly the only thing it shares with this film , though to be honest it's worse in that respect because we have to wait almost a whole hour before the monsters turn up and until then we have to endure a girls get together in the remote American wilderness . Compare this narrative structure to something like 28 DAYS LATER which instantly draws the audience into the story , or even better 28 WEEKS LATER which has an absolutely awesome opening ten minutes <br/><br/>Right away you can see the difference between the two movies . In one we have good natured British squaddies complete with a blokey attitude while in the other we have a cosmopolitan bunch of unsympathetic women who I found very annoying , so much so that I found myself cheering for the monsters . Not a very charitable attitude I know but compare this with the characterization of Sgt Wells , Coop and Spoon from the earlier movie where you couldn't not like the characters . Likewise throughout THE DESCENT there's a totally grim , bleak and nihilistic atmosph ere that is reflected in thestoryline and you won't feel like smiling after watching this . You can make the argument that Neil Marshall has made two horror films that are poles apart and you'd be right , but shouldn't a horror film be fun ? Isn't this the reason why DOG SOLDIERS was so enjoyable ? <br/><br/>Despite my criticism THE DESCENT was met with critical and commercial success and put Neil Marshall on the map in America . Seeing as we have a horror director who can make very different genre films I can't help thinking that if the rumoured 28 MONTHS LATER makes it into production then Neil Marshall would be a strong contender for director . One common criticism of the first two films in the franchise is that the second halves have a problem sustaining the momentum which is not a problem I've seen with this director's previous work and a grim , downbeat ending would be more in keeping with the 28 franchise than with this type of horror movie"

","This film reminded me on a view concepts which were used earlier.. When I began watching I thought about ""Open Water"", so I prepared myself for a lot of grief and a very nasty feeling throughout the film. As I somewhat expected, the first 45 minutes gave me this feeling.. This feeling was completely reversed in the second half, in which the gore and scares multiply by a factor 10 in a ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" kind of way..<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. Six girls in their twenties go on a vacation, one year after a tragic accident occurred involving one of them. As a way to move on with their lives, they decide to go on a vacation in which they go cave diving. Panic breaks out when the expected happens, they find out they're in the wrong cave! This first part of the film has an extremely claustrophobic atmosphere which contributes immensely to the suspense..<br/><br/>The second part takes the story to a straightforward horror-level, in which the girls find out that they are not alone.. The cave holds a danger far beyond their imagination and is out to get them.. Although this is quite standard horror stuff, the scares are very effective.. One of the great aspects to generate some of the best scares, is that one of the girls only has a infrared camera to see what's happening.. As the cave is pitch black and the girls get separated from each other, the suspense and gore come together in a nice even way..<br/><br/>There are off course some aspects which I don't like about this movie. The thing that bothered me most is that the girls are presented as being very good close friends. The decisions being made by them are in my opinion very strange.. If you would imagine yourself in their situation with some of your best friends, who could do the things they do? I couldn't, and that is what makes this movie a bit unbelievable..<br/><br/>All this said, my main point here is that this movie should be watched with an open mind, like most horror films.. It's easy to criticize on almost all movies out there and though I do not consider this a classic, it has a higher level than most horror films produced lately.. Very watchable and very enjoyable, this film gets my vote! 7,5/10"

In fact there was no need to show as much of the monsters as was shown, it would have created a much stronger effect if they had kept this to a minimum. The opening scene in the movie where the girl that lost her husband was running away from the darkness is how this should have been done."

","What's remarkable about this low-budget British horror film is just how much tension and, frankly, sheer terror it's able to eke out of the central situation before we're even given but a glimpse of the carnivorous creatures that dwell in the dark. There's a claustrophobic, and almost panic-inducing, sense of isolation and entrapment that expertly escalates from the central cave-in in 'The Descent (2005)'. It's also thanks to the subtle yet consistent character development that we care for each and every person trapped in the caverns below and are on the edge-of-our-seats as their lives are almost constantly threatened. What's also refreshing, and somewhat exciting, is that most of the brutality comes not from the so-called crawlers - whose very existence centres around catching, killing and eating their prey - but rather from the group of women fighting their way through the caves as their battle for survival forces them to lose their innocence almost as quickly as they might lose their sanity. This brutality also makes each encounter unpredictable, with the violence always having tangible consequences. The scares are well crafted and mature too, meaning the whole picture comes together to form a cohesive and taut thrill-ride that relishes its unique horrors and never relents. 8/10"

","I love horror films and lower expectations accordingly but this appalling piece of lazy plagiarism stinks any way you look at it. Trite scripts, zero characterisation and amateur hour acting have always been a staple of the genre but an original way with the material can lift up even the lowest budget horror and that's precisely what's missing here. Every single scene and ""shock"" is lifted wholesale from other movies and remade very, very badly. Most damning of all though the whole ""directorial style"" is filched so completely from John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" that when they even start playing the main theme from that classic you'll wonder why the lawsuits didn't swiftly fly across the Atlantic. What really riles though is this ""give it a break it's British"" attitude our film critics have been displaying since about 1980. The British film industry is a corpse more putrid and frightening than anything you'll see in this movie. I don't know where directors rise up from now but after watching the soulless artifice of the Descent I'm guessing advertising. If Alfred Hitchcock were alive today he'd just be a fat man working on his Father's fruit and veg stall."
"Duzniak38","10","27","50","4 August 2006"," Claustrophobic Horror
","The Descent is a tense horror movie which will eat at you and play on your mind long after viewing. The Descent is one of the best horror movies to come around for a very long time. The plot follows six friends who reunite for a caving expedition after a tragic accident which effects the main character - Sarah's life, forever. This trip is in order to get back out into the real world and experience fun again and to help put Sarah's mind at ease. Their adventure soon goes terribly wrong when a collapsing of rocks traps them deep in the dark, claustrophobic underground caves, and they find themselves being chased by bloodthirsty Crawlers - deformed creatures who have inhabited these caves for hundreds of years. Character development doesn't go overly deep -- but it doesn't really need to. The headstrong girls all get along fine, but there are obvious alliances and unspoken grudges hanging in the air. It is a realistic group of people you can truly imagine in reality. Juno has organised this adventure, a climb down into a famed cave system. She is the leader of the group; assertive and intelligent. Her new friend Holly is a hardcore thrill junkie and looks like she could be trouble, while mild-mannered, supportive Beth, Rebecca who is soon to become a doctor and Sam fall more in line in terms of group dynamic. As the movie begins, and they start their climb through these narrow, dark, nerving tunnels the tension already begins to rise. You can almost feel the emotion, the fear and excitement these girls are feeling. You can almost smell the dank, earthy smell of these ancient tunnel-ways. The way the film sucks you into the situation; makes you sweat, gives you goosebumps, makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end - this is genuinely effective scares. The movie doesn't require the false scares and loud jumps that are overplayed nowadays; it just grabs you by the scruff of you neck, and throws you deep into the exhilarating experience of enclosed spaces, with this group of intelligent, skilled, athletic women, who continue on down these tunnels... until Juno makes a horrifying confession which dreads you with fear. This isn't the cave that she pointed out to them in the guidebook. It is in fact uncharted, and she has no clue if there is another exit from where they are at this point. Right about now you feel so nervous. The lump in your throat is growing bigger and your palms become sweaty. The terrifying idea that this situation rings true to what could very easily happen in real life is a horrifying idea. And the thought of being lost and with no sense of control or direction, thousands of feet underground where nobody can help makes the tension rise higher and higher. The group's bond is stretched by this horrible news. They, naturally, freak out and start to argue and point the blame finger. As these women then continue on with their journey deeper and deeper into the darkness, physical stress and strain begins to become apparent. They are sweaty and hot and wet and dirty. They have very little equipment and soon lose their rope. As they continue further and further into the heart of the underground, there is also that burning question swimming around them. Are they going to be able to find a way out, or are they just going further and further into the wrong direction? Paranoia, desperation, claustrophobia and pressure begins to make the girls crack. They begin to hear noise and echoes and crawling sounds. Could it be that they are not alone? Could there be other people down here who could help them? Apparently not, we learn, as we are introduced to Crawlers - bloodthirsty hunters - in a revealing way which will make you jump out of your skin and make it crawl. This introduction to the villain is one of the most heart-pounding ones I have ever seen! It really gets your adrenalin pumping! During the initial attack on the group, an attack is made on one of the girls and the group is split up. Now things really begin to get moving along at a jaw-dropping pace. These horribly deformed creature inhabit these caves and prey on humans. However they are blind, so they track down their prey with their astounding hearing skills. Once the group is split up in a wave of panic and frenzy, things really start to get juicy. Pits of bones, pools of blood, chambers filled with stalagmites and stalactites (which are cleverly filmed to show how dangerous and deadly they can be; like razor sharp poles. They almost seem to make you think how even the caves are against the group of girls, because of how extremely dangerous and unsafe they can be. Even the caves and tunnels are on the Crawlers side) and dark tunnels which go on forever are what the girls encounter, as they continue to delve deeper, in both fear and hope for survival and escape. As the film pushes itself to the extreme without stopping to take a breath, emotional secrets are revealed, fatal accidents are made, and a final act of vengeance leaves you sitting there with you jaw in your lap, your spine tingling and your head swimming with emotions on these events. The Descent is a fantastic race against time. Not only does it pile on the gory goods the tense unnerving chills, but it also breaks into tougher topics; betrayal, revenge, decisions, responsibility and fear for survival. Neil Marshal delivers a fantastic, brutal horror movie which doesn't play out the typical clichés and stereotypes. It is as real a story with an array of true, honest, believable characters and real questions, thoughts and touches on real emotion. The Descent it a definite must see, and one of the finest horror films to come around for years and years."
"Vomitron_G","9","23","42","31 January 2006"," Descent into madness
","When I read the synopsis for THE DESCENT, I thought to myself ""This is just like THE CAVE, only with chicks (er, excuse me, an all-female cast)"". Now, the concept of a bunch of hot-looking young women who are into extreme sports does sound appealing, but the real reason why I wanted to watch this movie was because I very much enjoyed director Neil Marshall's previous film DOG SOLDIERS. And let me say right away: Though I kinda liked THE CAVE, THE DESCENT is a far better movie. It has more suspense and is more realistic, to name only two things.<br/><br/>The plot maybe isn't extremely original but it is executed perfectly and the over-all structure is flawless. The opening-scene is very powerful and will make you go ""Holy Sh!t?!?!"". It grabs your attention. Once inside the cave Marshall starts building up tension, very slowly (and I do mean slowly). After about 50 minutes the action kicks in, and it's a real thrill-ride. All leading up to a clever and satisfying ending. Between all this madness there's even a nice twist in the plot concerning one of the character's background. In short: This movie grabs you, pulls you in and doesn't let go until the end-credits roll.<br/><br/>The middle-part of the movie feels more like a survival-movie (and that's a trick Marshall also uses in DOG SOLDIERS, blending genres), because everything you'd expect to go wrong while exploring a cave does indeed go wrong: Getting stuck & claustrophobia kicking in, a cave collapsing, crossing a ravine, breaking a leg (in a bloody-open-fracture kinda way),... And just when our six girls start to think that things couldn't possible get any worse, they find out the hard way that much bigger problems are lurking in the dark...<br/><br/>There's a lot of blood & gore in this movie, especially in the second half. The make-up effects are rather excellent and the Crawlers, with their scary noises, look real creepy. Only complaint is that they still looked a little too human (their bodies, that is, not their actions). Some scenes are digitally enhanced, but you barely notice it. The sets all look real and the lighting is cleverly used. For instance, when the group gets divided, Marshall uses different lighting (like green flares, red torches,...) to indicate which person you're looking at in order to avoid any confusion. Never at any moment does the lighting feel artificial, so it works. Even some of the jump-scenes actually work. The musical score's almost perfect, never too dominant but adding to the atmosphere and raising the movie to a higher level.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall clearly knows how to make good horror-movies and I strongly believe this director's going places. This is one of the best British horror-movies I've seen in a long time and one that proves once again that you don't need a big budget to make a good movie. So if you like violent horror, then go see this flick. And remember: Darkness won't kill you; what's in it will!"

","To say the least, I did not feel to strongly about The Descent as far as horror movies go. First of all, it ended with too many loose ends that left the audience hanging. The movie was basically a one hour something bloodbath. In short, there was no steady plot line and the scares, i feel, were amateur. <br/><br/>In the beginning, the main character looses her husband and child in an eerie car crash. Because of this, she suffers from reocurring dreams which haunt her. These events turn out to have no significance at all in the end. <br/><br/>Later, the character named Juno, one of the friends that goes into the caves, seems like a shady character, but nothing is explained about her motives either. <br/><br/>The cheap scares in the movie were only generated through human-like monsters in the cave that resembled demented Gollum look-a-likes. In the resolution, if you can call it that, the origins of these monsters in failed to be communicated also. By the time i left the theater, I was confused and disappointed in myself for watching another ""horror"" flick that failed to deliver the goods.<br/><br/>On a brighter note though, I have to say I thought the idea was original and it could have been developed into a great thriller. The camera work was great too, but the story just ruined it all for me."
"katparker-86462","8","8","12","12 September 2018"," One of the greatest horror films of all time-incredibly effective.
","The Descent is as close to a masterpiece as they come, and in my humble opinion it certainly qualifies among the top ten finest horror film of the past twenty years or so. It is claustrophobic, visceral- there are bone splitting, blood oozing and vomit inducing scenes, certainly not for the fainthearted. But apart from all this the Descent contains something that every horror film should utilize- a good screenplay and characters one can relate to/side with. This is a tight film(literally and figuratively) and the characters are well drawn out. The acting is top notch and the fact that Neil Marshall went for quality but unknown faces works in the favor of the film. 8/10 (One of the greatest horror films of all time-incredibly effective)."
"Mr_Censored","10","8","12","9 September 2009"," ""The Descent"" reaches new heights of horror.
","Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) could use some cheering up. Just one year ago, she lost her husband and her only daughter to a bad car accident. In an effort to cheer her up, five of her best friends take her on a vacation into the Appalachian Mountains for some routine spelunking. Things go horribly wrong, however, when they find themselves trapped and without a map inside one of the caves. Unfortunately for them, this cave has yet to be thoroughly explored and an unknown threat lurks in the darkness, ready to attack and threaten their solidarity and sanity.<br/><br/>Writer/director Neil Marshall spends ample time building up the characters to the point where they feel real, but also wastes no time in getting to the point. It isn't long before our characters are submersed into the abyss from which they spend 90 minutes of the film trying to escape. A claustrophobic's nightmare come true, the film makes sure you're in the cave with the characters as they fight for their lives with a careful balance of character development and spooky atmosphere, achieved by its stunning cinematography and authentic location. By the time you get to the gore and the creature effects, the movie has already done its job and the rest is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>In fact, that's pretty much what sets ""The Descent"" apart from most modern horror stories. Rather than relying on outlandish death scenes and over-the-top gore, it's slightly restrained in its old-school approach that values tension over eye-candy. To be blunt, the death scenes are probably the last thing you'll remember from this film. What you'll likely take away from it is an unmistakable and unforgiving tone, a healthy portion of unforgettable imagery (see: climbing up a hill of human skulls) and an ending that will stay with you for days. It's a well-rounded, well-written and effectively directed film that warrants repeat viewings to absorb it all. With this film, Neil Marshall has certainly earned himself a spot in the echelon of iconic horror movie directors, and is truly a visionary to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>A sequel is currently on the horizon, although what would possess Sarah to enter that cave again remains to be seen, especially if you are to go by the original ending -- found in the ""Original Unrated Cut"" (the true version of the film) -- which leaves nowhere for a sequel to go. By itself, though, it stands alone as a modern classic for a reason and a film that will effectively creep out and thrill audiences for many decades to come. When this decade is looked back upon in future years, ""The Descent"" will no doubt sit at the top of the pile of films that helped define horror movie cinema in the new millennium."
"rmwhittaker101","1","38","76","24 May 2006"," Not scary, not gory and, worst of all, not well acted or written.
","Neil Marshall's feature debut as writer and director, the generally excellent Dog Soldiers, was burdened with one flaw. In a movie about men, with some fantastic 'bloke' dialogue, Marshall proved himself to have a tin ear for female dialogue. The talented Emma Cleasby was burdened down with some awful lines that sounded like rejects from Rachel Weitz' part in The Mummy. They might have worked in that campy environment - in the grimmer Dog Soldiers, they were just clumsy.<br/><br/>The Descent is that, multiplied by six female leads, none of them as talented as Cleasby.<br/><br/>Marshall's sophomore outing is just that - juvenile, priapic and gormless. Sticking half a dozen women down a cave (try to work out which country it's set in and what nationality the disposable 'heroines' are supposed to come from - I dare you) he leaves them to get consumed by albino cave dwellers. Dependent upon lapses in narrative logic that will annoy the halfway competent film watcher and indulging in failures in basic caving protocol that make it completely implausible that the cast could find their way out of a land rover, it's more Elle than Fangoria. Everything is set up for these smug Prada-by-way-of-DMM yuppettes to get slaughtered, and then they descend into asinine bickering. You'll be praying for their deaths... and possibly your own, if it brings this fearsome drivel in to land quicker.<br/><br/>It is ironic that several noted movie gossip sites that constantly criticize M. Night Shyamalan for the use of twist endings are lauding The Descent, when it has possibly the worst and clumsiest 'shock' reveal of the last decade. This is a new low in cinema because it shows that the once-critical audiences have now accepted pablum as worthwhile. Once upon a time, the benchmark trapped-in-the-wilderness movies were films like 2,000 Maniacs, The Hills Have Eyes, Cannibal Ferox and Deliverance. If this is getting good word, we need to reconsider the medium."
"emma-davies123","4","10","16","14 January 2014"," Don't understand the high vote
","The premise of this film is pretty cool, a bunch of backpackers trek down the wrong sort of cave and end up in all sorts of trouble. It's hard and first to tell if it will be a regular thriller or if it has a supernatural theme behind it, and the little sub-plot at the beginning (Sarah's story) adds a depth that keeps you watching. <br/><br/>However this has to be one of the slowest moving films I have ever watched. It's predominantly filmed in the dark with only torch-light or flares to guide the girls through (realistic but irritating), which ultimately kills the action somewhat when you're left thinking 'did I see that right?' <br/><br/>The characters in the film are undeveloped and there is no real sense of caring for any of them, and when it all goes wrong they are quick to blame someone else for the fact none of them prepared for what might happen. Juno is the woman who led them to a cave local authorities deemed unsafe deliberately on an ego kick. She is an infuriating character, demanding the others follow her lead when she is the one who got them into the mess in the first place. <br/><br/>It's at least an hour before the film gets going, with a couple of false starts that are not impressive. There is an element of suspense, but it is very weak and is strung out for so long I ended up thinking 'Someone just die already'. <br/><br/>All in all, a good Sunday afternoon film, but not worth 7/10 - a 4/10 at most."
"soulmining","10","31","61","8 July 2005"," The best British horror movie in years!
","The opening scene of The Descent shows three girlfriends happily enjoying the thrill of some white-water rafting, establishing right from the off that these women like their adventure and extreme sports. One year on and things have changed between these friends; Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) has suffered a breakdown after a family bereavement (in a shocking pre-credits sequence that will make your jaw hit the floor) and whilst best friend Beth (Alex Reid) has remained by her side, her other friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza) has fled to America. In an aim to rekindle their friendship Juno organises a caving expedition for the girls, and also invites Swedish sisters Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Buring) and her young headstrong protégé, Holly (Nora Jane No one). What the group doesn't know is that Juno is taking them to an unchartered series of caves... and naturally with this being a horror film, things don't quite go to plan. First of all Sarah gets trapped and they lose a bag of equipment, then the tunnel collapses behind them forcing the group to find an alternative exit, and then one of the girls suffers a nasty fall, displayed in all its bloody, bone-protruding glory. And then the horror really begins...<br/><br/>To say any more would spoil the surprise, for The Descent is one of those movies where the less you know about the plot, the more you'll enjoy it - if being terrified is your thing. Let's be honest here, this is the best British horror films in years, it really is that good. From the moment the girls enter the caves you're enveloped in a feeling of dread, and the sense of claustrophobia is almost unbearable as they begin to crawl through the narrow tunnels. The dark confined environment succeeds in unsettling the audience so much that when the action finally kicks in it almost comes as a relief. Some relief; this is a brutal exercise in sustained tension and horror with copious amounts of bone-crunching violence and gore. Even a seasoned genre fan like me has to admit that I was sat biting my knuckles at times and I must have jumped on at least three or four occasions during the course of the film - always a good sign that a horror movie is doing its job properly.<br/><br/>It's a simple premise and it works so effectively due to director Marshall's flawless execution. The pacing, editing and sound design are all faultless and the brooding soundtrack echoes the work of John Carpenter, and The Thing in particular. The lighting is also consistently atmospheric, relying mainly on torches, flares and at times, the infra-red viewfinder of a video camera. After his debut with Dog Soldiers and its cast of all male soldiers, he subverts the genre by casting all women this time and the fact that there's no big stars ensures that you're never sure who's going to make it out alive. All six of the principal cast do a great job in what must have been a very demanding shoot, and each of them are given enough screen time to establish their characters and make us care about what happens to them. The dynamic between the original trio of Sarah, Beth and Juno is at the movie's core and Mendoza deserves much credit in her portrayal of the bitch who leads them into trouble, yet for all her faults is clearly the strongest of the group. There's so much more I'd like to say about this film, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't yet had the pleasure. This is one descent into madness that you won't want to miss and it firmly establishes director Neil Marshall as a real talent within the industry. One thing is absolutely certain - after watching this film I am never ever going caving!"

Frankly, it had the audience I was viewing it with screaming on a number of occasions!

This movie's plot was extremely horrible, the actresses were dreadful, and the scenes were weak. The movie did have promise with a good idea of being trapped in an unexplored cave, but once again, Hollywood sell outs by slapping in some supernatural nothingness. The movie was sloppy, it substituted ingenuity for squirty blood that looked all too fake. This adds to the list of the many movies that are ruining the genre: The Ring 2, House of Wax, Cabin Fever, and Hostel. <br/><br/>This movie is not even worth watching even if someone else rents it, it was that bad."

","Well, where do I start. I consider this almost an insult to the horror genre. I mean, what was scary about this movie? Nothing. What was thrilling about this movie? Nothing. I mean, the movie begins with a woman losing her husband and child due to a car wreck involving thick metal poles. She probably should have killed herself at that moment, saving us this terrible plot development. I am pretty sure I would rather watch Gone With the Wind Backwards then watch this.<br/><br/>Now, I am sure you just think that I want to sit around and bash this because I thought it was a crappy movie for some reason or another, but trust me, I have my reasons. I payed my money, and I think for the first time in a while, I simply wanted to walk out. I am not sure how this movie is ""the number one horror movie of 2006"" or ""a movie that redefines horror"". I'll tell you what I saw in this movie. A whole load of what looked like Gollum from Lord of the Rings and an entirely over the top amount of blood. You could watch the scene from A Nightmare On Elm Street with Johnny Depp being sucked into the bed on repeat and it might have a similar effect.<br/><br/>With what I considered poor acting, a mediocre plot, one of the worst in horror history, and a complete waste of money, I would say avoid this one at all costs."
"mstomaso","8","11","19","2 October 2007"," Entertaining and well made reality-challenged psychological horror film
","It is very refreshing to see a horror film which not only respects but reveres its female characters and allows each to have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The Descent involves a group of girl friends who get together once a year or so to have an outdoor adventure, whether it be spelunking, riding rapids, or something less death-defying. A year after Sarah's (Shauna McDonald) husband and daughter are killed, they get together near Juno's (Natalie Mendoza) cabin in the Appalachians to explore a cave.<br/><br/>The ""Descent"" of the film is not just the descent into the cave, but a metaphorical allusion to hell, madness, and death. As things start to go wrong, friendship, and perhaps sanity, begin to rip apart.<br/><br/>Setting is very important to The Descent, and though a bit unrealistic, the cave environment is very nicely detailed and well portrayed. The cinematography is excellent. Tension and horror are achieved without buckets of blood and gore, and the film suggests much more than it shows - to great effect. The film is tightly directed and very well edited - not surprising from Paul Marshall given his credentials.<br/><br/>The story descends somewhat beyond the initial forays into unreality, but this is done with a level of insinuated ambiguity which implies something important about the plot. Avoiding a spoiler, I can not elaborate further... But anybody expecting a documentary from this film deserves what they get.<br/><br/>A great deal of credit for making The Descent the success that it is should go to the ensemble cast. The two leads - Mendoza and McDonald give stellar performances, but the entire cast deserves credit for making this film stand apart from the pack. The extras on the DVD indicate that Marshall gave each of the women considerable space with which to flesh out their characters and it is suggested that some liberties were taken with the script as well. If this is so, then the creativity, talent, and intelligence of this bunch should not go overlooked. Each character is beautiful, beautifully developed, and beautifully played - and each in her very own way.<br/><br/>The Descent borrows a bit from films such as Alien, Pitch Black and even Lord of the Rings (you will understand this when you see the film), but still, it is several steps above the average horror film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"kidboi","10","11","19","22 August 2006"," A genre classic? Probably...
","I just finished watching 'The Descent' for the second time. To tell the truth, i wasn't really scared after the first viewing, can't explain why really, possibly because i was watching it with eight dollar speakers. But the second time was more effective, probably because of the sub-woofer.<br/><br/>I was waiting to see a good horror film for a few years and then came 2006, which brought me THREE great horror films - Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes Remake and now The Descent. At first, when i read about the film, i wasn't really thrilled about the premise(people go into a cave, meet monsters, monsters eat the people). It reminded me too much of 'The Cave', which was an enormous disappointment. I only decided to watch it after reading positive reviews on 'Aint It Cool News'.<br/><br/>So, about the movie. The film opens with scenes of a few women rafting, after which one of them, Sarah goes somewhere with her husband and daughter, the later two meet tragic fate on the way. Sarah is then left with a deep trauma, and sees visions of her daughter through out the film, which plays an important part in the ending of the film. A year has passed since the tragic accident, and Sarah is now on her way to what seems to be a perfect vacation with her friends. They decide to go cave-diving and they're guide through this experience is Juno, Sarah's close friend. She tells everybody, that the cave is already discovered and everything is safe. After a small passage inside the cave collapses, lies are revealed, trust falls, one of the women, Holly, breaks her leg. But that isn't the only problem... In a tense scene, where the women argue over whether there is a way out or not, something attacks them, and all hell breaks loose..<br/><br/>Now, to get to the action in this films, you have to wait. Through this time, you get to know every woman in the group, specially Juno, who at first seems like a very supportive friend, but in the end turns out pretty much a liar.<br/><br/>Now, about the ending... As we all may or may not know, there are two versions of the ending to 'The Descent'. In the original ending, Sarah falls into a pile of bones, sees light, wake's up and runs to it. She gets out of the cave, drives to a highway, after which she wakes up in the cave, realizing it was a dream. She then sees her daughter once again and stay's in the cave awaiting her fate. In the alternate ending, the films ends with Sarah driving to the highway, which is a very corny ending, if you ask me. The original ending, however, is much deeper and has more meaning to it. Sarah's mind cannot take more. Her husband and daughter died in a tragic accident, and now her closest fiends have died horrifying deaths, and Sarah simply looses her mind and believes, that her daughter is really there in the cave.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a simply amazing horror film, probably, the best of this year and it could easily become a classic of the genre. If people are ready to accept it, that is.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This film lacked almost everything needed in a horror movie. No suspense, only a few really scary parts, and no intelligent storyline.<br/><br/>The acting was extremely poor. There were parts when the female characters were fighting the crawlers that were so poorly acted it was almost comical. In fact the audience was laughing like it was an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. What else could you do? You already spent the ticket price.<br/><br/>The part of the movie that was supposed to be novel and especially creepy was the crawler concept. And they were kind of cool. Unfortunately, they were almost a direct rip-off of the cavern dwelling creatures from Richard Laymon's novel ""Midnight's Lair"". It's almost as if the screenwriter read Laymon's book and said to himself ""these things are creepy and would make for good cinema"".<br/><br/>I was so disappointed because I had read several good reviews from (I thought) reputable reviewers. I wouldn't recommend this movie in any capacity or circumstance."

","The first half of the movie was alright. Not great, but alright. But then it falls apart, and succeeds in utterly destroying any coherence with rest of the film.<br/><br/>slight spoilers ahead... yawn... you were warned... <br/><br/>The movie opens with the death of the main protagonist's daughter. At first I thought the movie was about the main character, Sarah. Then it becomes an all female ensemble cast, about female friendship. The friends try their hand at spelunking. The scenic views within the caves were a welcoming touch. The foreboding builds a small bit.<br/><br/>Feelings of claustrophobia could have been built up in some of the characters, a bit more clearly, if this intention was present at all.<br/><br/>However, then it seems the film descends into the ridiculous, with extreme gore and nastiness towards all the characters. What was most galling was that it was a complete U-turn in terms of theme and character sense in the direction of the film. There was an extreme disconnect between first half of the film and the last half. The car crash & the loss of Sarah's daughter at the beginning of the film became completely irrelevant. The acting talents of the cast become wasted, as their character development also become irrelevant and disjointed from the gore-half of the movie. It lost any sense of coherence, and instead became a cruel dismemberment fest of the female characters by ""goblin cavemen"" rejects from LOTR. <br/><br/>""Suddenly!"" goblin men appear. Ugh. If the director or writer is to introduce highly implausible monsters, there should have been some foreshadowing or story mythology added to the scenario to introduce them and make them plausible within the movie. Seems like this part of the movie was hammered into such a tasteless & formulaic turn of events in order to accommodate the horror genre, which became its raison d'etre.<br/><br/>The female characters then turned from ""experienced adventurous, independent women"" into panicking, back-biting silly idiots running screaming in the dark and falling into pits. -- Who are then eaten alive. Not my cup of tea. I sat through this, disengaged, glancing at other things in my room, hoping it get better. It didn't and I regret watching this movie. If I had bought the DVD, I would have thrown it into the trash after seeing it.<br/><br/>As a man, I am not an extreme feminist, but even I was upset at how venally and cruelly women were taken apart in this film. Thematically, it jumped around, and couldn't decide what it was, nor hold any of the themes that it was building, until it suddenly become just a pure gore fest. In terms of storytelling, what was exceptionally weak was that there was no relevance of the death of protagonist's daughter except for an extremely ""tacked on,"" contrived ending. It's the first time I was moved to write a review, because the current 7 rating is completely undeserved. Just Awful."

After which in hindsight I feel I should have left the cinema. This unfortunately was not the case.<br/><br/>I think the main problem was nothing made me care about what happened to the characters let alone want any character to survive, be it a comment at the beginning of the movie that raised pity or even the fact that they actually deserved to survive to the end.<br/><br/>As for the feeling of claustrophobia, I felt that this was hampered by the fact that the time when it felt like the walls were closing in, well they actually did...close in that is.

It starts out mildly innocent enough, a very bland, typical plot a bunch of friends on a cave expedition with one character they place a little emphasis on making her look a little more suspicious than the others. We can only come to the assumption that other than Shauna McDonald (the supposed 'main character') and this other character, the remaining women are supposed to simply fill the generic roles of 'the siblings', 'the over confident jackass who dies first' and the rest are just 'unfortunate cannon fodder who die tragically and gorily'.<br/><br/>The creatures that dwell within the cave resemble LotR rejects and we half expected them to begin coughing 'Gollum!

Horror movies relying solely on loud noises and things jumping out to get a jump out of the crowd is not a movie worthy of the praise you guys give it.<br/><br/>To start off with where they went wrong, the lighting team was terrible. If your in a cave, 2 miles under the earth, no light will shine on things. This includes some of the demons, random parts of the cave, and when stuff jumps out or is supposed to be scary.<br/><br/>Next, nothing made sense, they go from one scene climbing something, and then the area changes completely. Water ceases to exist when you climb up a waterfall, ya know? The cheap scares throughout the movie where way overused, it seems as if they wanted to scare some random 10 year olds and make them scream.. all it did for the entire theater was cause laughter. Even until the very end, they use them.<br/><br/>No real plausible plot or storyline is present within the movie.<br/><br/>Plus, when you get a pick through the spinal cord, and voice box, you pretty much die instantly.

","Bought with a package of previously rented movies from a local rental shop, I chose this one and sat down to watch this movie with no expectations and no prior knowledge of it. Just the title. <br/><br/>As often the case after watching a clunker, (as such I judged it to be) I logged on to IMDb to see how bad it fared in the popular opinion. Imagine my astonishment when I see it popularly rated at 7.4! What did so many other people see that I missed? Who's off base, me or them? What did I fail to appreciate, if anything? <br/><br/>Now I have no problem with a virtually all female cast. No misogynist here, I can handle women being depicted as strong and assertive, in fact I find it a refreshing approach to what has so often been the more common role of women in horror movies, that of obligatory pretty screaming victims. What seemed to turn me off from taking the movie seriously at an early point was the sense of insincerity in the actresses. Now that I'm aware that it is a British movie, I wonder if perhaps it's a subtle cultural difference in the way the cast is directed or in their presentations, but I was always aware that they were acting. It was palpable. Then the mood was further broken by the standard low budget horror movie ethos, that the lead characters should make implausibly foolish decisions, which no one in their right mind would make, but which permit them to be killed in succession. EG: The lead spelunker left the guide book behind, so that they could all explore a 'new' part of the cave system! She is obviously a skilled and experienced climber/caver and yet she decides to deceive her companions by leading five people into a cave system she knows nothing about! When did she intend to tell her 'good friends' that she has led them into the unknown so that they could 'all discover it together'? Were they all going to giggle together over the prank around a wiener roast?<br/><br/>Then the cave creatures. They can skitter around on any surface even the ceiling, like spiders, showing that while blind they are still able to detect what is around them, yet they cannot detect living, breathing, hearts beating sweat smelling frightened people who are laying down on a ledge an inch in front of their faces as long as the ladies don't move! And despite the creatures' obvious great strength and agility in being able to zip around like squirrels, they get killed by the dozen by these exhausted and injured slow moving humans. Yeah, that could happen.<br/><br/>Then there are the quite unlikely plot twists and the odd moralistic rationalizations. -It's alright for the lead protagonist to deliberately mercy kill one of their number, but wrong and evil for the one who originally injured her to have done so purely without intent while surrounded and attacked by creatures! -It's a good idea for one of two people who are fighting for their lives against great odds, to deliberately injure the other and doom her to a grisly death, before they have reached safety!<br/><br/>And the final twist? Not horror inspiring but eye rolling. Of course by that time I'll admit I'd become thoroughly jaded with the show and it seemed more like banana peel humour, someone pulling your chair back as you are about to sit down, than any horrifying development.<br/><br/>No, the movie had turned me off long before this point, and I'd resigned myself to getting a laugh or two out of yet another badly done B flick. That so many thought so much better of it still amazes me. Wes Craven might have made a better movie out of it."

","Unfortunately I found myself quite disappointed by this film. While the anticipation and build-up to the confrontation with the creatures in the cave was quite nail-biting, as with a lot of films, once you've actually seen them they really aren't frightening at all and the film lost all edge for me. I felt that a lot more could have been made of the groups dynamics, perhaps focusing on the paranoia and mistrust of each other that you would expect in such a circumstance would have added more suspense once the 'nasties' had been unveiled to us. Marshall should have spent less time dragging out the girls get together and entrance to the cave, and concentrated more on their dynamics once things start to go wrong. This isn't a bad film by any standards, just a disappointing one after Dog Soldiers."

If this is intended to highlight a common emotional bond between (some) of the characters, it fails drastically. The subterranean creatures fail to scare in the *least*.

"screenman","1","9","16","8 January 2009"," Cinema Goes Down The Hole Again
","I don't quite know where to start, here. I see all of these stellar postings and superlative encomiums and think 'have they watched the same movie?' <br/><br/>Some people may call me a chauvinist before I'm through, but I prefer to consider myself a realist. A bunch of young women go caving. With tiresome predictability; each tries to out-macho the other like so many Ellen Ripleys. It just doesn't work. For one thing; she was on her own - even when in the company of others. Secondly; Sigourney Weaver at least learnt to act.<br/><br/>Soon, they're arguing and falling-out. Their voices are shrill and brittle and painful to hear. The echoing almost makes them unintelligible. Lo and behold! they've remembered their cosmetics but forgotten the map. Well; we all know that females can't interpret maps anyway so no surprises there, then. The main thing is that they can still look good even if they're lost.<br/><br/>Perhaps the director himself is the chauvinist, for perpetuating the appearance that women simply shouldn't go off to anywhere remotely dangerous without at least one nice sensible bloke to look after them. Because that's what this movie desperately cries out for: one or two male actors to bring a little objectivity to the affair.<br/><br/>As it is, when things begin to go pear-shaped, we see exactly the sort of tantrums and hysterics that have long since disinclined me towards female companionship in a hazardous situation. I've seen it all before at first hand. A small number of females do excel (the Ellen Ripleys of this world); sadly, despite 30-years of feminism; most play the headless-chicken card. At least to this extent it is an accurate portrayal, but I always find tantrums and hysterics rather tiresome. They're especially cheap as a means of provoking drama.<br/><br/>If the pettish bickering, the strident whining, and wrong-time-of-the-month histrionics aren't a big enough turn-off, then the lighting - or lack of it - is the clincher.<br/><br/>I know that in caves there is usually no light other than what we take with us, and as a consequence, what we see here is a perfectly reasonable representation of the subjects' predicament; but when the lack of illumination results in a more complete confusion to the viewer than the character, it becomes almost impossible to follow the plot. This bunch of young women are of broadly the same age, height, weight, vocal pitch, etc; so that in the gloom it is extremely difficult to tell what was happening and to whom. Often it is just a shrieking, flickering chaos. I could endure this for a few minutes, but for a whole movie? forget it.<br/><br/>After about two-thirds of the way through; I gave it up. I didn't care a rap about the characters, and had never been induced to do so. They're just a group of silly, shallow girls who should never have strayed beyond their campus. There is no particular build-up of tension, scarcely any backfill story, no cohesion in the plot whatsoever. In fact it would have made a better radio-programme because instead of trying to make sense of the abstract, twilit bedlam, a listener could simply have sat back and employed imagination.<br/><br/>What this movie demonstrates is the imperative of good acting and believable characterisation with sufficient depth to enable us to care about them, to say nothing of the need for sufficient light to see what the hell is going on. Realism is no use if the result is indiscernible confusion. There should also be much greater disparity of ages and temperaments.<br/><br/>If you like seeing young women doing what they do best, or perhaps NOT seeing them doing it, then you'll probably enjoy this. But if you prefer plausible acting, characters you can care about, events you can at least follow without the need for ESP, then give this a miss.<br/><br/>I think that if these young women really had to do something exciting enough to dampen their knickers; they should have gone climbing instead. At least the viewer could have seen what was happening most of the time. And they should remember to take a couple of nice sensible blokes with them, that way if they forget their maps it won't matter. And if they get into any trouble, at least two of their number will know what to do.<br/><br/>This crap should definitely be left where it went."

There's really nothing to this movie except one forced ""thrilling situation"" after another. The only thought put into it's creation has gone toward the make up.

","I had high hopes for this movie but ultimately found it a lacklustre film that had me clock watching after 15 minutes. When the film becomes more than a pot-holing exercise it does become briefly interesting - but only slightly. It's main failing was the characters - not one of them was truly likable (well, maybe one). Modern films that have groups of people facing tricky situations seem to follow a template that no longer works. There's the Joker in the pack, the brain, the sensitive one etc...they are all represented here but they are all just so annoying. These people need to be more humdrum, then perhaps i would have cared if they had come through this or not.<br/><br/>I would have thought that the setting would have made for a claustrophobic feel to the film but it never engaged my emotions in that way. Aliens, and to some degree the Abyss managed to successfully create that claustrophobic feel but this fell flat. Amazing considering this film is set in a cave.<br/><br/>I also did not like the way in which several of the characters react to the threat they are faced with - it was like a couple of them became little Rambo's. I have given this film 4 and that (to me) means it is a below average film."

","I've learned to stay away from movies written and directed by the same person, though the concept of pot-holing drew me in to see this one.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong to see this.<br/><br/>There may be some spoilers ahead, if you haven't seen it and actually want to, you should stop reading.<br/><br/>Characters are terribly underdeveloped which is a terrible waste. It's basically just a group of girls one exactly like the other and frankly nobody cares who dies when. In fact I can only recall one of their names. The movie opening is a total cheap shot, a visual insert which a high-schooler could have come up with (and probably written better). Then after waiting for what seemed like an eternity through some of the most on-the-nose dialogue ever, the inciting incident is finally revealed (and has nothing to do with the opening event). Then we're treated to clichéd, overdone Hollywood moments fed into a boring and predictable script, e.g. girl in bed rips off heart monitor, dying victim passes on bracelet revealing secret love - oh puh-lease. The plot is boringly predictable. Monster appears. Makes scary noise. Girl(s) flee or fight. Monster appears. Makes scary noise. Girl(s) flee or fight. Monster appears. Makes - you get the point. The poor writing is compensated for by an overly dramatic and distracting score, and of course plenty of gore (human bones, a lake of blood). I felt like I was at a baseball game, casually chatting to the person I went to see this movie with (as were the rest of the audience). At only two points were we actually 'in' the movie. But it's worth staying until the end for two reasons. First, there is the final escape. This might well have been the most over-the-top scene I have ever seen in my life. For a second I actually thought they were having a laugh at their own movie! But then when I realized they were serious? I CRINGED. Then there is the final hurrah, which makes absolutely no sense and frankly leaves the audience bewildered and angry they actually spent money to see this nonsense.<br/><br/>The real disappointment is that this movie has a fantastic premise. So much could have been done with this. They really blew it. And I'm really disappointed in Lionsgate. I had great hopes for the kinds of movies they wanted to put out."

Form of the formless, containment by absence, the pressing in of the absence of light.<br/><br/>""Ghosts of Mars"" did a bit of it, poorly, and it is exceedingly rare overall. That's why I celebrate any attempt. This isn't great, but it has some competence and lessons.<br/><br/>If you don't know this little film, it has a long setup period where we have a group of young women  not girls, surely  who arrange to be stranded in a cavern with a threat.<br/><br/>There are monsters but the threat is the dark. This isn't terrific cinematic engineering, that part all seems to be hit and miss. But it does have terrific pacing overall and that attention to pacing extends to the use of darkness and the various lighting devices they have at their disposal.<br/><br/>Much use is made of the point of view nature of the lighting: flashlights and cameras and even after they are gone much of the blocking uses those sensibilities. Its a subtle fold, but so very effective. It makes us see what these women do and joins us to them in terror.<br/><br/>There's an effective plot device that pings off this. One of our women has visions, which we follow until we have our legs pulled out from us and her.

The effects are what you would expect from a 2005 not-so-low-budget movie, the acting is satisfactory to say the least and the ideas for a horror movie aren't all that shabby. Problem is, it all doesn't add up to a whole.

The difference is that 'the Descent' is more horrifying , terrifying and shocker than 'The Cave' with a fantastic , unreal , and Alien style . The theme of people being stranded in a hostile , dangerous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of 'Pitch black' . The sets are realistic with underground scenarios shaped by formations and spaces that one might watch in certain impression , conveying a sense of vertical scale .<br/><br/>Suspenseful musical score by David Julyan (Prestige , Memento ,Insomnia), Christopher Nolan's usual musician . Photographed in Southern England though set in the Appalachians by Sean McCurdy , Neil Marshall's habitual cameraman who created a perfect atmosphere . The producers considered it too risked and perilous to shot in an actual cave , it also would have been far too time-consuming , so they opted to build one instead . The motion picture was decently directed by Neil Marshall with splendid visual style . He's expert in making brutally violent horror movies (Doomsday ,Dog soldiers) .

","Sadly, for me my title says it all. I foolishly chose this as my ""evening's entertainment"" after a completely misleading comment from someone that it was a ""psychological thriller"". For me, it turned out to be as far from that description as possible! After a slow build-up that I found tedious rather than interesting - with one exception, the accident near the beginning - things quickly descended into the usual feast of brutality, extreme violence and gore. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the second half of the film takes place in semi-darkness: unlike some members of the audiences of these films, I don't enjoy seeing characters being violently mutilated in close-up.<br/><br/>To summarise, then, what I disliked about this film was its feeble character development (I found I couldn't work out who was being killed or injured and, what's more, I didn't really care); a reliance on ""sudden jolts"" and brutal violence instead of atmosphere; dialogue often delivered in barely audible ""throw away"" style. Maybe this was why the revenge subplot made no sense to me and, even at the end, I couldn't work out the relevance of the road accident near the beginning. The idea behind the film also seemed to me a bit of a nonsense - to take a group of people into an unknown cave when only a couple of them are experienced potholers should have struck the whole party as blatantly suicidal.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I was intrigued by the accident near the beginning and its bearing on the rest of the plot - I just found that my revulsion at the second half of the film meant I couldn't give it close enough attention to find out.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I have enjoyed plenty of horror films over the years. Three of my favourites are Carrie, Hellraiser and Witchfinder General. All of these contain blood, violence and brutality. The difference between these films and The Descent is that the nastiness is relevant to their plots, and they all have characters the viewer can empathise with. I'm baffled and disturbed by the popularity of films that seem to wallow in violence for its own sake, and by the number of good reviews The Descent seems to have got."

","I must admit that I'm not a big fan of modern horror flicks, but this one got pretty good IMDb ratings and appeared, at first, to be different from the rest. Boy was I wrong. There was nothing original about this film other than the all-female cast of main characters. Ironically this makes the film even worse. You the un-original sequences aren't scary. I think the movie makers try to compensate for this by making the scenes *very* dark. But they're too dark. Half the time I cannot see what's going on, and the fact that most of the characters look and sound the same it's hard to tell what is happening to whom.<br/><br/>You don't really expect great acting or character development in a horror, so I won't even comment about that. But you do expect it to be scary. This movie was not. It's basically a series of overly dark scenes with various women screaming in them."

Desent is right indeed, it started well, the whole cave/pot holing plot could have been great...until the monsters came along. They instantly reminded me of Voldemort from Harry Potter, scary to kids maybe, to me they simply looked like daylight starved humans with bad (not menacing) teeth and made sounds like a cat in pain. From that point on it got steadily worse, less and less impresive. It didn't make me even nearly jump once and the only thing I found creepy was the fact they were deep in a cave, had the main plot unfolded with them fighting among each other and the battle of friendship tested then it would have held it's own but as it is, it sucked. As for the gore, yes lots of blood but rapid camera panning and shutter speed settings put paid to any real gore, I put it no more gory than the original Friday the 13th (which was a much better movie).<br/><br/>I give this 2 thumbs down, I only wish I had more thumbs."

","I'm still stunned by all the positive comments I read about this movie.

The introduction, or pre-horror, part of the movie was really drawn out and, quite frankly, one that didn't really draw me or my partner, into the movie. I actually thought the premise for the movie was good, but poorly executed. The tension build up was quite good although when it got to the d-r-a-w-n out horror part, I'd lost any 'caring' for the characters and couldn't wait until the end.

I still have no idea why they went into it in the first place, but they did anyway.<br/><br/>Eventually, the entrance crumbles shut. They realize that this is not the right cave, and some stupid ditz mentions that she was hoping to discover it, which is apparently worth risking your life for. The weird unknown creatures start attacking and killing the girls. There is no explanation of what these creatures are or how they got there.<br/><br/>As they go on, they just get themselves more and more lost and one by one, the girls start to die. One of them even kills one of the others by mistake.

Towards the end, the sole survivor escapes the cave, gets in her car and drives off. Then she opens the door and throws up. A flash of her fallen friend appears and it is shown to be only a dream and that she is still trapped in the cave. They then show her hallucinating of having cake with her (deceased) daughter with the creatures surrounding them, probably meaning that she will die very soon.<br/><br/>The beginning, middle, and ending of this movie made absolutely no sense to me and it looks like someone wrote the whole story and script in 5 minutes.

"The_Void","8","14","29","8 July 2005"," When extreme holidaying goes wrong...
","I had relatively high hopes for 'The Descent' before going into it. Neil Marshall proved that he has a good understanding of the horror genre with his debut, 'Dog Soldiers', which is also a film that I like very much and don't hesitate to name as one of the best horror films of the new millennium. This follow up to that film works on the same terms; with tension and atmosphere being more important than characters and substance, and I'm pleased to say that Marshall has created another worthy modern horror flick. It's clear that he wanted to be more original this time round, as the monsters here are of his own creation rather than being classic horror icons, like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers. The plot follows an all girl group of cavers who descend down into a cave somewhere in the UK. Things quickly go awry for our team, when, in a surprisingly tense scene, part of the cave collapses and seals them inside. Things get worse still when it turns out that they're not the only ones down there; and what is down there with them isn't exactly friendly...<br/><br/>Through a gritty and realistic plot pacing, Marshall has managed to take a simple premise and turn it into a slick and extremely suspenseful horror thrill ride. The film is slow to start, with only one exciting event in the first half hour, but once the movie starts properly; the thrills come thick and fast, and even when the plotting slows down; you can always count on there being another moment to drag you back into the action. I'm not usually a person that jumps during the 'jumpy' movie scenes; but this movie actually did the trick! Marshall obviously knows what makes horror movies work too, as he spends much of the film building a foreboding atmosphere, which is complimented by the isolated setting of the cave, which is two miles underground. He keeps the atmosphere going with a plethora of different tricks, including 'Argento-style' lighting, which he realistically blends into the movie by way of the lights that the girls take down into the cave with them. The film always breaths a sense of the horror of journeying into the unknown too, and this along with the tension filled atmosphere and realistic way that the horror is presented ensures that the film always sticks firmly to it's horror style.<br/><br/>It's clear that Neil Marshall is more interesting in creating a film that shocks more than anything else, and this is shown by the complete lack of characterisation. Marshall does give his girls something of a story, but it's never the focal point of the film and, in fact, it's hard to really care about it. This does bring the film down, as the girls are clearly in the movie just as an excuse to show the horror, and this makes sure that the film is as empty as it is stylish. This isn't all bad though, as the style is consistent; and the way that monsters have been designed reflects that. Much like the werewolves in Dog Soldiers, the fiends here look great and despite the fact that they're a work of fiction; they even have some sort of reality about them. The scenes with the monsters in, however, bring the film down. For some reason, Marshall has opted to fast edit the sequences, and while this succeeds in being disorientating and true to dark surroundings of the film's environment; it also makes it very difficult to see what's going on - which is never a good thing.<br/><br/>The Descent isn't a great film, or even a great genre film, but it's style, effects and fair amount of gore will ensure that horror fans will be pleased; and if that doesn't grab you, the vast amount of tension in the film certainly will. It definitely is nice, however, to see a modern film that isn't afraid that show blood and gore, along with a bit of imagination. It's even better to see, due to the wave of Japanese and American remakes getting unjust high praise, that the film is home-grown right here in the UK! Overall, The Descent isn't 'must see', but it's well worth seeing and I recommend it."
"CurbyCurb","1","6","10","18 October 2009"," Maybe I set my expectations to high?
","I've seen this movie in so many ""top horror"" lists I dedicated to give it a try. Everyone is claiming this is the holy grail of horror. So we have a cave, so im thinking that's going to create some great atmosphere. I found my self frustrated by the angles and pacing though. Then there's the character's who have no development whatsoever. So I could really care less about what happens to them.<br/><br/>Im waiting and waiting that hopefully these creatures will heighten the experience. But im disappointed again when there's no story behind them. When you no little to nothing about the villain in the movie it can make for some chilling scenes. That didn't work out too well here.. When they finally came to surface, the scare sequences happen so quickly it becomes an action flick. Speaking of action flicks, these stereotypical ladies seem to be masters at fighting. So that really takes away from the ""horror"" of what's going on.. So there's like an hour of that going on. Then in the end im waiting for the reward..<br/><br/>*SPOILER* So the woman who's family died in the beginning finds an escape. She finds the car which runs out of gas. The other girl she left to die(I can't even remember the names) appears in the passenger seat and she awakes in the cave... So im guessing this was to make the film ""deep"", have you guessing if she is still in a coma or not? Meh it just fails on so many levels. Im really disappointed. I guess if your claustrophobic this will provide a cheap thrill.. But it didn't do much for me, went in expecting to be terrified out of my mind, went out feeling like I wasted my time."
"blacklist-1","1","9","17","21 March 2011"," Descended into stupidity and for me sheer boredom.
","A simple question. ""What is a horror film designed to make it's audience do?"" The answer is easy to frighten us. If a horror film can do that and to an extent makes us emotionally care on some level about the characters who are getting stalked or killed or whatever, then it's a horror that can be classified as such and is enjoyable to watch as we become involved.<br/><br/>In short as you can guess from my rating The Descent fails to do either. I am staggered that the rating for one of the worst ""horror"" films I have seen whether it's British or otherwise is this high of a 7.4. Granted I will agree that it is very gory and violent and if you are particularly averse to that but like horrors you might enjoy cringing. The Descent certainly earned it's eighteen certificate in that respect. The thing is I have seen lots of gory films and are probably more desensitised to movie violence than some people. (Even though sometimes I have to look away, like Eden Lake a truly excellent horror, which I wouldn't call entertaining, but the whole thing like the story, themes, characters and acting are greatly orchestrated.) <br/><br/>Anyway the first five minutes of The Descent aren't too bad with a superb eerie scene in the hospital where the main character is in an accident. The film then chugs along at an average pace twenty minutes in before they enter the cave. The characters are set up nicely and the acting is okay for virtually unknown stars. But really there is little or no characterisation for the characters who are as thin as cardboard and the script is bad really.<br/><br/>I would be prepared to overlook the bad script and little characterisation if the film had generally been frightening but it wasn't. I think overall I jumped in fright about four times in the whole film and two of those moments were before they even enter the cave. The first reason I was hardly frightened was because the film took far too long in getting going with an exhaustive pace of slowness. It's about fifty minutes in before you see the weird predator creatures that stalk them. Secondly the film's characters seems devoid of basic common sense. When the girl who acts as a guide of the cave leaves the guide book in the car deliberately, you know the movie is descending into stupidity. It becomes even more ridiculous when they are down in the caves and get trapped in when she tells them that they are not even in the cave that is on the guidebook and that no one has ever been in the caves before. She thought it would be a nice surprise for them to explore it. I mean how stupid can you get? I know humans can act less rationally but come on. Any ""expert"" on anything of any sort always plans for contingencies and a ""guide"" should never lie to the ones they are leading into a cave whether they are strangers or friends.<br/><br/>With that you don't come to care about any of the characters as they (the woman guide really) steer themselves into death by their own stupidity and as the movie progressed it got sillier with one of the girls running away from the group when they find out about the predators. Duh! Sticking together in a group is probably a good idea as it maximises your chances of survival. They also just kept shrieking all the time and it got annoying. As a result of all this I was rooting for the predators to kill off the group and I'm pretty sure I wasn't meant to be on their side. It's just a relief when they do kill most of them but one (unfortunately) to rid myself of the boredom of listening to them and watching them. Ironically some of the scenes I found quite funny as the predators looked so fake, the CGI was awful even with a small budget, it's no excuse. As a result there's just no atmosphere.<br/><br/>I watched this until the end hoping it would improve but it just got steadily worse. I know there is a part two but I won't watch it. I couldn't put myself through the torture of boredom again. This is one of worst made and stupidest horror films I have seen and isn't worth the time of day. If anyone is a horror fan and are thinking of seeing it I would advise to not waste your time. I have seen scarier twelve rated movies (The Others being a good example and that was brilliant). Just don't watch The Descent it's that bad."

Well. The start at the road was so obvious that when the supposed shock should have come everyone, even the most frightened of us just burst out laughing, as was the case in the dream. Some of us even started joking, 'hopefully there aren't gollums or something underground' when they entered the caves, so there wasn't any fear left, we just kept blaming my buddy for disgracing our night. After I searched for something giving the movie substance or content (I had the time, there was nothing tense waiting for me), I just stumbled upon the extreme lack of ambitious screenwriters in the horror-genre. The story is every bit as constructed as the others flying around, with an unbelievable start-tragedy followed by a forced environment where there most likely everyone will fight for their lives with some bad guys entering the screen real scary.

It was clear to me that the writers and director made this movie solely for the Worst Film Festival. It was humorous in all the clichés it used, and the predictability of it. The camera work was worse than pitiful. Very few scenes were in focus, and the need to be out of focus is unclear. The sound crew was obviously asleep, too. These are trifling miseries, though, compared to a goofy plot and goofy characters. They don't hold your interest, and you spend most of your time yawning and wondering when the picture will finally end. Six women spelunk into unknown territory and at first you think its a remake of ""Deliverance,"" with a Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight character apiece. Then Gollum appears. Only, there are a bunch of Gollums, which makes this at least a mildly hilarious film. These Gollums eat people, by the way. Along the way the director uses most clichés-the photo of the doomed crew, the false alarms, the stereotypical characters-how could they forget the biggest cliché, however (the slow motion ""No""), makes one wonder whether this was intended to be a dark satire or not. A lot of critics were obviously on the take, or stockholders, because this movie only belongs in a Worst Film Festival.

"akuma634","1","9","17","14 August 2006"," Wake me when it's over
","I am very opinionated about horror movies and I haven't seen a good (new) horror movie since the remake of Hill Have Eyes. I despise movies like Saw and Hostel and I saw this for free and had very low expectations. So early on this woman gets into a car wreck and her husband and daughter die and for some odd reason it in to way affects the story as soon as everyone goes to the cave. So they put than in to make you feel sorry for her I guess. The characters are all very generic and the movie has almost no story. There was way to much talk and very little in the way of suspense. They use boring conversations as filler and you just sit there waiting for someone to die. The monsters weren't even the slightest bit scary and they show them way too often so it really cheapens it even more. The special effects were beyond awful, you hear a sound effect and see the aftermath in most deaths and in the other deaths it's a monster pouncing on someone and fake looking blood shoots out. For example if someone gets stabbed you hear the effect and the camera will cut to the knife already in the monster and the make up already applied, anyone with 5 bucks and a video camera could make better effects than this. In one scene this chick has a leg injury and people were actually grossed out by this. There is a fake looking bone sticking from the pant leg, and when the pant leg is lifted the make up is already there and it doesn't look very real.<br/><br/>How about the lack of suspense? You know who will die next long before it happens, it's always when someone gets wreck less and you just know they will die soon. The monsters just magically pop up out of nowhere every few minutes. There is no psychology, no stalking, no nothing it's just BAM! And the monster just pops out. Damned pathetic. So if you've ever seen a monster movie then you will have this movie figured out long before anything happens. And like I said there is no real story, it's a bunch of women with annoying accents in a cave with a bad rip off of that thing from Jeepers Creepers popping out of nowhere every few minutes until the credits start rolling, oh yeah and according to my watch the monsters didn't even show up for about an hour (but then again there were at least 15 minutes of previews from when I went in.) So if you like your violence as fake as possible, your gore kept to a minimum, a movie that treats you like a fool, a movie that give you plenty of warnings too early (almost like The Grudge remake), and just fails on every possible level than this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Do yourself a big favor and go to your nearest video store and rent the following movies: The Thing, Alien, Aliens, Jaws, Piranha, and Piranha 2. Then you'll be satisfied. Those are the monster movies that really will shock you and you just won't expect what will happen next. These are the foundations of the sub-genre that every other movie has been ripping off for the last 2-3 decades."

","While there were many ""jump"" scenes, there were so many implausible situations in the storyline that this became a very distracting movie. After a while the women became more irritating, and I never really cared about them or their outcome. This movie was on par with The Cave, Pitch Black, or The Ring; there was some suspense, but no actual terror. After it was over, I drove home and began to count out the inaccurate scenarios that I'd just seen. That was actually more entertaining than this movie. I'd suggest that people save their money and rent or buy something truly scary and suspenseful, like either of the Saw movies or The Grudge. This is the type of movie that will likely show up in another Scary Movie film."

","I usually tend to agree with the people on this site, but this time I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Talk about false advertisement..<br/><br/>The script was terrible and the acting mediocre at best. The sole purpose of the film was to scare the crap out of you by having things suddenly pop up out of nowhere. Besides that, the plot line simply didn't make any sense at all and made the whole film quite silly.<br/><br/>The film started of at a slow pace building up to what can only be described as an anticlimax. All the events leading up to the descent down into the cave didn't give the rest of film any substance at all and the first part was probably the best part of the entire film! It had two separate stories loosely put together without connection or point what so ever.<br/><br/>The events down in the cave were extremely illogical. They weren't illogical in the sense of ""unlikely"". The film was illogical because there were almost direct contradictions at times. If you study the antagonists closely at times you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 3 because it managed to almost make you jump out of your seat a couple of times (by things coming out of nowhere). If you are looking for a cheap scare this is the film to see. It doesn't require any brain activity at all.<br/><br/>But if you get p*-of watching pointless films with plot holes the size of craters you probably shouldn't waste your time going to see this one."
"Duane1975","4","9","17","7 November 2005"," Average, unrealistic and typical modern horror
","Having sat through this film I was extremely disheartened by the general premise that the film is based on. The beginning of the movie was the highlight and from then on things went from semi-realistic to absurd. <br/><br/>It seems that the writers imagination, which was somewhat disjointed, went from one idea to another with no link up, or no lead in. I understand that to be able to enjoy a horror that you need to somewhat suspend disbelief, but this movie takes that too far. The characters lack personalities and depth. They are portrayed in a rather two dimensional way which goes from one side to a complete opposite for no particular reason. You feel nothing for them and in the end aren't particularly worried what happens to any of them.<br/><br/>Having watched various horrors throughout the eighties to present day I have to say that this is typically average for this decade, so far. It is on a par with modern day 'so called' horrors, but don't expect something different or original."
"Lost_Highway","4","9","17","23 July 2005"," Average at best
","Sadly I think I was built up to think this was going to be a good, scary, creepy film. Unfortunately it was none of the above. Whilst I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bad film I can't bring myself to say it was good either.<br/><br/>It certainly has some good moments, but sadly it has a lot of dull moments as well, some people will prefer the pace of the first half of the movie, others like me will prefer it when it picks up a bit in the second half.<br/><br/>I think one problem was having too many characters, none of which we really get to know and therefore care about, I found it hard to care about the fate of these complete strangers. This is particularly odd as, like I mention above, the first half of the movie is very slow moving and should have been used as a chance to really get to know the characters. But to be honest I couldn't tell one character from another throughout the movie. I would have liked the movie better maybe if they had given us 3 or 4 characters and built them up with individual personalities, it seemed to be like they were only 2 different personalities out of all the characters.<br/><br/>The second problem is, well quite frankly it's not scary, not necessarily a major problem for some movies but for a movie that had a small budget, not exactly great acting and a one sentence plot outline, it was obviously relying on being scary to get by. And thats where it falls down, yes there are a few scattered jump moments, but most of them are fake moments if you like. (sort of like the old classic, hear a noise then a cat jumps out type moments) When it actually came to the crunch the bits that should have been scary simply weren't.<br/><br/>Rent this when it comes out if you like potholing, or are looking for a non-scary thriller, but if you are looking for a decent thriller or horror I wouldn't bother."

","This movie had me totally freaked out even before the real action started. It's been instantly relegated to my top horror flick list as well as my top movies with female heroes in it. It's not for the faint- hearted or weak-stomached and if you're claustrophobic (like me) you will struggle with it but persist!!! It's more than worth the effort. Superb direction, cinematography, acting and music.... everything in this is absolute top class! Shades of Alien & Predator amongst other things, one of the coolest things about this film is the wonderfully drawn characters of the female leads. One of the reviews here draws out the ""hidden"" story in this movie - relating to Sarah's subconscious which I really liked. I'll be watching the movie again with that in mind.<br/><br/>Reading the negative reviews here I can only assume they watched a totally different movie or went into this one determined to dislike it despite how brilliant it is (for some unfathomable reason!!). Created before The Cave and infinitely superior to it, this is about as FLAWLESS as horror movies get.<br/><br/>Watch this, it will restore your faith in the horror genre."
"jimrin","5","5","8","27 February 2012"," A disappointment...
","This had the potential to be a good movie, one which can drop the stereotypes of women in many horror movies and turn them into real protagonists. They don't have to be perfect. In fact, the characters were developed pretty well. So have you ever watched a movie and you're thinking this is a pretty good movie, and then the ending can make it or break it? In this case, the ending broke it. I'm not talking about the ending ending, but I'm referring to near the end of the movie where Sarah decides to become the judge, jury, and executioner of Juno. True, she didn't actually kill Juno, but she basically was giving her a death sentence. She didn't know all the facts, she had only one side of the story, and yet that was good enough for her to decide the fate for Juno. OK, so perhaps she wasn't killing Juno because of Beth... Perhaps she was killing Juno because she was having an affair with her husband. That gives the right to kill someone? Anyway, I personally think it would have been a better movie if the movie would have shown how they used their courage and ingenuity to get out of the cave... But in the end, this turns into a typical slasher movie where they get killed one by one."

The characters are two-dimensional, no real dialogue so no surprise there, but there is the hint of a back story that is never used, a suggestion of the husband cheating but maybe this was cut to allow for a scene where they run screaming.<br/><br/>It does have the feel of a Buffy flash back at points but it is harmless enough and easy to watch."
"TruPretender","4","5","8","16 August 2006"," A Deep, Dark Decension
","Be prepared for an unusually dark adventure when you make up your mind to see this film. It certainly builds to a nice set up. Also, for a feminist such as myself, the total domination of the female is both flattering and felicitous. The director certainly had some great ideas that he executed. I can easily say that I was surprised on most levels at first, because I saw something that was almost above my expectations. It wasn't a perfect film, mind you, but it did well with what it had. <br/><br/>The film follows a group of strong healthy women who meet in a camping trip, or rather a woodsy hang out in the Appalachian Mountains. One of these women, has just reached the end of a terrible year. Sarah, she lost her whole life, consisting of her husband, and her child. She is taking a private decent as it is, since the accident. Now, her friends are trying to serve her with a power weekend. This getaway soon turns disastrous, when the six women Decent into a cave , where circumstances take them into the heart of darkness, which tests their morals, their sanity, and ultimately, their will to survive. Soon, they are battling an army of unknown creatures that kill and eat, whilst screaming loud in the depths of the dark. This is made all the more unbearable by the fact that we hardly see any of it. <br/><br/>The film follows a distant, and pale tone all the way through, and the formula is not so predictable. The opening, however, is terribly rushed, and treated like a secondary plot device. Thusly, we barely have any steadiness or focus clear enough to realize the damage that has been done. Moments later, we are taken to the Appalachians, where the pushy, bossy Juno character is all and ecstatic about this new mountain climbing trip. The characters are certainly defined early on, and it is easily made clear as to which ones are amicable, and which ones aren't. Each one has flaws, and each one has strengths. The dialog, and the general closeness of the women is brought out with close shots and tight angles. <br/><br/>Another plus to the film, is the subject of the Decent. There are three actual Decents that are happening, or rather the characters are taking three simultaneous Decents. They have taken a Decent into the dangerous cave, the Decent into the end of their friendship, and ultimately, the Decent into insanity. As the claustrophobia and anger tenses, the women are forced to realize who is the one to blame, who can help them escape, and who they can trust with their lives. The Juno character has lied to them, trapped them in a cave, and endangered their lives. Many incidents end the film, with a tragic feeling, and a notable sense of prevention, which further flames the tragedy. Now, a minus for the film, is that the horror of the crawlers is never reached until quite late in the story, despite some early signs of impending danger. The focus on the women is long, dull, and heavy handed. Thusly, over half way through the film, do we really find the women in serious danger of death by the mouths of these creatures. <br/><br/>Yes, we were almost given a good film, and why not? The film has left many audiences talking about it, and given some good topics to debate over, but in the long run on things, the film seems to be a cold product of it's times. Like most films today, it either copies other films, or is a rehash or remake. It's a feminist ""Deliverance"" that takes place in a cave. The same type of set up brought to a more, action packed rate. It doesn't keep up with itself, and the survival instinct is muddied. There seems to be a moral message, but haven't we seen that already? What about the modern symbolism about the human system? It also falls prey to the MTV style camera-work, and tactics that are too familiar in some scenes. Also, the plot developments do not reach the potential to which they are first displayed. Alas, a wonderful example of how potential is only taken so far today, that it crumbles before it can reach the apex of perfection."

","""The Descent"" (2005) <br/><br/>Directed By: Neil Marshall <br/><br/>Starring: Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, Nora-Jane No one, & Oliver Milburn <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""Unrated"" (for strong violence/gore and language) <br/><br/>***PLEASE NOTE: This Is A Review Of The ""Unrated"" Version Of The Movie*** <br/><br/>When The Arrow (horror critic from the ""Arrow in the Head"" website and really the only critic I listen to when concerning the horror genre) gave ""The Descent"" a four-star rating and named it his favorite horror movie of 2005, I immediately put it on my ""Must-See"" list. I finally got the chance in August to see it in theaters and I realized that Neil Marshall is a horror genius. With ""The Descent"", Marshall crafted one of the greatest entries to the horror genre in the past decade, combining claustrophobia and bloodthirsty creatures flawlessly. It has been a long time since I found a horror movie that is one of the year's best moviesbut I found that with ""The Descent"". This film is shocking, terrifying, and surprisingly effective. For the first time in a very long time, a horror movie actually had me trembling when I left the theater. And, when I picked up the Unrated DVD and watched it (knowing the alternate ending ahead of time), I found myself even more affected by its unflinching and deeply dark attitude. ""The Descent"" is a serious horror movie--incomparable to most others made today.<br/><br/>Sarah (Macdonald) is a troubled woman. One year ago, her husband and her daughter were killed in a car accident, which she barely escaped. She has never been able to recover from the devastating blow. Her friends, including Juno (Mendoza) and Rebecca (Mulder), decide that taking a vacation will do her good and, knowing that Sarah enjoys exciting things, they choose a cave-diving adventure. At first, everything is going perfectlybut then the entrance caves in and the women find themselves trapped beneath the earth's surface with no way of knowing whether they can find the exitif it even exists. Things go from bad to completely hellish when they discover that they are not alone in the cave, for a group of vicious, bloodthirsty creatures are thriving down in the darkness and they have been waiting for a fresh meal. Scream your last breath.<br/><br/>People expecting a shallow, bloody, and rapidly-faced war between man (or, more appropriately, woman) and creature will be disappointed with ""The Descent"". It is not the typical horror movie and I thank God for that. The first half is a calmly-paced caving expedition that exploits everyday fears we may have, such as claustrophobia and fear of darkness. It gives us to time to develop bonds with the characters, particularly Sarah and Juno. Then, the nightmare truly begins and the characters we have come to feel for are plunged into one of the most horrifying scenarios imaginable. They are trapped in the darkness with the chance of escape growing smaller and smaller with every passing minuteand, on top of that, hordes of violent, snarling creatures arrive and tear into the group of friends. Then comes the war. You see, these women are not the clichéd female characters from horror movies that scream, hide, and cry hysterically the entire timeand then die. These women, though scared and emotional, want to survive and do not merely run around like chickens with their heads chopped off. They fight to the death and unleash their most animalistic instincts in order to survive. This is handled in a realistic and believable fashion.<br/><br/>When ""The Descent"" premiered in Britain, it featured a different ending than the version released in the originalan ending that changed everything, but that was only a few moments longer. I am proud to say that the ""Unrated"" edition features the original endingthe way the movie was meant to be seen. It was a more fitting ending and, for me anyways, a much more thought-provoking. Strong performances by the almost entirely-female cast give this movie an excellent finishing touch and Neil Marshall's direction ups the tension and terror without using clichéd and overused styles. I was happy to see that the creatures were exposed in only brief glimpses or usually bathed in darkness, instead of being shown outright from the opening scene. This concept was probably most successfully used in ""Jaws"", but, here, it is used almost just as effectively. On the slightly negative side, there were a few characters that weren't given enough time to develop so I got them confused when things went crazy. But, ""The Descent"" is easily the best horror film of 2006 and of the past few years. It is tense, suspenseful, and ultimately horrifying.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Are you tired of seeing the same, generic horror movie over and over? ""The Descent"" is the cure for that.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)"

","***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>What an absolutely outstanding horror film. Not only is it very well acted, but Marshall takes the time to establish the characters, causing the viewer to invest their emotions into them. This not only makes for better film-making, but the forces the viewer experience the film on a more intimate level; invoking more uncertainty, tension and terror.<br/><br/>Also, Marshall uses the penultimate tactic that makes any horror movie good. The viewer is shown almost nothing, allowing the mind to make up for what is not shown. Just like in ""Alien"", you are left to your own imagination to invent what you think may be in the darkness. At times when watching this movie, I was literally paralyzed with my own fear, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. I have not been that truly scared in a long time. Outstanding work.<br/><br/>However, do yourself a huge favor and attempt to see the original UK release, as the U.S. version has a modified ending. The UK version is by far superior and Lions Gate (the American distributor) should have left well enough alone.<br/><br/>I can only hope that more movies like this one come out as this is the way it should be done."
"Quinoa1984","10","8","15","5 August 2006"," possibly the most effective and scary horror movie of the year
","Neil Marshall is not a name I was familiar with before seeing his latest film, The Descent; he's made movies released in the UK, which got limited to no release in the US, to which it would be rightful to say that this is the best kind of calling card he could have made. It's a horror movie that's made with the eye of a professional, one who realizes that the best way to get an audience involved in what comes in the second to third acts of the picture is to make an equally compelling set-up act with the characters. The cast is also all but unknown to me, but they all too perform very strongly as the tough, hot women who decide to risk it down in a spelunking (if that's the word) expedition. Particularly the roles of Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) are very compelling once the action really starts to roll.<br/><br/>But going back to the professional part of the style- this is the kind of horror movie where you do and you don't notice what the filmmakers are doing. Unlike a recent horror movie like Saw which induces lots of fancy shmancy photography and editing to try to draw a viewer in, the director knows the best way is to not show what's going on. With this case being a cave, where the claustrophobia, consistently dark corners, and the lack of direction and light, marks enough doom that it just needs to be shot in a straightforward telling-the-story manner. At the same time, even with all of this atmosphere induced once the creatures appear and the pace picks up tenfold, you almost might forget really that a 'style' is going on, which is quite pleasing at a time when horror directors feel the need to make things gritty just for the sake of it. This is not to say the film isn't one of the most gory of the year, with enough blood to probably go through two of these newer remakes.<br/><br/>The set-up to the film with the girls is quite good (including a beginning involving a certain child that is one of the great modern horror movie beginnings by being realistically horrific), leading one to want to see these girls make it through to the end. The ending that has been apparently changed by Lions Gate for the US release is indeed unsatisfying, though it's lead-up is a plot element that's the only convention that doesn't really work. This is that a particular character near death gives information that's only there so that later in the film something else can come of this, breaking part of the belief within the disbelief (if that makes sense). But, overall, this is likely to become a nifty cult hit from overseas, the best of its kind to come from the UK since 28 Days Later. It doesn't really lie to you about what it is, and within certain conventions everything is put to top notch use with locations, tension, special effects and make-up, and even a couple of amusing points. It's a piece that I would probably in good conscience recommend to any serious fan of the genre."

","An interesting and differentiated horror movie in the ""gore"" style. It is above average for the genre. It started slowly, but after half it became interesting, maintaining a tense atmosphere, a little frightening and claustrophobic. The atmosphere is good. It can be divided into two parts: before and after the cave. You sit on the armchair during the exhibition with that feeling of agony and distress. It escapes from the usual clichés to the genre, having an unconventional and surprising ending. There are some logic flaws in the plot and the characters, but nothing that compromises the story.

","I'm a film major and an avid horror film fan. I didn't have any issues with this movie. It blew my mind. You know those films of nuclear decimation and houses just being completely flattened? That was me in my seat. After it's all over you're like, ""What's next? What now? Do I go out and live my life or what?"" It probably has ruined me for the next couple of years as far as horror films or even movies go. Why would you even go see junk like Saw III or whatever teen slasher sequel with Buffy in it after seeing this movie? It was also really suspenseful! A lot of Hitchcockian techniques were used in this movie. What was so great though, was that before we even get into the plot about the cave-dwellers, the actual cave itself and climbing down a cave, and being in small areas that can crush you, and swinging over a bottomless pit with one rope, or falling and breaking your leg and having to push the bone back in with no medication is really scary. It's scary cause it's real life situations. The movie kept me guessing the whole time. The only thing I think you can predict (but because they give you clues and foreshadowing at the beginning anyways) is who you think for sure is going to make it. If you think you can guess what's next I challenge you. The only bad part of the movie is when the computer graphics bats fly out of the cave. That's not even important. That's nothing. Scariest film I've ever seen."

Now, that's the qualities of a real scare-fest! The second half of the film more than compensates for the lack of blood in the first half, loaded with blood, guts and gore so nerve-wrecking that I honestly found it difficult to watch some of the scenes. It was just that well done! Quite terrifying, actually, and definitely not everyone's cup of tea, so be warned. It is also nice to see how the weakest character becomes the strongest. Exceptionally well made film."

","I heard it was ""the best thriller since Aliens"" from more than one person, and that gave me high hopes. What I got was a mix between something almost Saw-like, Alien-like, and something I have never seen before.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie had nothing do with the creatures. The revenge killing, the literal pool of blood, the accidental killings, the claustrophobiaall that was done perfectly. I just thought the cave dwellers held it all back due to their cliché and predictable nature. How many movies have you seen with monsters that only live to kill? Hundreds. Monsters in a horror movie are as predictable as Big Bird in an episode of Sesame Street. Without the monsters, the movie would have been less predictable. Anyway, the cave dwellers were nothing more than a dumber version of Orcs mixed with your standard jump-out-generic-monster.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great, but it didn't impress me. The plot-twist in the very end (of the Unrated Edition) is, sadly, just another cliché used in almost every movie anymore.<br/><br/>It was a fun movie. The upside-down killing is one of the coolest killings I have ever seen in a movie. I can't deny that this movie had its moments. But a few less clichés would have made this so much more fulfilling.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Neil Marshall's debut Dog Soldiers was a brilliant small-budget werewolf movie; his second film, The Descent, is a remarkable step forward: darker, scarier and more visually interesting.<br/><br/>Six women - including Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who recently lost her family, her protective friend Beth (Alex Reid) and reckless Juno (Nathalie Jackson Mendoza) - go spelunking in a cave in the Appalachian Mountains but end up trapped underground while mysterious creatures stalk them.<br/><br/>Performances are solid, if limited by the lack of characterization - every character is defined by a single personality trait. The all-female cast is an intriguing idea and feels refreshing for the genre.<br/><br/>Although the mysterious Gollum-like monsters show up relatively late, even before their arrival The Descent is tense and suspenseful. Pacing is brisk, tone dark and unsettling; the original ending is far superior to the silly alternate version.<br/><br/>Marshall shows talent and a true understanding of the horror genre: let's hope his career will continue at these levels.<br/><br/>8/10"
"rjh2200","4","4","6","12 January 2007"," derivative, but entertaining on a sensory level
","I cannot believe how people have raved on and on about this gorefest. It's not bad but it's also no masterpiece.<br/><br/>I realize that it's best to check your sense of reality at the door with a horror film, but the idea that six surface-dwellers in a pitch-black, unfamiliar environment can take out more than a dozen feral creatures whose senses (presumably) are attuned to living in their home cave is insulting. I also liked the ending myself (my girlfriend says it's ""lame"") because Sarah finally hallucinates and clearly isn't ever leaving the cave. It's left sort of open-ended.<br/><br/>Just about everything in this movie is a rip-off of Predator and the Blair Witch Project. Moreover, the other devices this movie uses are used so often that they have become cliché. For example, the first five minutes of the movie is a flashback of a sudden and tragic death (then fast forwards to a year later). Deja Vu? That's because it's used in nearly EVERY A- rate horror film made in the past ten years.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by this movie. They made the creatures such a big part of the movie that they failed to be frightening by the end. In fact, the lead characters are so darned annoying in the cabin party scene that I found myself actually rooting for the creatures. The Sarah versus Juno subplot (also contrived) got in the way."

"cwrdlylyn","10","7","13","24 August 2006"," THE DESCENT : Incredibly Scary... Please Have All Horror Movies Made By Foreign Directors!
","THE DESCENT<br/><br/>Finally, for the first time since 28 DAYS LATER a horror movie has come along that filled me with genuine fear. THE DESCENT is hands down the best horror movie released in recent years, and though it features a great deal of gore and violence, it refreshingly does not draw it's largest scares from these elements. THE DESCENT is a brilliantly shot film that captures the idea of claustrophobic insanity perfectly. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the two best horror films of the past decade have had their origins outside of the United States, and it's time for American film-makers to look past the ""slasher"" clichés.<br/><br/>THE DESCENT tells the story of a group of friends who have experienced an enormous tragedy just one summer ago. One year later, in an attempt to move on, a group of females choose to go on an expedition traveling through an ominous cave located in the middle of nowhere. It starts out as planned, a vacation that re-affirms friendships and shows signs of new hope in their lives. However, as they go deeper and deeper into the earth, things get more and more terrifying. <br/><br/>THE DESCENT leaves the remainder of it's story open for interpretation. As the girls begin to realize they are not alone in the caves, it is not 100% clear as to whether the bat creatures that hunt them are real or if they are representations of one character's slow descent into insanity. However, either way you interpret this (and I still haven't made up my mind), director Neil Marshall keeps his film constantly frightening.<br/><br/>For me personally, the scariest part of THE DESCENT comes before any monsters arrive. Through brilliant lighting, camera-work, and direction, this film manages to makes it's audience feel the claustrophobia to an uncomfortable extent. The sequences in which the girls must crawl on their elbows through passageways that have dust constantly falling from the roof made me physically uncomfortable. Often times we see nothing more then the beam of light from a flashlight and the jagged rocks it passes over. And yet, despite the limited options for scenery, Marshall manages to keep the film feeling alive. It never drones on or gets boring b/c of the small environment, instead it thrives.<br/><br/>Then when the monsters do appear, Marshall lets the blood fly. However, it is never the blood and gore that offer the real thrills. While films like SAW and HOSTEL relied completely on disgusting their audience to incite fear, THE DESCENT merely uses the gore to emphasize the terror, not create it. What's also very cool is the amount of references you can find in THE DESCENT to many of the greatest horror films in history, including:<br/><br/>THE SHINING - as the girls drive up the mountain to the cave entrance<br/><br/>CARRIE - as one character rises from a pool of blood, it's unmistakably similar to the prom scene<br/><br/>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - the use of night-vision goggles while in the caves<br/><br/>28 DAYS LATER - waking in the hospital in the very beginning of the movie<br/><br/>There were more but I can't remember them too well b/c my mind was so engrossed in the movie. Clocking in at a brisk 99 minutes, THE DESCENT packs the kind of punch far too many horror films don't. It scares it's audience while also engrossing them into a gripping emotional story (not to mention the fact that the cast offers strong performances). Also, it can be enjoyed as either a mindless thrill ride, or an incredibly complex examination of mental insanity. <br/><br/>It's a shame the film isn't finding a larger audience here in the states while films like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS can be the equivalent of a cinematic fart and still open at #1. However, I would place my bets on the fact that THE DESCENT will go on to continually find a larger audience in subsequent years... perhaps even becoming a cult film of sorts. It's simply too good to not be remembered as an incredible horror film.<br/><br/>... A- ..."

","I'm not sure how to write about this movie without talking about spoilers, so I'm just going to plow ahead and mention that THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS, so if you don't want to to know, don't read any further.<br/><br/>This movie is the story of a group of friends who decide to go exploring caves. One of their number has suffered a terrible tragedy in the form of a car crash that killed her husband and daughter. (The accident is simply one of the most jarring moments in movie history and is as big a punch in the face as anything that happens in the rest of the movie). Once the group gets to the cave everything begins to go wrong. Worse still is that it isn't long before they find out that there is something terrible in the cave with them.<br/><br/>I have to say at the outset this is a well made and well acted film. Any problems I have with the film, and I have many, are do to the story line. This is one of those movies that should have been better.<br/><br/>HEAVY SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT I dislike the plot twists in this movie a great deal, its not that they are in and of themselves bad, rather they are of the sort that are so incredibly clichéd or designed to keep the plot moving. First they don't go to the cave they were suppose to because their leader considers it a tourist trap, worse they never told anyone where they went; They never take the guide book on the caves of the area; they seem to lose what ever it is they need moments before they need it. Most amazing of all is the one that shows up about an hour into the movie. Even though its alluded to earlier, the creators of this little thriller have added a race of blind goblins to the mix, in away that seems completely out of left field. Here's a taut movie about a bunch of friends trapped underground upon which they've added some creatures from the road company of The Lord of The Rings. At that point I just threw up my hands and gave up. Its not bad, its just not in line with everything else.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say. This is one of those movies where things would move along on a logical path, except the writer keeps throwing twists at the characters for no good reason other than it movies the plot in the direction he wants it to go. I wouldn't care, but its always when the twist would do the most damage. I also wouldn't care if it wasn't every ten or fifteen minutes, once I could buy, maybe twice, but three or four or five times? It ruins the genuine suspense and feeling that movie naturally creates.<br/><br/>Try this on video or cable. Just don't be rushing out to see it since you may end up disappointed, like I was, at having to watch a good little thriller hobbled by dumb plot twists."
"coligo","3","6","11","17 July 2005"," A Voice of Reason
","I don't want to rain on anybody's parade here, but this film is not very good. If it were a newspaper it would be the Sun. Sexy women, crap jokes, poor story telling, a couple of stabs at thrilling its audience, all wrapped up in something that thinks its done a good job, but is actually a good example of why the public should not be allowed to read.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Dog Soldiers as much as the next man, but with this film we have a collection of not very good actresses (all bar two, Juno and Sam), who have a sub-par script. The setup scenes fail to convince that these charactersare friends, let alone alive! They are dull and hammy, cliché-ing their way through what should be an emotional rollercoster ride, but is instead a boring stroll down the pier.<br/><br/>As for the direction, well, after looking at some of the reviews on here, i think I must have stumbled into the wrong cinema screen. The film I watched was badly directed. Thats right, badly. Given the awesome setting of this film we should be on the edge of our seats throughout, but instead the best Marshal can do is throw hundreds of jumps scares at you. I'm not against this kind of scare tactic, after all it worked well in Jaws and The Sixth Sense, but here it is the only scare we get, repeatedly.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* <br/><br/>There is also a complete lack of logic in much of the story, the creatures are blind why? Even moles have limited vision. If they are blind who on earth drew that cave painting, and why did it require a flare to look at? Surely the torch in the teachers hand was enough to spot the second entrance (that the other characters couldn't even understand, ""Does that mean there's another way out?"", please, is anyone that stupid). The expositionary dialogue was appalling, the characters might as well of stood up, introduced themselves, their profession and their relation to other characters at the start. To be honest, for the number of shoddy 'jump out of the dark, whilst a loud noise booms' scares in this film, Neil Marshall might as well of sat next to you in the cinema and shouted ""Bleh!"" every now and again. Its a cheap way of getting shocks, true horror creates that out of atmosphere, character and tension, all things that this film lacks.<br/><br/>*End of Spoilers* <br/><br/>This film was real let down, and I didn't even expect much after seeing the trailer. It was badly handled and even worsely scripted. A film that could have been a neat entry into the genre of high tension horror, instead becomes a clichéd story with dubious plotting, awfully directed set piece moments and shoddy gore scenes that wish they were the Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, watch Dog Soldiers again, it may not be great but at least you don't come out lamenting British cinema's fall below mediocrity."
"pjcarline","5","6","11","13 July 2005"," Amicable cave-dwelling nonsense
","Young Englishman Neil Marshall - the one man band responsible for the lamentable and allegedly ""tongue in cheek"" horror flick Dog Soldiers - brings us more of the same with The Descent . <br/><br/>Guess what? It's peppered with umpteen jumpy moments, poor characterisation, an utterly implausible storyline, daft twists and a new bloodthirsty, cave-dwelling baddie which I'm sure was intended to be bloodthirsty and scary, but somehow passed me by. If you can turn a blind eye to all that, then The Descent is utterly idle dross which passes the time perfectly amicably.<br/><br/>Six adrenaline-junkie females (all of whom have surprisingly, dare I say it, male traits and psychological make-ups to boot) make the blunder of heading to Appalachian Mountains to plunge the depths of a cave system. While not entirely sure of the group dynamic (it was never adequately explained, or even explained for that matter), nor the reasoning behind their poorly thought out expedition, the group place their trust in Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) - an apparently seasoned stateside campaigner, who makes a few too many schoolboy errors for my liking. <br/><br/>With several clues for the observant (and even the not so observant, bless them), it's fair to say that their jaunt into the unknown is far from idyllic and that this is certainly not going to be their day. Not that I really cared, as the lack of any significant dialogue between the main players, coupled with unbelievable all-too-male jokey moments had me rooting for the hidden foe instead of the band of our boyish tomboys. <br/><br/>It's typically formulaic stuff as the not so intrepid explorers bungle deeper and deeper into the unknown, while the inevitable becomes more and more, well, inevitable. <br/><br/>What emerges from the darkness is that Mr Marshall will stop at nothing to make audiences jolt from their seat. After an hour this cocktail of Wes Craven mixed with 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf' begins to lose its potency, and the canny will have the tactic of bracing oneself at the opportune moment down to a fine art. Nevertheless, the film is paced well enough, with the suspense building nicely toward its all too predictable conclusion.<br/><br/>Despite all its flaws - and they are at times woefully and inadequately clear - the sum of The Descent 's parts somehow come together to produce perfectly watchable twaddle which requires little thought or emotive engagement. <br/><br/>Switch off and enjoy."

","The Descent is written and directed by Neil Marshall. It stars Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring and Nora Jane No one. Music is by David Julyan and cinematography by Sam McCurdy.<br/><br/>A group of adventurous ladies are always up for the challenges of nature, be it water rafting, climbing or cave exploring. When they go potholing in some out of the way Appalachian venue, they find a little more than they bargained for. In fact it's looking unlikely that any of them will survive the trip...<br/><br/>Neil Marshall first came to horror fan's attention with the bloody and hugely funny Dog Soldiers in 2002, here his follow up forgoes humour in favour of an assault on the viewers senses. Chiefly what Marshall has done is craft a picture that plays on the basic fears of your average human being, the dark, confined spaces, and yes, things that literally do go bump in the night, all nicely bundled up in the most appropriate of subterranean settings. But to purely label The Descent as a shallow popcorn horror piece would be a gross case of misdirection, for Marshall has given the characters a back story to work from, we as the viewers get introductions to these game and able ladies, interesting character dynamics serving for preparation, so when they get down in the dark, we are with them too.<br/><br/>Marshall knows his horror onions, he knows what works and he know what doesn't, after grabbing our attention quite early in the piece, he serenely goes about knitting the strands together to fully form his movie, he then of course knows that once we are in the caves, reality is the key, and here's Marshall's masterstroke. His use of lighting is first class, there is no light down there, we have to rely on Miners Helmet lamps, glow sticks, flares and even the video-cam viewfinder. Contrast the lighting work of that with The Cave that was released the same year, The Cave is lit up like Narnia on a snowy morning for crying out loud! Marshall is also well served by his sound department, trickles of water blending in with the sound of bodies scraping against rock, and of course something, somewhere, shuffling in the dark<br/><br/>The Descent ranks up with the very best of British horror movies, its build up and execution is first rate, and it pulls a neat trick of having an all female cast, of which Alex Reid and Shauna Macdonald are particularly impressive, the latter of which producing one of the best shows of grief shown by a British actress in many a blood red moon. American audiences have proved to be indifferent to it, though they have not been helped by having a different (weaker) ending to the excellently thought provoking one that Britain got. But a couple of nice homages aside (the score for example is a direct lift from Carpenter's The Thing), that are Marshall's want, The Descent is as fresh as a daisy; that is if your daisies are cloaked in terror! A brilliant horror picture, the most significant British horror film since The Wicker Man. 10/10"

","Wow. I was excited before I saw this film. The hype. The reviews. I was made to believe I would see a brilliantly creepy, twisted, and original horror film.<br/><br/>I sadly, to say the least, didn't get what I expected. It starts off leading you into quite an interesting and creepy story of a group of female friends descending into an unexplored cave for an annual trip. Sadly, just when you get to the point when the big twist has happened and you're ready for all Hell to break loose, it shoots off in all directions, completely slaughtering the claustrophobic and mysterious feel of the film.<br/><br/>Now, the critics may tell you about how the terror of what's lurking in the dark and the descent into madness and betrayal the girls go on, but that's not what you will find here. Not at all. I watched this film alone in a dark house, and not once was I scared by it. The most you'll get here is some very cheap scares, all involving bat-people jumping out of crevices in rock that could easily have come straight from an eight-year-old's sense of horror. And, as far as the descent into betrayal and brutality you hear about goes, I can simply say you'll feel cheated when you find none of that. A girl kills another girl by accident. That's it. No kidding.<br/><br/>So, what I'm complaining about here is the build of the film: Girls meet up, girls go into cave, the scene gets creepy and builds a sense of claustrophobia, they get trapped in, they get attacked, they run around and scream and die for 25 minutes, they leave. Extremely anticlimactic.<br/><br/>I would give this film a two. I would. But the fact that it is able to at least build up at the beginning to a point where you care about the main characters and their relationship and it is surrounded in a dark and claustrophobic mood (which sadly is completely murdered later) gave me the will to add two extra stars.<br/><br/>In conclusion, let me clarify that this film did not scare me, nor did it affect me in any way. It's just an EXTREMELY overrated monster flick. I'd say that the critics desperately need to develop a taste in horror."

I really didn't care if any of them lived or died. The suspense was drastically overdone. I found myself laughing at most of the scenes with the crawlers, and they weren't in the movie all that much(the basic plot of the movie wasn't even in it that much). This reminds me of those horror movies you would see being spoofed where you would see a couple having sex in a pool or hot tub while there's some creature from the unknown killing everyone in his sights. So you wonder why they are there, like don't they know they're next to die, and of course they are. Everythign that happens in this movie is exactly like that. The only thing good about this movie was the gore factor, the only thing they did right. I saw the original ending (not the one seen in the USA) and while making more sense, it still didn't add anything to an already horribly boring, pointless movie.

"cfbyrne","9","8","17","2 January 2007"," A Horror Movie That Scares The Hell Out Of You
","I had heard the hype surrounding this movie, mainly pertaining to the gore and graphic content that flows freely throughout the whole movie. I was expecting a gross-out film like ""Hostel"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which are disturbingly horrific, but not ""scary."" I was pleasantly surprised. ""The Descent"" is scary. You feel as if you yourself are in a claustrophobia-inducing cave being hunted by God knows what. The acting by these newcomers to mainstream cinema is impressive, as with a group of 5 women you either expect ultrafeminest-like macho-ism or nudity and helpless screaming. Nope...in ""The Descent"" you get realistic characters with pasts and actual human reactions. Without giving anything away, the ending was one of the most well-made parts of the film. With scenes reminiscent of ""The Shining"" and ""The Thing,"" this movie will literally scare the hell out of you."
"Wintersnake","9","9","20","12 December 2005"," A surprisingly effective and brilliant movie
","After the mediocre The Cave I had low expectations for this movie, being another cave movie with slightly similar premise. But it was to my pleasant surprise that The Descent easily surpasses The Cave by miles. This is the movie that should have replaced The Cave.<br/><br/>After a very shocking start that will take you completely off guard, the movie sets up the main theme, a group consisting solely of women, heads out into the wilderness to explore a cave. As expected, things go bump in the night, and what started as a wonderful experience soon becomes their worst nightmare, and a fight for their lives.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why this movie works so well. The cast is down to earth, normal looking persons. They feel and act real, and some scenes are nailed perfectly thanks to their acting. They express great emotion by their voices, movements and facial expressions, and as the situation gradually worsens, they change with it. The lead character Sarah is amazing, and without spoiling anything, she changes a lot during the movie and the events that occurs, and she plays it perfectly all the way. Another character, who's name shall be unspoiled for your enjoyments sake, is incredible when she accidentally does something horrible. The moment of realization, the look in her face, if it doesn't make you shocked and thinking, nothing will. It is masterfully played by her, and definitely one of the best moments in the movie. After the movie, ask yourself if you'd be able to live with the same situation.<br/><br/>Another thing that works so well, is how the movie plays well on various fears you might have. Suffering from Claustrophobia? You'll find some of the parts in this movie very disturbing and hard to watch. Fear of Darkness, being trapped, the unknown, heights...it's all there, and it's all very effective.<br/><br/>There's a lot of gore, and it's definitely not for the squeamish. Some scenes had me cringing, simply because they work so well. The gore never becomes silly, it makes the movie effective, and it's also well used to portrait the changes in the characters and how they respond to the events that unfolds. Lightning, Camera-work and Music are also topnotch, and they enhance the mood to great degrees.<br/><br/>This movie can be strongly recommended to both horror fans, and those tired of the same old, overproduced, flashy pop inspired horror movies these days(The mess that is The Cave in mind). This is a chilling, effective and brilliant movie that leaves you shocked and unsettled. And it even manages to give you a major twist at the end, something that managed to shock me more than any other movie the last few years. The question isn't IF you should watch this movie, it's How Soon."
"piercemyearce","10","6","12","2 March 2011"," One of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had.
","The Descent, for me, was a genre redefining film. Taken at surface value, it's simply a film about a woman who experiences a horrible loss and struggles with her sanity as she experiences a much worse fate. Deconstructed a bit beyond that, it works quite brilliantly on a lot of levels. For one, it's debatable whether the monsters found in depths of the caves and in the shadows even exist in the reality of the film or in the reality of the main character. The film is seen through her fears, her anxieties and as she loses her grip, so do her friends find themselves in increasingly dangerous situations. She hallucinates so often, that one wonders if she isn't experiencing a degree of psychosis brought on by PTSD. Regardless, without spilling too much, get a hold of the director's cut(or original UK version). It's the most moving, powerful and leaves you with a feeling of infinitely pleasing emptiness and an insolvable wonderful mystery."

That's the way it should be watched. <br/><br/>The Directing is very well done and the acting excellent.

","I really don't understand how some people can say this is such a great horror movie, and no, it's not because I'm a mindless teenager who only loves movies with lots of gore. ""The Exorcist"" is a prime example of a good horror movie, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""SAW"" aren't bad, either.<br/><br/>Many people say the reason some don't like this movie is because it causes them to think...that's ridiculous. What's there to think about!? The only question is whether or not the monsters are real, and that's not much. How does an intriguing ending make up for an entire movie? None of the characters are likable. Their ""friendly banter"" in the cabin is boring, it doesn't show us how close they are. Supposedly, this trip is supposed to make Sara feel better...so why doesn't she know any of these girls? It doesn't make any sense! Holly is stupid. Plain and simple. She's supposed to know how to do this, but instead she runs headfirst into a cave and breaks her leg. I was happy when she died.<br/><br/>Juno was a bitch. And flaky, as well.<br/><br/>Sara was absolutely the worst though. She was a completely wimp the ENTIRE time even though we're led to believe she ENJOYS doing this. Bats? Verrry scary. Maybe at first, but geez, calm down after awhile! Then she freaked out in the cave and almost got herself and the other girl killed. Then she MURDERED Juno at the end of the movie!!! There are no scares in this movie. The monsters are so-so, and the lighting is so bad you can't see what's going on half the time anyway. Even moments when something jumps out and is supposed to startle you, it's not the least bit frightening. This IS a horror movie, right??? I'm sorry, but this movie is a pathetic attempt at being a psychological thriller. Don't watch it. Don't waste your time."

","I wish I could give it a zero. This film was the pits. First of all, what was the ending supposed to tell us? Did the Beth character actually make it out, or was she just dreaming and she was stuck in the cave forever? Who knows. Second, the acting was pretty bad. Ultra transparent performances. I have seen better hemorrhoid ads on TV. Lastly, The director should be banned from making movies in the future. This rag was almost as bad as ""Cabin Fever"", and that was pretty bad. True horror films scare the audience. This thing bored me. Isolation can be a terrifying element (Like the movie Alien) and fear of the unknown can make or break a film. The only thing that scares me about this celluloid crap fest is having to watch it again!"

","This movie sucked, big time. My walk from the parking lot to the theater would have made a better movie. This movie was severely disappointing considering it came from the same creators of Saw and Hostel. I cannot say one good thing about this film. The acting was just plain awful. The first hour of the film alone seems to be about nothing more than a bunch of Scottish chicks getting together for beers and a cave exploring expedition. The first sign of anything remotely ""horror"" didn't happen until the last 40 minutes. Even then, it was weak. The events leading up to the ""horror"" part were weak and pointless. The ending...don't even bother to stay for the ending. Nothing about this film was worth any of my time. I wouldn't just give this movie a thumbs down, I would cut both my thumbs off and throw them at the movie screen."

This run of the mill movie contains cliché after cliché, though this critic said, ""still far better than most of the cliché-ridden dreck that passes for horror"", so I'm thinking either someone close to the production is spooning with these critics, or I'm not sure, because this horror movie drained the plot from three similar movies that previously came out. I'm not going to jog my memory to recycle the structure or antics of the characters with in the plot, but let me tell you, nothing UNIQUE, INSPIRED, or NOTEWORTHY comes from this boring and easily produced horror flick.

"tenten76","10","6","12","14 July 2005"," It may be new, but it's one of the finest horror films ever.
","A fast, jolting setup.. character introductions & conversations that felt quite natural.. fantastically well-done caving.. nasty monsters and nasty things happening.. and a brilliant ending.<br/><br/>You need anything else? How about six good unknown actresses who feel like individual characters without any one being over the top. How about some devilishly good scares underground, with camera pans and lighting reveals that DON'T just turn out to be a cat or a loud noise. How about great gore without noticeable CGI. How about feral monsters that are just plain scary (not indestructible or supernatural, but like a very scary wild animal). How about really effective tension generated through the danger and claustrophobia of caving, before we even get to the nastiness.<br/><br/>Sure, we know who's going to be left at the end of the film from about 90 seconds into the film (because of the characters), but it's not a problem - and the ending still delivers in spades. There's only one moment where I had to laugh at something that was 'over-the-top'. Script-wise I don't recall a single line out place, and not one ""come and get me, MF"" or ""We're gonna need a bigger boat"" sort of cliché.<br/><br/>Although its no-nonsense British charm means that it does stand apart from classics like ""TCM"" or ""The Thing"", it IS up to the same quality, and is undoubtedly one of the finest horror films ever. Bravo."
"poolandrews","7","6","12","10 July 2005"," 'Chicks with picks.' Better than I expected but it ain't perfect...
","The Descent opens with three friends, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) & Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) white water rafting down some very British looking river. Sarah while on her way home with her husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) & young daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) is involved in a road accident in which she is the only survivor. It's now 'One Year Later' & the girls are planning another adventure outing & meet up together in the heart of an American mountain range. They are joined by three more women, the annoying Holly (Nora-Jane No one), Beth (Alex Reid) & Sam (MyAnna Buring) who all set off for some underground caverns. Once they arrive they enter via a large hole in the ground, the only way out is to negotiate the passageways & tunnels. In traditional horror film style they quickly become lost & after a cave-in stuck, Juno admits she has brought them to the wrong cave system & one that is unexplored, furthermore she doesn't have a clue how to get out. As they venture deeper & further into the caverns panic & arguing sets in amongst the group, to make matters even worse they are not the only living creatures down there as they have to contend with flesh eating human like monsters...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Neil Marshall this UK production has me in two minds. On the one hand I thought certain aspects were better than I expected, while at other times I was disappointed. The script by Marshall, who made another British horror film called Dog Soldiers (2002) which I much prefer, takes what seemed like an eternity to get going & introduce the 'Crawlers'. I couldn't check my watch because I saw it in a cinema but it felt like well over 40 minutes before they showed up, to be fair when they do & The Descent kicks into straight horror then it's top-notch for the rest of it's running time. Until this point The Descent has virtually no horror elements at all, in fact it plays like a disaster film as they become trapped & try to figure a way out, I just can't get over how slow & uneventful this opening 30 plus minutes are. There was always a foreboding atmosphere that this was all building up to something but I went from excited expectation to desperate hope that something, anything that even resembles horror would pop up soon. I hated how Sarah's character suddenly became the female Arnold Schwarzenegger & kicked, punched, outrun, out-thought, stabbed, killed & poked eyes out as these 'Crawlers' couldn't even scratch her! Having said that the end slightly redeems itself. Also prepare to sit through a dark film, very dark. I mean dark as sometimes the screen is almost completely black & it's virtually impossible to see what's happening & bear in mind I saw it on a huge cinema screen. One cramped cave tunnel looks much like any-other so it is sometimes difficult to grasp just where everyone is in relation to everyone else & the location offers little variety. On the positive side, which there are many, Marshall creates some wonderfully atmospheric sequences in particular a scene when Sarah is stuck in a small tunnel which has to be one of the most tension filled & unnerving scenes in a horror film in the past few years. The caverns provide a real feeling of isolation which Marshall uses to his advantage. There are some real genuine scares here as well, I saw it with an audience in a cinema & there were some strong reactions to certain bits. I think we all liked the scene when Marshall first introduces a 'Crawler' via the infra red on a camcorder, you'll know when you see it. There are reasonable amounts of gore but they don't really kick in until the 'Crawlers' show up & they consist mainly of blood spurting & bites although there is a scene where someone's bone is sticking out through their skin, someone has a pick axe stuck through their throat & a cave full of bloody body parts & bones. The special effect are very good & thankfully it doesn't rely on awful CGI for which The Descent deserves another star at least. The 'Crawlers' themselves look a bit cheap at times & just like thin humans really & look almost exactly like Gollum from the Lord of the Ring (2001 - 2003) films. The acting is strong throughout & it was an interesting decision to have an entirely female cast & not a single male except Paul who dies within the first few minutes. Technically The Descent is fine but as I've mentioned the cinematography is somewhat dark & the cave setting became a little dull after a while. Overall I liked The Descent & I think most of the audience I watched it with did too, but unfortunately I just can't stop thinking about that painfully slow opening 30-40 minutes & I don't think I would be in any hurry to watch it again any time soon because of this. Oh, & the aerial shots of the U.S.A. mountain range don't match the ground shots which were filmed in Scotland I believe as the trees are completely different. I think The Descent is a very good horror film but not a brilliant one, but when all said & done I definitely think it's well worth watching so what are you waiting for?"

","I don't quite understand the hype. Just watched it, finally, and had many expectations given a 7.3 rating here. To me, it wasn't outstanding or remarkable in any sense. The characters were mostly annoying. The movie was longer than it needed to be, and the scenes establishing the core group of women were too long and unnecessary. It was visually hard to watch due to darkness, abruptness, etc. After the threat was established, it was very repetitive (and repetitively gruesome). We saw the same fight and kill scenes over .... and over ...., and over. How many times do we need to see someone almost get eaten? How many different ways do we need to see creatures get killed? It was a gore-fest for sure, but that's not a positive attribute in my book. I guessed at the beginning that Juno was cheating with Sarah's husband, and even if you didn't, the movie certainly provided enough hints prior to this ""revelation."" Given the betrayal, I expected Juno's poetic end. The fooled-you ending was okay, but at that point, I didn't much care what happened.<br/><br/>Note: I realized I happened to watch the unrated version. I can't speak for the content of any other versions, but I imagine the gore factor might have been somewhat lighter."

The most tense I got was hoping a large boulder would drop down and squash the lot of them in one go thus ending this film after 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I also found myself wanting to write down many questions on post-it notes about how contrived the plot was, What did the scene at the start have to do with the film? Why would they crawl through tiny holes of unexplored caves not knowing where they were going? Why did one character stab her friend accidentally then leave her for dead? Why did the other character then stab this character in the leg and leave her to fend of the weird creatures? A very strange film with some brash attempts at scares, mainly through sudden images and loud bangs.<br/><br/>In summary I was left feeling like this is one of, if not the worst film I have had the displeasure of viewing, I would avoid like the plague, otherwise you will just be disappointed, like the promise of a nice shiny biscuit tin, only to find there are no biscuits in it.

","I'm amazed that this film is getting so many high reviews, particularly as it rips off so many horror films that have gone before. For example...the the ominous heartbeart sound...ripped off from John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". The scene in the hospital where she's running down the corridor...Hellraiser anyone? Then the ""monsters"" themselves are a complete rip off of the mentally unbalanced guy in the British horror ""Creep"". If you've seen this film you'll see what I mean. Well if you find a guy prancing around with a bit of make-up and really bad choppy editing so you can hardly see what's happening scary, good for you.<br/><br/>The actresses were great to be fair, I just feel that nothing inventive was done much here. <br/><br/>My advice, if you want a real scary horror, go and see one of the Asian horrors like ""Cello"", ""The Shutter"", ""Ju-on"" or for real suspense ""The Thing"". This is a ""jumpy"" film in the style of ""I know what you did last summer"" and all those type of films. It is not scary or a horror, I would describe it more as a slightly suspenseful thriller.

"snow0r","8","7","15","5 April 2007"," Slow to start but worth the wait
","The Descent is the tale of a group of girls who go caving. Naturally, things aren't quite what they seem, and things start to go very wrong very quickly. The first section of the film aims to provide us with some background, some character development, so that we can differentiate between the girls later, when they're alone in the dark. As a result, impaling aside, this section's quite slow and drags on a bit. Once they go caving and the film properly starts though, it gets a lot more exciting. The scares are well paced, and they're effective even when it's pretty obvious that they're coming up; credit to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the caves for this. A lot of the film is without music, the silence truly eerie, and the lighting is also very effective. The use of headlamps and night-vision in certain sections makes sudden movement almost impossible to track and therefore quite scary. Nonetheless, it's still a little slow until the ego's take over underground. As the girls argue, they are being tracked by something that's been living in the cave and is none too pleased with their intrusion. Being stalked underground by a highly developed hunter is quite a freaky premise, and as a result you're left in a perpetual state of unease for the rest of the film as it turns from a girls night out into an underground zombie movie. This is a good thing, and it rattles along at a high pace for the second half, which makes The Descent tense, uncomfortable but ultimately enjoyable viewing. Worth it!"

","I've seen lots and lots of horror movies and I must admit, this one stands above all I've seen in the past 2 years. I mean in theaters, of course. Not only because it freaks you out -- and believe me, it does -- but because the story is simple and pretty easy to follow too: a bunch of women going to a cave expedition, seeking some adventure.. but the adventure turns out real bad. It has some simplicity to it, which I find somewhat refreshing after all these weird esoteric and complicated horror flicks we see these days. Not that I don't enjoy creepy angry ghosts returning from the afterlife with a thirst for vengeance because what's-their-names did horrible things to them in the past, but sometimes it's nice to just sit back and enjoy the show without having to figure things out too much. Sure, there's somewhat of a mystery to it -- up until we see those creepy creatures following our girls. After that, it's just blood, jump-out-of-your-seat moments... and then some more blood. And lots of fighting, of course. Either kill or be killed.<br/><br/>As for the visual effects, this movie is very good when it comes to conjuring realistic caves: full of large chasms and pretty narrow holes (eeeeck!!), it's dark, it's huge, it's real. And not only the creatures are surprisingly efficient and well done, without this odd 3D feel we often get when it comes to this kind of fictitious beasts, but the actresses are pretty convincing too. And, far more importantly (to me at least), they avoid being simple caricatures who exist solely to be slaughtered.<br/><br/>If you have a strong stomach, and if you enjoy gory movies, I strongly recommend you to watch it."

That fact is really taking away the suspense. <br/><br/>The predators reminded me the reapers from Blade 2. They add what u need to produce an average horror movie.

","This film is truly awful. It starts promisingly and the initial pot-holing scenes are very good and uncomfortably claustrophobic. Unfortunately it goes downhill almost immediately and doesn't stop until it has reached rock, rock bottom. The feeling of genuine claustrophobia is soon replaced with boring repetitive violence and scenes so full of clichés that many members of the audience, including myself, were unable to stifle their laughter. Realism goes out of the window, the script follows, and the whole thing grinds on until it reaches an unimaginative 'climax'. It is however mercifully short, which makes it a 2 rather than a 1."
"george.schmidt","10","5","10","8 August 2006"," The scariest and best horror film of the year - and IN YEARS!!!
","THE DESCENT (2006) **** Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Jackson Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, Nora-Jane No one, Oliver Milburn, Olly Kayll. Affectively excellent creep-out horror film  the best of the year and IN YEARS!  that will do for cave spelunking what ""Psycho"" did for showering. The simple enough premise  six healthy, young friends (all women), go on an adventure in the woods and uncover an unholy nest of 'crawlers', bat- like monstrosities with a nasty habit of devouring human flesh!  gets a vita adrenaline rush thanks to the shrewdly dispatched delivery by filmmaker Neil Marshall causing claustrophobia to no unnerving end. Macdonald comes across as the second coming of Sigourney Weaver with her stoic survivor's strength and triumphant will to take on anything. Buckets of blood, visceral gore and stomach-churning dread with genuinely shocking moments of thrills, pure horror and a giddy-head-rush in the simple thanks that you aren't on screen facing your worst fears. Cheers to the diabolically talented make-up by Tanya Lodge's crew and the canny production design by Simon Bowles are complemented by sturdy cinematography by Sam McCurdy. Echoes of Craven, Raimi and Romero with nods to ""Deliverance"", ""Carrie"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" yet ultimately an original, knotty design altogether."

","This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was badly written and a horrible plot line! Whoever made this movie should be shot. There was no character development before the girls all entered the cave, and who would be stupid enough to enter a cave that isn't on any maps? I hated the ending. There were obvious give aways to the fact that she hadn't escaped the cave and the creatures were simply ugly. The bitch fights were so obviously faked and it was annoying to watch. Overall, the movie was very dull and annoying. Nothing like that would ever happen. The best part of the movie was the credits. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! Unless you want to be scarred."

","I seem to be in the minority here, but I thought this film was a complete disappointment when compared to ""Dog Soldiers"". Others have given an overview of the plot, which I won't repeat, and the film does have a few spectacular moments.<br/><br/>However, I never felt that ""engaged"" with any of the characters, and as such found it difficult to care that much as the body count grew. Maybe this is partly a bloke thing - since the cast is virtually all women, and character development does not seem to have high on the priority list, I found it difficult to get that concerned with the fate of any particular actor.<br/><br/>The special effects are OK, but by now my mind was wondering about all the logical inconsistencies in the plot, and the premise of the situation the actors have to confront.<br/><br/>There's also the problem of the set - although I guess the intention was to recreate the claustrophobia of the confines of the caves, in practice I felt that after a while this just gave the film a one-dimensional appearance.<br/><br/>Although there are frequent references to other movies during the film, and I guess spotting them all would be vaguely amusing, in order to play that card this would need to be a better film.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing it, but it's one of those films in my opinion will soon be buried without trace, which is disappointing."

You can clearly see that the actresses are very unexperienced and really some of them reminded me of cheap B movies no longer produced (i thought so until i saw this movie). Not only that, the whole plot is really not very interesting because you know what will happen right from the start. Yes I was a bit scared off once or twice in the middle of the film, but other than that this movie is not nearly good enough to represent its genre in a prominent way and certainly not good enough to deserve an average of 7.5.

","I watched the UK version and heard that the ending was much different for the US version. They took out a crucial part of the symbolism of the movie. Sarah ending up in the cave by herself with nothing to live for but the memories of her children was a reprsentation of her life after the accident at the beginning when she lost her family. She no longer felt like she could relate to the outside world and real life. The more I think about it, the more I realize the movie was all about her and how she has to live her life fighting demons that haunt her from the terrible accident and how it is nearly impossible to relate to people in the outside world. By cutting that part at the end and making her escape real instead of a temporary dream, it defeats the symbolism, the development of Sarah's character, and in a way the whole point of the movie and turns it into just another Hollywood thriller. As fond as I am of the movie in its UK version (8/10), I would give the US version a 4 out of 10."

"biba_yu","10","8","19","5 December 2005"," One of the best horror movies I saw recently!
","When someone told me the story of Descent, I though ""Oh yeah, just another stupid movie about a bunch of stunning college girls in revealing clothes trapped by accident somewhere in nowhere and being chased by bunch of freaking monsters, then slaughtered one by one in horrible ways but not before we see most of their perfect bodies."" Surprise, surprise, it's not like that at all. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised to see that movie was British, and since I have a big respect for British cinematography it was actually a good sign for me. Second surprise: it is actually scary! And it's done very well, very professional direction, great script, great actors and genuine scares. Women (not girls!) in the movie are beautiful though, but not in a pin up way. What hit me most is the many ways story could be interpreted. I can not describe those ways of interpretation here, because that would contain a lot of spoilers, but it's fascinating how many details in movie have symbolic meaning and how their interpretation, which depends on the viewer, can affect the whole plot and the way we see the story. Even without surreal horror elements in The Descent, the movie would be scary because of all that claustrophobic setting that is offered. Just the thought of being trapped 2 miles in the underground cave with possibility of never seeing sunlight again is scary enough for me. And the whole expedition into the caves looks genuine enough for me to believe. Characters are also great, well developed, though uneven. It's quite clear that some of them are more in focus, more developed than the others. Even so, the Descent is great horror movie."

The acting is not definitely okay: the girls look terrified and the next second they have a ""Rambo-face"", ready to kill and eat their enemies' hearts alive.
I understand, it was 2005, but CGI in a scene with bats is so funny that I was literally crying. Caves don't look so good and in some scenes I thought that it was a videogame back from 2002.
Creatures are not scary at all, they're not so dangerous, their nature wasn't shown or explained enough to get interested.
I'm not sure that I was quite emphatic for at least one character. They're all boring and not catchy.

But apart from all this the Descent contains something that every horror film should utilize- a good screenplay and characters one can relate to/side with.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","3","5","4 December 2016"," very nearly gave me a panic attack
","Don't watch Neil Marshall's The Descent if you suffer from claustrophobia. Just don't. This film does for caves what Alien did for derelict space stations and what The Ring did for videotapes. Cleverly combining close quarters panic, the gnawing fear of losing your way in a near infinite set of tunnels and some visceral, throat ripping terror, it's one horror package that will leave you reeling. I believe this is the one that put Marshall on the map, and since then he's been doing mostly medieval style action adventure (he helmed the pilot for Game Of Thrones). This is his first, and most effective outing in a really solid career. The premise is simple: a group of girls decide to go on an excursion deep within a cave system in Eastern Europe. They run into a string of bad luck though, as they first find themselves hopelessly, sickeningly lost. Then the real fun begins as they realize they're not alone down there, and that something is hunting them. Terrifying subterranean creatures emerge like Gollum on bathsalts, fast, wiry, agile terrors from the deep that know the system inside out and prey on these poor girls one by one. Once they show up its a chaotic bloody free for all that will shred your nerves, but I almost found everything leading up to that even more scary. The slow buildup where they realize they are just so lost and may be stuck down there forever just puts a knot in your stomach and instills a hopeless dread that can't really be equalled by any monster or gory scene. Still, those things are pretty gnarly and provide more than a few wicked scares, especially when the girls first catch fleeting glimpses of them around corners and between cracks, dismissing them as tricks of the light. Marshall also employs cunning narrative tricks to perpetuate the lack of any kind of way out, one in particular that just curdles the blood in its ruthless, resolute sense of doom. The scariest film you will ever see set in a cave, and one of the premier fright fests ever made."

The only thing that lets this film down (for me) is the cave monsters who, as is often the case (Looking at you, Jaws) are infinitely scarier before they are shown on screen. Oh and also the sequel, this film doesn't need a sequel the original ending is brilliant. I won't say much else about it other than watch it, horror fans will not be disappointed, and there is enough thriller in there for people who are new to the genre."

","The Descent: six women enter, one woman leaves.<br/><br/>A year after her husband and daughter die in a traffic accident, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and five of her friends (Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, MylAnna Buring, Saskia Mulder, Nora-Jane No one) meet up in the Appalachian Mountains. After a slumber-party-esque night in a rustic cabin, they go cave-diving. They journey into the cave system only to be caught in a cave-in, blocking off the way that they came. It turns out that this is not the cave system that they thought it was; Juno (Natalie Mendoza) took them to an uncharted cave system so that they could explore it together. That means, however, that nobody will know where they are to rescue them. Their only hope is to find a second entrance (shown in a primitive-looking cave painting) before whoever - or whatever - it is that they hear following them catches up.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" had the makings for an excellent psychological horror film. The direction was exquisitely claustrophobic, closing the audience into the cramped tunnels along with the protagonists. The general, although not entirely absent, background music engrosses the viewer in every unnatural echo permeating the cave system. Early in the film, the protagonists list off the dangers of prolonged stays underground, among which are visual and auditory hallucinations. Had the movie progressed in the way that it had started - with six strong, yet understandably frightened women, trapped in an uncharted cave-system, suffering from what could only logically be panic-induced hallucinations - the movie would have been an excellent addition to the horror genre. It would be notable if only for its bold decision to include an all-female cast (admirably acted by a more than capable cast).<br/><br/>Then the mole people attacked.<br/><br/>The fact that there was a monster at all was a massive disappointment, but that they were little more than stereotypical, blind, cannibalistic cave-dwellers was an insult. All of the suspense, all of the psychological tension and interesting character development was destroyed the second that the real antagonist was introduced. It wasn't their paranoia or underlying interpersonal issues that threatened their lives, but mole people.<br/><br/>For the life of me I can't understand the positive critical response that it received, given how ultimately disappointing the film ended up being. Fans of suspenseful, psychological horror will enjoy the first half of the film while fans of hack-n-slash monster films will enjoy the second half. Feminists will enjoy the fact that the film has an all female cast, given how male-dominated the industry tends to be. It's hard to imagine an audience for the entire film, as it is never realized as a cohesive whole."

","... But given that I like the horror genre, let me complain a little.<br/><br/>It don't make no sense that a film like this gets a 7.4 average rating when there are other films that are far better with lesser scores. I would have expected a 4 or a 5.<br/><br/>So lets see, the caves were realistic. The plot didn't really matter because you were there to see people trapped in caves with monsters. They did remind me of the LotR Gollum character, but thankfully weren't so comical. The initial vague images were nice.<br/><br/>I felt creepy from being trapped, yes my palms sweat. They did that good. But the acting was only as tolerable as a typical teen slash movie, and the ass-kicking was just plain dumb. I really wish movie makers (even the ones outside of Hollywood) would get away from this notion that you have to eventually empower the audience for them to be satisfied. I mean, jeez, everybody wants to be Rambo! C'mon!<br/><br/>So why did the film get a weirdly even across-the-subpopulations census?<br/><br/>This is a booby film, and that brought my score down from a 6 or 8. Let me repeat this: I'm a big gay guy who wishes they'd make films like this with big strapping hunks (not those pretty boys that seem to be the stars in all films now) in skimpy shorts and tank tops, all sweaty and hairy, trapped together, underground, all of whom cannot act. Heck, I'd give it a 10 if it had the right guys!<br/><br/>And rightly so, I've lowered my vote to a reasonable 3. I am resisting trying to counter- balance the straight guy's vote by giving it a 1 because it deserves a better score for effort. Go put Bill Goldberg and some other equally strapping hunks in a film like this, no chicks to fight over, and I'll give it two thumbs up like everyone else, okay?"

","I'm mystified by the success of this film and the accolades it is getting. To me, it represents all that is wrong with modern British horror films, and all that is horrible about the way society has gone as a whole. The Descent is a dark, relentlessly unpleasant, foul-mouthed, deliberately disturbing film, just as the director's Dog Soldiers was. Is this really the thing we want to see when we slip into the cinema to escape the harsh realities of the world? British horror films, particularly in the 1970s, used to have style, wit, charm, sexiness, all couched in a peculiarly British style. See Assault, And Soon The Darkness, The Corpse or Fright. But films like this one, along with Creep, Shaun Of The Dead, Severance and the aforementioned Dog Soldiers only give us endless swearing, dysfunctional human beings, claustrophobic scenarios and nasty asides. Such a shame."
"come2whereimfrom","Null","3","5","2 October 2005"," not even half de(s)cent.
","The descent: I'm afraid (not of the film) but of the fact that this wasn't even half de(s)cent. What starts as a normal low budget British horror soon turns in to a low budget British horror with American sensibilities. The main character starts off as a gibbering widow who also lost her baby in the same accident as her husband and ends up like a cross between Bruce Willis in die-hard and Carrie. From a middle-aged schoolteacher (or whatever she is) who is rubbish at pot holing to a blood-soaked, axe-wielding monster slayer who is f-ing ace at everything. It is just a little too much. Sure enough when the film starts and these six friends (shame it wasn't the cast of friends!) go underground into what they all believe is a series of easy climbs, it's o.k. a little boring but o.k. Except one of the party has taken them somewhere no one has ever been before, a series of uncharted caves. Then as the unsuspecting team lower themselves in to smaller and smaller caves and tunnels the tension starts to build. Thing is it's still not scary, I guess if you are claustrophobic then you might be breathing a little heavier than everyone else but only in the same way that someone with a fear of clowns might not particularly enjoy 'bobo's big top adventure with the clown quartet'. The jumps are there but obvious and despite the fact your in a dark cave you can see them a mile off. It is only when the monsters arrive that it really gets silly, they look like a reunion of Gollum's family tree complete with mad uncle and aunt. The thing that lets these creatures down is that they apparently have adapted to hunt like bats using only sound now if you can get around a dark cave in complete silence let me know. At one point our heroine has a flaming torch that the monsters can't see even though it makes more noise than all six screaming women put together. From the outset of this expedition gone wrong it's a race to find a way out before the creatures get them and that's it. There is a sub-plot about one of the girls having a bit with one of the others husband but it's so thin it's almost as transparent as the monsters skin tissue. Before seeing this film I was expecting a kind of Blair Witch/Most Haunted vibe with cameras on green night-vision and fuzzy screens in the atmospheric underground. What we got was a poor excuse for a gore-fest in a cave. Empire gave this film 5 stars, well if that's what a leading film magazine thinks of this p#ss-poor pot holing parody then I'm sorry but I won't be able to trust their judgement on anything ever again."

But this still has some of the oldest horror clichés such as the cast (all women) delve deeper into the unknown caverns they are exploring instead of retreating (but this is just an excuse to get some victims for the movie), because of this it's great when they meet the creatures lurking in the darkness. The gore is great and the creatures fascinated me.<br/><br/>This wasn't scary but it's a good way to pass 90 mins and most horror fans will love it."

","How did this get 7.4/10? I just don't know. How did this win awards for the best horror? I just don't know. And why do people think this is scary? I just don't know.<br/><br/>This movie was very bad. A group of friends and I decided to hire this out on night, hoping to find a scary movie, but boy, were we disappointed.<br/><br/>It starts out all right with a car crash, which is more ""thrilling"" than ""scary"". It's about 20 or 30 minutes in when the girls start their caving adventure and that's when I wondered when we would start seeing the horror. Ten minutes later and I was still waiting. Another 10 minutes passed. It was 50 Minutes into the movie when the first zombie (or whatever it was) appeared. For the previous 30 minutes or so, all that you see is the same thing over and over. The girls caving. They are stuck somewhere or something and are trying to make their way through or something. To be honest I wasn't paying to much attention because it bored me to death, watching a rather normal caving expedition for half an hour. It's a horror movie, not a caving documentary! But as I said, after 50 minutes the first zombie finally appeared. It gave me a little fright at first and it was there that I hoped this movie was going to turn around. But it wasn't to be. They started to attack the girls and chase them etc., but this was not one bit scary because you couldn't even make out what was happening. Every fight scene was fast pitched and it was dark. You could pretty much only see 2 blurs struggling with each other. That's not scary.<br/><br/>Eventually the girls start turning on each other. They start beating each other with whatever equipment they have, whilst the zombies continue to attack them. This continues for the remainder of the movie. I won't say what happens at the end, in case you want to watch it. But really I cannot see how you would want to.<br/><br/>Overall the acting wasn't too bad, but apart from that this movie was completely terrible. So if you want to watch a good horror movie, do not get this. If you want something to laugh at because it is so bad. Do not get this. It is so bad there is nothing to laugh at. It breaks down to this; do not buy, rent or even look at this movie. It is a waste of time."

This is where the film gained one of it's stars. Certainly, there was one moment of suspense I recall, but it was totally ruined by<br/><br/>2. The crap monster things. Albino flesh eaters? Surely you can't go wrong. Actually you can, by making them out of a not very convincing suit and a group of people from the worst acting school around. Or maybe the gutter. Who knows?<br/><br/>3. The lighting. It's a cave, so it's dark. Great. No complaints here. 1 star.<br/><br/>4. The actors. From the Carmen Electra school of horror acting. Doesn't matter if you can't act love, just try to look pretty. Sadly, some of them fail at this as well. <br/><br/>5. The plot. I can't quite work this one out. There's a gang of women, and they go caving....then they get attacked by monsters that weren't explained at all....no, I'm still at a loss I'm afraid.<br/><br/>6. The ""scares"". I admit it, I jumped once. one of them accidentally kills another one. However, this seemingly good scare is then thrown into utter confusion by the remaining women not trusting the one who ACCIDENTALLY killed her friend. It was a clear accident, the friend crept up on her when they were under attack. Frankly she deserved to die. Otherwise, minimum. As I've said, bad monsters make for no scares.<br/><br/>7. The weird ending....I can't figure THIS one out either. She escapes.....gets to the jeep.....gets in, and the woman who was accidentally killed is there. Bang, it was a dream and she's still in the cave. Fair enough. However then it get's even weirder, with the one survivor looking up and seeing her daughter with a cake....there's no sudden push to get out for the daughter after this, in case you were thinking that, no, the film just ends.... (ADDENDUM) I remembered why there was no push. The daughter was already dead, which in fact makes me even MORE confused (and bored) by this scene.<br/><br/>I was left thinking ""What the hell was that?"" after I saw this, and waited for the reviews trashing it. Only none came....Most critics loved it, meaning that most critics were on acid when they watched this god-awful piece of schlock."
"keith96778","2","4","8","6 August 2006"," Monsters in a hole. *SPOILERS GALORE*
","This is the most overrated movie to crack an IMDb 5.0 in quite some time. The only ""twist"" in this movie is the undistinguished cast of interchangeable thirty-something females, which, incidentally, renders an uninspired performance overall. So far as I can tell, the only reason this abomination is receiving attention is because of the novelty of the casting. If dancing bears had been cast instead of women, it wouldn't have been worse and some of the monotony might have been lightened up by some deft hoofing. <br/><br/>There seems to be no real point to the death of Sarah's husband and child in the first few minutes of the movie. So it works well with the rest of the film, which is similarly pointless. There is no real character development. The ladies are initially portrayed as a band of devil-may- care adventuresses engaged in madcap adolescent camaraderie, but they have no personalities to go along with the frequently unintelligible accents. At then end, you will ask yourself ""Who were those people?"" and you will answer back to yourself, ""I don't care.""<br/><br/>And it really doesn't matter who they are or were. The the movie is about a bunch of nitwits that go into a hole in the ground and get chased by monsters before one lone survivor escapes into the daylight. *yawn* They aren't even real monsters. They're just people wearing a few layers of cheap latex who do their best to sneer and squeak and gurgle and mug for the camera. It's blatant camera abuse.<br/><br/>There is no real suspense or sense of surprise. The explorers are in a hole full of monsters that are trying to eat them. The explorers are trying to find a way out before they get eaten.<br/><br/>They should have just called this movie ""Monsters in a Hole"" and been done with it. At least the audience could have left the theater wondering who the monsters where--- the hungry blind latex albinos or the mean old ladies who disturbed their tranquil existence. <br/><br/>I give it two stars because I think they used a pretty high quality of latex on the monsters. More like they wasted it, actually. Well, that's okay, I'll stick with two stars anyway."

","Okay, I just saw it and I'm going to be righteous and indignant...<br/><br/>When sexy British spelunkers go out to the Appalachians to find a new cave system something 'gosh' goes awry. The main character (by main I don't mean most well developed and fleshed out character who drives the movie, instead I mean the survivor no one really cares about or knows) causes a cave-in, and they must now fight against a really lame Nosferatu/Gullom-esquire bunch of Chud rip-offs.<br/><br/>And of course, they die in succession, whoever died in what order I don't know since I didn't care about a single one of the sexy wannabe tomb-raiders.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT CHEAP SCARES!!! The usual false sense of security and then bam, something quick happens. Then they get down into the dark to where you can't really see what's going on.<br/><br/>Moving on in the fill in the blanks, mad lib style of film-making comes in full force the crazy woman who becomes like one of the cave dwellers and slays enough to get the mandatory gore level required for an R-rating (and I'll bet there's gonna be an NC-17 version too, with 30 extra seconds of someone getting hacked.) Then, the sole survivor finds a way out (and stabbing someone who ACCIDENTALLY killed someone, leaving her to fend for herself)And we then realize she went in a huge circle since the cars they left ARE RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF HER WHEN SHE GETS OUT OF THE SECOND CAVE!!!! Also, really weird that these cave people are so close to the county roads. You'd figure some hick would find them.<br/><br/>So, in my professional opinion, don't watch this movie, in fact don't watch any horror movie made after 'Silence of the Lambs,' well, maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe 'Candyman'. It's a fact, Hollywood will never make horror movies like they used to. All they're doing right now is remaking old horror movies and its wearing thin. C'mon, the Hills have eyes? House of Wax? The originals weren't all that great but they were at least better made than glossy cash-in remakes!!!! One day Hollywood, there's gonna be a revloution and you will not be spared!"

","I am genuinely mystified as to why this movie draws such high ratings. I'm also really annoyed with people who just carelessly give a movie a ""10"" rating, as if this movie is Citizen Kane. Come ON, people, show some friggin' sense of proportion, will you?!<br/><br/>There's nothing remotely original about The Descent. The cheesy shock effects are the same as in every other horror movie, and can be seen coming a mile away. The premise is essentially exactly like all those underwater movies with a monster, combined with those backwood flicks about monstrously inbred hicks. Here we have some cavemen who never got out of the caves and evolved to live underground (when we saw the first one, I yelled ""It's Gollum!!""). This is in North America. Which wasn't populated by humans until the Native Americans crossed the Bering Strait some ten or twelve thousand years ago. There were never any actual cavemen in North America. So this part doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>And the crawlers' not being about to hear or smell the girls when standing right next to them, or even stepping on them?! That was idiotic.<br/><br/>Not much else in the film makes sense, either. Why do Sarah's husband and daughter die in the beginning if not to make this a story about Sarah overcoming that trauma? But no, this is cynical European ""realism"", so nobody survives (in the original ending).<br/><br/>And poor beautiful Juno, who had an affair with Sarah's husband - and not just some casual thing but a deeply held love -, still loved Sarah and wanted to strengthen their friendship. But, noooo, the movie sends the message that Juno is an awful person who deserves to die for her heinous crimes. Shyeah right. How moronic.<br/><br/>And the six women. Hardly any character development at all. Hardly any sexy elements at all. With the introduction of Holly, the short-haired base jumper with an attitude, presented as ""Juno's... protegé"", wink-wink, I was sure this was supposed to be a lesbian thing, but apparently it was nothing of the sort. As someone else said, no sleaze factor at all. It was played straight all the way. Another sign of pretentiousness. The characters were extremely hard to tell apart. Two of them were sisters, but I'll be buggered if I can remember who. Juno and Sam were good-looking; the rest were nothing particular to look at.<br/><br/>Juno and Sarah made cool action chicks in the fight scenes towards the end, though. And the studio sets made for a very convincing and natural-looking cave system. But that's really the only good things I have to say about this movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."
"davlieu","3","4","8","30 July 2006"," Probably the worst horror movie I have seen...
","OK, I sat here to think of a worst horror movie... but have yet to come up with one. The characters in here are soooooo stupid. This movie falls into the category of horror movies where the characters put themselves in that situation. I was more annoyed then I was scared. From the first 15 minutes of the movie, I thought that this was going to be an awesome scare. However, after I couldn't wait till the movie was over! I actually wanted all the characters to die because of how annoyed I was with them. I just looked up the rating for Ring 1 (American) on IMDb, and I can't believe this movie got a higher rating than that. Ring 1 was actually scary, this was not. At most, it was a little jumpy."
"maxxx-1","3","4","8","6 May 2006"," Interesting for the first 15 minutes.
","This movie apparently can not decide what type of suspense and/or surprises to throw at the audience - and ends up throwing everything possible in a random sequence, and multiple times. Usually that would mean ""you never know what's going to happen"" - but not this time, sorry.<br/><br/>For the first several minutes, when the action still starts to build up - after the initial surprise, largely off-the-bat and failing to have any reasonable explanation for such a peculiar chain of events - it is interesting, creepy, claustrophobic, unsettling and even leaving some people that are not very fond of closed spaces a little short of breath. But then? Then the main attraction enters, and from that point the movie goes downwards. Every corner the same surprise. Every over-the-shoulder glance the same surprise. Every flickering of light the same surprise.<br/><br/>See, master Hitchcock brewed up a recipe for a good scary movie - start off with an earthquake and then start building the suspense. This movie's creators took a different turn: start off with pointless gore for a kick start and just keep it steady until the end. Too bad that after some time the constant suspense wears off - more enemies, even more enemies, oh, one more enemy, and how about yet one more for good measure, as in a badly paced video game.<br/><br/>All in all - if a movie has about three or four good jumper scares, but the audience starts chatting during the rest, making funny remarks ""where is the next enemy going to jump out from and how will they glare point-blank into the camera lens, as if could be scary twice"", it means failure at capturing and holding their attention.<br/><br/>Additionally, beware the Signs syndrome: this movie used most, if not all, of its good shots in the trailers.<br/><br/>Watch it only with a scaredy-cat girl you're trying to pick up, perhaps you'll get a few hugs. But don't count on more. From the movie, that is."

","Here it is, the film people unanimously have referred to as ""The best British horror-film"", ""the most intense...."", bla, bla, bla. It is so nice then to be the voice of blasphemy, assuring you that none of the praise mentioned above merits any kind of attention. Neil Marshalls previous outing, ""Dog Soldiers"", certainly wasn't anything to brag about either, and isn't it strange that this film which has been revered by so many folks, ultimately turns out to be such a disappointment? Not at all, for this little ""goodie"" is an annoying crowd-pleaser, and to please the dull and dumb mass, it is important that you make sure that it will fail to interest those with, what should I say, eclectic taste buds. When that is said, I'm painfully aware that I'm not living in a vacuum, and in the hunt for new and possibly interesting horror, I'm sadly forced to, now and then, to consult the reviews. Well, as so often is the case, bad, bad mistake! The film starts off well enough, with a fairly surprising car-accident. Nice burrowing there. And from then on, get prepared for a pack of intensely provoking,oh so tough, hags. From the get go, you can clearly see the talentlessness run amok here. The dialogue is clichéd, badly scripted, and on top of it all, you have six individuals better off serving coffee at a diner. Now and then, mainly in the more dramatic sequences, they tend to show a bit of worth in the ""believable, realistic-acting department"", but I tell you, for the most part, you have to deal with extremely irritating, non-stop, shallow and false dialogue( Notice especially the wonderful acting when they are heading towards the cave. Hilarious!) Of course, in any horror film you will want the cattle sent to the slaughter, but with these ""brave girls"" on board, I assure you, you will want to see their innards wrecked, the slaughter to commence in a split second. Characters the worth of cardboard( Particularly Rebecca with her mongoloid, thin voice!). And what about the legendary, breathtaking, claustrophobic intensity the film is supposed to convey?! Not present, naught, nil, zero. What about the cave-cannibals then? Fairly nice looks, but nothing more. Gore? Should have been more explicit. And yeah, before I forget, it seems that Mr. Marshall has contracted the Follywood disease that forces him to make his actors act all tough and make smart comments in the face of antropophagous terror. Vomit!! My two points go to the little amount of gore, and the little twist at the very end; nice to see that the happy escape was a flight of fancy. Hi, hi, hi!!!"

","I've never been one for adrenalin addiction action sports. If I had to pick one it probably wouldn't be pot-holing. One enthusiast explains the attraction: "". . . as much a psychological as well as a physical activity. You should be prepared to push the envelope as far as both your mind and body are concerned, but the rewards are endless. Try this exciting and challenging sport and you will see how it allows your imagination to run wild as it takes you to the brink of what is both challenging and mysterious."" I went to see this nasty little blood-soaked movie wondering whether I would thrill to find a genuinely new British horror innovation, or alternatively just enjoy a camp and less-than-scary diet of gore-fest. (Yes, sad as it is, I am a fan of horror movies.) The Descent turned out to be neither of the two main categories but, in its merciful 99 minutes, delivers a better share of shocks than most.<br/><br/>Six strong, capable women (one of them recovering from a traumatic bereavement) set off into the Appalachian Mountains for a pot-holing experience. They seem like regular, good looking and intelligent women, mostly with some pot-holing experience. Even before we go underground (especially if you've seen the trailer) the litany of psychological challenges are promising, as the self-appointed leader of the group lists claustrophobia, paranoia, and a host of other hurdles to jump.<br/><br/>The film has been expertly put together, however formulaically. There is the initial attention-grabbing horrific incident in the first few minutes, the type of female characters that are designed to appeal to women as well as men, skillful editing to make you drop your popcorn by letting you relax momentarily first (so the sudden shock is greater), a cutesy kid, very effective use of light and dark, monsters that have some 'reasonable' connection with their environment, and a reality factor from the interesting mechanics of climbing down into caves and how you cross seemingly impossible chasms. Once it gets under way, there is little or no pause for light relief. You make a prediction to yourself about how many if any will get out alive, then sit back and have the wits scared out of you.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Creep are valid - the storyline and mutants have some similarity, as do the pacing and denouement. Those to Deliverance and Aliens less so - those two were outstanding movies involving deep character development and masterly pacing - in category way beyond this Saturday-night shocker. But The Descent delivers on its promise of being very, very scary for the time you're in the cinema. You won't go home looking over your shoulder for monsters, but if you're easily unnerved you're probably better off not leaving home in the first place."

It's not, however, meant as a deep and thoughtful character study, it's strictly genre horror and as such is certainly bloodthirsty enough and contains a level of inventive killings and shocks to satisfy a fan of the genre.<br/><br/>I do feel that due to the director's decision to play it entirely straight as opposed to having an element of tongue-in-cheek means that the film won't be as re-watchable as Dog Soldiers was.<br/><br/>Still, beats the crap out of any of the predictable kiddy-horror Hollywood's been responsible for of late, and as such should be applauded.

This film brought two others to mind while I was watching it, Aliens and the Thing, these two movies set the bar when it comes to atmosphere, and this above all others is key to a great horror film. Neil Marshall seems to be a master of this, in an era when great horror films are tough to come by. From the very beginning this movie grabs you by your collar and doesn't let go. It seems to place right in the mix of everything that is happening, and emotion, what was the last horror film anyone has seen that had emotional attachment to its characters? As in Dog Soldiers, Mr. Marshall somehow builds a relationship with the characters without spending too much time doing so. So far in two films, Dog Soldiers (the best werewolf movie in my opinion), and the Descent (one of if not the best pure horror movie), Marshall has delivered sheer perfection. I applaud him in is efforts to show people how to make a great horror film, using real emotions and atmosphere, not just settling on the cheap ""jump"" thrills, though he mixes them in, its always at the perfect time and doesn't feel out of place. I could only hope that more film makers take a look at what hes done, and attempt to take some things from him.

","Top notch film, fully deserving the awards that it won. White knuckle horror movie from start to finish.

I consider myself a horror movie enthusiast, and have seen most of the classics, but none of them can touch this movie!! I think the scariest moment was the first closeup shot of the cave creatures, when the girls light up the flare and one of them is just standing behind her with his head cocked, shocking. The plot of the movie was really well thought out and the acting was also really well done by all of the actresses involved.

Not really a spoiler- but definitely subtle.<br/><br/>The monster were pretty cool, as well. They were still organic, not superhuman like Predator. I never thought about how vampires got their sexual reputation- when they go for the jugular, you have to get pretty close. Even when you are a nasty, pale, bat-like freak- you still have to hold the head just so, and fit your mouth around a chick's neck.<br/><br/>Undeniably a good movie!"

","Like ""Open Water"" and ""Blair Witch Project"", this is a movie that holds more in its setting than it does in the fear factor. ""The Descent"" isn't your typical screaming, jump-fest, it's a film that creates the situation more scary than the atmosphere. However, what makes a movie like this work is the constant feeling that something will in fact trigger that atmospheric feeling that every horror tries to manipulate onto the audience. And even though there are certain scenes that have you jump out of your seat, this is not an exercise in just how many surprises you can take. It's an exercise in how long you can have your hands squeezing the seat before it starts to hurt.<br/><br/>It is a movie that centers around Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her female friends who, every year, take a trip somewhere adventurous and explore. After Sarah's husband and child are tragically killed in a car accident, she suffers emotional pain but decides to bond again with her friends and do something fun to get her mind off of everything. This time, they decide to explore a deep cave. Of course, being a horror, the cave isn't really ordinary. In this cave, there are dead ends, rocks falling, bridges collapsing, deep holes, and-- oh yeah, mutated creatures. These deadly creatures hunger and without warning, eat the living flesh right off your body. Sarah and her friends must avoid all obstacles and reach the exit of the dark cave, before it's too late.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall, previously famous for ""Dog Soldiers"", creates a movie so intense, so teeth clenching, you have no choice but to feel tense. His use of space and camera angles creates an almost surreal claustrophobic feel. There you put yourself in the situation, and as you imagine yourself walking through a dark cave full of monsters, you get more terrified. Never before has a movie put me in such terror without even realizing it.<br/><br/>In the day and age where horrors are all the same, and where they're only made for money, a horror fanatic needs some sort of reminder that there are some movies that still excite. Being a huge fan of the genre myself, it was a pleasant treat, and definitely a scary one. Call it being biased, call it too early, but ""The Descent"" makes its way up into one of my favorite movies of the year."

Eventually, the trailer hit and the announcement of the theatrical release date shortly afterward. To say that I was like a kid of Christmas would be an understatement. I honestly don't remember the last time I was this giddy about a seeing movie. Was it dangerous to build up my expectations like that? Probably, but I was confident enough in the material to do so. August 4th, 2006 - that burning hunger finally subsided.<br/><br/>This instant horror classic is about a group of girls who reunite one year later after a tragic accident, for a caving expedition. Geared up and more energetic then a group of druids at a D&D convention, they descend into the cave. Smashing good times ahead, ladies! Unfortunately, before the girls can start making out with one another, something goes horribly wrong and their entry point is suddenly blocked, forcing them to find another way out. With limited battery power and supplies, they are now in a race against time. And to make matters even worse, there are others things in the caves besides themselves. (And no  they're not Oompa-Loompas!) Oddly enough, my favorite element of THE DESCENT was not the girls, nor the creatures they encounter, but the cave itself. The cave to me was like the water in JAWS. I don't like the ocean because I can't see what's below the water. I don't like caves because of the tight spaces. I'm not the type of person who pisses themselves when being confined in small tight spaces, but I don't enjoy it - that's for sure. With that being said, allow to describe one of the most unnerving sequences in the film for me. No, it's cool! No major spoilers here, I promise.<br/><br/>Once the girls have all repelled into the cavern, one of them immediately maps out their next route. After considering a few options, she decides on a path and starts her way through. With only the light from her head gear, we watch her scuffle through several gaps which are decreasing in size. She's been doing this for twenty seconds and my stomach is already turning. She then proceeds into an even smaller space, squirming around, bending her body to fit through the tunnel. My stomach turns again. She then precedes into yet another section of the tunnel which is even smaller. Barf! To put this into perspective, you would have a hard time placing a pencil between her shoulders and the walls. I honestly couldn't take it. Just as I was about to exit the theater for a two minute break she ended up finding the next room. Thank God! So yeah, I've rarely ever dealt with scenes of emotional intensity like that during a movie before. Very nerve-wracking and very cool! I also enjoyed Neil Marshall's story. I mean talk about a tight script! The characters, story, dialogue and pacing are all exceptionally well thought out. You know how a movie sometimes has that great scene that everyone talks about? Well, this flick has about seven of those. I can think four sequences right now that were truly bothersome to me. They're memorable because you care about these girls and some seriously bad stuff happens to them. It's just unforgiving at times. Good twists, too. I was constantly surprised by some of the story choices that were made: pretty ballsy choices in my opinion, and certainly not commercial ones.<br/><br/>Earlier on I wrote that this was an instant horror classic, and I truly believe that. People bitch to me all the time how there's nothing original in horror these days. Well, here you go! This movie will make you uncomfortable, scare you, gross you out and entertain you for the entire 139 minutes. When I left the theater I felt that I had seen something new and fresh, and of course, very well-executed.<br/><br/>Overall, THE DESCENT is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I'd even say it's now in my Top Twenty of all time. So yes, you must see this film. But for God's sakes - will you please see it in the theater, or at home in the dark with a kick-ass sound system? If you watch this movie on a sunny Sunday afternoon, you'll never understand what I am talking about here."
"Woodyanders","10","5","11","6 August 2006"," A smart, scary and overall superb subterranean creature feature survivalist horror shocker
","A motley sextet of spunky and adventurous young British women embark on an exciting spelunking expedition into a heretofore neglected and unexplored Appalachian cavern. Things turn sour when they get trapped deep down in the bowels of the earth by a sudden cave-in. Things go from already really bad to much, much horribly worse when the ladies find out they are not alone: there's a lethal and hungry gaggle of blind, agile and savage carnivorous albino humanoid mutant beasts who relentlessly stalk and attack the endangered group. <br/><br/>Writer/director Neil (""Dog Soldiers"") Marshall wisely takes his time setting up the characters and the situation, carefully easing the viewer into the central narrative before hitting us with all he's got. And boy does he got loads to hit us with: Besides the intrinsically taut, arresting and unsettling premise, we also have plenty of shockingly raw, gruesome and visceral violence, truly spooky, ugly and grotesque monsters, a clammy, creepy and suffocatingly claustrophobic atmosphere which steadily intensifies as the film goes on, and one corker of a startling surprise ending. Moreover, Marshall is to be further commended for not making a thuddingly obvious and heavy-handed proto-feminist empowerment chick flick; there's no sisters are doing it for themselves type preaching to be found in a single moment of this film. Instead the female characters have not only their survivalist skills pushed to the limit, but also their bonds of friendship and loyalty put to the ultimate test. Watching these women either stick by or abandon one another during their harrowing ordeal gives this movie a truly disturbing, substantial and provocative edge, clearly showing how these kinds of punishing life-threatening circumstances bring out the best and worst in human beings. Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane No one all give excellent and engaging performances, deftly creating believable and likable characters who you genuinely care about (Macdonald especially shines as the toughest and most fiercely self-reliant member of the group). Better still, the monsters in the film aren't done with that dreadfully phony and rarely convincing CGI; the filmmakers thankfully opted for using folks in highly effective and persuasive suits. But what truly makes this a terrific fright film knock-out is the admirable and wonderful marked emphasis on the interplay between the characters, thus ensuring that there's a fabulous abundance of heart and humanity as well as the expected (and wholly terrifying) chills and thrills. A simply stupendous movie that's absolutely essential viewing for horror fans the world over."

"nex-4","7","5","11","7 November 2005"," Good film and better than the bog standard Hollywood fare we're used to
","Superior British horror movie sets tense claustrophia with old fashion suspense and comes out on top.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of less than impressive horror movies in recent years, particularly out of Hollywood. Cabin Fever is a prime example of such a sub-standard flick and there are many more. One distinct advantage British horror has is a true grittiness to it, a kind of 'realness' which makes the characters a lot easier to identify with.<br/><br/>In The Descent we follow the fortunes of an all female cave exploration team who are going on an adventure in a mountain range. The purpose of this expedition is to bring them all together after the hideous events of the previous year which are revealed at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not a particularly big name cast with perhaps Saskia Mulder as Rebecca who also appears in the BBC's Book Club the best known actress on display. Certainly the most recognisable. However, the strength of this movie isn't in its star acumen, but rather in its story telling and direction.<br/><br/>The Descent is claustrophia in abundance; tight cave systems barely give room to breath, and the overwhelming darkness compounds it ten fold. In this movie, light is at a premium.<br/><br/>As for the horror side of it, well let's just touch on the fact that there are rather unfriendly cave dwellers (Who it must be admitted look successfully hideous) who intend to make life difficult for our heroines. They also sound vile - a testament to the sound engineers and overall design of these characters.<br/><br/>Gore levels are impressive without being over the top, and what would a horror movie be without its gore? On that note although this could easily be classified as horror, I would also class it under suspense and claustrophobic dark thriller.<br/><br/>The direction is uniformly effective, but the insatiable darkness and occasional fast action do tend to make certain parts a bit confusing. It's a small price to pay for what is overall a very useful technique in terms of film making - although it should be added that it's quite unique as deployed here.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film and worth your attention. It's certainly one of the better horror films I've seen for sure. The ending clinched it for me for sure.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","The Descent is still as scary and riveting then when I first saw this at the age of 13. It creeps inside you, and won't let to not think about: ""What if""... It doesn't contain unnecessary jump scares, yet it still keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's quiet when it has to be - and those parts are probably the most horrifying - , and it's loud when you wouldn't expect it to be. We have strong female protagonists, free of typical horror movie cliches and a powerful, tragic story. Just as they - us, the viewers also experience the caves claustrophobic feels, it plays with our minds just as much as it does with the characters. Neil Marshall's movie still holds up after one and a half decade thanks to its dark and depressing originality and the undeniably unexpected dark and twisted ending, which unfortunately can rarely be found in todays 'sequel-world' of cinema."

","The descent is seriously terrifying. It will provide you with an experience that relates entirely to those of the characters on screen. Each one is trapped, isolated and alone. In that theatre, you will understand the fear of having no escape. The film, like it's big brother 'Dog Soldiers', takes British horror to it's deserved glory. Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious fiction. After a quarter of the film has passed, you pray for the characters escape as, in a way, you will also be saved from the mental onslaught that drives into your mind throughout. I didn't expect anything from this film before I walked into the theatre it, yet it is the greatest horror I have ever seen, and am likely to for a very long time."

","Neil Marshall's tense, oppressive horror entry is an absolute masterpiece. From the setting to the creature effects to the screenplay, there's so little to reproach here that it's surprising that the movie isn't already a bone-fide mainstream classic. Lead Shauna MacDonald tears into her role as a grieving wife and mother joining her friends on a cave-exploring adventure, headed straight for an unenviable head-first run-in with subterranean, flesh-eating monsters. Marshall's grasp of atmosphere and setting are remarkable, forcing most viewers (even horror aficionados) to white-knuckle their way through the proceedings, on the way to a memorable, devastating and emotional climax. Highly, highly recommended."
"thetauren13","7","2","3","9 May 2009"," Just Didn't Do It For Me
","I really wanted to like this movie. I'd heard quite a few good things about it and was really looking forward to watching it, so perhaps that was part of the reason I was disappointed; my expectations were too high.<br/><br/>First off, after just the first 10 minutes of the movie it was glaringly obvious to me which of the women would be the one to survive. Perhaps it's more of a problem with the genre, but when you put some back story into one of the characters but not any of the others, you're christening him or her as the main character, and it's already a given that he or she will survive (if, of course, anyone at all does). Now, normally I wouldn't mind that a whole lot, but the problem here was that I simply did not like Sarah's character. She rubbed me the wrong way from the start, I guess. And it didn't help that she actually killed off the one character I did like (for an absurd reason, no less); I really wanted Juno to live and was hoping against hope the whole time that she would.<br/><br/>Second, from the moment the so-called 'crawlers' appeared on screen, all I could think of was SmÃ©agol from The Lord of the Rings, and let's just say that kinda killed my enjoyment of the film. I appreciate trying to make the creatures somewhat realistic, but I guess it was just bad luck how they turned out... I would have been much happier if the characters had been attacked by giant spiders or something.<br/><br/>Anyways, now that I've let my disappointment out, I'd still rate the film marginally favorably. After all, it was far better than Living Hell or some other such garbage, and I was more let down by my expectations than by the movie itself."
"bacontrees","10","2","3","2 June 2008"," One of the scariest films I have ever seen.
","I saw the original version first, then the North American version (or US?). I won't explain the difference, but they are both scary!! It wasn't available in Canada at first, so I bought the DVD on eBay, and it didn't have to be on the big screen to be effective. Then, it got released here in Canada about a year later (approximately) and I went to see it again, but on the big screen. Still scared the ______ out of me.<br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to go for the atmosphere rather than the music jabs to scare the audience. I'm very impressed at the quality of acting here, because that is the main reason why many movies don't work for me, if I can't believe the characters, no amount of blood or effects will make any difference in the end. The characters are complex, but that is displayed in their actions and expressions, not always in what they say - there's a whole lot more going on in the film than the basic plot and the gore. Upon seeing it a second or third time, you get to know the characters even better. <br/><br/>In my opinion, one of the best horror movies of all time. Oh, and very bloody and scary."
"mitchellnisbet74","4","2","3","14 March 2008"," A good attempt but failed to scare me
","This is a pretty good attempt on a quite original plot with some good actors and also some fairly scary scenes. The actors if sometimes wooden did portray some good changes in character - hence the name the descent may not only mean the literal term - a descent into a cave and a deep place but also the descent of the characters ultimately because one of the group deceives them into thinking that they are in a different cave and therefore they get lost. <br/><br/>There are some questionable scenes in it such as the one where one of the characters is still alive after having a hole through her neck and half of her intestines ripped out by the flesh eating monsters. Another groanable scene is when one of the monsters steps on a woman's face - now seeing as they are blind and have acute other senses then one would think that it would feel the body heat. But no, conveniently it ignores her and carries on to feast on her comrades guts - lovely stuff.<br/><br/>For me the ending wasn't satisfying and left me completely emotionless - any feelings i had built up for the characters during the film were completely confused when the woman escapes then is back in the cave with several monsters surrounding her. And then her little girl appears singing happy birthday to her! <br/><br/>Altogether worth a watch but don't expect too much from it it won't satisfy your needs, either for scare-horror or a good film."

It is because of what could be the stupidest thing I ever saw someone of any gender, age, or level of intelligence do.<br/><br/>OK, so we are down in the depths of an uncharted cave that may not even have a way out, and we find a race of mutated creatures that will kill us and eat us in a heartbeat, and now it is just the two of us left BUT I just found out that you were HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY HUSBAND!!!!!!! Well, all bets are off now. I will put a pick in your leg and leave you for dead, instead of working together to get out and worrying about the soap opera crap later. Women should really be insulted by this movie.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, before you respond by saying, HEY, she left the other girl that she ACCIDENTALLY FATALLY wounded behind. The people who wrote this couldn't even come up with an even slightly believable way to get the wife (sorry, can't bother to remember or look up the character names) to find out that her husband was cheating on her. A woman who is dying from a pick thru her throat bothers to tell the wife that the cheater woman left her for dead and that she was seeing her husband. It would have been nice if they had shown her calling out to cheater woman, the way she was somehow able to call out to the wife. AND....Oh Yeah, the wife had to crush the dying tattletale's skull anyway. So what was the cheater woman's crime (aside from that most HEINIOUS and UNFORGIVABLE crime of cheating)? Was cheater woman guilty of NOT bashing the dying woman's skull in before she left her?"

","If Neil Marshall's DOG SOLDIERS was inspired by 80's action/horror movies like ALIENS or PREDATOR, THE DESCENT reminded me of films like DELIVERANCE 1972 and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 1974.<br/><br/>In the days where no horror fan hears the names like Tobe Hooper anymore and Wes craven makes horrible movies like CURSED,Niel Marshall has made a masterpiece in horror genre,THE DESCENT. A low budget horror film which has all the elements that can be expected from one. It has blood(which I think is really necessary for the genre),suspense,a very creepy location and there's a smart psychological plot under it's skin where you can sense issues like CLAUSTROPHOBIA or PARANOIA.<br/><br/>The story of THE DESCENT is very simple,however Neil Marshall tells it in a very interesting way therefore the less you know about it the more you enjoy it,so I'm going to skip the story. And finally because the most of the movie happens in a cave where there's no natural light, try to pay attention how the scenes are lit by such few and simple things,and the influence each one has because of their color.<br/><br/>So go rent the DVD(and make sure it has the original British ending,because the US ending is a total disappointment)turn of the lights,turn up the volume and enjoy a descent into fear."

","So a 1950's creature feature flick. But at least in the 1950's they would have sold it as that. The movie would be better named as ""the attack of the mole people."" The summary lies, it isn't a descent into a cave from hell or have any kid of mental struggle that we get twisted into. Not at all! The girls get lost in the cave, find monsters, try to escape.<br/><br/>However, the Actresses pulled it together and were not cheesy and dumb. They for the most part they were quite clever and watchable. Unless one of them becomes super famous and wins an Oscar or marries a soccer player, not worth mentioning again. It is intense and needs a soundtrack. Consider it a alternate on Halloween and you get to the video store too late for any of the popular favs."

","Slow at times, but very ambitious and scary when you need it to be, The Descent harnesses its potential enough to keep horror fanatics and filmgoers satisfied. Shauna Macdonald gives an understated performance as Sarah, the lead character in the film. Her performance more than the rest, truly captures the horror and terror these characters are going through, fit with the trauma to make you truly sympathize and care for her. The film, especially towards the beginning, can feel a bit slow and just filler to setup the situation we know is bound to happen. That being said, it is because of this that the film can feel at times a bit formulaic and it's a bit disappointing seeing from the atmosphere and direction the film often takes, that if the script were just a little smarter, it could be something incredibly daring and smart, but instead it takes a safer way out. In the end however, The Descent is more than an enjoyable time. It's scares are truly genuine, its acting surprisingly decent, and for the most part, it handles its concept pretty well. It may have its issues at times, but it's daring, and ambitious. It can play safe at times with standard story elements, but it takes risks not achieved with such success in some time, that proves it to be rather impressive.

I got that the husband was likely enamored of Juno, and that Sarah's questioning him about being ""distant"" while he was driving likely caused the fatal accident. But this whole understory seemed to have little to do with the rest of the movie or its resolution. Sure, Sarah finally ""turns"" on Juno, but only after she believes that Juno had willfully killed Beth. Maybe her husband's infidelity with Juno made her feel vindicated. I don't know. But there was just no satisfactory connection. - I know most horror movies these days depend on one final jump scare after everything seems to have been resolved. I think it's kind of a cheap way to end a movie. But what was the sudden appearance of Juno in the car after Sarah had escaped and driven a few miles away all about? Last we saw of Juno, she was surrounded by half a dozen crawlers and seemed done for. Did she somehow vanquish all those crawlers, AND find her way out, AND get into the car - but hide rather than driving the thing away? Or was Juno a figment of Sarah's imagination? Guilt for having stabbed her in the leg?<br/><br/>Having said this, it was still an OKAY movie. But not a movie I'd be enticed to watch again."

","This is the stuff nightmares are made of.<br/><br/>Imagine being trapped underground with your closest friends and some not very nice creatures preying on you. Then see those who you thought were your friends splinter and the group dynamic fall apart in a welter of gore and primal survival.<br/><br/>This is the basic premise of Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"". Its a very visceral film which meanders along for the first 60 minutes after the initial shocking car accident and then explodes into life with the appearance of the Crawlers (imagine Gollums nastier country cousins).<br/><br/>From the outset Marshall makes us sympathise with the group especially Sarah (whose character grows throughout the film), who loses her husband and daughter in the first few minutes and even with Juno, the ""villain"" who is weighed down by guilt of a big secret, whose recklessness gets the group into this mess in the first place. I personally found Beth's death the most upsetting. Her character was the most sympathetic. <br/><br/>Marshall does a good job in setting up the group dynamic in such a way as to make us care about them. Its because of his good writing here and its not often that you find such characterisation in a gory horror film. What Marshall has given us here sets a new standard for visceral shocks. He does rely on one jump-shock too many and I personally do not want to see what a compound fracture looks like (or how to treat one. Ever seen an entire cinema audience pull a nauseous grimace.) Its worth commenting on the production design. Stunning. You would not think it was a film set at Pinewood. It was a character by itself, adding to Marshall observations about claustrophobia, fear of the dark and friendship.<br/><br/>Of course, he could be asking: Do you know really ""know"" your ""friends""? <br/><br/>Bloody excellent. 10 out of 10."

","I am a huge horror movie fan and what I saw was without question the most original and hard core horror film I have seen in ages besides ""Saw"", ""Hostel"", and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Neill Marshall wrote and directed a film about six women on a cave diving expedition that descends into the bottom of hell hence the name of the movie ""The Descent."" The film opens with three of the women on a white water rafting trip in the wilderness and the vacation ends in tragedy when Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) husband and daughter are killed in horrifying car accident leaving her traumatized. One year later, Sarah and her friends, Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza, who could be the next great female action star) travel to the Appalachian Mountains and embark on a cave diving expedition. They are joined by a three other women: mother and daughter, Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and punk adventurer Holly (Nora-Jane No one, see ""The Magdelene Sisters""). As they go further and further down the caverns, they end trapped and lost with company: cannibalistic monsters. They are a few wholes in the movie, but it is immediately forgotten due to the amount of violence and gore and jump out of your seats surprises. Neill Marshall is a genius by sending his audience down into a dark, claustrophobic maze of rock, bones, and blood. You will be without question left speechless by the way he circles around the characters as they desperately attempt to escape. If you are a horror movie buff this is the movie for you!"

I had to stop eating my little sour candies because it was so violent and gross that anything in my mouth made me want to vomit. I almost felt the overwhelming need to contact the people responsible for this monstrosity and ask them what made them think they even had a right to put such complete TRASH into the world.<br/><br/>The fact that anyone found this movie remotely decent, much more actually good, frankly appalls me. This was by far the worst thing I have seen in years. Someone wrote a review somewhere on here that said they were impressed that it was a movie that managed to be scary without buckets of blood and gore.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Either they're using a different definition of buckets of blood and gore than everyone else is in the sane world, or they just didn't watch the movie, because people getting pick-axed in the throat, breaking their legs so that bone is sticking through, getting devoured, and swimming through a LAKE OF BLOOD certainly falls under MY definition of buckets of blood and gore.<br/><br/>Please people, doing ANYTHING else with your time would be infinitely more productive.

","The Descent. What a brilliant name for a movie that doesn't live up to its title. A group of women literally descend into a cave and then descend into their own abysmal hell because their relationships suck. Nobody trusts anybody. Then it gets even worse when they find themselves lost and to top it all off, a bunch of sullen cave ""monsters"" show up. Or do they? The dream sequences and hallucinations serve only to confuse an already weak story. The only true descent of this film is its lack of believability. You'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of the cave ""creatures"" who happen to look just like us only dirtier. Half the movie is spend watching them crawl around in mud and somehow miraculously not find and eat our super spelunking ladies. Neither the American or the British ending serve to tie up the wildly loose ends of this cave dwelling flop."
"mOVIemAN56","9","4","9","2 September 2007"," The scariest film in recent cinema
","I rarely get the treat of viewing British cinema so I was quite pleased when I was able to stumble upon the British horror film The Descent. The story follows that of six woman from the United Kingdom who love to do wild things. Not wild things in the terms of erotic films but in the terms of being daredevils so to say. After a freak accident claims the life of a woman named Sarah's young daughter and husband, the six friends travel to the United State to bond while they go spelunking (cave diving). What happens in the caves becomes a living nightmare as they become trapped inside with strange creatures out to kill them.<br/><br/>At first when I read that the film was nearly an all female cast I had my doubts. The only time you ever see all female casts in the States is when a romantic comedy is the basis for the plot. However, one must remember, this is British made and are more adapt at acting then most anorexic, beauty queen wannabe's that act in the US. I liked the all female cast, they all did a great job and looked like they actually knew what they were doing while spelunking which added to the realism. All the girls are relatively unknowns outside of the UK but it doesn't matter, films don't have to have big stars in order to be great films.<br/><br/>The horror is top-notch even before the Crawlers (monsters) show up. You feel a strong sense of claustrophobia and foreboding while the woman crawl through narrow tunnels in the pitch. Honestly, I was freaked out even before the monsters began wrecking havoc. Once the monsters do arrive you are really in for a treat. They are easily the most believable, scariest looking things I have seen in a horror film since the original Alien. Needless to say you will be scared out of your mind by the end of this and will be thinking about it even more when you turn off the lights to go to be that night. (recommendation: watch at night in the pitch black, it's even scarier)<br/><br/>What makes all horror films is atmosphere. A strong sense of innocence and amusement must be present early on then that innocence must be smashed in bloody fashion. The film throws you right inside the caves with the six women and makes you feel just as claustrophobic and scared as they are. That is why The Descent works so well, it makes you feel as if you are there and as if you are going to be the next attacked. This is what so many horror films fail to do, there is a bunch of flash but no show, for the Descent there is not a lot of flash but a ton of show. This is why it is one of the best horror films since Alien.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Stars"

"adibadi","2","4","9","29 June 2007"," de/s/cent crap
","I read a pretty good review on this movie - let's call that to a first approximation - so I decided to watch it. Okay, maybe I'm not that much into horror pieces, but this was something really bad.<br/><br/>Let's see the plot. Bunch of cool girls (you know, doing extreme sports 'n' stuff) get together to explore a 'brand new' cave system. They go down, walk a bit and then slaughter. Frankly speaking I expected some sort of tricks or anything after a fair start: husband dies, daughter also, thriller elements, blabla, after remarks like ""this was not in the book"" someone may know something, but forget it, there is simply nothing, absolutely zero, in addition to that the incoherence of the memories with the main stripe is painful.<br/><br/>Characters. We cannot talk much about development, 'cause their guts start to run down on some other guys' throats too fast. Neither isn't too difficult to predict who was/were gonna come out of the hole. The tremendous screenwriter made some attempts to stir that one and only fascinating story line again, he badly failed I must say.<br/><br/>Creatures. This is even more terrible. Ugly freaks with a supposed-to-be scary (I would rather say annoying) scream and overshaped audition, not being able to see or smell (or touch, though if it comes to hearing then they bite necks quite accurately). I'd summarize (means repeat) the explanation: ""They have developed down here isolated, without any daylight"". Wow, please. Gimme a break to place a turd in my pants.<br/><br/>From the moment the massacre started I took a look on my watch every five minutes and tried to figure out the average timing of the next member of the group altering into victuals, a perfect activity while a frightening film.<br/><br/>So there you go: if you enjoy checking out Gollum-like creatures running around and killing people in a lame way or you're a braindead seeking for absolutely no cogitation, then go ahead, otherwise stay far away. I've given a two for the only reason it is short enough, thus I was able to watch till the end."

I hate SUV's cause probably on 10% of people take them off road, but this movie took a high-end brand SUV and took it into the wilderness. That made me smile.<br/><br/>4) The movie didn't just start killing people right away, it gave each of them personalities and stories.<br/><br/>5) It leaves you wondering what happens to Sarah after the end.

"adudewhoiscool","10","4","9","14 February 2007"," The best horror film in years
","If you want to be scared, ""The Descent"" is a movie for you. This movie is unlike recent horror movies. The recent horror films all seem to rely on either jump scenes or abundances of gore. In ""The Descent,"" Neil Marshal has created a film that actually successfully mixes both gore and jumps, and at the same time gives you a feeling of tension throughout the entire movie. It would not be strange to say that this movie is the best horror film in a long time. Some people may even call it one of the scariest films ever. <br/><br/>A tragic accident occurs, leaving Sarah very traumatized. One year later, six female friends reunite for a caving expedition. Their adventure soon goes horribly wrong when a collapse traps them deep underground. To make things worst, they discover that some bloodthirsty cannibalized creatures are hunting them. As their friendships deteriorate, they find themselves in a desperate struggle to survive from not only the creatures but each other as well. Can all of them make it alive or will they all end up being snacks for the creatures? <br/><br/>This movie is intense. It starts out a little slow, during the first twenty-five minutes, in order to show a little character development, but after that, the roller coaster ride begins and it continues until the end credits. If you pretend that you are in the exact same situation as the females, you will relate to the characters and feel very claustrophobic. The feeling of claustrophobia will make you cheer for the females to escape this cave. Of course, their problem is not just exiting the cave, but also escaping from these cannibalistic creatures that live in the cave. Those creatures do not show up until about fifty minutes into the film but once they do, ""The Descent"" turns a completely new direction.<br/><br/>Since this movie is an all-female cast, surprisingly, it does not settle on the sex and nudity factor at all. Usually you get a movie that is mostly male dominated or else you usually get something that features the females in very limited clothing and many close up shots of their butts and chests. These women did not just run around screaming throughout the movie, they were tough and could easily take care of themselves. It is weird to see a horror movie that does not feature a women's sexuality. While the women were still very attractive, their looks were not the focal point of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Descent"" was an amazing horror film. There is nothing to complain about in this film. It does not feature many of the typical horror movie clichés you would see in modern day horror films. It does its job in frightening the heck out of you. After viewing this movie, many people will probably take spelunking, or cave diving, off their ""things to do before you die"" list. ""The Descent"" is one of the best horror films in years. ""The Descent"" is extremely recommended!"

","Neil Marshall has created another top class movie, 6 friends get trapped when a caving excursion turns bad and the Descent becomes more than a journey into the depths of a cave system; it becomes a descent in to a world of mistrust and even madness.<br/><br/>As they are hunted down by a breed of predators adapted to surviving in the darkness of the caves, their individual characters and friendships are tested to the limit.<br/><br/>Marshall creates a very strong sense of tension throughout the movie, and all 6 of the actresses give outstanding performances, in particular 'Shauna MacDonald' and 'Natalie Mendoza' whose characters have their own sense of tension between them right from the start of the film.<br/><br/>The Descent really is one of the finest horror movies to come out in years, it is relentlessly creepy, dark and atmospheric, it is very gruesome, but it's way more than just a gore-fest; and it is truly terrifying.<br/><br/>9/10 Simply has to be seen"

It's tense and stressful from the first scene, and it doesn't give you a break til the end. The ending is fantastic. There's two ways a horror movie usually ends: They all die or they live.

It's claustrophobic, gruesome and depressing. Neil Marshall really knows how to handle a movie well. Even the scenes when they are just caving are tense and exciting.<br/><br/>Six friends meet up in America to go caving. Sarah, Juno, Holly, Rebecca, Beth and Sam. After a long hike, they reach the cave. They descend into the cave and begin exploring. But when there is a cave in everything goes dreadfully wrong, especially when they find out they're not alone...<br/><br/>And boy, when they find out it is one of the scariest things ever filmed. The Crawlers are very creepy, vicious little creatures. They bite, tear and eat their victims. They are made all the more mysterious because they are mostly kept in the dark. This is where the film succeeds. The use of camera angles and lighting are perfect and make the film that much more intense. All the women can act and make us feel the right emotions for their characters.<br/><br/>For all horror fans that haven't seen this, you MUST! This is comparable to the almighty Alien. That's how good this is. See it if you haven't! 5/5."

I don't want to spoil anything for you so just go see this movie and you won't regret it. It's gory but not in an exploitive way and the sense desperation the gang starts to feel when the beasties reveal themselves makes all that happens very logical.

","The Descent tells the story of six sporty women in their mid-twenties who venture into the Appalachian Mountains for a pleasant day of spelunking and catching up on old times. We meet the women a day before they set off for the cave: Juno, the alpha-female jock of the group, Holly, the rock climber punk, Beth, the smart one, Rebecca and Sam, the two sisters, and Sarah, who has become the quiet one since a car accident took the lives of her husband and young daughter a year earlier. The women spend a night drinking and reminiscing, and the next morning they hike to the mouth of a nearby cave system in the woods and repel into it. They run into trouble when they find out that they have descended into an unexplored cave, and that their only known way back out of the cave has just been blocked.<br/><br/>The Descent is a minimalist horror masterpiece. Director Neil Marshall and cinematographer Sam McCurdy create an atmosphere of constant fear using simple yet utterly effective visual techniques. The cinematography is beautiful and scary because it exploits our inherent fears of darkness, claustrophobia and disorientation. In the cave, light is like a gift, and Marshall makes us appreciate it like the women do. Without light, we are left only with our own fears of what may lurk in the darkness. That's why this movie is genuinely scary. Marshall never compromises his visual style even though it is so simple, because he knows it works. Frankly, the film didn't have the option of using many special effects because of its tiny $6.7 million budget, but Marshall manages to create several memorably nightmarish images as well as a lot of deliciously gory violence.<br/><br/>The Descent pays homage to genre classics like Alien, Carrie, Deliverance, and The Blair Witch Project (and even a classic outside of the genre, Apocalypse Now), by incorporating elements from each without losing its own stylistic focus. As a genre exercise, the film succeeds because it establishes a style and sticks to it. For lovers of horror, this is an absolute must-see."

And this one definitely delivered, on many different levels than one, which was refreshing to see among all of the cheap Hollywood horror that is carted out lately. The film begins in the UK with a woman named Sarah, who is river rafting with two friends, all whom seem to be pure thrill seekers. On Sarah's drive back from the river expedition with her husband, a horrible car accident takes place, taking the life of Sarah's young daughter. A year later, Sarah and a group of her friends meet in the US Appalachian mountains to prepare for a cave exploration. After spending the night in a cabin, the group of girls (lead by Juno, the thrill-seeking aficionado) head to a cave at the mouth of a river. After descending into the cavern, they are fascinated by it. But their fascination soon turns into fear, after a tunnel leading into another area of the cavern collapses, nearly killing Sarah and cutting the girls off from the exit. As the minutes tick by and their sources of light begin to lose power, the girls begin to lose hope, desperately searching for a way out. Their hopes are heightened slightly when they find evidence of previous explorers and cave markings, but it is revealed that the cave they're in isn't the cave they thought they were in. Turns out Juno took them to an unexplored cave that is unknown to anyone, so they could ""explore it for themselves"", not telling her friends.<br/><br/>After one of the girls, Holly, falls and severely injures her leg, Sarah spots a strange human-looking creature hiding in the darkness. Of course her friends don't believe her, telling her it's just the dark playing tricks. But they believe her soon enough, because the strange breed of pale, human-like creatures close in on the girls, and they are thirsty for blood. After killing one of the creatures, an examination of it leads to the conclusion that the species are completely blind, hunting their prey by only sound. Now, with limited light source, can the girls escape the cave? Or will they become another meal for the flesh-eating species? <br/><br/>This film is a pure work of terror, probably one of the best I've seen in a very long time, managing to be extremely spooky and dodging the majority of clichés that are so prominent in horror films. The cave sequences (which most of the film consists of) are dark, damp, and extremely claustrophobic. I felt uncomfortable watching them, almost as if I was actually there. The acting was excellent, each of the women gave perfect performances. The caves themselves were very convincing, which has me wondering whether or not they used actual caverns to film the movie in. The creatures in this movie were disgusting, and their orchestrated movements and strange howl/screaming sounds were very creepy. They weren't too over the top, nothing like the giant monsters you see in films like ""The Cave"". On the contrary, they are actually very human-like, but their skin and eyes are pure white and they seem to have excellent climbing skills. Unlike in most horror films, I actually felt bad for the characters as they met grisly fates at the hands of the creatures, and I felt even worse when someone was killed accidentally by one of her friends. I won't go into the details, but it was actually quite tragic the way the whole film played out. From what I know, there are two versions of the ending, and the U.S. version is a tad bit shorter, but from what I read about the two versions it really isn't major. Let's just say that we Americans seem to enjoy ""happy endings"". I really didn't think it was a huge deal though.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Descent"" is one scary good time. It was claustrophobic, intense, and had you not knowing what to expect next, holding your attention the whole time. It isn't your over the top, corny monster movie, so don't anticipate anything like the mediocre creature-feature ""The Cave"", ""The Descent"" is miles above it. Horror films don't get much better than this. 9/10."
"xcrss_my_heartx","10","4","9","31 July 2006"," Great cave/horror film, maybe the best yet.
","This film gives off a perfect sense of loss and survival while still being terrifying as it gets. It is beautiful at times and creates a hero who is doomed throughout. If you are adventurous and feel that you have to risk the dark to see the light then this movie is definitely for you. The characters are well in depth for a horror film, and the actors are definitely capable of playing the part. The situations are realistic and believable even the creatures they encounter seem to have a purpose for survival and a background that goes back to cave drawings, perhaps older than humans. this movie gives you a whole different reason to fear the dark and the things that don't rely on light to see. good luck, bring a your blanket<br/><br/>If this isn't the best cave survival horror flick please recommend one better."
"digital-energy","10","4","9","23 July 2006"," It scared the hell out of me...
","...nothing more to say. I never was scared like this. In some scenes I felt claustrophobic like never before. The creature effects are very realistic, don't mind they don't explain were their origin is. I'm looking forward for a sequel, i think the creatures might scare someone a second time. After I watched it in cinema, I bought a DVD of this movie, but don't watched it until now. ""The descent"" is really grueling. Don't know what to write, my English is not good enough for writing minimum 10 lines without it would be sound like German ""school-english"". Watch it, be scared, enjoy. 10 out of 10. Greetings, digital-energy"
"bazibazbaz","Null","4","9","18 February 2006"," Frighteningly bad
","Getting 6 women lost in an unchartered cave with the land based equivalent of creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean isn't a bad idea for a film. But that's as far as The Descent should have got. The monsters aren't scary, they're cocks. And the film's actually more effective before they arrive. A lot more could have been made of why they were there etc, because their introduction is about as subtle as the musical score. Perhaps if they were a little more terrifying, the melodramatic orchestral bursts whenever one of the Dr Who type goons appears wouldn't have seemed so inappropriate. On the positive side, the cave claustrophobia is effective and there's a nice broken leg scene. Apart from that it's all a bit crap really."
"jsayer","10","4","9","13 February 2006"," Best British Made Horror Film
","When I First heard about 'The Descent' i thought it would be one of those crap American horror movies that always ends in a lovey dovey way that wouldn't happen in real life. I was surprised to find out that it was British made i was also surprised to find that it was directed by the directer of 'Dog Soldiers' Neil Marshall. <br/><br/>The basic plot is a group of women go on a caving trip and things go horribly wrong when there only known exit is blocked by an unexpected rock fall. Its not until after the cave in that the women discover that there is something down there with them, and this something is not happy to see them. They also discover there is more than one of these things down there. It then becomes a battle for survival.<br/><br/>The women arn't hot young supermodel college students either in fact they all in there early 30's late 20's they are good looking but not in the way that you would expect.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall has done it and made a better British horror film than the brilliant '28 Days later'.<br/><br/>Oh How do you give a lemon an orgasm? You Tickle its citrus! LOL.<br/><br/>Its well worth spending the money to buy it on DVD with jumps and scares and i mean real scares throughout the movie it easily makes the top ten horror movies."
"afdiazr","8","4","9","13 February 2006"," Neil Marshall kicks major butt
","I had already seen Dog Soldiers, and though it has its mistakes and lowdowns, it still manages to be a pretty decent horror/action flick. Way better than a lot of stuff out of the American and Japanese market. With The Descent, Neil Marshall is on my Top 5 Horror Movie Directors list. This one is claustrophobic, has strong female characters, the scary parts are truly scary, and you actually feel so into the film you can't escape its grip. People are always looking for a frightening horror film, and this one delivers on that department. It's almost like you're inside the caverns with all those girls. You've got the resulting tension from being trapped inside the cave. You've got the drama from Sarah's tragedy. You've got that awesome use of light where you can clearly see what's going on but still feel you're surrounded by complete darkness. And you've got the intense mutant sequences, with lots of blood and clever camera movement. The way Marshall portrays the mutants is incredible. The first time you get a glimpse of one them reminded me of the moment when you first see the aliens in Signs at the children party. Truly frightening. Another added value is that the copies showing in Mexico City are the UK copies, with the complete ending, and not the happy thing they're showing in the States. That was a clever move from the distribution company.<br/><br/>This movie is not as gory as everyone has made it out to be. It's gory, but not unbearable or anything. At least is way gorier than Hostel.<br/><br/>See this one at the theater. The use of light is impressive, and it adds so much to the whole experience."
"LeonardPine","8","4","9","7 February 2006"," Horror that gets it right
","The Descent is the best horror film in ages, a horror film that gets it right by going back to basics. Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers was an assured debut but this is better, a confident and serious approach to the subject. With nods to films such as Alien, Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and even The Shining, The Descent delivers on every level.<br/><br/>With a slow assured build up after the opening shock moment, as the group of girls venture deep into caves, director Marshall waits for exactly the right moment to deliver a shock moment that is guarantee'd to have you leaping out of your seats! From then on the action never lets up as the plucky females battle for their lives against the hideous and vicious creatures dwelling in the caves. With lashings of gore, violence and some nail-biting suspense, The Descent really delivers the goods.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown all female cast are very good, especially Natalie Mendoza who plays the awesome Juno, and we do actually care for them thanks to the slow build up.<br/><br/>So if you like your horror straight and serious, you simply must see The Descent. Check it out!"
"humberthumbert-1","10","4","9","2 February 2006"," Scariest film ever made
","OK, just a brief comment-- I saw this a few days ago at Sundance. I'm both a huge fan of horror films and a really difficult scare-- while I enjoy horror films, I frequently find myself disappointed in the actual scare department.<br/><br/>As far as I can think, I have never been more scared during a movie than this one.<br/><br/>I spent half of my time jumping out of my chair and the other half clutching my chest. People ran out of the screening because it was too scary for them-- which I don't think I've ever seen before (at least, not at Sundance). As a total claustrophobe, I thought it might have have just been targeting my weak points, but my boyfriend screamed about 10 times in the movie- a first that I can think of.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I said ""This is probably the scariest film I've ever seen."" He said, ""Well, it's definitely one of them."" ""What have you seen that's scarier?"" I asked. He couldn't think of a movie that came close.<br/><br/>And again, we watch a lot of horror movies. This movie is amazing."
"james_corck3","Null","4","9","23 January 2006"," It takes you to hell and let you return to tell the experience
","The previous movie of Neil Marshall was, in essence, a black comedy. There is no comedy in The descent. Everything is horrifying, terrifying, thrilling and scary. Six girls trapped underground and a common enemy. Not the crawlers, but themselves and their paranoia.<br/><br/>The origin of the movie, that car crash that will traumatize the leading female (Shauna McDonald) right from the first scene, and the next sequence, running through a hospital hallway with the lights going, tells you that this movie is not kidding. This is pure fear with steroids. This movie is to watch it behind your hands, or under the seat, or just to keep in tension until your veins pop out.<br/><br/>If we make a math, this is Alien+The shinning+Death line. Horror is horrible again. Horror movies have their mojo back, and a final advise. The less you read of it, the most you will enjoy it, and stay on your seat until the end of the credits. There is a final surprise that will give the whole movie it's true meaning. That cave is not the trap, is their own minds."

","I wasn't lucky enough to catch this film at the cinema, but rented it on DVD on it's rental release day. I was so blown away I bought The Descent the following day.<br/><br/>We don't churn out that many Horror films a year here in the UK, so I was not too sure on what to expect. The reviews had been very good and I am not surprised why...<br/><br/>The acting from all of the female (largely unknown) leads is top notch and you do feel for each of them when the proverbial starts to hit the fan.<br/><br/>It's dark, mysterious, unsettling and down right gory. Everything that a Horror film should be. The first 45 minutes builds up so much excitement and tension that you will be on the edge of your seat for the final part of the film.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall rocked with Dog Soldiers and has struck gold again with The Descent. His clever use of lighting the scenes adds just to the originality of the film. Far more superior than The Cave.<br/><br/>It's best to watch this film, not knowing too much about it and then in the final act, you will hopefully agree with me that this film rocks...!"
"fertilecelluloid","8","4","9","16 December 2005"," Rock solid horror thriller
","""The Descent"" is a solid horror thriller with a touch of ""Journey To The Centre Of The Earth"" thrown in. Why ""solid""? Characters first. The prologue sets up a major character's backstory beautifully. While doing so, we get a taste of the realism to come. Meaning: the bloodshed. The other characters -- a bunch of young women going caving -- are introduced economically and we're quickly into the main story. The women abseil into a remote cave and encounter...trouble.<br/><br/>Horror films are usually ruined when characters do stupid things. Characters don't do stupid things in ""The Descent"". The script has a solid logic and the women make rationally decisions under pressure. It can not be underestimated how much a little intelligence can add to a movie. This is an intelligent, claustrophobic, tense piece of work with great special effects, moody photography, smart sound design and rock solid acting. In other words, the filmmakers did their homework.<br/><br/>Though I wasn't too fond of the ending, I rate this very highly. The violence is quick and bloody, the subterranean creatures are gruesomely realized, and the setting is convincing. There have been other movies about similar horrors, but this succeeds because it doesn't pander to the dumbest of audiences and keeps its characters real.<br/><br/>Take the plunge."
"alma_ehrencrona","10","4","9","13 November 2005"," Non stop horror, never seen anything like this!
","I don't regret watching this movie but while I was watching it I promised myself that I would never do it again! The reason for that is that I was totally terrified through the whole movie, I chew down my nails and my heart was beating twice as fast as it should have been. If you'd like to be non stop horror-struck for one hour and forty minutes I truly recommend this piece. As I was starting to get nauseous by the claustrophobic atmosphere & thought that my heart couldn't handle anymore, the story got to it's climax, which lasted for the rest of the movie. For more than an hour after the movie had ended I was constantly nervous and my hands was literally shaking! This is the first time I have really been scared by a movie. Maybe the acting isn't the best you can get & some of the effects aren't that convincing. But that didn't bother me; first of all there was so many other things to concentrate on & it seemed only stupid to sit and complain about -at the moment- trivial things like that. I also think that it's more fun to watch horror-movies that's not in the typical Hollywood-spirit. Even though the quality sometimes may be not as high, movies like this is the ones that leaves the strongest and -in this case- unpleasant memories."

Any one a bit squeamish should NOT see this film cos man is there some violence in it all i will say is watch out for an interesting new use of an ice pick through out the film <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film and I'm glad that British film makers are finally bringing out GOOD horror movies these days"
"ba5588","3","4","9","14 July 2005"," Cave Film
","Predictable I'm not much of a horror fan, but after seeing this movie, I doubt I will see another soon. The director's combination of the paranormal experiences (the hospital scene and the dream ending) and the real creatures living in the cave doesn't mix well. It's like combining The Swamp Creature with The Ring. The film also has many scenes in which I actually heard laughter in the theater. The film used excessive blood and gore to frighten its viewers, when all it did was just disgust the viewer and bring the film down. I was surprised to see that this film received such a high rating on this site. Seeing as almost everyone I spoke with at the theater was very disappointed with the film itself. This film may have scared some, but a real look at this movie will reveal it's faults and lack of horror quality."

I wasn't to sure if I wanted to go see this film, but thought 'what the hell' it's a horror film, and they are the best kind. Seeing that it was an 18 certificate, rather than being a 15 with all the good parts taken out, made my mind up. Now I am very pleased I did decide to go - Never before have I gone out of the cinema, after jumping so many times, with a big grin on my face.<br/><br/>The tension in this film is unrelenting . The blood & gore flows. The lighting is magnificent. The music atmospheric. The acting stupendous.

Even the ending is great, but I won't spoil it for you! The horror genre is not dead - and this proves it.<br/><br/>My rating - 11/10.<br/><br/>Like I said - ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN - For God's Sake, do not miss this movie.<br/><br/>You have been warned."

The gore in this film is so intense, I suppose that the best word to use to describe this film would have to be SAVAGE!. Most recent horror films are certificate 15's and the old rare 18 doesn't turn out to be all that gory, but this film is an exception.<br/><br/>I have to give this film ten out of ten because it excels in every area possible great plot, script and direction. And not to forget the gore and the jumps that this film provides which is off the scale.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall is now on a roll and I can't wait till the sequel to dog soldiers is out.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet I strongly recommend that you see it straight away I promise that you won't be disappointed unless your a sad loser who can't grasp the concept of a good horror movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

"ario-34119","1","3","6","17 May 2017"," Slow, shallow and illogical
","I really don't understand the ratings and reviews people gave this film. Honestly, I watched it because the director was chosen to make a reboot of a film series I was looking forward to see. But I guess that reboot is doomed now.<br/><br/>This film is very slow. Do you want a suspense thriller or people crawling in a cave, which is what you get the first hour or so? It's also very shallow. Whatever character being established out of these women the whole first act, it goes down the drain in the next. They don't act like experienced climber/spelunker/whatever, and they certainly don't behave like friends.<br/><br/>Logic also goes down the drain. First of all, you're going against cave dwellers, for crying out loud, and your first instinct is to throw away your flares? Who do you think can see better in the dark? And secondly, when your life depends on (or at least have a better chance of survival by) working together with your friend, you don't stab her and leave her to die, whatever your beef is with her.<br/><br/>So, no. I don't get what people are praising. To me, it's a bad film. I don't get the suspense, the story telling is a mess and it's very forgettable. The three stars are for the acting and cinematography, which are decent.<br/><br/>EDIT --- I turned the three to one after a while (quite a long while) when I realized that the great reviews are from friends (or fake accounts) of the film makers to boost this crapfest into a decent rating."

","The Descent follows a group of women who go spelunking in an uncharted cave system in the Appalachian Mountains. As they are crawling through the tunnels, the cave collapses leaving them trapped and soon to realize that they are not alone down there. The Descent is not particularly groundbreaking or original in regards to the plot, but it is executed with such perfection and contains all the elements essential to creating tension, suspense, and scariness.<br/><br/>The Descent does an amazing job creating a pervasive feeling of dread, terror, and hopelessness that lingers through the entire movie's run-time, and giving you no time to catch your breath or relax. It is a non-stop thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the screen. <br/><br/>In addition to a substantial amount of violence, blood, gore, and disturbing imagery, there is also a great amount of psychological tension including but not limited to: claustrophobia, nyctophilia, the feeling of being lost, isolation, hopelessness and internal conflict between characters.The characters are well-developed and interesting. They are not the disposable slasher movie teen idiots put on the screen simply to die; they are actually deeply crafted with varying personalities and the audience wants them to survive. The tension and chemistry between them helps to build an element of deep human drama that usually is not present in a movie such as this. This is all heavily supported by the great performances by the entire cast.<br/><br/>The Descent uses so many great techniques to make it as intense and scary as possible.For example, the reveal of the monsters is from a shaky found footage perspective that puts you in the moment. Now a days there are entire movies that are found footage, but the Descent only made that one particular scene found footage and it was executed to perfection. The camera-work, lighting, music, sound effects, and special/practical effects all combine to create an effectively creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Descent is a horror-masterpiece that does everything right and is a must-see for any and all horror fans. <br/><br/>It should also be noted that this movie has two endings, the unrated and the US cut version. I HIGHLY prefer the unrated version and I would strongly suggest watching that instead of the US cut."

","A solid modern day horror film may be as common as a Coelacanth fish, but The Descent leaves a bloody mark as a gripping and thoroughly entertaining horror film emphasizing the terrors of darkness, forces we don't know, claustrophobia, and loneliness. An onslaught of gory, adrenaline-driven action and plenty of scares for any horror movie junky, The Descent carries on a story of a group of female hikers that investigate a descent to only be consumed by the darkness and walls that are closing in. they soon discover that they are not alone only to be hunted down one by one by humanoid creatures of unknown ""descent"" (you see where I'm going with this?). While it may seem like a typical monster/slasher film, there's a deeper message: Fear of the unknown. Relentless pacing and solid, realistic performances drive the film deep into the descent of success.<br/><br/>9/10. An awesome horror picture that brought hope to the once-hopeless horror movie genre."
"craigstampermovies","3","3","6","3 October 2013"," Disappointing
","Disappointing. After a fairly promising buildup in which reasonably believable characters are established, things quickly deteriorate into conventional boo moments and run-of-the-mill action. The direction is nothing original; the acting, so-so. Super-loud music and noises, intended to heighten the scares, abound, only emphasizing that all has devolved to physical fights with inhuman creatures in a cave. It's more or less a 50s monster flick with gloss but nothing new to offer. One of our group of six spelunkers - sort of a female rip-off of Burt Reynolds' character in Deliverance - *intentionally* leads her companions into an uncharted cave rather than the mapped cave they thought they'd be exploring (that's how we know we're in for a heavy moral a la Deliverance at some point). Said character does something even more heinous later on, to warrant her inevitable comeuppance, because sacrificing her friends to her own ego is too subtle a sin for likely fans of ""The Descent""."

But still...how can anyone think this movie was anything but GARBAGE! All the negative reviews here are totally spot-on. I should get paid watching 6 the most annoying female characters in the most sorry-a** scenario with the most annoying monsters...I mean, the production was sooo weak it wouldn't even qualify for TV. How did they cramp this down everybody's throat? And some of the shots were even trying to make sense, such as ending a scene with a zoom into some random trees in the woods with no particular reason and felt very odd and forced. Mistakes like that was being repeated again and again throughout the whole film. Honestly, it wouldn't make a difference if no one made it out of the cave. To me the characters, including the monsters, were actually the subconscious reflection the makers of this flick-people who lost all contact with the real world."

All six of the characters are given just enough screen time for you to learn who is who, which is vital for building up the scares, yet something that many other such films fail to do.<br/><br/>* SPOILER WARNING * Sadly, despite being a huge fan of this genre, and sitting through most of the movie with sweaty palms and marveling at the great sets, minimal CGI and overall claustrophobia of it all, the film was undone for me in the final quarter.<br/><br/>I was actually sitting there thinking ""What??"", when two of the characters turn on each other rather than face the menace around them. I won't elaborate on ""why"" this happens, except to say the reasons are simply not strong enough. The victim in this instance is simply not ""evil"" enough, and no amount of back story justification can excuse her death. In fact she's not evil at all. Just irresponsible.<br/><br/>It's an atrocious end that rips all the sympathy from the ""hero"", and utterly flattens a film that was heading for 8/10.<br/><br/>Instead, The Descent stumbles badly like a Olympic hurdler who was leading, only to finish 4th - outside the medals. It's a shame. I can only hope Neil Marshall will try this genre once more, and get everything right. Perhaps watch Aliens and witness how the Ripley character is equally strong, sympathetic and heroic? Even a dark ending needs to have a silver lining, albeit at least a moral one."

","Wow it's been a while since i've seen the movie. But i've finally dug out my copy of the DVD one night, and i was soon astonished by how great this film was. *There are already plenty of well written synopsis descriptions for this film from other reviews and places* All i'm saying is ""this is the film you can't go on with out!"" This has been one of the horror films that have made me trip-out for real in so long. I just wish there we're more good films like this. It's a horror gem to behold. A master piece from Dog Soldiers creator NEIL MARSHELL. Also there have been rumors of a sequel of this film. I'm HAPPY, but i'm also SAD.

"sweetsoda","10","3","6","8 August 2007"," Super movie !!
","This movie was incredible. I recommend it to anyone who is sick of the standard horror movie formula. There were about a dozen cave movies released very close to the time this one was. This is the best one. This movie was really scary. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because I have seen no horror movie in recent memory that has broken the chain of repeditive formulas, so well. I especially recommend this movie to women, whom i think will like a horror movie that is really a horror movie and not a skin flick made to please male movie viewers. <br/><br/>To all that may go to see this movie pay close attention, or you might miss something. Grats to the cast and crew and all the people that made this one its a winner, and not buried in over rated under talented actors, and actresses."
"lone-wolf-007","10","3","6","26 July 2007"," Fear of the Dark
","This movie is excellent in every way. Be sure to watch the director's cut with the extended ending due to the fact that it is more fulfilling. The characters are strong and you sense they generally do not know what to do or how to get out of the situation they have been placed in. They panic and start turning on one another and you believe the situation is dire. The story is deceptively simple but it grabs you and does not let go. The actors are good, the story is good and the creatures are scary and brutal. I can not say enough good things about this movie. I was surprised at how well it worked. I can not recommend it enough. If you like horror or movies in general you owe yourself to see this. It is a crime that not enough people have seen this. Excellent is not enough to describe it. It will make you think twice what may be lurking out in the dark."
"Camoo","10","3","6","28 April 2007"," One of the most effective of all horror films!
","I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this was possibly the scariest damn movie I've seen. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is close on my list. Audition, perhaps. The Shining was more about a creepy atmosphere, but I personally wasn't scared by it's grotesque imagery, twin sisters, child voices, blood flooding, etc. It was a great film, but too surreal and technical to pull the correct nerves. Jaws really freaked me out when I was a kid, but now I watch it with nostalgia and amusement, as with the Exorcist. Again, movies like Friday the 13th and Pet Semetary were pure terror for kids, but now they play like camp slap comedy. Scream was a joke. And never mind the slew of slasher teen horror films that followed, and more recently Japanese horror remakes and ultra-violent trash released on in a wave the past few years, a la Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, Wolf Creek.. So with these all firmly implanted in my memory bank, I went into the theater with very low hopes for this little known Australian film. And it really messed me up! It was a great theater experience, and the director really knew what worked, what to tweak, what to modulate, all to heighten the effect on the viewer. First, and most importantly, he set up a story that was believable, with characters that you care for, and females that are (gasp) intelligent, and none are readily disposable bimbos, removing a chance for a ""Which blonde will die first?"" guessing game in the first half hour. Second, time manipulation. Much like 'Jaws', the director makes you wait, and carefully builds the tension like a great musical piece. Third, story manipulation. It begins a tense, claustrophobic disaster story, then, when you think you're safely confined in the flow of a narrative *BAM!* it makes a sharp unexpected turn for the worst. Fourth, it plays on our deepest shared unconscious fears: claustrophobia, darkness, isolation, heights, intruders... Finally what greatly contributes to the experience is the editing and sound design. Cuts are very carefully made to shock, and the sound is amplified to maximize every small movement a character makes. I really can't recommend this enough, best to see it without any foreknowledge of the story line, because a certain 'entrance' it is quite a surprise!"
"hentschellm","9","3","6","20 March 2007"," The Descent: One of the Best Horror Films Ever and Scariest Movie Ever Made
","The Descent<br/><br/>I made a review on this movie before but I didn't think it summed it up enough.<br/><br/>I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is easily the most horrifying and best horror film since Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>I have to admit when I first saw trailers for this movie, it looked horrible. I had already seen Neil Marshall's other horror film Dog Soldiers which also looked horrible but was pretty good actually. Then I saw great reviews for this movie. I picked it up and with still low expectations watched it.<br/><br/>I was in awe of how well done it was. There were flaws like in any movie. But this movie just did great. I got the unedited version with special features.<br/><br/>Plot: It is a very simple plot. But that does not mean it is a bad plot. This movie wouldn't have worked with a complex plot. Although theories have been developed over parts of the movie but I not going into that. They have many references throughout the movie to different horror films, the biggest ones being, Deliverence, Alien, The Shining, and from what I see The Thing.<br/><br/>Acting: When you look at the beginning credits, I will guarantee you that 95% of you people won't recognize a single actor or actress. This is in no way a bad thing. It gives a more documentary feel making the movie that much creepier. The acting was superb. Except for one scene it is an all female cast. All the girls play their parts beautifully and very convincingly. Special attention should be payed to Shauna MacDonald, Natalie Mendoza, and Alex Reid. These actresses really put all they had into it. Neil Marshall starts slow but he does it well by putting character development so that we will feel for the characters.<br/><br/>Horror: This was easily the scariest horror film since Silence of the Lambs. With almost zip humor except for a few scenes at the beginning, they use almost the entire movie for horror. Neil used all forms of horror. If your claustrophobic as I am you will be creeped out. They use tense moments with a lot of suspense such as the blood testing sequence in The Thing. They use many jump sequences. The gore level is highly intense and some will be nauseated. However, the level is realistic. It's not someone falling down a rock chasm and walking with a scratch, they made it hard to watch but creepy. The creatures were awesome. A Gollum look alike, they used costumes and body paint which made them creepier because they looked more human.<br/><br/>Overall a sensational horror film which should be considered a classic. If you're going to rent or buy, get the unedited, because it is no more violent than the edited version, but the edited cuts about 90 seconds from the unedited original ending leaving you confused. The unedited clears it up and has the special features.<br/><br/>After seeing this and Dog Soldiers, I can safely say that Neil Marshall is the new and modern John Carpenter.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"fedor8","Null","3","6","17 January 2007"," Women get slaughtered in a badly-lit cave.
","Apart from the violent opening scene, very little happens for quite a while. This early part of the movie is spent not on thrills, but on getting us acquainted with the half-dozen main characters, all of which are women. If at least there were some eye-catchers in that bunch, but they're mostly average-looking or worse  and the dialog is dull.<br/><br/>Once the mayhem finally starts, it's relatively bloody, which distracts from the clichés, of which there are more than a few. Having a cave as the setting for the slaughter is a two-edged sword. On one hand, things can get quite claustrophobic, but on the other, it's just an excuse to keep many scenes badly-lit in order to save on the monsters' special effects and make-up. The creatures are solid, but nothing to shout about, looking a lot like Gollum's relatives and friends.<br/><br/>So if you like the idea of having dozens of Gollums slaughter a couple of women in a cave, you shouldn't pass on this movie."
"iheart_ny","10","3","6","12 January 2007"," The Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen
","Horror movies these days have been absolutely terrible...stupid, clichéd, simple enough that a five-year-old could follow them. But, along comes ""The Descent"" and the horror genre is revived. ""The Descent"" reminds me of the ""Alien"" movies; terrifying, yet smart and likable. The Descent simply has it all.<br/><br/>It is about Sarah, a woman who's husband was killed in a tragic (but deliciously bloody) car crash. Her best friends take her up to a cabin for the weekend, and they are about to to on a hiking adventure throughout the mountains and such. But they get caught underneath a cave, and a rockfall blocks their only exit. So when trying to find an exit, Sarah thinks she sees somebody, but her friend Juno tells her that it's only her imagination. It isn't her imagination. She has seen a bloodsucking monster who is out to kill all of the people who cross it.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is led by an entirely female cast, so it is nice to know that women can hold a horror flick by themselves. And there are many scares here, and there's an interesting back story, which is something that all movies need, but they lack. I usually don't like that many horror films, but this is an exception. It is the best horror that I've ever seen and probably the best I'll see in a long time. Add this one to your collection today."

The story is disjointed with things that happen that do not really either tie into the story or have so little significance that it made no sense to even be in the movie. The special FX of the monsters were average at best. They looked like smeagles from Lord of the Rings :/ and were not scary. In summary, this movie was about bunch o women, some a bit wacko, that go down a cave and get killed by lame cavemen who turned into smeagles :/.<br/><br/>Terrible.

"rqs","10","3","6","22 November 2006"," One Scary Movie!!
","""The Descent"" -- what a great title. This British horror-thriller recalls grueling, adrenaline-pumping classics like ""Deliverance,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Alien"" and ""Dead Calm."" It's that good. Finally, a scary movie with teeth, not just blood and entrails -- a savage and gripping piece of work that jangles your nerves without leaving your brain hanging. And so, for a change, you emerge feeling energized and exhilarated rather than enervated, or merely queasy.<br/><br/>Recently faddish torture-and-gore pictures zero in on anatomical violation at the expense more resonant archetypal terrors, those things that go bump in the long, dark night of the soul. Not so in ""The Descent."" The titular drop refers to a cave-diving expedition undertaken by six women, but it's also a breathless plummet into the abyss where nightmares are realized, a descent into primal chaos and madness.<br/><br/>Not that ""The Descent"" goes light on sensations of physical peril. Bodies are pushed, pulled, battered and stretched to the breaking point and beyond. The tight canals and cavernous cavities, sometimes illuminated by the light from pinkish-red flares, make it seem almost like a ""Fantastic Voyage"" into inner space, corporeal and psychological. These women are straining the limits of their muscles and bones, their friendships, and their core beliefs about who they are.<br/><br/>In an American studio picture (which, fortunately, ""The Descent"" is not), each of the women would be assigned one ""problem"" to work through, and one related personality characteristic to distinguish her from the others. I'm grateful that ""The Descent"" doesn't waste much time on obligatory schematic elements. It just takes the plunge -- damn the character development, full speed into the void.<br/><br/>Yes, there's a main character, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who has suffered a recent trauma and needs to be reborn if she's ever going to make it fully back into the world again. Beth (Alex Reid) is her nurturing friend, and Juno (Natalie Mendoza -- giving off a distinct Michelle Rodriguez tough-girl vibe) is the unreliable, risk-taking member of the group who leads this expedition into subterranean Appalachia. (Insert ""Dueling Banjos"" theme here.) There's also a mother and daughter, and the girl's friend, a punkish daredevil who prefers phallic base-jumping to yonic cave-diving. That's about it.<br/><br/>Where the movie comes alive is in the dark, claustrophobic world under the surface, where the women soon discover there's no way out but through. Writer-director Neil Marshall (2002's ""Dog Soldiers"") uses recurring images of penetration (not just sexual, but lethal) above and below ground, looking through bullet holes in a road sign or shooting stalactites and stalagmites in ways that emphasize their potential as instruments of impalement.<br/><br/>He and cinematographer Sam McCurdy have a way with darkness, too; it can be oppressive (as when most of the screen is black, surrounding a small rock tunnel) or a terrifying emptiness, a vacuum to be filled by real or imagined dangers. These flawlessly orchestrated compositions make palpable an atmosphere of tension and dread.<br/><br/>Marshall knows his core audience well. He's studied many of their (and, no doubt, his) favorite movies, especially thriller classics of the 1970s, and liberally quotes from them -- remarkably, without throwing you out of his movie in the process. Part of the fun is in noticing these visual quotations when they pop up, and then seeing what ""The Descent"" does with them. They include explicit allusions (in addition to the movies already mentioned above) to ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Carrie,"" ""2001,"" ""The Third Man,"" ""The Fourth Man,"" ""Don't Look Now,"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Apocalypse Now""... and plenty more.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" works (and plays) not only with movie imagery, but with the stuff of myth and dreams as well. It evokes hellish visions, from famous paintings (Goya's Black Paintings, Fuseli's ""The Nightmare"") to Gothic gargoyles and Dore's engravings for Dante's ""Inferno."" These almost subliminal references help drive ""The Descent,"" and give it a powerful mythic energy. It grasps when and how to draw upon these images to create just the right tone of hallucinatory fear, and set it reverberating in your head. The movie's not pretentious or derivative, it's just uncanny about knowing what to borrow and how to use it.<br/><br/>One warning: Don't let anybody tell you anything about the movie before you see it. The ride is a lot more fun if you don't know where it's headed..<br/><br/>This is the fresh, exciting summer movie I've been wanting for months. Or for years, it seems. Make sure you see this..........."

","All right, I know most people are raving about this movie, and they say it's the best thing they've seen all year; Considering the rather crappy year of films we've had, I have to agree with them. However, I really do not think this film is all that great.<br/><br/>First of all, the film takes WAY too long to get started. I don't mind a little build up for my scares, but this film took TOO long to get started; it took an hour for us to even see the monsters, all for a build up of about thirty minutes of violence. By the time it finally does get started, you've lost all interest in the film and don't really give a crap what happens. Even then, the monsters aren't that frightening - it's nothing we haven't seen before, and the scares are extremely cheap. This film is definitely going to suffer on DVD.<br/><br/>The actors certainly can't be faulted; they all turned in very fine performances. But the material they gave them was boring and clichéd. Definitely in my opinion nothing to rave about. 5/10."

","Lets me start things off by saying I thought I would enjoy this movie. I thought it would be a great new scary movie(hard to come by now a days). I thought it was going to be the new Alien because thats what all my friends who saw it were saying. But after seeing it I question whether or not my friends that were saying that have even seen Alien. Unlike Alien this movie sucked. It did not take to long into the movie to start hoping that it would just end. After every frame I wanted it to end. Not because the movie freaked me out, but because it just sucked. Don't get me wrong. I have seen worse movies(believe me). And maybe the only reason I HATE this movie because of my high expectations. <br/><br/>Now there was a plot (dont get excited though, it sucked also). A group of chicks get together and go search a cave. I'm not going to spoil anything. But as you've seen in the commercials I'm sure, weird looking things that looked kinda like Golem from Lord of the Rings start attacking these chicks. And besides from their random attacking, and seeing the way bats see the movie tells you no REAL reason their down there anyway. There just there. And after the attacks start the chicks try to escape. And there's the movie.

Bad ass chicks that would kick any man's ass in a claustrophobic setting with some troglydites is an interesting premise that hasn't been done as well as this before.<br/><br/>What worked in a subversive way is the subtext of Juno and Sarah's relationship...it could've been a bit more intense in the beginning, their history should've been a bit more elaborate.<br/><br/>An interesting spin on it would've been the bit of Sarah's grief and psychosis throughout the film, especially after the loss of her husband and daughter. As the group of women were walking towards the cave, one of them mentions 'paranoia sets in...' with that said, what if it were all in Sarah's head? Grief and despair are lonely places and I feel the film would've worked a bit better if Sarah constructed the entire 'cave dwelling monster schema' in her head and she's murdering everyone to get to Juno. A bit of Haute Tension, but it would've worked better here and with a more tangible motive."

When a cave expedition amongst friends goes wrong, leaving them trapped under the surface a group of hungry predators make their mark. Even though ""The Descent"" is a horror film it works really well as a thriller, surprisingly it has a good footing and a smart background. Writer and director Marshall uses great camera work with both his and a camcorder to bring that edgy feeling. Even though it is set in the darkness of the cave there is still enough lighting to show the gruesome acts which take place.

","I'm a major lover of horror films, and must firstly say that if you're of the same disposition you must see this film immediately. Easily the scariest thing I've ever seen, this has the biggest and most effective 'jump' in horror-film history. In fact, it hits the mark on several physical scares, particularly in the second half, but it is the first half that distinguishes this film from the majority of modern day scaries. <br/><br/>It is hideously claustrophobic, and I found myself breathing heavier as the characters spelunked deeper and deeper. (If spelunking means caving, as I think it does. If not, I've got to use the word spelunk three times in a review). <br/><br/>Finally, to impress just how scary this film is, when I was watching with two friends, one scene actually caused me to leap from my sofa to the door in one seamless bound and my friends to literally hug themselves in a way similar to Scooby Doo and Shaggy. Funny in hindsight, not so at the time."

Neil Marshall straps you in, sets you up, and has you clinching the seats all the way to the credits. First of all, I think the acting was great. The girls all looked truly terrified and trust me, it rubs off onto the viewer like it should. The plot was well developed and made the characters into more than your typical college teens looking for a scare. Any scary movie that forces you to analyze rather than just sit and wait to be scared can only make the experience more worthwhile. The ""things"" that they encounter down in the cave truly look freaky and it doesn't get old throughout the more. Even -they- have their own appearances which makes every scare seem different. As for the scares themselves, your typical horror movie spooks are there but are done so well with lighting, music and sound that you'll be jumping even when you expect it.

","I know this will come as shocking to many of you, but I just recently saw this film in the States for the first time, and I have to say - after seeing the ""original ending,"" I actually prefer the U.S. version, and here's why...<br/><br/>As a horror fan, I come from what I like to call a ""Purist"" point-of-view, meaning I want to see blood and guts carnage just for the sake of carnage. :) While I respect the open-ended interpretive quality of the filmmaker's original cut, I feel like it adds too much ""psycho-babble"" to the mix. This is a pure and simple monster movie. Well, maybe not so much simple, as I love the back story on the main characters, and it offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do. But none-the-less, it is a *beep* you monster movie, and it delivers. I don't want it to be too thought-provoking or ""open to interpretation,"" as is the case in the original ending. Just like ""High Tension,"" I felt the ""psychotic"" mumbo jumbo actually detracted from the overall effectivness of the horror. Keep it simple, people! It would have been so much scarier if there actually was some psycho randomly killing French farm-country families for no reason whatsoever.(See ""High Tension"" if you don't know what I am talking about.) I just want to have the *beep* scared out of me, and maybe actually feel something for the characters. Did ""Alien"" have to leave room for interpretation? Did, ""Dawn of the Dead?"" How about ""Carrie?"" These are all obviously films that Neil Marshall was inspired by, and in the vein of those films, let's keep things simple, shall we? I LOVED this film. I thought (at least the U.S. version) ended brilliantly, and was BRILLIANT throughout. The story felt honest and brutal, and it reminded me of everything from ""Evil Dead""(the cabin in the beginning anyone?) to ""Alien"" (those ruthless gut-eating scenes, not to mentiong the kick-you-ass style of the women in the film.) Anyway, just a thought. IMHO. :)"

","The idea of an all female casted movie is a great idea, but unfortunately because there's no character development the movie fails to follow through. The characters in this movie are so two dimensional, so when they began to get picked off by these ridiculous ""blind"" creatures I didn't really care. Some are touting this as a woman vs man struggle and woman comes out as hero. If that's the case, I don't want to be a woman. These women are weak, stupid, and uninteresting. The only character I almost took a liking to was the chic that screwed her best friends husband and disappeared after his death. And the only reason I almost cheered for her was because she was the hottest out of all of them. It's just a really unnecessary movie.

","I usually do not like gory horror films but ""The Descent"" got pretty good reviews from the professional critics so I thought I would give it a try. It turned out to be a total waste of time and money.<br/><br/>The production quality is much lower than what we are accustomed to in mainstream American films. The photography is fuzzy and the sound is distorted. The first hour is about a woman's personal tragedy and a group of women who go cave crawling. This part of the film is not made very well and is pretty boring. The monsters are pretty good, but they do not come in till very late in the film and by that point I was already bored to death.<br/><br/>If you like gory horror films, you might like ""The Descent"" better than I did.

"secretdrop","3","3","6","6 August 2006"," Lord of the Rings Meets Babes in Toyland Meets Extreme Caving
","The movie received great reviews for a horror movie and I haven't the slightest clue why. The scariest parts of the movie were even before any monsters are introduced. Just caving as the main characters did alone was horrifying in it of itself and throwing a bunch of monsters in that are no joke... Smeagol/Gollum from Lord of the Rings only lightened the fear factor of being trapped in a cave. The movie is an hour of caving... then suddenly having a realization that no one has died so the movie goes 180 and the monsters just rip everyone to pieces. As horror classics can be, people say and do the dumbest things that typically would never occur in a situation so God bless the character who sat behind me in the movie theater who made obnoxious comments that helped me get by the movie smiling and being entertained. The worst aspect of the movie was predictability. Horror movies have a generic formula of music and camera effects to give a horror shock value that this movie merely took full advantage of. You will be sitting there saying to yourself ""The monster will not appear right now... but in 5...4...3...2...1... bam,"" and he will. There's your stereotypical survivor who went through a tragic accident earlier in the movie only to become a hardcore Crawler killer later. There's your other stereotypical leader who screws everyone over for their actions and ends up paying the largest price... surviving 'til the near end. And let's not forget the ever so essential stereotypical horror movie monster weakness that suddenly changes the fear factor from ""I'm gonna 'shite' (most of the girls are British) my pants"" to ""Wow... you're fighting a bunch of blind monsters in the dark... I'd say score's even."" There's a ton of classic lines in there though you'll leave the theater laughing to. One example so you have an idea what I mean would be after killing one of the Crawlers... the survivors ask their doctor friend ""So what exactly are we fighting?"" The monsters have basically been discovered previously to be blind, excellent at climbing walls, and use hearing to find prey. The doctor says after 25 minutes of the movie being chased by these things... ""Well... they are certainly blind. And well adapted for the underground life."" I'll close saying this much... The Descent is worth seeing if you honestly want to be ""entertained"" for an hour and a half but not worth seeing in least way shape or form if your goal is to see a GOOD movie."

","This movie reminded me of going into the MOANING CAVE in Northern CA. This movie is basically about 8 girls who decide to get together and explore a cave. Why? Because one of the girls needed to recover from her HUSBAND'S DEATH...yes, the same husband who was in LAND OF THE DEAD. He had pretty much no part in this movie which was odd. That entire sequence was strange. So, these girls go into some random cave in Tennessee where they encounter a ton of ""crawlers"" that can't see and look a lot like Gollum from Lord of the Rings but with more of a pasty appearance and they are all wet. So, these girls are very good at killing them but while they are killing them, they are each dying. One strange and meaningless scene was where Sarah tries to would Juno's leg with her pick Axe. Why? Because Juno ACCIDENTALLY killed some other chick in the cave. Doesn't Sarah realize it's a innocent MISTAKE? Anyway, this movie was basic and had surface qualities only, nothing meaningful and zero character development. But it does give you that creepy Claustrophobic feeling the entire time."

","When the Descent hit British theatres one year ago it became a huge success and as a horror buff I for one knew that there was something very special about this picture.<br/><br/>Well a year later, The Descent finally gets it awaited release in the US and all I can say is go see it because The Descent will be this decade's Exorcist in that it already has rave reviews and has to be one of the most terrifying pictures to be seen in the last ten years.<br/><br/>scarier than Scream! scarier than The Exorcist and scarier than Halloween!<br/><br/>The plot revolves around an all female cast who get trapped underground in the Applachain mountains in the US (well Scotland really) during a normal pot holing adventure, however its not before long when the claustrophobia begins to settle in and you are quite literally transported into the caves along side the six women. Lets basically say that the first part of the movie gets its suspense from a Cliffhanger type narrative but before long the tension and indeed the gore breaks new ground when the horror element of the story is introduced.<br/><br/>Basically a great film with great acting, great effects, great story and character development and the reason why this film will be 1973's exorcist? Because just like when the Exorcist was released, people in the movie theatre were constantly screaming, jumping out of their seats and a couple behind me had to leave half way through because the girlfriend couldn't take anymore and when I saw her walk out she was quite literally shivering from the terror on screen.<br/><br/>When it hits theatres August 4th go see it, be part of horror film history!!"
"Carrot-4","6","3","6","21 June 2006"," And the acting saves the day!
","Like I do all the time when I hear about a new independent horror film that has critics and festival-goers amazed, I got my hopes up.<br/><br/>In this one, a group of British girls looking for kicks go caving in new-england and they have a great time until they start being hunted by cave-monsters. As you can see, the premise isn't too original but, hey, we're talking horror film here. The problem here isn't the premise, it's pretty much everything else; first, the movie takes it's time to start, now, usually that doesn't bother me, actually i like it when you get to know and like the characters before they get ripped apart, but they only really develop 2 of the characters so, when people start dying, it's like free gory deaths but you don't actually feel for the characters. Also, the fact that the movie is set in a pitch black environment could have been a real plus but after you see the first 3 or 4 monsters, you start seeing them all the time and really take a good look at them so, after a while they're not really scary anymore not even creepy, just gross. The only moments you're not sure of what you're seeing is during action/fight scenes, which is quite annoying. The techniques used to scare you are pretty lame too, like the ""I'll make you jump so many times you'll have to be scared"" and the ""pan to the left, then pan to the right, then to the left, then to the right, then to the left and BOOM! Big Scary Monster!"" and so on. The last 15 minutes didn't make much sense to me either it just seemed like ""Rambo vs. the Cave-Monsters: The All Girl Version"" with a twist ending that wasn't necessary at all.<br/><br/>So, what did I like? Well, apart from the acting, not much, but the acting was definitely great, kudos to all the girls for pulling this one off because they really save the film. Really, I must say, the mood wasn't very good, the action either, but the acting WOW! Subtle, always on the mark, no useless girly screaming, no overacting, great panicking... Seriously, I hope you girls read this comment to make yourselves feel better because I AM AMAZED! <br/><br/>So, in 25 words or less: like Aliens underground with an all girl cast without guns with less budget and not as good... so, not really like Aliens after all..."

","This is one of the very best horror films ever made, but that's really not a surprise as ""Dog Soldiers"" Director Neil Marshall was at the helm.<br/><br/>I've long been a fan of the genre. Having said that, my disgust with Hollyweird for dumbing down horror is at its peak. Filmmakers, producers, studio execs, ad nauseum, seem to think their audience is made up of a bunch of slobbering nose-pickers with a mean I.Q. rating of seventy. Remake after sorry remake continue to churn out of the American movie making machine, fixing what was never broken, safely editing the resulting schlock to earn a PG13 rating so that all the kiddies can get in on a Saturday night without Mommy and Daddy. It's enough to make a girl want to pull all her hair out at the roots.<br/><br/>Enter ""The Descent,"" which is intelligent, well written, well acted and one heck of a ride. Talk about a girl's trip gone awry...Six strong, smart women leave civilization (well, somewhat; they are in the heart of the Appalachians. Shades of ""Deliverance,"" which is unsettling enough) to explore the depths of an unknown cave. They're well prepared and they make all the right decisions, but from the moment they descend into the mouth of the cavern they are screwed. It's painful to watch the mental unraveling of the main character, Sarah, and likewise painful to realize that escape from the hell they find themselves in is futile, but to me it's part of what makes this film so great. These characters are easy to like and sympathize with, and none of them are safe.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of the same old tired formula horror--and if you liked the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake--don't bother. If, however, you like a good scarefest with some brains, you must see this movie."

","I am a caver, and knew that the sets were mostly studio before I saw it, so was very pleasantly surprised by just how good the sets are. A few inaccuracies- mostly the cast's clothing- but also some amazingly realistic touches: in the close-up of them rigging the traverse across the chasm, there is coloured tape around the krab (fastener) so the owner can tell it is theirs. Yep, we all do that. I also loved the part in the same scene where the first obsolete equipment is found in a ""new"" system... uh-oh. Also the night before, with them all drinking beer in the cabin- yes, all the cavers I know do exactly that!<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the Crawlers mostly were real actors, not CG- much more work involved and they look good close-up. The Descent is a great horror film, but it would also be a great movie if there were no monsters and it just followed them trying to find a way out.<br/><br/>Put me off caving? No way.

"Superunknovvn","6","3","6","19 March 2006"," Good claustrophobic horror movie
","""The Descent"" is a horror movie that avoids the genre's clichés for the most part. There is no inane nudity (if nudity can ever be ""inane"") and the first appearance of horror elements isn't rushed. The all female characters and their relationships to each other are explained decently enough and after a short intro we enter the dark cave with them. The more time the six women spend underground the more the claustrophobic atmosphere and the constant darkness begin to affect the viewer, too. You are trapped down there with them and as you watch them getting lost you begin to feel just as uncomfortable as they do. As if being trapped in an unexplored cave wasn't enough, creepy, flesh-eating creatures start turning up and all hell breaks loose. The second half of the movie is a gorefest galore.<br/><br/>For a story that could easily have turned into a predictable and campy b-movie, writer and director Neil Marshall brought out the best of his little flick. The creatures look pretty good (could they have been inspired by the infamous K-Fee spots, by any chance?), the pacing is tight and fast, and, as I've said before, Marshall really knows how to create tension. Personally, I was a little turned off by the general darkness and the quick editing, though. Most of the time it was hard to make out what was going on, which was a bit confusing and annoying.<br/><br/>Anyway, Marshall has already deservedly made a name for himself among fans with this movie and ""Dog Soldiers"". Hopefully he will continue making horror movies as well worth seeing as ""The Descent""."

","This is most definitely one of the best thriller/horrors in years. The suspense and intensity of the action is almost perfect. this gives what lies beneath a good run for it's money (for lack of better words). With all the Japanese ghost story horrors like the ring, the grudge, darkwater and so on, this is a very welcome surprise. The movie grabs your attention from the start giving the impression it's going to be a gruesome flick. This then changes to a slower pace in witch you totally forget you are actually watching, in what is in my opinion, an incredibly clever and intense horror. Then all of a sudden the tone changes back to gruesome and after that, things REALLY start to get funked! The scream moments are just timed so good, that even watching it for the 5th time in a week (yes that good) you still get shocked every now and then. In short, there is no excuse for not seeing this movie. (well unless you are not old enough maybe and don't get parental permission to go see it, though luck then ;))<br/><br/>See it... Fear it...

And in the second part, when you think you won't be able to watch another second of the movie, so depressing it is, the vampires attack! Preety soon, the group brakes apart, the weaker ones are hunted down, the stronger ones grow up to become fighters. Able to use bones and axes as weapons, two female Homo Sapiens start wreaking havoc among the tribe of vampires, killing seven in total. That left about hundred of them alive in the tribe... And in the end, when the salvation is near, one of them exacts revenge on the other, and flees towards the normal world... only to find out she is in fact crazy and hallucinating her escape, while still inside the cave, having given up the fight and waiting for the vampires to come for her. One of the most interesting points: the cave had been explored by other people before, yet no one knew of its existence, meaning - No one EVER COMES OUT ALIVE!

"drweir","10","3","6","17 October 2005"," An Excellent Descent
","The Descent is a 2005 British horror movie by director Neil Marshall, whose only other notable outing is 2002's Dog Soldiers. It stars 6 unknown British (and 1 Australian?) actresses, who go on a caving expedition in the Appalachian mountains. It's clearly a low-budget film. Oh, and yes, it's ABSOLUTELY GREAT!! I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, except for the above description, and of course that as soon as they descent into the cave, woeful things start a-happening. I went in with that knowledge, and found that it suited quite well.<br/><br/>The Descent follows the classic blueprint of the horror film, but with a few ingenious deviations. It also incorporates elements from the psychological thriller, mainly concerning Sarah, who can be described as one of the two main characters, and does so with great results. As I said, this film is mainly a horror film, with all its accompanying startle-scenes and gore, but it admirably avoids all encounters with the realm of clichés and cheesiness. I got so disturbed during this movie (""scared"" isn't the right word, and so isn't ""freaked out"", ""disturbed"" is the best choice) that at around minute 70-75 out of the whole 99 minutes this movie takes, I just wanted to leave. That, and this was the first film in at least 10 years (since I was 13) in which I screamed in the theater. As the movie progressed, and I could see a ""scene"" coming on, I just wanted it to be over with. That's because each one of the scare-scenes is so perfectly balanced and immaculately timed to create the maximum effect, without ever becoming routinely or dull, like way too many of today's horror films. The cinematography also does a great deal to elevate each scene beyond the ordinary in films of this genre.<br/><br/>The human element in this movie is also well constructed and never too cheesy. Which leads me to the acting. First of all, having only women as the protagonists of a film often becomes contrived or artificial, due to the filmmakers' knowledge that they're not using men like almost always. In this film, however, the characterisation is perfectly natural, the female characters never feel too ""objectified"", that is, there only to look tough and sexy, or too ""feminist"", that is, too aware that they're the protagonists of a story and therefore must use the opportunity to show how strong women can be. The characters feel real, and aren't stereotypically good or bad. Each person has her defining elements, but never becomes two-dimensional.<br/><br/>All in all, The Descent is the best horror film in many, many years, and a long-awaited rejuvenation of the genre. 5 out of 5."

","Very rarely do I write a review about a film, but this one really justified me doing so.<br/><br/>I'm going to say out-right that I loved this film. I'm not a horror fan by any means, finding all the recent British crop such as 'Creep' and Hollywood's ""Boogeyman"" very poor. This wiped the floor with them.<br/><br/>Set in an intricate cave system, the story follows six women getting trapped and trying to escape, but they are not alone. The first act follows the women from their arrival at a cabin in the middle of nowhere to the titular descent, and once down there the film really moves up a notch.<br/><br/>This film will make you jump. One scene involving a view through a video camera made me leap out of my seat, which was a first for me, it was brilliant. The gore is strong, yet not overdone, and the characters all mostly fleshed out.<br/><br/>The acting is strong and interesting, and the idea is a very unique spin on the trapped cave adventures. I felt it was much more interesting having the group all female.<br/><br/>This is the second film I have seen by director Neil Marshall, after the excellent 'Dog Soldiers' and hopefully he will now get a shot in Hollywood. He's very much earned it. If I was to write a horror right now, he would at the top of my list for directing. Capable and imaginative, the man knows how to shock and create tension. Superb.<br/><br/>The film does lose two marks for the first act. It's acceptable, but you just wait for them to get into the caves. The ending was also not too clear, but that leaves the audience to interpret for themselves, an interesting move.<br/><br/>Overall, the best British horror since ""28 Days Later"", and certainly on par, if not better when down the caves. If directors like Marshall keep producing films of this quality, perhaps their is hope for the industry yet.<br/><br/>-Stu"

No wonder it got an 18 it fully lives up to it with the amount of genuine shocks and scares .. lots of brutality and gore and i love how it's all done to women (and they're not your typical screaming bumbling idiots as most horror movies portray them) The 6 female leads really pull it off both physically and in their acting ability, when the s**t hits the fan you do feel for them unlike some throwaway horror films where you're actually wishing for the cast to be killed off! I think the fact that it's set in such a confided dark space (personally pot holing is something that scares the s**t out of me anyway) is scary enough, but these women really face it all - they get trapped in there and haven't hardly any food, tools to get out let alone a route to follow and then get attacked by a group of mutant 'humans' just tops it off!! Dog Soldiers was class .. this was super .. and his next film 'Outpost' sees a group of oil rig workers facing a zombie like plague spread inside while their stuck their in a storm sounds like it should be a hoot! Neil Marshall is like a fu**ed up Hitchcok of the 2000's, his writing and directing really is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre and i really hope people don't avoid this @ the cinemas and let it become a cult classic @ the home market like Dog Soldiers was!! Oh and well done to Cellador (those who make Who Wants To Be A Millionaire) for giving this guy the money to make the film (and make it they way he wanted to) .. apparently lots of studios weren't interested even though he was so praised for his debut film! The only complaint i have is the kinda weird but very Inglewood ending!"

","The sportswoman Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) loses her husband and daughter in a car crash, but she survives. One year later, her friends Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (Myanna Buring) and Holly (Nora-Jane No one), leaded by Juno (Natalie Mendonza), invite her to explore a deep cave in the mountains. When the expedition is about three kilometers underground, a rock collapses and blocks the access tunnel, trapping the group inside the cave. With limited supplies, they try to find a way out, but sooner they face a hunger and savage breed of predators.<br/><br/>The storyline of ""The Descent"" is not original, inclusive a couple of months ago I saw a very similar movie called ""The Cave"". But on the contrary of the foregoing film, ""The Descent"" has a great screenplay, with a scary, claustrophobic, tense and gore story, and a psychological study of the characters under a huge condition of stress, deteriorating the relationship among them. The use of light and darkness in the special effects transmit a sensation of fear for the unknown. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Abismo do Medo"" (""Abyss of Fear"")"

I was very interested in this movie because I do the potholing and at last there is a movie in my favorite scenario! my only problem was that I think the director and the crew not even considered asking a professional guy about the whole thing... Come on, just imagine that you go down to a cave, and crawl on the rocks with a short sleeved T-shirt that really let's you watch the women's breast. yes, absolutely correct outfit for caving! but OK, it's just my view, ""normal"" people (I mean not the cavers) doesn't care about it. but the whole film was stupid, horribly made and not scary at all... I was suffering during watching it, really. One thing really annoys me. and this is about the respect for the caves. these idiots go down, every time they throw the glowing sticks into the pitches... who will get rid of these stuff later? so, all in all, it is a bad film. but it would be OK for me if at least the potholing stuff were OK... but no. don't watch it."

"Bunuel1976","7","4","10","11 February 2006"," The Descent (2005) ***
","Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS (2002) with this nail-biting sleeper. After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE (1972) mode, the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise. The all-female cast members are relative newcomers, a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements, the supernatural and, at times, themselves. It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the ""Crawlers"" (with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up) for as long as he does; if I were to nitpick, I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different 'voice' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC (1997). The surprise, downbeat, open-ended 'twist' ending, then, is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before."
"olethrosdc","9","4","10","24 January 2006"," A near-masterpiece of slowly mounting horror and tension.
","This is a truly remarkable film. The opening is full of subtle tension and the first shock of the movie is timed impeccably and executed very believably. This early first dramatic moment is essential in reminding the viewer that this is a horror film and creates a sense of anticipation that will be sustained throughout the rest of the film's introduction. The remaining half hour or so of introductory and character-building scenes is occasionally punctuated by a cheap shock - something which I think undermines the overall slow mounting tension of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The film's strongest point is the way it portrays the fear of the unknown, of darkness and of confined spaces. Soon, these mundane, but very effectively conveyed, fears are eclipsed by the first glimpses of the lurking horror. This quickly brings on a change of pace and character in the film, with the amount of gore increasing considerably, though the fact that everything is shrouded in darkness mercifully hides some of the horrid details (though perhaps they are more strongly pictured in one's inner eye than when shown explicitly). The last part is composed of action-packed scenes punctuated by brief delirium, terror and anticipation. The final crescendo is triply surprising, though there is another cheap scare that almost destroys the cumulative effect.<br/><br/>The characters are very strong for this type of film and elevate it to something above almost any other horror film you might have seen of late. The musical score works extremely well with what is going on. The photography, camera angles and camera movements are executed flawlessly.<br/><br/>Apart from a slight overindulgence in shock scenes, which might merely be a matter of taste, and the fact that a few times the movie makers seem to underestimate the audience's intelligence, the movie is well worth watching. As an extra plus, for once the interactions between characters are important and add substantially to the tension.<br/><br/>Some very minor spoilers follow.<br/><br/>Firstly, the shock scenes. I am not sure why they had so many of them, but it appeared as though they felt that they just felt they had to maintain the interest of the more gaze-wandering part of the audience. On the other hand, some of the shock scenes were very realistic and useful. One such scene was the one with the crows over the corpse of the deer. Since I have once encountered a similar scene while walking around in the woods I could empathise with it quite a bit, though I must say it is not nearly as horror-inducing without the stench. But it does foreshadow the hidden threat very effectively.<br/><br/>The cave system itself is depicted wonderfully; it gives one a sense of awe in its juxtaposition of large and small dimensions. The climbing scenes are extremely believable as far as my limited experience goes, and the dangers of wandering around in dark places are portrayed nicely, though I am not sure it is possible to get severe rope burns while wearing gloves.<br/><br/>The creatures themselves are wonderful, though I would have preferred them to be almost completely silent minus gnawing and rending sounds, as were the monstrosities in the very similarly themed Lurking Horror.<br/><br/>I think that sums up my complaints. Do watch."

","The scariest horror movies of all time, The Descent not only delivers dread, claustrophobia and heart pounding shocks, it benefits from incredibly realistic and devoted performances from the best female lead cast, here is a huge thumbs up to Shauna McDonald, Natalia Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane Moore who play best friends on a caving expedition which takes a deadly turn as they are trapped and pursued by a bloodthirsty subterranean breed of predators. It takes a good 45 minutes before you get the first glimpse of what's lurking in the shadows, but before that Director Neil Marshall expertly stirs dread layer by layer as the girls venture deeper and deeper, and if you're claustrophobic avoid this, even if you're not you'll still have a hard time squeezing past these tight moments. The Descent features one of my favourite scenes in a movie where Juno can't find a way out as there's no breeze, surrounded by several tunnels Rebecca screams out for help in the never-ending darkness, and as the night vision camera pans to Rebecca, a disfigured and horrific looking creature stands behind her, the girls scream and separate and the survival games begin. What follows on is a masterpiece story of survival and the lengths we will go to, there are moments that are both visceral yet hard on the emotions and some nasty twists that look hopeful for the characters when really this nightmare will never end. I screamed out loud, swearing in horror yet was absolutely thrilled by this utter master in terror, you must watch The Descent."

The only part that seemed a bit eerie to me was near the beginning of the movie, in the hospital hallway.<br/><br/>I didn't even watch it to the end, fell asleep halfway through, so I don't know how it ends, and I'm not bothering to find out. The characters are boring, annoying, and you won't feel even a slight connection to them during the movie. They all kinda looked the same to me. Although, that's not surprising, since nearly the whole movie is done in a PITCH-BLACK ENVIRONMENT! The monsters we're hilarious to say the least, and all jumpscares are so predictable, you won't even bother to blink when they happen.<br/><br/>All in all, avoid this one.

","I always get fired up when I find a good scary movie. It's such a specific genre and it's becoming more and more difficult to find originality. Instead of inventiveness and imagination we're getting Teenagers Having Sex and Getting Killed, remakes, and a never-ending supply of Saw films that just keep coming off the assembly line.<br/><br/>The Descent really surprised me because I remember completely dismissing the previews. An attractive, all-female group of friends get together to go spelunking in the Appalachians and find themselves getting picked off one by one by cave dwellers. Snore.<br/><br/>What surprised me though was how the director and the writer paid attention to the story and the relationships, which ultimately makes any film scarier.<br/><br/>On the trip, the leader of the group takes it upon herself to bring the girls to a cave system that has yet to be charted. After a collapse in the cave leaves them stranded for a way out, they find themselves ""descending"" deeper into the caves looking for a second route. The deeper they search, the more information is revealed about the bonds between the women. Some are strong, others cripplingly weak but these ties provide the characters with dimension and a believable resilience.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was taking the story out of the standard setting and into a place that felt truly claustrophobic, consequently making the viewer just as panicked and anxious as secrets are exposed and the odds are dwindling. The ending is pretty good too..."

","I am going to be very incisive in my review.. so be fore-warned..<br/><br/>So we have a bunch of hens with an attitude problem - they try out death-defying feats, to prove their physical fitness and prowess. They also guzzle beer, gossip, console each other, and frequently, screech at each other too. Fine.<br/><br/>In due course of time, they decide to explore a tunnel in the Appalachian Mountains (in case you didn't know.. these mountains were made famous by 19th century author, Washington Irving, who based many of his eerie stories in the Catskills, an extension of the Appalachians in NY state). After much screeching and beer-guzzling, this group manages to enter a tunnel, and promptly get lost inside, because the tunnel had not been explored earlier.. and the guide book had not been brought inside (purposely). After more screeching, twists and turns in the dark, damp crevices, they come across strange hairless beings, whose only preoccupation seems to be biting these unfortunate friends of ours. Must be really hungry, these fellows. The way these subterranean creatures crawl all over the the roofs and walls of the tunnels would put Spiderman to shame.<br/><br/>More screeching and bloody killings later, the film ends abruptly. By this time, I was too bored and sated with all the bloodshed, and did not feel like rewinding the end, just to see if I had missed anything. Surely a film cannot be so fatuous and pointless?

","Contains spoiler? (as if it were possible to ""spoil"" this waste of celluloid) What is this, some sort of mass Internet hoax where a thousand people get together and submit good reviews for an appallingly bad movie? Or did Neil Marshall pay off his family and Facebook friends to do so? Either way, how this mess ever earned its current score of 7.4/10 is beyond me. I generously gave it a second star solely for its premise, a group of girls going spelunking and getting trapped. THAT had the potential for a good movie, but noooo... it wouldn't have kept the attention of the ADD-suffering younger crowd, so they also had to spice it up by tossing in a tribe of cannibalistic Bat Boys lifted from covers of the Weekly World News, right down to using echolocation that sounds like the pathetic throat-creaking used in The Grudge. What they SHOULD have tossed was this whole film... into the incinerator.<br/><br/>The ""scary"" creatures were instead completely laughable, despite using the trite old formula of having the movie become dark and quiet, then accompanying sudden movement with loud noise. Cat jumping onto a trash can lid in a dark alley, anyone? Please. If that weren't enough, we're also ""treated"" to a misleading storyline that turns out to really be just a ""dream sequence."" Oh well, if it worked for The Wizard of Oz, it should work for 1842 other movies too, right? Nah, it's time to finally put these tired old dream sequences to BED."
"politehere","10","3","7","3 September 2010"," One of the most enjoyable horror films I've ever seen

There are people here who complain about the ""cheap scares"" yet they fail to admit that over 90% of the ""horror"" movies out there totally lack effective scare tactics even simple cheap scares. At least this movie made me jump at certain times which is a plus.<br/><br/>The idea of a group of girls trapped in a cave which has never been explored by anyone is fantastic. Never once did I get bored watching the six girls traverse across the tight tunnels which filled up much of the time of the film. The sense of claustrophobia was beautifully conveyed to the viewers, yet another plus.<br/><br/>There were more than enough gore and interesting brutal fight scenes. To those who complain about the plot holes. You really need to read what the director has to say then you will see that the whole film is about a conflict and an unpleasant secret which is revealed about the betrayal of the leader of the group to Sarah and it all happens in an unusual setting deep down under the ground. The way Sarah fought the ghouls reminded me of The Resident Evil and it made me enjoy the movie even more.<br/><br/>The scene where Sarah climbs a slope covered with bones crawling towards the light was indescribably artistic and the fact that the ending leaves you in a state of shock and despair is very pleasant.<br/><br/>Adding the survival genre to the movie makes it even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has everything I expected to see. 10/10."
"gio_mack","2","3","7","19 April 2010"," A typically poor British attempt . . .
","I was excited to watch this film after having seen it on the shelves in several places but not got round to renting / purchasing it. However, it was only once I was about to unwrap the plastic and put it in the DVD player that I realised it was a UK film. Oh oh... too late though, only one way to find out I thought! The film appears to have been written by a feminist, kicking off with a group of pre-menopausal women trying to live exciting and apparently thrill seeking lives. The chosen idea is to go exploring a cave. After several scenes of the women acting like female larger louts (or at least their fowl and uninspiring language), we finally arrive at the Boreham Cave (or as one character quite rightly coins the phrase 'Boredom Cave').<br/><br/>A factor that contributed to my growing sense of boredom was the pointless delaying of any action (was this an attempt to build up a feeling of suspense from the story mentioned on the rear of the case?). But this was nothing compared to the great frustration I felt from having to endure the constant sounds of women groaning, grunting and moaning in what sounded like watching a documentary on pregnancy. These sounds may have been perfectly acceptable if they were trying to defend themselves from monsters; but no, they were simply doing what they went down there to do - exploring. Climbing across a rock. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Anyway, as the film gradually progressed there was a lack of true suspense for me, and as the ending approached the story seemed to leave any clear path or direction it could have went in. Also sad to see effects used changing in a very noticeable manner at one point.<br/><br/>To sum up this movie was the same as any other British 'horror' I've seen. In my opinion we should just leave the genre to the Americans."
"RockPortReview","10","3","7","19 February 2010"," Clausterphotic Horror at its BEST!!
","The Descent 2/15/2010<br/><br/>The Descent is one of the most nerve shredding and scariest movies of the last decade! This was British director Neil Marshall's second feature film. His first was the brutally vicious werewolf movie ""Dog Soldiers"". Neil has a great feel for the horror genre and it shows as there are several homage's to classic horror films within this movie.<br/><br/>The Descent is a unique film in that it has an almost all female cast. The only male meets a nasty end less than 10 minutes in as his family is involved in a car accident. The man's wife (Sarah) and daughter (Jessica) survive. Throughout the movie there are small clips of Jessica holding a birthday cake that also comes into play in the UK version ending (more on that later). One year after the accident Sarah meets five of her girlfriends at a cabin for a cave exploring expedition in the Appellation Mountains. There's nothing like a little spelunking to relive some stress, I guess. This was an all British production that was also filmed in Britain but was set in the eastern United States. It must be our fine American Mountains. All the women are well cast and relatable. At times it can be hard to tell a few of them apart with all their gear on, but the filmmakers do make a conscious effort to avoid any confusion. When they get down in the caves, anyone who is even a little bit claustrophobic will totally freak out. These women are constantly squeezing through tight spaces creating a very tense atmosphere. Since the caves are completely dark the only lights the filmmakers use are the ones brought down by the women. A lot of scenes are lit by flares, giving everything a menacing red or green cast to it.<br/><br/>As they explore deeper and deeper into the caves one of the girls slips down a slope and we get see one the most disgusting injuries known to man (or woman), the compound fracture. Maybe it's just me but seeing bones protruding through your flesh is just not right. Anytime this happens in a movie you know they are so done for, this was no exception. The bad new continues to mount when they start seeing things. This is our introduction to the Crawlers. These possibly former humans have evolved and adapted to suit their environment. They are completely blind, but have heightened sound and smell. The action between the women and the crawlers is intense and frenetic. This crazy action has its consequences when one of girls mistakenly kills another. What makes this film so scary is the fact that the crawlers are blind. In many instances the women are face to face with them or hiding just inches away. The women get split up and despite their best efforts start to die off. Our main character Sarah turns into a modern incarnation of Sarah Connor from T2. She is quite the crawler killing bad ass. <br/><br/>Like I mentioned in the beginning, the ending has two different versions. The U.S. version has Sarah escaping from the caves and driving off. While the U.K. version adds another scene on top of that making it a much ominous ending. U.S. audiences prefer happy endings, hey who doesn't. The Brits I guess."

","(This movie definitely made me think twice about ever going cave-diving!!!)<br/><br/>More than a few critics this year have hailed ""The Descent"" as one of the scariest horror movies of the last 10 years. For once, they're right. I've seen a fair share of ""Saw"" (another Lionsgate franchise) over the last two years, but ""The Descent"" is in a whole other ball park by itself. Claustrophobia? Darkness? Gore? Nasty monsters? You bet. ""The Descent"" has it all.<br/><br/>The story is that six adrenaline-charged females are trapped underground by a cave-in. With nothing around them but darkness, they strive to stay alive long enough to find the light. Unknown to the women, something is lurking within the darkness, just out of sight, watching their every move. And it soon becomes a battle for survival as the women are hunted down and eviscerated by some really nasty creepy-crawlers.<br/><br/>The director of ""The Descent"" is Neil Marshall, the Brit responsible for 2002's ultra-bloody werewolf adventure ""Dog Soldiers."" Marshall made a name for himself with that picture, and ""The Descent"" contains the same sense of wall-to-wall action as ""Dog Soldiers,"" except that the action here is literal, much rather than figurative. The gore factor is extremely up there (perhaps even more extended in the original unedited version) and those creepy-crawlers I mentioned? The first image of them is sure to stick with you; for once in a long time, the protagonists are terrorized by creatures that are actually scary.<br/><br/>Many of the females are pretty, and tough, and able to handle themselves in hand-to-hand combat with the creatures, and so the body count on both sides sort of evens out. So, ""The Descent"" sort of turns into a battle royal toward the end. These women are strong, giving their characters that extra kick of girl-power, and alas, there's no gratuitous nudity here although one girl is seen taking a shower, and the movie doesn't pause to give us an excuse for T + A. It's all about survival, and seeing what's ahead, or as far as the beam of your flashlight will go.<br/><br/>Though the movie is set in the United States, many of the actresses do lousy jobs of masking their European accents. (Maybe it would've been better if Marshall instead kept the horror in Europe? It still would have given ""The Descent"" an exotic appeal that doesn't conform to shoddy American standards).<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is one tension-filled and nasty horror masterpiece. Just pray for daylight if you ever get trapped underground with nasty creepy-crawlers.<br/><br/>10/10"
"InaneSwine","8","3","7","30 September 2006"," Directed with masterful precision

During their attempts to escape, they discover something very nasty lurking in the underground labyrinth. Marshall tightens the screws on the viewer with masterful precision, even if the geysers of gore are sometimes so unintentionally comical as to defuse his carefully wrought tension.<br/><br/>While the American version of the ending delivers a good scare, the British delivers a much more thought-provoking and open-ended cliffhanger, while still including the American's scare."

Then Sarah stabs her before they leave the cave... they should have both just went and left together, there was no good reason for her to die.

"supertom-3","9","3","7","21 September 2006"," Fantastico!
","Completely out of the blue this film hit horror fans for six, and general movie fans too. The Descent is a movie very much in the tradition of Alien and The Thing and represents probably the best creature horror since The Thing. Director Neil Marshall sets the film up to play on the audiences fears of, the dark, being buried alive, confined spaces, and the unknown. It's a simple idea that Marshall has to put these women down into a cave with merely flashlights and flares to light their way, but as the history of this genre will show you, it's so, so easy to get wrong (The Cave, essentially the Hollywood, and as such less artistic and subtle, version of this). Marshall who did the highly rated comedy horror Dog Soldiers before this, steps up a gear for The Descent, delivering a genuinely creepy and unnerving horror film. The film is brilliantly shot and the use of locales is superb, particularly the antithesis of the wide open Scottish countryside at the films beginning, with the claustrophobic atmosphere of the caves.<br/><br/>The plot follows a group of women, always searching for the next natural high. This year it is caving. One of the women, Sarah, lost her husband and her daughter in a tragic accident the year before, on her way back home after some white water rafting. While the instigator of the ladies adventures, Juno, harbours guilty feelings because she had been having an affair with the husband. So we already know something will come to a head inside the cave between the two, once best friends. The caving starts off okay until a section collapses leaving the (attractive naturally) ladies having to find an alternate route out. As the film progresses it's not only the dangers of the caves terrain that the ladies overcome but also the horrible looking bat people dwelling inside, who naturally have a taste for human flesh.<br/><br/>What makes this film work is the fact that Marshall makes you care about the characters. He gives them all a personality. Similarly the film has no stars in it and there's a surprise factor as you try and guess who'll get picked off and in what order. Similarly it's very atmospheric and well shot, and the score from David Julyan (whose brilliant work in Christopher Nolan's first three movies, I loved) is ambient and suitably indicative of the horror to come. All the cast are excellent, particularly Natalie Mendoza and Shauna MacDonald. Marshall too directs with assurance, and flair, perfectly capturing the caves in much the same way Ridley Scott captured the confines of the ship and it's air ducts in Alien. Marshall is building himself a reputation for doing quality British genre movies, and doing them very well. Lets see if he can keep it up. <br/><br/>All in all the Descent isn't merely a decent movie of its type, it is in fact one of the best of its genre. A film that will continue to garner a cult following. It's a movie that American filmmakers of late have seemingly just viewed as impossible to do with subtlety, and skill and decent acting. Intent to go for cheap and therefore ineffectual scares. The Descent takes time to build up it's tension, and knows when to pull the audience in, only to give them a jolt of pants dampening fear when they least expect it. While the brilliant score from Julyan is anything but schlocky, overwrought and predictable. A brilliant film. ****1/2"

","After watching this movie i was surprised. I read a lot of reviews before watching this film and nearly everyone said it was very scary. But after watching the film I didn't get scared at all not once did I jump or said maybe i should turn this film off. With that said this film also has a lot of positives. The actresses where very good they all played there part just fine. The concept of the movie was very good and original. The music i thought fit the movie perfectly. The creatures where amazing very cool looking. The violent scene's where very gory. The setting and the lighting of this film was very well done it actually makes you feel like you are in the cave with the girls if you watch the movie without the lights on. Another problem this film had was that it took so long to get the movie actually started, all the real action and fun starts an hour into the movie only leaving 30 minutes of none stop action which isn't completely bad. By the end of the movie you get very much involved with the characters and everyone that you don't really want them to die. I would recommend this film to anyone that likes horror movies and who knows maybe it will scare you, I love horror movie but i still haven't found one that has scared me so because i don't think its scary at all it doesn't mean you wont. So watch it an enjoy it and just have some fun."

","I happened to be in the Houston area when I saw this movie; and there seemed to be more marketing for this movie in Texas that back home on the east coast. I have to admit, I went to see the film with a bit of skepticism; as I am an old fan of 'Aliens'. However, I found myself a bit surprised with this movie. All those Texans in the theater, were shouting and screaming at certain points of the film and I guess that's a good thing. At first I felt the movie took a little long to develop itself and, at the end, I felt that I saw two separate movies. However, I quickly became convinced that this movie was based more on Sarah's psycosis rather than the ""monsters."" I think she may have been hallucinagenic and that perhaps there really weren't any monsters to begin with. After all, she did ""mistakenly"" kill one of her friends, which spun off another series of different but curious events in the film. I'm certain that a sequel will follow that will eventually explain the original in greater detail. All in all, the movie provided for some good screams (atleast in Texas)and I guess thats a favorable thing. It's a great movie--I haven't seen a great scary movie like this in years!"

Cannibles live amongst the rock as they plead for human flesh, so they start killing everyone. There's only one survivor at the end and the ending is messed up. You might need someone to watch it with because it's frightening as hell and thats why I love it.

I wasn't extremely frightened throughout this film, but the combination of action and throwing some very horrifying scenes at the audience really helped me enjoy the movie the whole way through. Not to mention the primal survival fight scenes they mix in.<br/><br/>What really sold me with this movie were the scenes where the only thing visible was what was illuminated by the yellow glow of the flashlights, and around it was a border of empty abyss. I felt like I was inside the caves with the characters. The film throws some very interesting twists at you which I will not spoil for those of you who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>My only critical thing to say about this movie is the ending scene. It was very anti-climatic, and took way to long. But don't fret, the movie will make up for it.<br/><br/>This is not only a great violent horror, it is also a suspense thriller, with a mix of phobia.

","I heard some good things about this film, and I really liked Dog Soldiers but even so this was better than I thought. This is one of the few horror films that had truly fleshed out characters - I really felt I knew these people and was sorry when they died.<br/><br/>The fact that this film essentially featured 6 women was also great. Despite other reviews, I definitely did not see this as women vs men. It was women vs creatures. The creatures were both men and women - it was an entire culture/family of creatures.<br/><br/>But this film is as much about relationships and people dealing with their own issues as it was about the monsters.<br/><br/>For horror fiends, this is a real treat too. Great FX, lots of gore and - thankfully - no nudity for an mostly female film. It was nice that despite women getting soaked (with water, blood, etc.) that there were no 'wet t-shirt' shots was very refreshing.<br/><br/>I have heard there is an alternate ending that played outside of the US. But I liked this one too, so am hopeful the other one will be on the DVD.<br/><br/>This is an extremely well done film that can satisfy horror, drama and both male and female audiences.

"dfranzen70","7","3","7","30 August 2006"," Chilling and claustrophobic
","Six adventurous friends, some recovering from a tragic accident a year earlier, embark on a spelunking expedition in big ol' cave in a desolate part of the Appalachian mountains. Suddenly, there's a rumbling in the earth, and the entrance is blocked behind them. And that's about when they realize they're not in a mapped cave, but rather a new cave that their ersatz leader Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) wanted them all to ""discover"" and perhaps even be able to name.<br/><br/>The women do not fall under the typical categories for horror films; all are strong, tough, kind, resilient, and indomitable. They don't screech at the slightest noise or movement just beyond their line of vision. At the same time, though, they're not all uberfit adrenaline junkies out for another thrill (one character remarks that she's an English teacher, not Tomb Raider). All bring something unique to the team, such as scouting, climbing, or medical knowledge.<br/><br/>So there's your situation. Six experienced cavers are trapped in a cave that may or may not have more than one entrance. Will they be able to use their combined skills to find another way out? Perhaps, but the situation quickly worsens, as they discover they're not alone in the cave - one of their number spots a Gollum-like creature climbing the walls and ceiling of the cave. Eeek! The ladies discover that the creatures aren't benevolent at all; they're blind (think mole men, really) and track their prey by sound, like bats, and they're utterly carnivorous.<br/><br/>The overall question that the movie poses to its audience is: Will the friends work as a team, as they always have, to escape their predicament, or will they turn on each other? It's not a question with a simple answer; the women all like each other, but they don't necessarily like each other equally, as would be the case in any small group. Take minor tension among them and add a severely traumatic situation, and nerves will be frayed, with possible tragic results.<br/><br/>Director Neil Marshall did a fantastic job of scaring the bejeezus out of me at the appropriate times. This isn't a film that just throws a whole bunch of blood and guts at you, hoping something will metaphorically stick. The chills are calculated, sometimes coming one after the other, others laying in wait for the right time to pounce. Marshall's pacing prevents the film from lagging while not overwhelming the viewer with imagery and special effects. I imagine it's not easy to convey true dread and trepidation when most of your scenes are in literal darkness. Indeed, Marshall, who also wrote the screenplay, is perfectly adept at putting the viewer in the place of the six protagonists, allowing us to feel just as afraid as they do.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are some minor problems with the plot. Sometimes the connection between certain items is a little too blunt (i.e., the camera lingers on something, so you just know it'll come into play somehow later in the film). But these problems really are inconsequential in the grand scope of the film.<br/><br/>Personally, I found it to be particularly terrifying, because I am a little bit claustrophobic. Elevators are fine, but anything smaller than that would make me wig out. Some of the scenes in The Descent take place while the women are crawling through the tiniest crevice in the rocks - that, as a matter of fact, is where two of them find themselves when the cave entrance is abruptly closed. Truly frightening stuff.<br/><br/>Another caveat, though: This is a very gory film. People are liberally covered in blood; there are stabbings and guttings and smashings and what not. If you're the type whose own blood makes you squeamish, you'd do well to avoid this film."

","A group of friends go on a caving expedition in the Appalachian mountains. When they descend to and make their way through the caverns there is a collapse, which cuts them off from some of their gear. What's more is that they are in a section of the cave previously unexplored. And they are not alone.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall, writer and director of the brilliantly simple yet hugely entertaining horror/action film 'Dog Soldiers' returns with 'The Descent.' If 'Dog Soldiers' was ""kinda like Aliens"" then this film is ""kinda like Alien... with more then one monster."" Racking up a great and frighteningly claustrophobic atmosphere that few horror films successfully achieve. The 'descent' into the cave is played out both psychologically - as hope fades and trust among friends deteriorates - as well as viscerally - packing in some truly intense gore.<br/><br/>A strike that may be unfairly labeled about the film that it is a cave horror movie and 'The Cave' from roughly a year ago kind of sucked. Believe me when I say: this is nothing like the mediocre, glossily produced, poorly shot, stupidly plotted, and painfully generic ""The Cave"" which also lacked any sort of tense atmosphere. 'The Descent' is appropriately simple - no scientific explanations and reasoning that tries to explain the horror, because if you are being chased by monsters would you stop for a little science experiment? I should think not, even if you are a Nobel Prize winning scientist. The monster aspect of this movie is also played out better because of that since these are creatures hunting and no predator would take a convenient break to allow its prey to come to terms or rest for a bit. Well some do, as certain films demonstrate, but they make boring horror movie monsters!<br/><br/>Also, on a side note, Sam Raimi is looking to remake his classic 'The Evil Dead.' Not the greatest play in the book, but since he is on the look for a new director he should look no further then Neil Marshall, who is able to develop a simple plot very well and use small scale production values to a great effect.<br/><br/>This is a great horror film and ranks right up with 'Silent Hill' as one of the years best. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for intense horror violence/gore and profanity."

","I write this in August of 2006, and unless this movie is total fluke, I anticipate to hear more of Neil Marshall. Good reviews and a nearby theater with decent parking lured me out to THE DESCENT and I'm glad I saw it. Despite an opening that too heavily resembled FINAL DESTINATION and it's offspring, this movie picks up a completely original concept and runs away with it. If you've seen the trailers or read most of the reviews, you already know it involved both getting stranded in a cave and monsters. What you can't anticipate is that it also bothers to invest in its characters enough to evoke something more like ALIEN and less like, well, anything less well done.<br/><br/>I've heard the British ending is more ambiguous than the American one. From what I've read (I'll spare you the spoiler) it's not so much ambiguous as it is unfinished. The American ending is more definitive, a much needed feature to a film so thrilling. When you're gasping for breath, you want to know it's all over, finally.<br/><br/>I walked out with my friends and we agreed (1) we had no interest in spelunking and that (2) picking apart certain logical fallacies in this movie was folly. Sit down, scare it up, and walk away thrilled, and yes, perplexed. There's a twist at the end, but it's not a ""who lives and who dies"" kind of twist. It's a bigger, moral dilemma, and an interesting choice for a genre so content with killing whomever it likes."

There are scenes which would make claustrophobics hyperventilate. There's no denying it: This is a scary one. But it's so much more than that.

I've seen so many horror films, and have yet to be even remotely scared. The Descent was different. This is the only movie I've ever seen that actually scared me, and apparently I wasn't the only one. After getting outa the theater both of my friends looked shaken, and a kid who walked out after wards was pale as a ghost. He look at us and said ""I never should have seen that movie by myself"". This movie definitely gets the adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>This movie lacks plot, as well as explanation as to what these creatures are that are chasing them. It was a little disappointing that it was never explained, but honestly it really didn't take away from the movie. Its other greatest flaw is that it will always be referred to as ""that movie like 'The Cave'"". The Cave is a god awful movie, and sadly The Descent will always be compared to a knock off of it.<br/><br/>The good stuff, well the movie starts off in a rather scary setting. The fact that the whole movie is filmed with the girls trapped inside these enclosed caves give it a real creepy feeling. You immediately get a sense of claustrophobia, and then to top it off these creatures are desperately trying to find them. I don't want to spoil anything, but the creatures in this movie were great. They really gave off a feeling of feral bloodlust and it really made them creepy. The Film work was wonderful throughout this movie, whether it be the lighting or just the shots, it really helped to give the movie a really creepy feel.<br/><br/>This movie is not just jump out and scare you horror (which it has) its a legitimately scary movie.

","As a horror fan, this movie gets me excited because it seems like we're finally heading in the right direction again with horror films. I found this movie to be very creepy and I definitely enjoyed this one quite a bit. I'll tell you one thing, before this movie even introduces the monsters, it shows you just how terrifying and dangerous cave exploring can be and it does it effectively enough that I swore I would never lower myself into some unknown darkness via rope.<br/><br/>The story involves a young woman who loses her husband and daughter in a horrific car accident and after taking some time to get her head together, decides to go cave exploring with her girlfriends (I have to add here that I've never met women who are this adventurous in real life... to have six of them together in a film like this gives me hope). Things go wrong as you can already imagine and you end up with a movie that in lesser hands, could have been a total piece but ends up being a genuinely scary movie. It's not the scariest movie in the world but it's better than a lot of what's been coming out as of late.<br/><br/>I thought the actresses (I fell in love with Ms. Mendoza who plays Juno..... I love you!) were really good and I loved the way that they were able to use the most subtle expressions to communicate. Looks are traded and you can basically fill in the blanks. I thought they interacted very well with each other and unlike other horror films, I didn't want them to get butchered as I began to sympathize with them. But guess what? You can't have a horror movie without people getting decimated and decimated they get. I wouldn't recommend this movie to the squeamish and people who are claustrophobic because while I'm not claustrophobic myself, there were several moments where I began to feel short of breath.<br/><br/>I loved the story and the tragedy that enfolds it. The way things turn out are understandable in a way but still makes you say, that's just not right. I won't ruin it for you but if you see it, you'll see what I mean. The gore effects are pretty good and I thought the monsters were okay as well. In all honesty, I enjoyed the movie's first half a little better than the monster fest of the latter half because the scares were rooted in reality. There was a moment where one of the girls gets stuck in a tunnel that was just cringe inducing.<br/><br/>I'll end the review by recommending this film highly.

But of course, it still had it's share of cheap scares. The atmosphere was great though as was the acting and everything else about the movie. I will say though that I would most likely only watch this movie in the theater or on a big screen TV. I don't think it would have the same effect on a small TV. Another thing is for anyone who is claustrophobic, there may be a couple of parts that make could make you uncomfortable. I know it had me writhing in my seat a good bit. I would highly recommend that anyone who likes horror movies go see this one. You won't be disappointed."

If i saw that movie a year ago i might have cried of being so scared. Not only the scare was amazing but the acting. The Lady who plaid Sarah had a really hard acting job to do. The Beginning of the movie she was a really timid scared girl with a horrible past and by the end of the movie she was a tough psycho lady with boots. The only part of the movie i would probably change is the beginning, there was way too much of the wemen reuniting to the point where it became almost boaring, But the ending redeamed it.

"BackFire83","9","3","7","7 August 2006"," With 'The Descent' Neil Marshall Joins the Ranks of Great Horror Filmmakers.
","Over the last few years people seem to have forgotten what the point of a horror movie really is. They seem to think that it's to merely ""gross out"" simply by showing violence (Saw) or get startled by something moving quickly on screen and making a loud noise. Even recent horror films that I've greatly enjoyed mostly used either one of these tactics. With The Descent, Niel Marshal reminds us all the point of horror films, and does it beautifully.<br/><br/>Starting slowly and using the pacing of a suspense film at first, we are shown the characters. They decide to go cave diving after one of them suffers a terrible tragedy, in hopes that the adventure will give her some fun and excitement. Things begin to go wrong almost instantly for them once they enter the cave. A few jump scares here and there, most of which can be seen a mile away even by a casual viewer, we're lured into a false sense of quiet suspense as the claustrophobic atmosphere is created for us to slowly take in, and their obstacles slowly get more and more dangerous. The ""descent"" into true visceral horror happens gradually, the arrival - suddenly. Once the horror starts, it doesn't let up. This is a film of such tension, such palpable, real fear, that it is almost overwhelming.<br/><br/>Few films actually scare me, few disturb me, this movie did both. From it's terrifying premise of one of the most horrible situations imaginable somehow becoming MORE terrible, to it's immensely skillful execution, to the monsters, which I think are some of the best movie monsters I've ever seen, this film could not have been better. The film moves from simple jump scares to deeply disturbing and morbid terror, mostly created by both the disgusting creatures that pursue our hero's and the cave itself, so seamlessly that you won't even see it coming. However, something that is also very unsettling is the witnessing of the character's slow ""descent"" into madness, caused by their dire and hellish situation.<br/><br/>The blood and gore is great in this movie. It's used, not to create the terror, but to enhance it. And it's never done to entice and excite, the violence is so damn excruciating, it's what gore should be used for.<br/><br/>With 'The Descent"" Neil Marshall cements what I (and probably many) had thought and hoped after viewing Dog Soldiers - his other masterpiece - That he is one of the greatest horror filmmakers in the world, one that I think has a long long career ahead of him."
"missykat","8","3","7","6 August 2006"," An Homage to Great Horror
","Neil Marshall is someone Hollywood horror movie makers should pay attention to. He managed in Dog Soldiers to make arguably the first believable, action-packed, modern werewolf film (the werewolves themselves were even realistic-great costumes!) and in Descent he manages to make you care about a bunch of girls who go spelunking and get eaten by blind, slimy cave crawlers.<br/><br/>Missing in a lot of low-budget horror, however good the scripts may be, is the elements of good film/video quality and good acting. The Descent has both. Marshall takes you right into the action from the very beginning, and takes plenty of time (but not too much) getting to know the characters. The jumpy moments aren't cued by the film score, and they're never when or what you expect. There's plenty of suspense and the sense of claustrophobia is so unbearable I had to let go of my fiancé's hand just to give myself some room to breathe.<br/><br/>People were literally screaming in the theatre--always a good sign. I saw the US release and liked the ending, though I've read conflicting reviews here that the UK ending was better. I also feel there are a lot of homages buried in the film. Elements of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, Carrie, Apocalypse Now are obvious...other scenes (the hospital) are eerily familiar and effective.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have liked for Marshall to have done differently is to set the film in Europe where it was filmed. I mean, come on. Can't inbred cave crawlers exist ANYWHERE in the world but in Appalachia? As a native of the region, I'm a bit tired of the stereotype. I mean, how in the world would a hot group of adventurous British babes ever find their way to the back woods of North Carolina? It would never happen. I'm just glad there were no banjos pickin' in the background."
"CMRKeyboadist","9","3","7","6 August 2006"," Review on the American Release
","I, for the past few years have been pretty disgusted about seeing horror movies in the theaters. All the PG-13 horror films coming out seem to swarm the theaters to naive movie goers. I have been seeing the previews for ""The Descent"" for a few weeks now and thought it looked interesting, but not interesting enough to go and see it in the theaters. It wasn't until I did some research on the movie and found out that it was directed by the same guy that did ""Dog Soldiers"" that I got really interested. So I decided to leave work early and go and check it out in the theaters.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty simple. A group of close women friends are thrill chasers. This is how the movie starts out with them white water rafting. It all comes to a horrible halt when Sara (the lead actress) and her family are in a horrible accident killing both her husband and her daughter. One year passes when Sara finally decides to get her life back on track. She meets up with her other women friends and they have already planned to go spelunking in an old cave in the middle of nowhere. When an entrance in the cave collapses they are all trapped and must figure another way out. What they don't know is what is lurking in the darkness waiting for them.<br/><br/>I was absolutely impressed with this film. ""Dog Soldiers"" was a good movie but this really shows just how good of a director Neil Marshall really is. The characters are built nicely so when they start to die you really feel awful. The big thing for me was just how incredible the lighting was in the movie. 90% of the movie they are underground and the lighting is done very realistically. The violence in the movie is outstanding and should wet any gorehounds appetite (myself included). What I have been reading recently is that the ending of the American version was heavily chopped and dumbed down for the American audience. Doesn't surprise me. Without giving anything away, the American ending does seem cliché and I already know how the original ending was suppose to be and it sounds much better. If you have a multi-regional DVD player get the British version on DVD! That is what I just got done doing.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, even though they dumbed the ending up for American audiences it was still a really great film. Get the British version and see the American theatrical release. 9/10"
"MakoSucks","9","3","7","6 August 2006"," Descent...into AWESOMENESS!
","Finally a horror movie that actually lives up to the hype, and goes beyond it. The concept alone, of being stuck inside of a cramped and pitch black cave is frightening by itself. Then they add these pale, white, bald and naked humanoid monsters into the mix and it becomes the best horror movie in theaters since god knows when.<br/><br/>From the start to the end, there are a lot of great scares throughout the movie. A lot of which is slightly familiar, but still effective. Than there's the massive amount of violence and gore. Its great! Pretty well presented and brutal. There are a lot of cool shots that really enhance the gore, violence, and horror of this great flick. The ending sequence was kind of out of place, but it was still a pretty good ending.<br/><br/>All in all a great horror movie, with a lot of gore and blood, with a pretty good story, and flow of action. Way better than the recent diarrhea of crappy movies, like Hostel, Slither, the Exorcism of Emily Rose, and all the other forgettable horror movies of the year. See it for an actually good horror movie."

","I just got back from a midnight screening of the film and let me tell you that I am greatly satisfied by what I saw. This is a film with a simple plot and a limited cast that draws it's strength from its intensity. And intense it is! The last half of the film is brilliantly executed. Neil Marshall knows the genre well. The dynamic range of his camera--from epic, Peter Jackson-esquire aerial photography to the tight, narrow, womb-like confides of the cave setting--make brilliant contrasts. He also knows a thing or two about human nature, which plays a huge part in the films success. This film kind of reminds me of the brilliant 1997 sci-fi horror film ""CUBE"" in that it shows that even protagonists--the best of humanity, if you will--can become feral, murderous creatures under pressure. Add to this an often great music score by David Julyan, solid and entirely believable characters and performances all-around, and carnage that even the most demanding horror fan will be pleased by, the Descent is a terrific little horror film that does not disappoint. Like the aforementioned CUBE, the ending--not the cropped US ending, which is missing the last climactic scene but the real ending we will hopefully get on DVD--is uncertain and bleak, and will follow you for a long time. I just sat there when the film was over. It was a profoundly impacting horror flick, and in a day and age when unoriginality reigns king of the genre, ""The Descent"" is a gem in a coal mine."

","If you appreciated Neil Marshall's ""Dog Soldiers,"" this movie is for you. It is intense, suspenseful, and provides a lot of jump-scares and gore. Horror fans will not be disappointed. The storyline is straightforward: A group of women go spelunking and encounter flesh-craving cave dwellers. Insanity ensues. What makes this movie good is the fact that the characters are believable and developed enough so that we care about them, but not so developed that we get a drama instead of a horror flick. Also, the cave setting they find themselves in provides plenty of great opportunities for claustrophobia-inducing cinematography and minimalist film-making. This is a back-to-the-basics horror film, but the effects are realistic. There is a cave, a group of women, monsters, and the darker side of human nature - a combination that scares, excites, and doesn't let us down. This is another excellent horror film in the tradition of other recent successes in the genre, such as ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Wolf Creek."" <br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"nived84","10","3","7","4 August 2006"," The Descent is on par with Carpenter's Thing and Scott's Alien
","Neil Marshall. Remember the name; he just might be the next John Carpenter. Personally I've never heard of the man. Four years ago he directed a low budget horror flick called Dog Soldiers. Apparently it must have been a pretty good show, because the sick minds over at Lionsgate gave the dude some quick cash and went on to create one of the years most intense and startling horror-thrillers that manages to easily dodge most of the silly and lame clichés that often plague most modern day horror films. The Decent echoes touches of Ridley Scott's Alien, Brian De Palma's Carrie and John Carpenter's The Thing, and does so in brilliant fashion. I say if you're gonna steal, you might as well steal from the best. The Descent is essentially the polar opposite of Alexander Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes; it takes place in a wet and confined climate, deep underground and in total darkness. It's a terrific setting and used amazingly well. This is what I image last year's The Cave was trying to do with a PG-13 rating. Well The Decent most certainly earns it's R-rating and doesn't hold back on any of the blood n' guts. And with a running time of just under a hundred minutes it certainly packs a good, solid punch. This is the stuff classics are made of.<br/><br/>The Descent is about a group of six young women who love exploring and adventuring. One of them is still recovering from a horrible accident that occurred over a year ago. Her friend's think she needs to get out, and go on a cave diving exploration trip, hoping that it'll help her take her mind off things and help ease her tension. Yeah, right! As you can tell from the previews there's something not quite so normal about these caves; there's something very evil and terrifying living deep beneath the surface, and worst yet... it's hungry. That's all I'm going to spill on The Descent; it's a film that is a much more effective journey if you don't know what'll happen next. The direction is masterful, the music is gripping and yes, the scares will have you popping' outta your seat! If you like your horror movies with plenty of blood and gore, tons of suspense and extreme tension and a bunch of girls kickin' some serious ass than I'm sure you'll get a real scream out of The Descent. I would easily rank this as one of the scariest and most intense horror films in years. I seriously didn't expect a horror film to match (or even exceed) this year's The Hills Have Eyes, but I was dead wrong. Definitely see this one on the big screen, because it certainly won't feel the same seeing it for the first time on DVD."

The audience I saw this with in January (@Sundance) was completely sucked in, screaming, roiling in pure fear. The film stayed with me for several days afterward - in fact it did something no film has ever managed to do: it gave me nightmares. The night I saw it I could not sleep, it was that powerful in its ability to shock and make one's blood run cold. The direction, cinematography, and execution are delivered with mesmerizing skill. Bravo to everyone involved in this total masterpiece, not just in horror but for cinema history itself. This is a classic. Unforgettable."
"freaky_dave","8","3","7","4 August 2006"," A terrifying movie that draws comparisons to Alien
","The Descent is so far the best horror movie of 2006, and one of the best in a long time. It draws comparisons to Alien and understandably so, but it is still not quite on the same par as that excellent horror film. But it is an intense engaging thriller nonetheless.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with three female friends on a white water rafting trip. They are about to finish their trip while the husband of one of them stands on the side with their daughter. This would be Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) husband. The sense of doom starts from the beginning, and continues onward into a big shocking scene which works perfectly.<br/><br/>It is now a year later and the same friends are meeting to go on a caving expedition. Sarah is still having nightmares about that shocking scene earlier in the film involving her husband and daughter, but she goes on the trip anyway. She meets up with the two friends that were with her on the rafting trip as well as three others. One of those two girls who had been on the rafting trip is Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and we already know from one of the beginning scenes that Juno had an affair with Sarah's husband, yet Sarah doesn't know it yet. This is where the suspense starts and only increases as these girls soon find themselves struggling to survive at first a cave-in which makes things more difficult, and then something even worse as they discover they are not alone in that cave.<br/><br/>Neil Jordan, who directed Dog Soldiers a few years ago, directs this film with an outstanding touch. He uses different shades of light as well as shadows to make this film even more claustrophobic,that by the time the monsters come around 50 minutes into the film, your nerves are already on edge. So when the monsters appear and the blood and gore starts, you are swallowed up by the carnage.<br/><br/>There is not a lot of character development in this movie, but that is not the point. This is one effective horror film that will have you thinking after you've seen it. I know it will be on my mind for awhile.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect. It does not have the same effect as Alien did, but it does come close. With the exception of one scene near the end involving two of the characters that I just couldn't quite accept as something that one of them would do, this film works by making all of the characters believable. The performances were very well done, and maybe that's why I couldn't quite accept what happens between those two characters. Maybe others will see it differently, but I'm not about to give that little spoiler away. You'll have to see the movie and understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Overall this was an effective horror movie and well worth seeing. It has suspense, believable characters, and gore. All the things that make up what I think a horror movie should have. And on one final note, parents please do not bring young children to see this movie. It's R rated for a reason. I say this because I saw some parents with children under six watching this film."
"TheMovieMark","7","3","7","4 August 2006"," Nice spelunk-a-dunks, ladies!
","Smothering. Suffocating. Stomach-churning. All words to describe the feeling of Rosie O'Donnell sitting on your chest (I lost a bet in college once; don't ask). But these words also accurately describe Lionsgate's European horror import The Descent. I wish ""scintillating story"" were two other ""s"" words I could use in my cute little description, but I guess we can't always have it all. Darn you Bogey and McCall! <br/><br/>Be aware that this is a film for hardcore horror films. It's gory. Gorier than I expected. If you're not in the mood to see thumbs digging into eye sockets, heads being bashed against rocks, sharp objects going through jugulars, or the cringe-inducing sight of broken bones and gaping wounds then you might want to look for something a little lighter to satisfy your entertainment needs. If you're a self-admitted wuss then you'll probably feel more at home at a James Blount concert. But if you like a slice of horror served raw, gritty, and with nastiness to spare then The Descent will highly entertain.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is effectively eerie, the tension is constant and claustrophobic, and the cave setting rarely allows a moment of comfort. Some of the best visuals happen even before we're introduced to the cave-dwelling creatures. I felt uneasy just watching these lovely ladies crawling through tight spots and hanging over cavernous spaces. The creatively subtle use of music only adds to the discomfort and helps make our anticipation of what's going to happen even more unsettling than what we eventually see play out on screen.<br/><br/>I also really liked seeing a handful (plus one) of girls flex their toned little muscles and kick some monster rumpage. I don't always need my heroes to be big tough guys with five o'clock shadow to spare and cigars to chomp. Feel free to give me some ladies who are ready to throw down and refuse to cringe and cry in the corner. Of course, I prefer that they be fit and fairly good-looking. I am a male, after all. But the director is to be commended for using the ladies as more than mere window dressing.<br/><br/>Granted, I'm not sure how the deformed-looking Gollum creatures could easily kill huge animals and strip them to the bone yet they were easily punked out by some skinny gals, but that's just one of those internal flaws that you have to resign yourself to not obsess over.<br/><br/>There are a few of those throughout the film. The biggest flaw being that there isn't much story of which to speak. Read my plot description and you've got about 90% of the story. Though I do highly recommend that you pay careful attention to who's who and what's what at the very beginning. Otherwise, you might be confused as to why certain things happen at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There's still a good chance you'll be confused anyway because for some inexplicable reason the filmmakers decided to go the whole ""let's make the audience scratch their collective head and go huh?"" conclusion. Why? It's a disappointment. I wanted a finale that would really knock me over. Saw's final 10 minutes come to mind.<br/><br/>I've heard that the European version's ending was more satisfying, so I guess I'll have to wait and see if the DVD gives me the closure I was craving. Something a little less clichéd, perhaps. We know; women scorned have a lot of fury. Apparently Hell is no match for them. But come on, would... no, I won't say any more; I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm stopping here.<br/><br/>The Descent won't appeal to all audiences, but it'll definitely please all you horror fans who are sick and tired of crap like When a Stranger Calls that thinks 90 minutes of a phone ringing is satisfactory tension.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>If you like your horror films loaded with atmosphere, tension, and gore then you'll be highly entertained by The Descent. However, if you demand a deep plot and detailed backstories then you just might be disappointed. Your best bet is to go in fully prepared to ignore the film's logical flaws and its sometimes crutch-like usage of cheap (yet effective) ""jump scares."" The faint-of-heart need not apply."

Certainly not for people who has been searching for movies where people in masks start chasing young girl down and stabbing them the very first minute of the movie.<br/><br/>The Descent is about six girls who are reuniting after an incredibly sad car crash (this made me jump the first). Some minutes later you see the six going in the cave, surprise surprise, they enter the wrong cave.<br/><br/>For people who haven't heard of this movie but do want to rent it, the movie contains an good amount of gore, story, jumps. The down part is Juno, she really just gets on my nerves with her attempts to calm everybody down. The crawlers really look like hobbits from Lord of the Rings, except they look like they had an bucket of acid over their face some seconds ago. The movie is settled in an pitch-black cave, you hear crawlers screaming and rocks moving. In the beginning you'll see Sarah getting stuck while she was moving in small holes which makes it seem claustrophobic (sp?).<br/><br/>Back about the gore, the gore is fantastic. Especially for a new epic cinema movie. Movies like the Grudge and The Ring doesn't show blood. Unlike their Japanese versions made before them, the Japanese The Descent (which I also watched) was abit better then the new The Descent, thats because the original Descent really laid back in Crawlers and story, yet many buckets of red paint where thrown on people. It didn't seem realistic, the zippers on the coat didn't either."

Don't judge it from the advertisements) The director Neil Marshall's last movie Dog Soldiers was horrible, so i wasn't expecting much from this one.

","A few years ago I read review after review about how great Neil Marshall's ""Dog Soldiers"" was. I checked it out for myself and unfortunately I did not think it was good at all. Now ""The Descent"" has created positive buzz globally and I again fell for the positive buzz trap.<br/><br/>In his newest film Marshall produces a story about a group of women who are extreme sport enthusiasts and their spelunking vacation. I commend Marshall for making the film male free, but he didn't succeed in making me feel sorry for them b/c of this. I mean in 1960 sure, now no. The group finds themselves in an uncharted cave and running out of time to find the exit. The group keeps moving forward, pushingpushingtrying to make it out of this desperate situation.<br/><br/>Soon though they find that they are not alone. This was a generally intense moment, but from there the film drags out until it's ending. The group must now not only race to find an exit, they most race from the cave cannibals. The film failed for me really because there are times in the film where the drama requires the viewer to have an emotional tie with the characters. This bond was never created. If it was, then it was light and went missed.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is a film I could see a lot of people enjoying.

I loved the fact that it was so gory etc as i enjoy these type of films and also i enjoyed watching a film that was easy to follow. the actresses in it were also talented and i loved that that film was an all-female cast for once. What let it down was the fact that the ending was unclear, was she dreaming? i am not too sure what was going on. you never get to find out what the creatures are and how/why they live there. also, you never find out why 'Juno' took them down the wrong cavern & i have no idea what the young girl with the birthday cake was supposed to represent...help anyone =)"

","Six girls in their early twenties go on a caving expedition in a previously unexplored cave. When the entrance to the cave collapses, the girls must try to find another way out. However, it soon appears that they are not alone in the cave.<br/><br/>This movie appealed to me for several reasons. First of all, it really scared me, which most horror movies unfortunately don't do. This movie brought to me some pretty vivid images that stuck to my mind for hours after watching this.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie went straight to the chase. As movie watchers, we are often subject to movies moralizing over certain questions, as e.g. religion and political issues, even though these issues are not part of the plot of the movie, and this moralization can sometimes be quite irritating. British-made ""The Descent"" didn't have any of this. It is clear already from the beginning that the director has one single goalwhich is to scare the heck out of you.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I'm very glad that the ""hero"" in this film isn't the average Hollywood hero who has some kind of weakness that he/she manages to overcome in the end of the film. The characters in ""The Descent"" are characters you could find in a good novel. None are pure good and none are pure evil. You actually have to use your brains in order to make up your mind what to think of them.<br/><br/>The minus with this movie was that the plot was too thin, and even though a horror movie's main goal is to scare people, there should be a good story behind it. Since I all the same was thrilled from beginning to end, I only remove one point from the total score and give it a 9/10."

","Oh my god what a thrilling and captivating experience that was. Since this movie made me and my family jump at some of the scenes then it did the job that it was meant to do. (We don't scare very easily). We say that it has an absolutely brilliant plot, the acting seemed real, (not just acting, pardon the pun). It made us seem like we were really there because we were riveted to our seats from the beginning. If you like gripping scenes, a bit of blood and guts, but keeps you guessing though-out the movie, then this is the movie for you. We haven't seen a movie like this one for many years. Thank you to all the makers. :-) We hope that this is helpful to you. Enjoy. Thats all I can say without spoiling the movie."
"jluis1984","8","3","7","14 March 2006"," Brutal horror classic!
","Neil Marshall gained his entry to horror hall of fame and a cult-like following after only one film, his hugely acclaimed werewolf masterpiece ""Dog Soldiers"". Now, and to prove that he is not a one hit wonder, he returns to the genre with this powerful movie that takes the horror back to its roots and keeps the tension to the max. Just like his previous movie, ""The Descent"" seems to be destined to become a horror classic; and along with Aja's ""Haute Tension"" and Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", prove that the horror genre is alive and kicking.<br/><br/>The plot tells the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), a extreme sports enthusiast who, a year after the traumatic event that killed his husband and daughter, decides to make a new excursion not only to prove herself, but also to reunite with her friends. Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), the expert adventurer of the team, leads the group but their previous experience won't prepare them to what they will find inside the cave.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is, at its core, a tale of survival horror, but it also explores psychological horror, as Sarah's mental state is balancing between sanity and madness. That and the claustrophobic feeling of isolation inside the cave really sets the perfect mood in the film. The movie takes its time to explode, slowly developing the relations between the characters before and during the trip.<br/><br/>While the story is very simple and at times predictable, it is the execution of the film what shows its true brilliance. The awesome use of lights and shadows to create tension and to distinguish between characters is superb, and the music follows the actions in the film with perfect tone. The dark atmosphere and the feeling of claustrophobia enhances the suspense and the film's rhythm during the last third of the film feels just like a roller-coaster. It is truly, a descent to madness.<br/><br/>The characters are very well defined and it is a nice change of pace to see a cast of young adult women instead of the typical teens that seem to infest modern horror movies these days. The acting is very good, and Shauna Macdonald makes a great lead character. The rest of the cast was also very good, and all seemed very believable in their roles, specially Alex Reid and Saskia Mulder.<br/><br/>If a flaw is to be found in the movie, it would be probably the fact that the story is quite simple and a bit predictable. Unlike ""Dog Soldiers"", this one is a more straightforward survival horror movie; however, Marsdhall's perfect direction and the great performance of those involved truly makes the difference between a typical horror movie and a soon-to-be classic.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" may be a proof that even the simplest story can make a terrific movie if the proper care is taken. Neil Marshall excels in this film and confirms what everybody thought after ""Dog Soldier"", that this British young man is a name to look after in the future. 8/10"

"Canadacatdejected-1","8","3","7","20 February 2006"," A scary and disturbing film that also manages to retain a strong sense of emotion
","Given That Neil Marshall's debut film, Dog Soldiers, was such a muddled affair than it is of great surprise that his second movie proves to be something of the reverse. Despite the fact that the film is a virtually re-run of Dog Soldiers: The Descent proves to be both disturbing and scary whilst also being surprisingly emotional. Drawing from films such as Deliverance and the Alien series Marshall manages to create an effective sense of claustrophobia and fear. This sets the perfect backdrop for the chaos that follows as the six women understand just why the cave remains unnamed. Yet, this film would not the film that it is without the three female leads (Natalie Mendoza in particular stands out)and the brilliant score from David Julvan. This coupled with Marshall's effective sense of direction gives the film an artistry that one would not normally associate with the horror genre. And that for a genre which is often so predictable and restricted is praise enough for this film."
"ianrthompson","8","3","7","18 February 2006"," Excellent Film and Very Scary
","Neil Marshall has done it again! Dog Soldiers was a masterpiece - a werewolf and soldiers film for the boys. The Descent is a film for the girls. Actually, that's not fair. This film is fantastic! Like Dog Soldiers, it doesn't rely on a massive budget. It relies on a good story to do the job.<br/><br/>The Descent tells the story of a group of girls who go exploring an uncharted cave and find something that they don't really want to encounter. I'm not going to say anymore because that's all I knew about the film when I watched it and I thought it was brilliant. And the ending is superb.<br/><br/>When I write a horror novel I want Neil Marshall to turn it into a film. He is a genius."
"jithunnair","9","3","7","5 December 2005"," Amazing horror
","When i give this movie a 9,it's for being a superb horror flick, irrespective of how good it fares as a complete movie - i'll leave that upto you. Yes, there is fiction, there are imaginary creatures (i hope they are :P ) but the thrill, the chills, and the kills are so very real that they make you jump out of your seats till the very end. The very beauty of good horror is in startling the viewer when he's least expecting it, and The Descent does a good job of it! Another plus point is that the horror is created in a situation that is totally new (atleast to me)- the darkness, the water, and the constrained paths all combine together to add to the horror. It's gory, very gory, but the grit and determination of the characters seeps into you till the point when you yourself want to take a pickaxe and join them in their crusade against the god-knows-what-they-are-called! Definitely not for the weak-hearted! If you want to get the best out of it, do what i do with every horror flick: rent a DVD, pump up the volume, lock yourself in your room, turn off the lights...and let the scares begin !!!! You'll have the scare of your life, I guarantee !"
"verm1n","6","3","7","11 November 2005"," Brilliant start, awful from middle to end. :/
","I think the crawlers(cave monsters) spoiled to whole movie for me, after the first one it was Bad b-screamer all the way to finish. The cave trolls looked sh*t BTW, their teeth for one, looked like they belonged to a talk show guy. And in the fight screens they were slow and clumsy, the perfect evolved cave trolls? yeah right..<br/><br/>It would have been much more scarier and exciting to watch them trying to get out of the cave. Just seeing them climbing through the tight holes made my skin crawl. They had not many batteries left, they were starting to panic - one can understand that :). If the movie ending with 1-3 people getting out alive in the end after many passages, rough holes, under watering swimming and that sort of challenges, I would have liked it.<br/><br/>Like the movie 'Mean Creek', about a couple a teenagers and a dark secret. Everything in it seems realistic and could have been a true story, and it was very shocking and spooky without any cave troll and action filled fighting screens.<br/><br/>Or they could had made the 'crawler' taking the girls one by one while they were struggling to get out, like drag 'em down holes, make the others believe that they were lost. but WITHOUT showing itself. Just a few horrible, ice-freezing screams and footstep sound around them, that would drive them mad. And in the end, only Sarah and Juno getting out, and then some nice ending and you never really SEE the monster, that would drive the audience mad with curiosity, of course you would be left with a lot of unsolved questions, and thats makes people talk about it and getting their own fantasy image about how it looked.<br/><br/>thats my opinion."

","A film about menstruation based on the Freudian model in which girls a plenty confront bloody vampriric monsters in a cavernous hell. You can say its about bereavement, you can say its about repressed Lesbian relationships, though you'd be wrong there; you could even say its about nothing but I say you're wrong - its one long bit of anxiety about the female cycle and I DON'T mean the one your girlfriend bought from Halfords this morning. In terms of imagery its everywhere - wild and deadly fluctuations in mood against a backdrop of blood drenched passages. Everyone knows the definitive take on the subject is The Blob but this is a close second. Saturated in horrid, ovulating imagery its a pion to the desires of the flesh - those feelings that build to a bloody crescendo at a certain time. The final third is resplendent with multitudinous acts of penetration - a symbolic acknowledgement of the contradictory desire to be impregnated at a time when its the most dangerous. I found it to be a gruelling, unpleasant experience as a result because lets be honest, no-one wants to get into that sort of thing do they?"
"niz","8","3","7","18 July 2005"," Colossal Cave
","Wow, a decent modern British film! Its a miracle! THE DESCENT is a very effective, if not original, girl-powered survival horror flick. It doesn't bear close analysis, but is a very entertaining theatrical cinema experience. Its closest recent companion (in style if not in content) would be HAUTE TENSION.<br/><br/>I haven't seen director Neil Marshall's previous DOG SOLDIERS, but on the strength of this will seek it out. The cave scenes are beautifully shot, light is used very cleverly, and the sound design is fantastic. The first half of the film, which to all intents and purposes is a straight caving movie, really builds tension, and is incredibly claustrophobic. The second half, when the monsters are introduced, switches gear to standard survival horror mode, and ratchets up the ""jump-scares"", brutal monster attacks, and blood, to an amazing degree. There is rarely a moment to relax.<br/><br/>There are some notable problems: the 6 girls, while attempts are made to flesh them out and give them characterisation, are very similar-looking and interchangeable. This is a problem in dark cave scenes where its difficult to make out who is doing what. Obviously they're all monster fodder anyway, but i can only remember the names of 2 of the girls, and the personalities of 2 more. i.e. 2 of the girls are completely anonymous.<br/><br/>Secondly, the ""science"" of the monsters is rather dubious: supposedly blind underground dwellers who use ultrasound to locate their victims, they cannot hear somebody say ""They're blind"" directly behind them but can hear an alarm clock, they apparently cannot hear loud footfalls, apparently cannot even smell, and in fact are killed very easily, and yet we are expected to believe they have survived by going to the surface and hunting animals. Highly unlikely, but its a horror film so its excused.<br/><br/>Finally the motivations of the ""final girl"" are somewhat unclear: her actions at the end of the film seem unjustified and unfair, its difficult to understand why Marshall chose to present her as the (morally justified) ""hero"", I certainly had more sympathy for the ""villain"" of the piece.<br/><br/>But despite this, overall its an excellent film, its scary, has attractive leads, has some fun with the standard genre stereotypes, has a fantastic beginning, and a great, downbeat ending. What more could you ask?"
"dodgygeezer99_2000","8","3","7","17 July 2005"," A film worth seeing at the cinema.
","This film exceeded my expectations. I, like so many others thought that with a low budget and not well known actress's, this film would be very average but it wasn't. The story line was a bit transparent from the first 5 minutes of the film but the scenes in the cave are brilliant. As others have posted, if you are a bit claustrophobic your fears will intensify. The person I saw the film with said he felt trapped inside the cave with the women. The scenes just draw you right in as if you are there with them.<br/><br/>We have several thoughts on the ""cave dwellers"". My husband believes that the creatures that are are all people who had once tried to explore the cave, couldn't find their way out hence evolved over the years to their environment. If that is the case, they evolved in less than 100 years because the old rock climbing apparatus that was found was said to be 100 years old. There were also hieroglyphics in the cave, which would imply people were in the cave much earlier. The one bit that has me pondering is from the beginning of the film when the women find the dead animal lying in the grass. If this was indeed killed by the cave dwellers then there must be a way out. If the animal was merely shot by a hunter, it would have been gathered and not left on the ground to rot. I am a bit confused about that issue. At points when the attack scenes were happening, things happened far to fast so you really couldn't make out what was happening. Maybe that was intentional. I don't know but it kind of took something away from the film for me. All of that aside, I think the film was definitely worth seeing. It has some scenes in it that really make you jump and feel like you are in the cave too. I rate the film 8 out of 10. Hold on to your popcorn and enjoy the ride!!!!!"
"woodalex","8","3","7","14 July 2005"," A few flaws but a very entertaining scare fest!
","When I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema, I thought it looked quite interesting. But the main reason for watching it was because on the trailer on the TV, it said that the film magazine 'Empire' rated the film five stars. I still have to actually see if this is true or not. And did it deserve five stars? In some cases yes.<br/><br/>The story was a very good one but confusing in some places. Six women go on a caving trip and get trapped in by a rock fall. Nothing out of the ordinary I hear you say. But in this deep and mysterious cave with them are evolved humans, humans that want to kill and eat these women. A thing that I find very strange to see is that the cast are mostly British women, and genuine British women also, not Americans trying to put on an accent. This impressed me quite a lot. But a couple of confusing parts put doubt in my mind a bit whilst watching the movie. Did one of the other women cavers have an affair with Sarah's husband? And what was the whole deal with the chain saying ""Live every day""? This seemed to have a big effect on the film in some way, but I couldn't pick it out. But one thing that I do applaud about the film, was the fact that Sarah's dead daughter did not mix with the film too much. I thought that the ending would be that either the deceased daughter would turn out evil in some way, or that she would help her mother escape.<br/><br/>The acting was quite good throughout, apart from a couple of scenes. Especially the scene when Sarah first saw the blood thirsty human, the acting went into a downward direction. But, where the acting failed, the scares succeeded. This film was absolutely petrifying to say the least and well pulled off. The fear that you are trapped in a dark, wet and unknown cave is bad enough, but the addition of murderous humans at every turn really is ghastly. The amount of times I jumped was amazing.<br/><br/>The killers look a lot like Gollum from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And the fact that they live in the darkness underground, suggests to me that the writer has watched the trilogy too many times. In a few scenes near the end, Sarah has the look of 'Carrie' from the horror movie. I do not know if this was meant to be, but it struck me for a second. Also, the fight scenes were a bit hard to make out as the camera was very shaky and it constantly kept switching angles. This hurt my head a bit. There was quite a poor display of CGI also, especially with the appearance of the bats and when the women were abseiling down the hole. When the credits came up, it said that one of the killers was called Scar. I thought that this was very peculiar indeed, as not once throughout the movie did anyone mention its name.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a great movie and well worth watching. But expect to be frightened severely, as this film will hold you and never let go."

What really bites is that the image had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FILM. I was expecting something much more interesting indeed lured by false advertising of a ripoff design. If only the film had ripped off the idea instead of only the poster!<br/><br/>btw It appears that the film had a different ending at some point from reading these reviews which seem to suggest that the woman never made it out of the cave. The original ending couldn't have been worse than the current one, in which abruptly the film seems to say ""ok, you get to leave now, the film's over"" I was more thrilled to escape the film than the character could have been to suddenly find the exit that after descending what seems like 5 miles is accessible by a little scramble of about 35 seconds. they decided to go for the ""happy plus carrie"" ending. as if anybody could care what happens either way. . . <br/><br/>And for all of you slagging British film it's not all bad.

","To call this film dull would be the equivalent of calling Hussain slightly unpleasant. It is my firm belief that if you were to conduct an experiment whereby one subject would snort five lines of cocaine and the other would watch ""The Descent"" the person who had taken the coke would walk away with more brain cells still intact.<br/><br/>The 'acting' is truly atrocious; as the film was beginning I had a wonderful nostalgia trip back to the old Nativity plays we used to perform at Primary school every Christmas.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film begins simply enough with a family driving through the country when they are involved in a car accident resulting in an over elaborate death for the husband and daughter of the lead character. We are then treated to a hospital scene with enough green filter to make the Wachowski brothers vomit with rage. The lead character has a breakdown and then quickly gets over the loss of her family.<br/><br/>Soon afterwards we meet her supermodel friends who are all supposedly rough ad rugged rock climbers; it is more likely however that their idea of an adventure would be going shopping for dresses. These extremely beautiful women all stay in a log cabin together and drink beer while hugging an awful lot, all we need is a nice pillow fight and we're sorted. Unfortunately there is no pillow fight, but there is a nice unnecessary scene of a woman showering. Lovely! The women then spend a good hour in the cave where nothing actually happens! Seriously, nothing happens for an entire sixty minutes! After an entire gruelling hour we are ""treated"" to an attack made by the monsters, where have I seen this before? Ah yes ""Creep"" another poor horror film, but it came first and the scene in ""Creep"" where you first see the monster is genuinely quite scary, the revealing of the creatures in ""The Descent"" however, is pathetic.<br/><br/>In fact, while I'm on the subject of ""Creep"", the monsters in this film are absolute rip-offs of Craig, not only do they resemble him, but they make identical noises and move in a fairly similar manner. Both films are about being trapped in the dark in someone else's territory, the only difference is Christopher Smith can actually direct a film whereas Neil Marshall has no real skill as a filmmaker whatsoever! Everything I saw in this film, I have seen a thousand times before, executed a thousand times better! I have absolutely nothing good to say for it.<br/><br/>Recent horror films are, on the whole, dreadful.

This movie was horrible. I mean really bad. While the idea of the movie is scary..(especially for a claustrophobic) being trapped in a cave, no one knows where you are to come and find you and you have no sure way out, the movie itself is disappointing. As if the first part of the movie wasn't bad enough, the second half introduces these little cave creatures/monsters that are not happy they have guests. Ugh. Really? Also, while the women are trying to find hiding spots in the cave, there are plenty of moments where the creatures walk and stop right next to them and even directly look at them, yet they act like they don't see them.

The good news: All but one of these annoying characters are lost miles down in the cave, presumably eaten by the aforementioned cave dwellers, and the sole survivor goes insane from the experience; so at least there's a happy ending! When will directors and writers learn that horror movie characters must project depth and elicit sympathy? (i.e. Lt. Ripley?) If you don't care about the people involved, you won't care whether they all die in the dark or not. All mindless, self-centered, crude, shallow characters should be buried in a cave! This film is a sad comment on where the horror genre has been going lately. So many producers and directors merely assume that the audience will all be Jason/Freddy fans and proceed to pander to that base element. My advice?

The fact is...they just don't gel. They are about as believable and genuine as the imbeciles that take part in (and indeed watch) Big Brother. You don't ever get the feeling that not only would they all keep in touch over many years,but choose to spend huge amounts of time in each others company doing dangerous deeds. I personally struggled to stay in their company for the duration of the movie. As for the ""creatures""...they are clammy,but not frightening. At all. Mostly because we saw them before,in ""Creep"". They sometimes find things with their ""bat-like"" sonar. Although one leans on the head of the lead and cannot distinguish her cranium from the geology of the catacombs. Oh dear.

But apart from all this the Descent contains something that every horror film should utilize- a good screenplay and characters one can relate to/side with.

I felt within the first few minutes of the movie that the direction, script and characters were well developed and could lead to a great movie. The tension between the two main characters was great and pretty well acted. The cave scenes were also excellent for generating a wonderful sense of isolation and foreboding. <br/><br/>The problem I had with the film was that it was really two movies in one with the director unable to decide which way to go. The conflict could have played out well in so many different ways without so many other characters involved. I also felt the crawlers were overplayed and maybe even unnecessary except for creating ambiguity surrounding Sarah's actions at the end toward Juno. Was it revenge, or an act of survival?<br/><br/>As it is I suppose it's a (decent) horror flick because of the creatures and blood, but it could have been an amazing adventure/thriller without."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","2","4","28 February 2018"," The Descent is the very definition of claustrophobic horror.
","Trust me when I say this, it will make you think twice about setting foot into a cave. We follow a group of British women who decide to explore a famous cave system in America. Problem is, one ""smart cookie"" in the group decides to take it upon herself to guide the group into an unknown cave maze instead...where something else inhabits the darkness. That something being a large pack of blind cave dwellers that pretty much resemble the Falmer from Elder Scrolls (my best comparison). Oh, and they hunt and devour pretty much anything. This is a pretty decent gem from the horror genre. My main admiration has to go to director Neil Marshall who somehow took on the impossible challenge of filming in small narrow passages and dark caves. I'm sure dynamically recreated sets were utilised, but it felt authentic and a damn terrifying creepy environment. Embracing darkness is incredibly difficult, and consequently means the lighting has to be on point...fortunately it is. Flares, torches and fire all felt natural and added appropriate light so that we can visibly see our characters. Marshall's inventive direction and adventurous environment enhanced the claustrophobia needed to create the scares. There are some clever scenes, particularly when the Falmer (yup...I'm calling them that) are introduced. Night vision on a camcorder and quick movement of the head torches assist in some extremely effective techniques. The characters have glimpses of development and personality, especially Sarah, but probably not enough to actually care about them. Speaking of Sarah, can we just reflect on how she entered the cave as a scared fearful woman and yet somehow turns into Arnold Schwarzenegger of the cave world by the end. Even does the scream from Predator! The constant rapid cuts when the Falmer attack the humans made me slightly nauseous and made it difficult to differentiate what the heck was going on. However, this is a gory, claustrophobic, dark and often tense horror film that will appeal to genre enthusiasts."
"masonmorgan-92917","7","2","4","12 February 2017"," An exhausting experience
","Neil Marshall's The Descent received wide critical praise upon it's release, some even toting this 2005 film as one of the best horror movies of the decade. While I did find some aspects of the film quite underwhelming, The Descent provided one of the most intense and uncomfortable film experiences I've ever had. <br/><br/>While I myself am more a fan of subtle psychological horror films, ones that provoke thought whilst building the tension, The Descent was a nice change of pace. Of course we must get through the character introduction and scene-setting points in the story, but these sequences surprisingly didn't feel tiresome. All the characters we are introduced to are fairly interesting as they each slowly begin to generate their own personality traits and attitudes as the story progresses, only up until the bloodshed, but at that point, who the hell really cares, right? It's refreshing for a horror movie to portray the female characters as strong, independent and resourceful forces rather than the screaming bimbos we've become so accustomed to. Our characters aren't perfect though as they quite often play victim to the usual horror movie tropes and you'll find yourself yelling at the TV as characters make dumb decisions or have strange motivations for their actions. <br/><br/>One issue that I had with The Descent was the ending. While the ending ultimately seems appropriate, it was still supremely unsatisfying. It's almost as if the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't find a rewarding way to end the story. There were also some poor set and lighting work at times but it wasn't majorly distracting. The scenes of combat against the hellish creatures were incomprehensible most of the time and it was fairly frustrating as I attempted to make out what exactly was happening, only having to wait until the fight was over to see who won. These fight scenes don't make up the majority of the film, but the shoddy camera-work is very noticeable and surprisingly amateur.<br/><br/>The Descent is an experience that will leave you exhausted. It's gruelling and tense almost constantly, merciless in it's depiction of claustrophobia and extreme violence. But once the initial waves of sickness and dread die down, the film finds ways to invigorate and energize the viewer. It's an experience you truly won't forget, but it's also one some may hesitate to return to. <br/><br/>A no-nonsense, gut wrenching thriller, The Descent is guaranteed to satisfy any viewer's gore-driven fantasies , especially those who didn't realize they had any."

","One of the best modern day horror movies ever made, as well as one of the best-reviewed horror movie of the decade. The tension is high, the characters are strong, and the atmosphere is nice and thick, The Descent does just about everything right. Of all the 'isolation' horror movies being made, this is hands down the crown jewel! The production designs of the cave system look fantastic, they were all man made of course, but it gave them room to create some truly frightening scenarios.<br/><br/>As I said before, the real highlight of The Descent comes from the group tension between the women and their history together, which just happens to hit a rough patch during this time of crisis in the cave. They're forced to work together, even though previous drama has surfaced creating some very thick tension amongst the group. Plus, there is something else about having an all-female cast that makes the movie a bit more harrowing and interesting, probably because when you think of violence, you typically think of men committing the violence or being violently killed. But that being said, the woman certainly are up for the challenge, and the movie just would not have worked with men in this type of situation.<br/><br/>And as a final note, the ending of The Descent is simple, yet brilliant (from what I have read, most people were expecting more), it's actually one of my personal favorite horror movie endings!"

A fantastic cast of actors give stunning performances as they fight for their very lives against disgustingly creepy cave dwelling beings who devour flesh. There is overwhelming intensity and suspense so great it's difficult to endure. The horror is unrelenting and the claustrophobic fear in the darkness of the caves is spine chilling.

","This movie, though not my ""favourite"" horror, is definitely up there in the list of stomach churning, arm gripping, breath taking films. I first watched ""The Descent"" alone whilst reading a book, so didn't pay too much attention to what was going on. The few times I put my book down and looked briefly at the screen, I got a scare! I suggested to my sister and mum, along with her friend, that we all watch it on New Years Eve. About 20 minutes into the movie, my mum said ""this is boring"". I felt a little downhearted after that, but insisted we gave it time. That wasn't a mistake! Once the characters found themselves stuck in the caves and struggling to find their way out, we all concentrated more, wondering what was going to happen next. Then, after the first creature had shown itself, there was scream after scream to follow, along with a lot of laughs! There was barely a quiet moment to redeem yourself! My mum admitted that the movie turned out pretty great once it had finished. ""The Descent"" is full to the brim with scares, jumps and plenty of terrifying scenes to make your throat sore! If you find yourself in the same situation a little while into the movie and feel like it's never going to pick up pace, trust me, it does. Definitely worth watching and deserves it 18 rating. Prepare yourself for this movie, you won't soon forget about it..."

","The Descent caught me off guard on how scary it is. Good horror movies are so hard to come by. What I most especially appreciated about this movie is how primal it is. The characters recognize what they have to do and take a stand against impossible odds. This is survival of the fittest. Hunt or be hunted. I compare this movie to the original Predator. Lost in uncharted territory and dealing with an unknown creature or creatures. The Descent forces its characters to enter a savage kill or be killed mentality 'descending' them towards madness.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a sequel. I don't recommend it by any means. I actually knew it wasn't going to be worth watching after reading reviews on IMDb and rotten tomatoes but it was easily available on Netflix Streaming and my curiosity got the best of me.

","The reason to watch ""The Descent"" is that it is a well-crafted, richly textured, tense, arm-chair squeezing, and gratifying film that is probably not quite like anything you have seen before. You will experience a descent, in more ways than one. <br/><br/>Its pace will not satisfy everyone. Just like the pace of ""No Country For Old Men"" or ""Unforgiven"" will not satisfy everyone. It takes time for the story to develop and the tension and horror to build.

As years have past, I have found the score to be one of the most compelling parts of the movie. It is satisfying and seems perfectly matched to the film. <br/><br/>I have found that, like most good movies, ""The Descent"" has earned more of my admiration through the years. I enjoyed the movie ""Alien"" when it first came out, but I've only recently begun to appreciate just how good it is. ""The Descent"" has similarly earned my respect through the course of time. It's not as good as ""Alien"", but it certainly leaves a resounding impact on your emotions, such that upon finishing the movie, you feel overwhelmed, gratified, and realizing ...

"starving_college_student","5","2","4","9 April 2008"," Average fare with some cool monsters
","The Descent is all around decent, but not overly memorable. The monsters were pretty effective and the scenes in which the characters confronted these beasts were very well done. These aside, and while better than a cheap slasher flick, there are a number of things that bring The Descent down. Neil Marshall setup an effective atmosphere of gloom and claustrophobia with some great camera tricks and moves. The actresses too all do a better than average (for horror films) performance. But the story is where things get dragged down. The film doesn't seem to know what kind of story it is until about halfway through the film. I knew absolutely 0% about this film before watching it so I wasn't even aware there were any monsters until they finally appeared halfway through. However it's a basic step of story telling to establish your characters and plot in the opening few minutes. Instead the opening seemed to go off on character development that was unnecessary. For example, the initial death of the husband really had nothing to do with the plot (often this kind of thing would be in the back story) other than to give a few scares and set up a future plot device. The scares too were different, relying on a more supernatural tone, like in the hospital as the lights went out one by one. However this isn't a ghost film (as I found out later), its a monster film. From there seeing a group of models going caving in an unknown cave felt a little camp (while the rest of the movie didn't). And lastly the killing of Juno in retaliation for infidelity did not seem to be justified and felt like an out of place attempt to make something deeper and more meaningful than it is. But the plot and character flaws aside the film finishes off with a very interesting ending and some pretty cool monster scenes. For those wishing to see another horror film, this would be a good one to pass the time with until something more memorable comes along."

","The story = On a daredevil caving holiday six girls are trapped underground when an unexpected rock falls and blocks their exit. Searching the maze of tunnels for a way out, they find themselves hunted down by a race of fearless hungary predators.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be wrong to suggest that the British horror film has come back to life (especially as, recently, the lacklustre CREEP (2004) hammered one more nail in the coffin), but Neil Marshall's intense THE DESCENT breathes a whole new life into the British horror movies.<br/><br/>The Descent is creepy intense and nerve racking and really makes the best of combining claustrophobia and nasties lurking in the dark. To be honest, being trapped in an airless dark hole not much bigger than my own body would be, possibly, one of my least favourite leisure activities  the scope for Marshall to scare me half to death was immense. The set up at the beginning is really tragic and heartbreaking as it sees one of the main characters husband and child die in an equally tragic car accident. The Descent is in no way a slasher movie it owes more movies like Aliens with a strong female lead battling against of zombie mutant alien like creatures. Marshall put me right there with them and perfectly captured the thrill, utter fear and claustrophobic nature of such an excursion. Then second half of this bad girl kicked in with creatures peering in the shadows, sadistic/brutal/messy attacks, seat jumping boo scares, intense mano et beasto get downs, powerful, suspense filled bits and a strong dose of ""human"" evil at that. Stack on top of all that genre quality; energetic directing, true scares, an incredibly moving score, a talented manner of milking the cave surroundings, a sly use of dream sequences and an ending that toyed with my knowledge of known conventions to rip my heart out and you get a grade a quality horror classic.<br/><br/>Shauna Macdonald (Sarah) was awesome and hit all the right notes, very credible and should be up there with all the other female action heroes. Natalie Mendoza (Juno) avoided the usual pitfalls that her type of character usually comes with and put out a layered performance. Nora Jane No one (Holly) was very much capable as the more butch of the group. Alex Reid (Beth) and Saskia Mulder (Rebecca) were both convincing in their roles.<br/><br/>All in all this is a true horror classic and for once worth all the rave reviews from the critics that this movie has been getting and plus all the female characters are astounding and made you sympathise with them, very rare that happens in a horror movie, in fact this is probably the first."

","Sticks to the basic formula of modern horror films (an hour of character development, a thirty minute rush with the baddies) but completely excels in every element of it. It doesn't transcend the genre, but instead it perfects it. It builds strong characters and goes in depth with the majority of them so that we become familiar with who these characters are and we become worried, knowing that their lives will soon be in grave danger. The first half delves into the mystery and fear of simply being in the cave. They are lost in an unknown territory with no help possible from the outside world. Marshall does a great job of developing a strong sense of claustrophobia and paranoia and a desperate need to escape from the hellish cave that these ladies have become lost in.<br/><br/>Then the second half steps it up enormously, creating one of the most frightening experiences of my life. The creatures are absolutely terrifying and put the viewer in a constant state of fear and even further paranoia. We forget about the need to escape the cave, though it is still a strong desperation, and we focus on the more pressing need to escape the creatures. The title certainly presents numerous meanings. There is the obvious descent further and further into the depths of the cave. Then there is the obvious descent into a metaphoric hell as they go darker and darker and finally the creatures appear. Yet even more internally, there is the characters descent into complete madness. The paranoia and insanity of it all is mostly apparent through Juno, who after accidentally stabbing Beth turns into a killing machine, and Sarah who, after actually killing Beth, becomes even more of a hollowed shell, absolutely annihilating everything in her way. This includes handicapping her only living friend, whom she just found out had an affair with her husband and that's why her husband and daughter died, which I hated at first but have just grown to love more and more. Her 'badassness' was just overwhelming and completely awesome.<br/><br/>The ending is one of the greatest of recent years (I saw the original UK ending where Sarah doesn't actually escape, by the way). It transcends the Hollywood trend of the one hot girl that we see from beginning to end surviving all of the impossible to survive odds and getting away from the horror, in the most unrealistic fashion. But in this ending, we see the realistic fact that no one has a chance of surviving those odds and a great revelation of complete mental breakdown to the horrors of the descent. This film also has the privilege of being the only film that I've screamed like a black person during, which happened when the creature appeared on the video camera. I'm normally a fan of more ambietic, mental horror but this film just had my pulse racing like I was having a heart attack whilst soiling myself. I've rarely had a more frightening, yet extremely entertaining time watching a film. It also has the privilege of making me grimace and mutter ""Fuck."" more than any other picture."

Also it includes an all female cast, a rarity in horror films, especially since the characters are not just sexualized teens.

","One of the aspects I find interesting whenever I read reviews about certain movies is the fact that sometimes I'll see similar terms used to describe them, be it in plot, style, its high quality or dreadful mise en scene. Terms like ""Hitchcockian"" have become so intricately linked to a specific style of films the very mention of it brings forth images of a shower, crashing music, thrilling set pieces, blondes in danger, and irresistible suspense.<br/><br/>The term that keeps popping up here is ""spelunking"". It has nothing to do with the quality of THE DESCENT, which is high in thrills, but practically everyone seems to be using it like the word's existence depended on it. I dreaded reading any more about this movie because just the thought of viewing that odd word, which sounds like something speed freaks would take in order to come crashing down to a halt (well, at least to me), would make me yip.<br/><br/>So let's see: the definition of what it means to 'spelunk' isn't being the action a fat lady takes when she missteps and comes crashing down a flight of stairs, landing in an extremely awkward position somewhere between the radiator and the boiler in the basement. Spelunking (and this, the third time I write it): a person who goes exploring a cave as a hobby. Okay. That being out of the way, I can say I finally know what the hell that strange, whiskery word means, and I can move on into what the movie THE DESCENT is about.<br/><br/>So. Six women, of which several have some unfinished business, go into a dark place deep underground. It doesn't bother them in the least that there's a deer with its throat ripped clear off. They want to go exploring and that's that. What they ignore is that -- surprise, surprise -- there's Something Down There, And It Ain't Nice.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall has made himself quite a picture with THE DESCENT. He takes an old, old, Really Old premise and making it nearly a war movie where the women are more than ready to do battle instead of do the weak flail of arms and yelling help in the hopes that Prince Charming will come and save them. There isn't a single weak woman in the bunch -- these might as well be Amazons from a different tribe, since the only significant male in the bunch is killed cleanly off during the film's introduction sequence -- itself gruesome as it is brutal and brief. Shauna MacDonald, as the emotionally and mentally frail Sarah, carries the weight of her baggage through the entire run and evolves into quite a character.<br/><br/>As for fear factor, THE DESCENT is relentless once it takes off. It creeps and creeps and creeps until what seems to be a hallucination in Sarah's eyes explodes in vicious ferocity. This is a pretty sharp horror movie that is awash in gore and frights and uses them to their full advantage and even when the story moves in flatly predictable ways, you will be on the edge of your seat. A winner and a back-to-basics, with a good dose of Seventies' despair thrown in."

Most horror film recently have just been gory and may make you jump from time to time, not this one. It has great all around story and the director made a great job of using the scenery to scare the audience. I watched this movie for the second time with some friends last night and all or us were absolutely petrified. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this film."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","8 August 2006"," Critics' choice for the most likely ""best horror movie of the year""
","(watched in Toronto)<br/><br/>I am among the group of regular movie goers who like to check out critics' reviews before seeing a movie. I was slightly surprised at the unanimity and enthusiasm in the critics' praise of this movie. Having watched the movie, I can see that they have their reasons.<br/><br/>If you know nothing at all about the movie (maybe you should stop reading this, right now), you would be thinking, during the first half of the movie, that you are watching an adventure-turned-disaster movie along the line of ""Vertical Limit"" or ""Into the void"". There may be just that additional hint of psychological flavour, as the main protagonist Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), right at the beginning of the movie, suffers a devastating loss of husband and daughter in a traffic accident, with steel rods impaling the windshield and victims.<br/><br/>I don't need to elaborate the nightmares that haunt Sara in the ensuring year, at the end of which her two best friends who were with her at a white water adventure just before the accident try to help her get out of the sinking feeling by, ironically, organizing an exploration of descending into a cave. Three more women are added to the group. While they think that they are all taking a relatively ""safe"" adventure trip, under the experienced guidance of Juno (Natalie Mendoza)their leader, into a charted course, Juno harbours a more ambitious plan of exploring a hitherto untouched cave, thereby giving them the naming right, her idea of cheering Sara up.<br/><br/>As I said, the first half, although already gripping in its own right, provides the tension and thrills in the form of natural accidents. The real meat comes with the discovering of carnivorous cave dwellers that look like Gollum, move like the Aliens and operate like bats (totally blind, relying on their other senses to move around the bowels of the earth). Towards the end, the story takes on very much the route of Sigourney Weavers ""Aliens"" (i.e. with an ""s"", the second one) and much satisfaction can be obtained by watching the heroines' ferocious destruction of the ultra-vicious villains.<br/><br/>There is not one thing in particular that makes this movie outstanding; it's how it all fits together. In this British movie, you don't see the banal, formulaic Hollywood treatment such as trying to give each character a special, but superficial ""story"". This is Sara and Juno's story, and is left at that. There is unquestionably a great deal of gore, but no blatantly exposed as in the standard run-of-the-mill horrors, but cleverly softened, taking advantage of the various lightings used in the underground cavern. There are lots of referential tributes to various scenes in a good number of movies, as the critics point out, which I wouldn't repeat. There are well paced actions and thrills. There are explorations into a deeper layer of psychology, which tactfully avoid the pitfall of being too pretentious and overbearing. Yes, there are logical aspects that can be challengesd such as how can human beings have any chance at all in the underground environ that is the home tuft of these ""crawlers""  they had enough trouble with the deadly terrine even before these things show up. But all in all, this is a movie that you do not find much fault with, and that is perhaps why it has become the critics' favourite."

"jayjaycee","7","0","0","16 May 2020"," A surreal allegory and infernal hell trip at the same time
","""The Descent"" is a 2005 horror film directed by Neil Marshall starring Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza. I generally love it when films manage to become successful, even though their budget is heavily restricted. Money isn't always everything, sometimes I watch movies that have obtained a utopian funding and ended up as nothing but hot garbage (I am looking at you, Michael Bay), on the other side I am extremely fascinated that some gems prove the total opposite and show that pure creativity is everything a film needs. May it be Kevin Smith's minimalistic comedy hit ""Clerks"" that works simply due to its brilliant screenplay or a found footage film like ""The Blair Witch Project"" that solely lives from the horror it creates in our heads, low budget doesn't always mean lower quality. While this horror flick has had a little more money in it pocket than the previously mentioned flicks (approximately Â£3.5 million, to be exact), it is still a meagre amount to work with. Hence it is so surprisingly pleasant to see what a decent film the outcome in case of this flick is. First, it is fascinating to see that it is not only a horror film that's sole purpose is to show of some jump scares and frighten the audience, but also offers a subliminal deeper meaning that gives the film a haunting ambiguity to it. Honestly, I haven't seen this film before, but already a few minutes into the movie I told my brother about my theory and he just sat there and said ""Yes..."", wondering that I figured it out so fast, but the fact that my brain once again overanalysed the film didn't make it any less packing, if anything, it made it even better for me. The film starts out with a traumatic experience and it was obvious that it wasn't only filmed to make the film longer, it has a deep meaning that will overshadow the remaining progress of the film immensely. Protagonist Sarah is the one who lost both her husband and daughter in a fatal car accident and suffers from depression ever since. While it is not explicitly mentioned by any character, it is still sort of evident, as she is seen taking pills and also the fact that the first half of the film is almost exclusively captured in cold blue shades support this assumption. This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant aspects of this movie, but before we go deeper into it (pun intended), there are also a few things that I was dissatisfied with. On the one hand, it was extremely trying for me to find some sort of connection to any of the characters, as the film doesn't do enough about introducing them properly, on the other hand the character constellation was tremendously confusing, especially in the cave scenes, that I had severe difficulties to distinguish between them all. The lack of sympathy for the ladies even got to the point that I was more annoyed rather than actually caring for them. The fact that they are characterized as what Lily and Robin would call ""Woo-Girls"" made them unlikable, to the point that I sat there and jokingly begged for someone to kill them. It indeed was pretty hard to not dislike them all and that's such a pity, as the only halfway likable character of them all was our troubled protagonist Sarah. Sadly, the focus doesn't lie on her the way I hoped it would and she is pushed in the background most of the time in favour of concentrating on her unsympathetic friends instead. This procedure was continued for most of the runtime, I even forgot her name in a few situations. For a main character that is pretty sad. Only when there were two or three of them left, it was easy to follow them, in other words, it was way too late. Even when I disliked this undeniable major flaw, it did not keep me from having a good time, as the horror in this film is simply superb. The way it is only introduced slowly makes it work out so well and stand out in its own way. To be honest, if I haven't already known about the fact that this film belongs to the horror genre, it easily could have been a survival drama as well, but thanks to advertising and the fact that is a fifteen years old classic of that same genre, I was spared from this unexpected genre twist. This doesn't change the fact that the film indeed managed to scare the hell out of me. As previously mentioned, the fear is only induced gradually. Most of the horror in the beginning takes place via sounds and brief shots of what turns out to be the horrid danger and only introduces its monster after it has been messing with our heads for a while. The so-called ""Crawlers"", as they are named only in the credits, are genuinely creepy and the mere fact that they are humanoid creatures and that their origin isn't explained in the slightest, adds a lot of thrill to the atmosphere. Also, that those monsters are anything but invincible and have a distinct weakness to them (blindness) makes the film tremendously unpredictable. Thus, it is still offering the possibility for the characters to escape and find a way out, instead of making it appear that it is their certain death for them in the first place. Furthermore, it offers enough other aspects and ideas that kept me on the edge of my seat. Next to the closeup shots of the leading ladies crawling through the most narrow fissures that triggered my own claustrophobia even when I wasn't in the situation myself, the different colour schemes that gave each scenario an undeniably packing feeling to it make it even better. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the graphic violence and blood. The scene where they try to fix Holly's open fracture? Almost made me throw up! There are also several other sequences that use the gore factor of this film eminently well, but the best scenes are the ones when the film makes use of the main feature of its antagonistic creatures. When this one crawler literally steps on the head of the motionless Sarah after she killed off the female one in the pool of blood? I literally freaked out! As gruesome and promising the killings started out, after more than two deaths took place in quite the same manner, it became less shocking than before and the deaths of those two who were killed before Juno and Sarah become the only ones left alive (I actually don't remember their names at all) were repetitive, lacked the innovation of the demises depicted before and on top of that, were utterly stupid. I mean, what did she try to achieve by climbing? She even checked it out other ways and knew that there was water at the bottom of the gorge. Why didn't she try it? It was probably necessary so that Sarah could confront Juno about the apparent affair of her with her late husband. After she has killed her former best friend, we get to the most interesting part of the film: the ending. Ignoring the existence of the sequel that presumes that she actually made it out of the cave, I personally think that she died down there eventually. If we consider that the things that are depicted in this film actually happened, she died down there in the cave by the hands of those supernatural monsters, but I prefer to see the whole thing metaphorically: As I mentioned before, the film is just a brutal allegory of Sarah's fight with depression. The whole spelunking adventure with her friends resembles her deteriorating mental health and her friends trying to help her through it and the crawlers are the incarnation of depressive thoughts that try to kill her and distance her from her friends. I mean, they are killed off one by one, the arrows on the wall all contradict themselves and Sarah is the final character to be alive and only after she learned that her husband cheated on her with her best friend she totally accepts that she is going to die. With seemingly no one there to help her anymore, she embraces her fate and is letting it happen. Even though it is not explicitly shown or mentioned, my theory is that she commits suicide in the end after giving up the fight. Regardless of whether you see it as just a gore horror film or an allegory for her struggle, in the end the film draws a devastatingly depressing conclusion in both ways. In terms of filmmaking it is absolutely brilliant, but as a subject matter it indescribably sad. All in all, this subterranean and surreal film is an ambiguous hell trip through all sorts of emotions and the ferocity of depression and offers enough as both a pure gore fest and as an allegory to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. Even though the characters are shallow and unlikeable, and the film lacks the factor of shock in the end, it still manages to entertain and create a nightmarish atmosphere. It indeed is a gem, flawed but not less brilliant, and deservedly bears the title of being one of the finest and most original British horror films of all time. I don't know about you, but I will never go anywhere near to a cave, let alone entering one. It is enough for me to watch a bunch of girls do this for me on screen. This already gives me enough anxiety."

","Neil Marshall follows his equally good variant on the werewolf theme, Dog Soldiers, with The Descent. This all female lead cast movie, follows six women who, having entered a cave system, struggle to survive against the humanoid creatures living inside. The beauty of the film is that whilst attempting to survive the cannibalistic monsters, the women also find themselves hamstrung by the impetuous actions of one of their own. It's a good story, which Marshall chooses to primarily film through the perspective of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who a year previously, tragically lost her husband and daughter in a rather horrid car accident. Thus the ostensible premise behind the spelunking expedition in the Appalachin Mountains; to assist the damaged Sarah to regain at least part of her adventurous mojo, which we see on display in an exciting white-water rafting sequence in the opening scenes.<br/><br/>Marshall assembles a cosmopolitan cast of women which assists identification purposes later during the cave scenes, though it might be considered a little unusual, in that not one of the women is American, seeing the vast majority of the film is set in the U.S.A., (with Scotland and England locations subbing in well). The purpose stage-built ""cave system"" works outstandingly well conjuring up a sea of subterranean terror with its terrifying, underground inhabitants.<br/><br/>Both Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza who plays the other key role of Juno, the tough, but manipulative leader of the expedition are excellent in their parts. The interrelationship of their characters is only revealed towards the end and it is fascinating watching the metamorphosis of Sarah's character, as she rises to both the challenges of ""the crawlers"" and the woman she once thought of and trusted as a friend.<br/><br/>The Descent is an exhilarating, gut-wrenching, thrill-ride of a horror story and serves once again to demonstrate Neil Marshall is a talented director, who lucky for us, is not satisfied working with established tropes of the horror genre."

In an era not so long ago, women were honored and protected as the producers of new life in our society. What happened to bring Western civilization to the point where we now regard brutality and stylized murder as circuses for our amusement? Anyone who enjoyed this film should really make an honest internal inquiry into the content of their character. No one with any respect for humanity should take pleasure in the violent destruction of human life, especially the life of women. Most youth today have no idea how violence really appears outside of a film or video game. When the effects of violence and death suddenly become all too real, it ain't no game.

In his second horror achievement, Marshall proves himself to be a versatile filmmaker, with ingenious new ideas and a good old-fashioned sense of grim and disturbing chaos. ""The Descent"" is quite gory, but also suspenseful and full of intrigues and surprise twists, which is a really rare combination nowadays. Marshall opted for an all female cast, which is quite innovating in horror (especially blend with the other topic of extreme sports), and this evidently creases an almost natural atmosphere of competition, jealousy and betrayal that our gifted director captures on film perfectly. A circle of six friends, all into extreme sports and reckless kicks, meet to go on a caving expedition exactly one year after one of them Â– Sarah Â– lost her husband and 8 year old daughter in a tragic road accident. The ominous cave quickly becomes a deadly challenge when it turns out that the competitive leader Juno single-handedly the location. ""The Descent"" is a very exciting film, with believable characters and some excellent gross-out special effects. Marshall's directing is very tight and the film's fast pacing doesn't leave you much time to ponder about possible flaws and/or plot holes. The ""residents"" of the cave are effectively unsettling creations that produce frightening sounds and crawl around creepily. The ending of the film can be interpreted in several ways, which is a surprisingly intelligent and unexpected twist for such an ""ordinary"" horror production. In short, ""The Descent"" is highly recommended and, personally, I can't wait to see what Marshall's next project will be like."
"TheSeaLion","4","3","8","5 March 2015"," I really wanted to like this one
","""The Descent"" is a horror movie I really wanted to like. I heard all of this great stuff about it, including many people, average Joes and critics alike calling it one of the best horror movies of the 21st Century. After watching it, I have to ask myself if I missed something or if everyone else was looking at things that weren't there.<br/><br/>Even though this film is getting such a low grade from me, I'm not angry that I spent time watching a movie I ended up disliking. All of the lead actresses were good and I can't fault director and writer Neil Marshall that much, either. While I think the movie had some pretty big story and character flaws, I get the feeling that Marshall had great pride in what he was doing and a great idea and just miscalculated because, as far as I can tell, his directing and writing isn't bad.<br/><br/>You also can't fault the cinematography or the set design for this movie. Before entering the cave, the audience is treated to some wide shots of the forest and open areas. When the six girls enter the cavern, the camera is pressed up close to their face, giving off a sense of claustrophobia, especially when compared to the wide open shots we'd seen earlier. The sets are also believable as a real cavern while the darkness helps play to the horror element by allowing the only light to come from the girls' headlamps, glow sticks, flares, etc.<br/><br/>While I did have some positive things to say about the movie, I feel that they are somewhat superficial when compared to the problems I found with the movie. Let's start at the way beginning with the death of Sarah's (Shauna Macdonald) husband (Oliver Milburn) and daughter (Molly Kayll). From that opening, you'd think it'd have some effect on the story or characters. Not really. Sarah sees glimpses of her daughter in the cave and hears her laughter at one point, but that's not even three minutes worth of footage. Allof that could have been cut out, take out the opening with the car crash, and you'd still have the same movie. The only thing you'd have to change is a few lines of dialogue and take out a few scenes. For what is one of the most important scenes in the movie, it really doesn't do much in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Next off, these characters are interchangeable. Granted, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) has some amount of character, but the others are flat and lack personality. Considering the story revolves around these six characters trying to escape from an undiscovered cavern while there's no help on its way, you'd think there should be something to make you care about the characters. Granted, there's about a five minute scene introducing (if that's what you'd call it) the six girls who will be on the spelunking trip, but not much is established during that part. Once they enter the cave, it's six boring characters with no personality trying to escape. I understand we're supposed to want them to escape because they're the characters we're following, but it's very hard to care about their outcome when they don't have anything that sets them apart or makes them interesting.<br/><br/>My last major gripe is with how the horror element works in this movie. I already said above that the close camera shots on the characters while they're in the cave gives off a sense of claustrophobia which can make us feel uncomfortable, that's about it. The movie starts off by suggesting some sort of psychological horror story due to the death of Sarah's family. Then, when the characters get stuck in the cave in, it becomes a survival movie with the characters in a claustrophobic environment. Then, it becomes a creature feature complete with characters running around the caverns and fighting small Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings""- esque creatures with their climbing equipment. The movie feels like it doesn't know what kind of horror movie it wants to be. Granted, it could be all three if it pulled it off, but it doesn't. The psychological family angle is only present for about five minutes of screen time, and the second we're introduced to the creatures, the cavern opens up to be large enough for out heroes to dash around and fight monsters, getting rid of the sense of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>I can see why this movie got the level of appraise that it did and I do think there were some good ideas and talented people attached to it, but I think it was lacking in a lot of places. I will end this by saying while I didn't like ""The Descent"", it's movie I wish I had liked and I might revisit someday to see if my view on it has changed."
"preppy-3","8","3","8","12 August 2006"," Very good
","Creepy eerie little horror film from England. It's about six women friends who decide to explore an unknown cavern that leads underground. While there that get trapped and find there is a race of cannibals down there too.<br/><br/>That's about it for plot but this is still very good. We get to know and understand who the women are before they descend. Refreshingly they aren't all stereotypes--they are flawed but interesting human beings. Their dialogue is sometimes hard to understand (this was done in England and the accents are thick) but you can still figure things out. All the acting is excellent too.<br/><br/>The descent down the cave is beautifully done--constantly being filmed from odd angles to keep the viewer off balance. Also we don't see anything more than the women see underground. They're surrounded by darkness and we're always expecting something to leap out. The film works beautifully in a dark theatre--it's like you're in the cave with them.<br/><br/>The cannibals themselves don't pop up until an hour in--but it's worth the wait. The first views of them are downright terrifying (I yelled aloud at one) but then it doesn't work. For me they stopped being scary when we get good looks at them--they look like what they are which is guys in costume. Still the gore starts and it is STRONG. Blood flies and bodies are torn asunder. Most of the fights are shot in fast motion which, oddly, works. It all leads up to a silly ending. I know the American version has a different conclusion than the European version--we'll have to wait for the DVD to find out what it is probably.<br/><br/>Still a good strong horror film. But DO NOT see it if you can't stand blood and gore--this is very strong stuff."
"halcyonbear","4","3","8","4 August 2006"," Couldn't understand what the fuss was about!
","I saw this movie when it first opened in the UK. I'd loved Meil Marshall's previous film Dog Soldiers which worked well as both a horror and a comedy, so I had high hopes for The Descent. Boy, was I disappointed! The characters are either so unlikeable or just plain whiny that it was impossible for me to identify with them. As I didn't sympathise with them I couldn't have cared less when the creatures started killing them, or when they were in danger in the caves. The ending is so bleak, or would be if you liked the main protagonist. I like my horror to have an edge of humour, but this was an element The Descent lacked. Save yourself money and time by avoiding at all costs!"
"kate-pryor","8","3","8","14 June 2006"," Why this is scarier (and better) than most horror movies
","My fiancÃ©e and i agree that The Descent is scary because unlike most movies which contain teenagers having sex and not fighting back (ala ""Die Cheerleader, Die"" in Scary Movie), the women in this flick fight back against the creatures. Normally there is one bad guy, and if you only fought back you'd survive. In this, no matter how manner they kill, there are always more. Thats terror, not squealing 18 year olds. My fiancÃ©e, however, thought it was TOO scary...he didn't like The Grudge either, and i thought that The Grudge was pretty tame. But as a true horror buff, i liked it. It was sufficiently gory, but most importantly even though you knew something was going to happen, it still makes you jump."
"tvalstar99","8","3","8","28 November 2005"," Unexpected good
","I read on IMDb a good comparison about a roller-coaster. The beginning is an introduction, but you constantly feel the tension, like you're going up on the roller-coaster. And then the movie really starts and you go down the roller-coaster real fast. The Descent is a movie which lets you think getting lost in a cave is scary, but becomes real horror. The movie uses some classic tricks and borrows from movies like Alien, Predator and Pitch Black but it works beautifully. It is a very exciting, scary movie, where the animal instincts of the women rise and where everybody thinks about themselves. It has a psychological element that doesn't quite work, but who cares? The movie just keeps on riding the roller-coaster and even when you think the ride is over it is just not quite yet. For a scary claustrophobic night which will give you the creeps, the descent is the perfect movie."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","9","29 February 2008"," Nice Try
","Descent, The (2005) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The latest horror film from director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) comes as a major disappointment after hearing so many good things. My girlfriend told me to pick out a winner, I picked this but sadly we both walked away disappointed. Six women travel to the mountains so that they can explore a cave. Once inside the cave they get trapped and don't know their way out so they must travel forward where they run into flesh eating humanoids. This film has so much going for it but at the one hour mark it runs into a wall and blows up in the viewers face. There are two major problems, which I'll get to in a second. Technically, this is one of the best made horror films I've seen in quite some time. Once we enter the cave the director is able to build some great atmosphere, some nice suspense and an overall atmospheric mood. However, building suspense is very tricky because you've got to know how far you can pull the suspense without the viewing growing tired. The suspense builds for the first hour and then it just hits the wall and it seemed everyone in the crowd grew tired the same time I did. Another problem is that the monsters are hide throughout most of the first half of the film. As Roger Corman use to say, hide the monsters as long as you can because when you finally show them they won't be nearly as effective as what the viewer has already build up in their minds. When the monsters finally did appear they were another letdown because they seemed like that bald guy in The Lord of the Rings. The monsters were nearly as scary as the suspense that lead up to them so this just added to the boredom. Then there's a ""twist"" at the end that I really hated. This was a very nice and strong try but things just didn't work out in the final thirty minutes."
"moorestahl","10","3","9","9 July 2005"," Neil Marshall has proved that the horror genre is not dead.
","I can only say that the amount I paid to see The Decent was completely worth it. It has been a long time since I have been made to feel so edgy whilst watching a film. I found myself at times huddle low in my chair as a result of sheer tension and pure entertainment at it's best. Not only is The Decent one of the best horror movies I have seen it is one of the finest films I have seen too. The Script is flawless, the acting is superb and the set...unbelievable. The Decent will (without doubt) become a classic film that will stand the test of time. Move over Romero, Craven & Carpenter...There's a new Marshall in town and he don't take no *beep*.<br/><br/>""They think it's all over...It is now"" Dog Soldiers."
"whonose-1","10","3","9","8 July 2005"," The best British horror film EVER!
","I literally ached when I left the cinema - I was leaning forward the entire time. It was so incredibly tense - not to mention claustrophobic, and lets not forget TERRIFYING! I have not seen a better British horror movie. Great location - fantastic idea, acted flawlessly and directed perfectly to bleed dry every last shock, scare, moan, and hard-hitting scene from the script. This is cinema that hurts but you're so scared you don't even notice until it's over! <br/><br/>If you're looking to be traumatised by a film - try this one out - I really can't implore you enough, although not surprisingly it's not for the squeamish. We have an (almost) decapitation within the first few minutes and it's pretty relentless after that, and we haven't even got into the dark yet. Bloody terrifying! I'm still shaking - I have to see this movie again!"

It has a slow start where we are nicely introduced to all the characters. It has a perfect build towards the point where things start happening and after that it's a blistering ride right until the end.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, the monsters perfect, vicious and really fast which adds to the excitement. We have a completely female cast here and with great characters and some of them with awesome survival skills. You really care about and root for them. <br/><br/>I was wondering how it's going to end and it could not be more perfect which made me rate this 10 stars.<br/><br/>If you like suspense and thrills and you have also somehow managed to miss this one until now, just turn the lights down and enjoy the ride."

"Mulholland-95","10","2","5","15 January 2017"," The descent of the human nature
","'The descent' is a film of Neil Marshall in 2005. The title can suggest some ideas: - The descent the six friends into one cave. - The descent of human towards its real animal nature, in this case, the human can do horrible things for maintain her/his own life, even kill if is necessary.<br/><br/>For other hand, along of the story, we can observe and identify the personality of the six women: - Sarah: brave and depressive. - Juno: selfish and proud. - Beth: helpful and sensible. - Rebecca: intelligent, strong and protective. - Sam: emotional and enthusiast - Holly: impulsive and angry.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are good aspects in the movie that we can emphasize, for example: - The incredible realism for the cave: the dust, the sensation of claustrophobic and the rough relief. - The play of colors's lights between red (flare and blood), yellow (wood fire and artificial light) and green (flashlight); this light's game we can see it in the film 'Creep'. - The comfortable and beautiful woods. - The sensible and profound soundtrack that transmits emotions like mystery, adventure and horror; especially in the beginning and the ending. - The use of dreams and hallucinations for represent the Sarah's traumas. - The violent battles between women and crawlers, and the dramatic deaths of some characters.<br/><br/>This movie has bad elements like: - The clichés of horror movies: in middle of the nothing (woods), the stupid decisions of main characters, false scares, and, more recently, the use of screamers. - The excessive use of blood during the crawlers's death.<br/><br/>The story we can divide in five parts: - The beginning: A car accident, where Sarah loses her husband and daughter. The meeting of six friend in middle of woods (Chattooga National Park) and the road towards the cave. - In the cave: The six friends enter in the cave, they cross narrow tunnels. The collapse of one tunnel and the fear of Sarah. The lie and the descent of Juno. The dexterity of Rebecca. - The accidents: Accidentally, Juno hurts the Rebecca's hand when she falls. The fracture and splinting of Holly. The first sighting of crawlers and the discovery of the cave paintings. - The attack of crawlers: The six friends find one place with many animal bones and the crawlers attack. Holly dies; Juno kills one crawler and to, accidentally, Beth. One crawler hunts to Rebecca and Sam. Sarah sees the horrible nature of the crawlers, she kills Beth and three crawlers. Juno saves to Rebecca and Sam of her hunter, but later these two sister die for the crawlers's hunting. - The depressive ending: Sarah and Juno gather again, they fight against some crawlers in a bloody and violent battle, Sarah discovers the truth of Juno and she wounds the Juno's leg. Sarah falls of tunnel, she dreams with her escape of cave and the Juno's ghost. Finally, Sarah wakes inside cave, she sees her daughter meanwhile we hear the crawlers's calls.<br/><br/>Along the movie, there are some mysteries unsolved: - The origin of cave paintings. - The origin of crawlers, possibly they were humans. - The destiny of the adventurers of XX century. - The destiny of Sarah.<br/><br/>The Sarah's revenge against Juno can have several motives, for example: - Juno had one adventure with the Sarah's husband. - Juno wounded and left Beth. - Sarah needs to live and she uses to Juno like bait.<br/><br/>The Sarah's destiny during story's ending could be the next: - Sarah will die in cave by the crawlers. - Sarah will survive inside the cave and she will be one crawler. - Sarah will achieve to encounter the departure of cave.<br/><br/>The second part of story is bad, it changes essential elements and it responses some my questions, but I consider that film like one apocryphal story. In addition, whether the studios do the third part, then I hope a best story and that film will put in order the errors of second part.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, 'The descent' is an excellent horror movie and it deserves major recognize for its achievements."
"adamscastlevania2","5","2","5","6 November 2014"," Good B-movie, but it's no masterpiece
","(43%) A darling amongst a good majority of both critics and horror fans, but quite honestly it's not really for me. By far the best part is the group entering the cave and them just tackling the obstacles, but once things start to get more horror based and the creatures start to show up (think Gollum, crossed with the anger of a ticked off bear) it just becomes a generic horror in which one by one the cast get picked off, and most interest from them on diminishes. And because this is set in such a dark location it becomes almost impossible to keep any sort of tabs on what exactly is happening to any one of its characters, so any thoughts and feelings around any of them is wasted as yet another one is eaten and you'd be damned if you knew for sure who it was. The direction for the most part is fine with some nice shots popping up, but during any sort of action it is choppy and hard to follow making it even harder to care. Overall this is not bad, just overrated, and it could have been a lot worse. For instance It could have been a found footage movie, and that would have really sucked."
"IDontRideBarrels","7","2","5","19 July 2014"," Almost there, but not quite.
","The first half is actually rather good, playing with claustrophobia and fear of heights until the creatures start attacking, just before the 1 hour mark. Then you realize that the film's antagonists are inconsistent, nonsensical, and incredibly incompetent until the script calls for them to specifically kill someone.<br/><br/>The monsters appear to be some kind of subhuman carnivores (who have been around for a long time, judging from the amount of animal remains and blood we see). They've evolved in the darkness to be blind night hunters - but they suck at using every single sense except hearing. One actually places its hand on a girl's head while looking for her, then starts to move on. Seriously, you can't tell the difference between a human head and ROCK? The monsters also don't seem to have a sense of smell. One of the humans says ""they must navigate through sound"" but the monsters don't appear to have developed any kind of echolocation whatsoever, which in real life would make a blind predator unable to even navigate the network of caves it calls home. And despite living in darkness, the creatures (1) are shown to hunt outside of their caves (2) don't exhibit the traits of light sensitivity despite their eyes giving the impression that they should. Instead, they seem almost drawn to light, and don't recoil when it's shoved in their faces. So despite being blind, they also rely on sight, but can't seem to see anything properly yes, this is a massive plot hole.<br/><br/>The monsters are literally impossible. There's no rhyme or reason to how they navigate, why they attack the way they do, or pretty much do anything that they do. They're shitty unrealistic villains.<br/><br/>Even The Cave (2005) had better monsters, and those things looked much less realistic. Yet they had echolocation and were fittingly competent within the narrative.<br/><br/>I also disliked the ending of The Descent. I'm not sure if it's a good or bad ending, but my first impression is dislike. There's a theory about the monsters not being real, but I'm pretty iffy about the validity of that considering a sequel was made. At any rate, as some IMDb users have said (see the discussion board for this movie), the monsters sucked and should have been (1) excluded, or (2) completely rewritten. Their appearance was fine - the costume/prop department did a good job - just their behavior was terribly written. Almost every scene with a monster should have been redone.<br/><br/>The Descent could have been a terrific horror film. Instead, it's closer to mediocrity. The film IS still entertaining but the monsters are remarkably disappointing, as are a few other things in last 30 minutes or so."
"holyspiritdriven","7","2","5","4 November 2013"," Like/Hated This Movie
","Can I say that I thought this was a really well made movie while hating it at the same time? I'm always on the lookout for a good scary movie & I'm very critical at what makes a good scary movie. I think the ""Boo"" factor is a cheap way of getting a scare out of you, while an intriguing creepy plot is how to absolutely terrify. I don't care for stupid monsters and goriness. I love dark, mysterious, haunting movies like What Lies Beneath and the first Paranormal Activity. Descent threw some curve balls at me. I hate movies like Sanctum because I feel uptight and claustrophobic the entire time and this is what Descent does to you. It's intense and really makes you feel like you're there. One girl breaks her leg and it almost made me want to vomit because it was so realistic. The sequence of events had me saying ""I hate this, I hate this,"" but then as a couple of the women rose to the occasion to fight for their lives I started to like it. Juno wields an ice axe becomes a true bad ass attacking the creatures that have come to feast on them. When Juno accidentally kills one of her friends, she becomes a ""bad guy"" which I hated. Yes, she was a coward by walking away, but I hated that she ends up getting killed by Sarah in the end. What I did like about this movie was that it was extremely realistic. Most movies like this have me saying ""Oh come on! No one would do that!"" or ""There is no reason they couldn't get away"" or ""Yeah right"". In Descent each of the women act like real people, real outdoorsy chicks and when they are forced to become bad asses, it's not like some stupid tough guy chick like in Ultra Violet or Underworld. These girls are real bad asses (Mainly Juno & Sarah). Although the ""crawlers"" seem a little cliché horror movie-esqu, they achieve a bit believability mainly by vulnerabilities: they're blind and they can actually be killed. When Sarah finally breaks free of the cave you find yourself remembering to breath. (I didn't like that her escape turned out to be a dream and you're left wondering whatever *did* happen to her. Overall, not my type of ""horror"" flick, but very well made and realistic."
"Cath8-8","9","2","5","29 August 2013"," Great movie
","Even though you know from the get go what will happen generally, this is really a thrilling movie. <br/><br/>The graphics are great and 'the monsters' are realistic (and by that I mean that it looks realistic). The story is good, but the camera work and the music are better. It gives you a sense of what is to come. <br/><br/>But what really makes this movie great is that the thrilling parts are not placed in the usual time. For example: the build up to a scary scene takes normally, say, three seconds. But in the descent it really comes unexpected and throughout the entire movie it changes from four/five/six seconds to one or the other way. The scary parts are also realistic. I don't know if an other reviewer noted this, but the actresses had moments where they themselves didn't know either when 'the monsters' would come. So they are genuinely freaked out and you hear that when they scream (like in the night vision part).<br/><br/>I think this is a great horror movie and truly worth watching!"

","I m a super horror movies lover, I've wanted to watch this for quite a while and finally I finished it today. Firstly I expected this was something like The-Hills-Have-Eyes-type of creature, um... turned out a bit similar indeed. one thing I really appreciate this movie is the first hour of it. The monsters appears an hour later but this hour isn't boring AT ALL. Looking how the characters squeeze around underneath and the collapse of tunnel are already very exciting. Another thing very attractive is the relationship between the two main characters - Sarah and Juno. Sarah's resentment towards Juno created a very good drama in caves. Obviously there isn't just the war between the monsters and human, but also two women.<br/><br/>However I m disappointed with the ending. Sarah seemed has found her way out but suddenly it turned into a ghost movie, not a good shot. I guess this means no one can make a way out then.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this to people who love gross things, but the bloody scenes in this movie weren't very good so don't expect too much from that. If you love to find excitement from watching people escaping around, this movie is perfect for you.<br/><br/>overall rating:8/10"
"drqshadow-reviews","8","2","5","27 August 2012"," Nice Balance of Original Ideas and Reliable Conventions
","A tight-knit trio of outdoorsy ladies invite some friends along for a weekend of alcohol and spelunking, but ultimately bite off more than they can chew in an uncharted system of North Carolina caverns. Darkness is an essential ingredient of any good horror flick, and after a chamber collapses shortly into the expedition, there's no shortage of that. The tight quarters add an appreciable element of claustrophobia to the mix, too, which really heightens the tension when a creepy tribe of pale, man-eating creatures appear and begin picking off stragglers. It's a good recipe, with plenty of quality spooks, but the low visibility and lack of characterization for most of the supporting cast meant I was playing guess-the-victim during most of the hairier scenes. Still, points for proficiency and for testing a few new tricks on a tried-and-true formula."
"gigan-92","10","2","5","4 January 2012"," A Rarity in Modern Horror
","A+ <br/><br/>This one is a contemporary horror treat, and that's a rarity these days. I'd begun to lose faith in the genre as the new millennium began but this movie proves there's still quite a bit of hope. The tight-framing in those incredibly narrow caves is bound to kick-start the claustrophobia in anyone, and that's before our pale friends even come in. When they do, I'm glad to say its good old make-up and well-done lighting being used to create a very real terror. But don't go expecting your usual helpless damsels in distress, no; the nicely done screenplay has some intriguing fates not just for the characters; as well as the creatures. Every frame you find yourself on the edge of your seat, really well done. And the score by David Julyan really seals the deal.<br/><br/>One thing I must mention though is that in horror, especially new horror, there is always the random idiot who sneaks up on a friend who is in the middle of a killing spree and makes the fatal mistake of tapping them on the soldier without warning.

","It's strange that I haven't reviewed this one earlier. I have seen it in 2005 and up to know still remembers it as a very good horror flick. But due to part 2 over here they released part 1 on Blu-Ray. The DVD I had was sometimes way too dark to see what was happening, but I knew what a LED TV and Blu-Ray could do with the blackest parts, ideal to see. I knew what was going to happen but still it does have it's moments. The originality lays in the fact that it is played by girls. You will only see one guy, sadly he dies quickly. just before he dies you know he's going to say something, that being revealed at the end. Not only the guy dies but also his child. From there on we start to know the characters. It's girl power and they are going to 'descent' a cave. Of course, showing off, one girl decides to enter an unknown cave but not telling the others. Things go from bad to worse. Blood flows copiously and even sometimes it becomes gory. The acting is superb. Being in trouble all secrets between the girls are revealed and that also give them something to worry about. Once the creatures appear, it's 100% horror. It's beautiful filmed, perfect editing and they knew how to use the score. I would classify it together with the Spanish version of 'REC' (better than the remake). And saying that people say part 2 is better..."
"dejan8378","9","2","5","4 August 2010"," Girls that will make your adrenaline rush
","A story seen so many times before, but what does makes this one better than most and among the best, is keeping in touch with reality on all levels. The story is build slowly while you sink into deep anticipation in the cave that is horrifying itself, but it can't prepare you enough for the terror that follows. The creatures are created visually excellent, but their real monstrosity comes from the way they act, aware that they are predators, but yet they are cautious when hunt as every nature's predator and feel fear too which gives a definitive attribution to the realism, unlike most monsters that are just fearless killing machines. The characters are not cardboards which always include ""funny"" and ""all evil"" ones that must die at some point. Big advantage is that they are all girls which leave you without ""necessary romance"" and sacrifice of the male in the end so the girl can ultimately escape. The girls are a sports tip, they search for adrenaline rush, they are not by some odd coincidence in the cave which explains their fighting abilities and their hotness off course. The actions scenes are tense, frightening and detailed which makes you grasp in your chair. And there is a second story that includes conflict between our heroes. Highly recommended."
"lewiskendell","8","2","5","10 July 2010"," Some of the best modern horror to be found.
","The Descent is a movie of several different kinds of fear. Fear of oppressing, endless darkness. Claustrophobic fear of being trapped in small space miles under the surface, with possibly no way out. Fear of unknown, bloodthirsty monsters. Fear of your own companions and their actions.<br/><br/>I've seen this so many times that I shouldn't be frightened by it anymore, but I certainly am. It's the atmosphere and the uncomfortable ease that you can find yourself drawn into this unknown cave system with these women, their underlying issues, and the unseen terrors in the dark. I keep watching it again because it's so entertaining, even beyond the normal parameters of a horror movie.<br/><br/>The Descent dabbles successfully in both primal and psychological horror, features a setting that would inspire panic without any additional enemies, and sticks a great cast right in the middle of it. There will never be a horror movie that appeals to absolutely everyone (the nature of fear is too subjective for that), but this is one of the few movies in the genre that I think comes close to being universal. If you have any slight interest in horror of any kind, you should make seeing this an imperative."

","I first watched this movie on Syfy about 2 years ago. It was the worst thing i ever saw. I didn't get why so many people loved it. Then about a year ago my sister brought home ""The Descent"" from Blockbuster and she somehow convinced me to watch it with her. It was completely different than the TV edited version, in a very good way. This movie is amazing! I had to go out and buy it and I have watched it countless times and I still jump at this part, or at that noise. This was just a really good movie all together. If you can't handle very much gore, there are 2 things you can think of. The first is that it is very dark and gloomy and has a very creepy atmosphere, so you won't be able to see very much (even though you can see most of the gore!). The second would be not to watch this movie because it IS very gory. The thing that I noticed most though was how the girls go from being adventurous girls who love the outdoors, to being frightened little back stabbers, to being these macho tough girls who aren't afraid of anything. It is a complete turn around...twice! Anyways it was a very good movie and I suggest buying it because renting it wouldn't be enough!"

","It was a winter evening, free to air T.V. was set for an evening of crap (how surprising), so I set off to my local DVD shop to hire a film. I said to the guy in the shop: ""I want a film that's edgy, scary, not horror necessarily, but confronting. Also, I don't like cheap teen-slash-em horror films, they bore me and are just not creepy. So the rather enthusiastic chap in my DVD shop said. ""You'll love The Descent"" Well, he was right it scared the fu.cking crap out of me, not because of any really fantastic special effects (though, those that are used are amazing) but because of it's ambiance (and it's other characters). Do not read any spoilers because I came into this film not knowing what was ahead and it really made an impact. Congratulations to the Brits, a fantastic horror film that is just perfect. I've not been terrified before, at least not since The Thing (in 1981) and Alien when it, too, first went to the big screen."
"insomniac_rod","9","2","5","28 April 2007"," Truly dramatic and claustrophobic Horror feature.
","""The Descent"" is a Horror movie you won't easily forget mainly because it came in a time where remakes and lousy plots have taken the genre. <br/><br/>The horrors of ""The Descent"" rely on blind,ugly, sadistic, not to say nightmarish creatures that attack a group of females inside an underground watery cave. There is plenty of blood, gore, suspense, dramatism, a claustrophobic feeling, and intense ""fighting"" sequences. There is plenty for everyone's tastes as the extreme sports sub-plot is interesting enough to make you believe that the main characters will stand a chance to survive or at least fight back. The legend of the cave although not explained in depth is also very interesting. <br/><br/>The direction couldn't be better for a movie like this. As I've mentioned, there is a feeling of claustrophobia through the running time that will make you feel like you're choking (specially when some scenes take place under the water) and being desperate. There's suspense, mystery, and tense moments to keep you interested and wondering in fear what will happen next. The camera angels will take you by surprise in some scenes.<br/><br/>Also, the score is very effective. <br/><br/>This isn't a conventional watch because it's a very innovative movie with gore elements and plenty of tension. Very recommended for any Horror fan. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a dramatic scene where the lead female's husband and daughter are killed in a freak car accident. The scene is important for the plot because through flashbacks we learn that the husband wasn't exactly a good family man. A year after the traumatic events, close friends and a guest reunite in a cabin in the woods to plan an expedition to a mysterious underground cave. Little do our female heroines know that this extreme sports activity will mean their horrible death."
"tuuli-kago","10","2","5","1 March 2007"," Must-see for horror fans!
","""The Descent"" is the best and probably the scariest horror movie I have seen in my life. It's really claustrophobic, dark and intense till the very end. And if to be honest, this movie is quite depressing too. It shows very well how everything falls apart in danger. And at least for me, that was extremely sad to watch. Another great this about ""The Descent"" is that the women don't just scream and drop down dead of fright, but they fight really hard for their lives. Obviously that's not enough... The acting was top class all the way. Alex Reid, Nora-Jane No one, Shauna Macdonald, MyAnna Buring, Natalie Mendoza and Saskia Mulder fit perfectly in their roles. The caves were very realistic, so were the crawlers. So,if you are tired of all the little happy-ending Hollywood lame teen-slashers, ""The Descent"" is just for you!"

This movie really has a good simple plot for this kind of movie,they made a mistake,found out what has been lurkin' down there for decades and now they have to try to survive the biggest survival game in their lives.

"kris-149","6","2","5","5 February 2007"," Good horror flick, but its importance is exaggerated
","The Descent<br/><br/>As a lifelong horror fan it takes a fair bit to get me excited about a fright-flick these days, but 'The Descent' had me rubbing my hands together. Back in 2002, British director Neil Marshall did the impossible and breathed new life into the werewolf archetype with his gory indie film 'Dog Soldiers'. I was lucky enough to interview him around the time of its DVD release and he was obviously a guy who knew his horror. So when I heard that The Descent was being hailed overseas as the scariest thing since 'The Blair Witch Project', I was pumped. Neil Marshall with more than $5 to spend? Hell yeah! <br/><br/>'The Descent' starts out well, with a flashback road accident that is the stuff of nightmares  enough to make even a hardened horror veteran flinch in his seat. The present-day narrative begins as we are introduced to Sarah, a woman who has recently lost her daughter and isn't taking it well. Juno, supposedly Sarah's friend, is an outwardly tough woman who has more or less abandoned Sarah in her time of emotional need.<br/><br/>The estranged pair meet up again at a log cabin deep in the American forest, where they join a group of acquaintances  thrill-seeking women who plan to rappel down into an underground cave and squeeze through its tight shafts to get their kicks. (Strong yet believable female characters  an all-too-rare cinematic achievement.) <br/><br/>They're a good mile or so underground when a rockfall blocks off the way they came in. No problem  this cave is supposed to have two ways in and out, and the girls ask Juno to check the guidebook for information. Trouble is, the risk-loving Juno has taken them to an uncharted cave, hoping to claim it and name it. As they search for a way out, it becomes clear they aren't alone in the complex subterranean system. Something else is in there with them  and it's not friendly.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall, what have you wrought here? 'The Descent' is like a deformed hybrid of 'Aliens', 'Pitch Black' and 'Predator' that fails to measure up to any of its forebears. For a sadly short 20-minute period, 'The Descent' does create a cloying sense of claustrophobia akin to 'Aliens', and as he did in 'Dog Soldiers', Marshall caters to horror buffs by weaving homages unobtrusively into the plot. But these elements only serve to make the other 75 minutes a bitter disappointment. <br/><br/>So what exactly is wrong with 'The Descent'? Cheap frights are one problem  the unconvincing CGI bats that burst out of the cave entrance are an unpleasant entree hinting at the meal of the horror clichés to come (including those tired old 'Look behind you!' moments). The overuse of high-speed shutter is another  in small doses it can give a scene a frenetic feel, but Marshall employs so much of it that it's often hard to tell what's going on at all. Lastly  and this would be forgivable if everything else was up to scratch (see Pitch Black)  the science regarding the cave creatures is all over the place.<br/><br/>Now, there are two versions of the film out there, one for UK audiences and one for US audiences. The UK version (which we got in Australia) has a rather more ambiguous ending. But frankly both climaxes are unsatisfying and make The Descent seem like a $9 million version of the stories we all wrote in primary school that ended with, "" and then I woke up.""<br/><br/>By no means is The Descent a bad horror movie. The central premise is good, the acting more than competent and some of the sets are exceptional. But its significance in the overall history of horror films has been grossly exaggerated."

","This is one very intense movie. If your looking for a T&A slasher flick go some where else. Hell before the girls run into the real threat just them going around in the cave is suspenseful because you know something is going to Happen.<br/><br/>And Happen it does and you get to watch Sarah go from a timid scared girl to one psychotic crazed women.<br/><br/>Enough cant be said about the set either I mean if this where just a movie about the cave it self it would be creepy, there are some truly great scenes.<br/><br/>There are two endings to this movie one happier then the other but both are very sad. I think I prefer the US version which would be the less depressing of the too but thats for the individual to decide."

","The ending sucked. She gets out? She doesn't get out? It was all a dream? What the hell happened? I payed for a good story, and had one until the last minute. The story had no ending. There was no finality or cliffhanger. Without some sort of finality, I might as well have stayed home and watched TV. Directors who don't know how to finish the job should never get hired in the first place. A great movie went straight down into the gutter with that crappy ending. I have no respect for a director who has no respect for my time. The director is telling the story--so end the damn thing or tell everyone they get a refund if they agree that the director didn't know how to end the story, so he just threw something stupid in to try to look artsy. It's a horror movie for cripe sake. Part 2 could start with the creatures grabbing her just before she gets to town, but nooooooo, we got stuck with that other crap."

","The Joe Cool Experience: The Descent(2005) <br/><br/>Starring: Shauna McDonald as Sarah Natalie Mendoza as Juno Alex Reid as Beth MyAnna Buring as Sam Saskia Mulder as Rebecca Nora-Jane No one as Holly <br/><br/>Plot: Six women exploring a cave become trapped far underground and soon realize they are not alone as creatures that crave flesh live underground and have discovered them. They must now try to survive and escape the cave. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to Neil Marshall's follow-up to Dog Soldiers, because that movie was a fun ride. I had a good feeling about this when I finally got the chance to watch it. This time he takes six women(as opposed to a majority of men in DS) and traps them in a cave with a bunch of monsters that want to eat them. I had no problem with that at all. Why change the basic formula that worked for you before? <br/><br/>However The Descent varies because they don't have much room, they can't really see that well, and they don't have very many weapons at their disposal. This makes it tricky as to how many of them survive, if any, and if they do, how they accomplish that. <br/><br/>A complaint could be made about the lack of light through a lot of this. There are times when you can't see well. I didn't like it at first, but in reflection I feel that it helps this movie more than hinders it. It sort of places you in the cave with them and when the first creature is finally revealed, you're just as shocked as they are. The first big reveal could not have been shot any better. especially with how they were having to use the night-vision function on the camera because it was almost pitch black in the cave. The darkness adds to the terror and paranoia of the movie. Paranoia is a big theme. The girls begin to question each other in the cave as well and only worry about the survival of themselves and not their friends. <br/><br/>I did have some problems with this movie though. For starters, with the exception of three, Sarah, Juno and Holly, the girls are pretty much indivisible from one another. It was hard to tell Rebecca apart from Sam, for example. Not much was done to help that. I also felt the ending was severely lacking. It added an element right at the closing frame that didn't need to be added, period. There was no reason to do it, and I didn't like it one bit. <br/><br/>Even with the flaws, however, The Descent was a well-made horror film and a nice follow-up to Dog Soldiers. Neil Marshall knows his horror and I expect we'll see more of the same quality from him in the future. <br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"
"somf","9","2","5","6 January 2007"," Why this film works so well
","There is so much bad horror being made today that when a good one comes around it is worth rejoicing. Usually when I see a scary film and a monster or creature doesn't show up for 20 minutes I get a little miffed. Well guess what folks, the first creature in this film really shows up close to an hour into the film and well past the half way mark. But Neil Marshall creates a wonderful drama between the group of all female spelunkers and he also directs some real action movie drama as they negotiate through the perils of an underground cave. I really enjoyed the creatures; although I felt their underground senses and abilities seemed to vary from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Marshall doesn't exploit the women in the film sexually as is the case in almost every horror film in the last 20 years and the film is much better for it. I did not care much for Marshall's much lauded ""Dog Soldiers"" but I have a feeling this writer director has a long and successful career ahead of him."

","Man has it been a while since a decent horror film has came out. This one was very good. An excellent directed film.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't make it into the cave for about 35 minutes or so. It has great character development and moves quickly. Actually you do see blood in the first five minutes unlike Hostil, Wolf Creek etc (Not to say that you have to have blood in the first 5 minutes). The acting was also excellent.<br/><br/>One of my friends is a horror nut and saw this movie in the theaters and said it was very well done. He said they didn't even need the monsters in the movie. He was pretty much correct. The suspense is there and the horror comes later. You will see lots of blood including one of the actresses falling in a blood filled lake.<br/><br/>My only complaints is I wasn't fulfilled by the ending. I think it left me hanging to much. But this movie really was good.<br/><br/>If you finally wan't to see an original horror than see this movie. It's the best movie since the first SAW."
"qiowisj","9","2","5","29 December 2006"," Horror done right; original and engrossing
","Well versed moviegoers, horror fans especially, nowadays realize that there have been no end to remakes lately. The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Grudge, et cetera, et cetera. We can look forward to upcoming films like The Hitcher being remade also. The Descent, thank god, is not like any of these.<br/><br/>An awful car accident has left the story's protagonist, Sarah, without a daughter. A year later, she travels with a group of her girlfriends to go spelunking in America as part of an annual exercising vacation. Upon entering a vast cavern, their vacation soon becomes about surviving what they've stepped into.<br/><br/>Revealing anymore would rid the viewer of the jolts and suspense in store. Once the scares begin, it seldom lets up. I commend director Neil Marshall for taking such a basic environment and amping up the fright factor. We've all been scared of the dark at one point, The Descent takes that primordial fear and stretches it into over an hour and a half.<br/><br/>The choice of an all female cast was, in hindsight, fresh and respectable. Too many times have I seen mostly male characters face extreme cinematic conditions. The fact that the actresses are unknowns is further proof to excellent casting. You will worry and fret over misfortune which occurs, I've seldom experienced this in some time. Anyone can die in this film, having a huge star would've simply killed the unpredictability.<br/><br/>A few words of advice; watch the movie with its original ending and avoid the American-released conclusion. Without it, The Descent loses some of its visceral impact, which is a shame."

","A great movie when you consider what is behind it. A relatively inexperienced feature director, not a lot of money, no big cast names, shot mostly in a handful of locations. (the hospital scenes are the 'long corridor' at Pinewood studios)Many corners were cut to bring this to the screen including using the same set parts again and again to produce the different cave interiors and swapping the USA for bonny Scotland for the location work.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film and when I rented it I just pressed menu and play then watched the whole thing again after the initial view. Loved the ending the sense of helplessness that the lead Sarah would have felt.<br/><br/>The real magic of the film comes from the claustrophobic lighting which in all but a handful of cases uses available light from torches and flares. The colour coded lighting also helps you follow the plight of each group of characters.<br/><br/>The music was OK but I thought it sounded like it was written by someone not familiar with film scoring. Some of the instrument timbres were not matched well to the situation. A bit clunky but it did complement the film well.<br/><br/>There were some plot holes and things not made completely evident but overall a fantastic effort and what must go down as a British horror classic.

Except for an early male cameo, the five women (except for the creatures) make up the entire screen time of the film. The film is well acted and the cinematography was great.

The editing during the gore scenes was very effective, slow enough to give you a feeling of what was going on, but fast enough that it wasn't totally disgusting and you didn't have time to notice how they were faked. The fight scenes were cut a bit too fast. It was often difficult to tell who was fighting what and how many.<br/><br/>A word of caution when you watch this movie.

I love that The Descent isn't just about the creatures but the relationships between the characters, as well as the claustrophobic, tightened up feeling you get when they're inside the cave. Sure the creatures freaked me out, but The Descent didn't stop there and that's what I like about it. The Descent is the BEST and SCARIEST horror film of the twentieth century. It's that good. 10/10"

","I really liked this film. It grabbed me with its claustrophobic sequences early on and then built to a horror crescendo that genuinely made it difficult to sit still. Definitely one of the scariest films I've seen in a bit. The pacing was excellent starting out slow and building and building. Effects were very well done considering especially what was probably not a huge budget. Tons of gore. Very good film. The design and creature effects were outstanding too. Be really fun to see some making of features on a DVD release. I'd like to see how and where they filmed and more on the costumes and makeup.I think that folks that liked Hostel will probably get a kick out of this film."

"Rathko","9","2","5","14 August 2006"," An Excellent Off-beat Horror Movie
","The IMDb reviews seem to be pretty polarized. Viewers either love it or loathe it. At times, it's as though we're all watching completely different films. I, for one, fall into the former category and am proud to say that 'The Descent' is, for me at least, one of the best horror films of recent years.<br/><br/>Purposefully harking back to the horror heyday of the 1970s, 'The Descent' takes its leisurely time introducing the premise  six adventurous women get trapped in an unmapped cave system. Refreshingly, there is no obligatory prologue showing us how a previous expedition was massacred. No campfire tales of local legends of mysterious creatures in the woods. In fact, there are none of the expected clues and hints and darting shadows to forewarn us that there is something else down there in the caves with them. When the creatures do appear, they are a brilliant creation of good old-fashioned make-up effects and all the more effective because of it. Though the second half of the film inevitably becomes an 'Alien'-style chaotic pursuit through dark corridors, it's carried off with such skill and relentless pacing that it never falls into tedium. Production design, cinematography, and editing are all first rate. So-called plot holes that other reviewers have pointed out are actually well explained, and the complaints reveal more of the viewer's lack of attention than any problems with what is, in fact, a fairly solid script.<br/><br/>If there is a gripe, it's with the character development. While the characters are given far richer and more rounded lives than the usual horror staples, they are poorly developed none-the-less. Little distinguishes the six women other than accent and hair color, and it's a shame that more thought was not put into creating six unique and individual characters. 'Alien', which 'The Descent' so clearly resembles, created diverse and dynamic characters in the first five minutes, and such care pays off ten-fold in our emotional investment during the ensuing action.<br/><br/>'The Descent' is a far more professional film than 'Dog Soldiers', and provides a rare degree of originality, solid scares, genuine suspense and gore. A quality movie all round."
"raz00710","8","2","5","12 August 2006"," This is how The Cave should've been
","The Descent was by far one of the scariest movies I have seen in quite some time. The production design coupled with clever camera angles help highlight the suspense. One that that is quite respectable about this movie is that it builds up to it's climax. Yeah there are a couple of shocking moments early on in the movie but the real fun does not start until you are well into flick. A movie that actually gives you time to get to know the characters, and a little plot development are starting to get rarer and rarer. I was at first against the idea of an all female cast, but it actually worked out pretty well. In a way I suppose you could say it made the movie a little bit more strait-forward byt not having any guys, who in any other movie would spark a love interest, or some other nonsense. All-in-all this was a very good, albeit simple, horror flick. It succeeds very nicely."
"abum190","9","2","5","8 August 2006"," Everything a horror movie should be
","'The Passion of the Christ' was the first R-rated movie I saw in theaters. 'The Descent' was the second. My reaction to the first was tears and a sense of fulfillment. My reaction to the second was shock and pure exhilaration. I'd have to say that they were both incredibly satisfactory reactions.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. There is a sense in the entire first half of the movie that something terrible will happen. Of course everyone who's seeing the movie knows to expect monsters and gore in the second half, and the filmmakers know we expect that. They fill the first 45 minutes or so with foreboding moments, some of them meant to make you jump, others just to creep you out. But of course, the characters in the movie don't know that something is coming; the filmmakers know that too, so they also fill the first part with scenes of laughter and moments of genuine friendship. The juxtaposition of these two tones in the first act of the movie does two things for the movie: it invests us in these interesting people and it gets us tense enough for when blood starts pouring.<br/><br/>But when the action starts, who really cares about juxtaposition? The action in this movie is so harrowing and intense that it was all I could do to cover my eyes. The gore is incredibly excessive, but I found myself not caring because it should be. We've been with these characters every step of the way- we've experienced claustrophobia with them, felt the fear of dangling over a bottomless pit with them, and when we get to the bloody scenes, they are just as appalled as we are by intestines being ripped out of stomachs. We feel what they feel and it makes for an incredibly interesting experience.<br/><br/>I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that. The characters were real and didn't fall into normal horror movie clichés. There was real human drama and it added another dimension to the action.<br/><br/>This is a brilliantly scary movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves to pee their pants."

"zakryto-2","5","2","5","6 August 2006"," Wasted potential
","I started out liking this movie, for about 40 minutes. The premise is interesting: six adventurous women go to get thrills in a cave and supposedly confront their inner demons, Deliverance-style. The movie looks good, and the women are fine while you can see them. There are many knowing, winking references to Deliverance--the bluegrass music, the whitewater rafting in the beginning of the film, the decrepit Appalachian shacks... (there are also references to Apocalypse Now and 28 Days Later and Alien, and, unfortunately and possibly unintentionally, Tomb Raider...). The film falls apart, though, when it starts relying on cheap scare tactics--those sudden shrill sound coming out of nowhere that startle the girls sitting next to you but leave you wondering what the point was.<br/><br/>There are many problems with the exposition and character development. I thought there were at least two girls too many in the film--once they get dirty in the cave, they are impossible to keep track of, especially since we didn't really get to know some of them well enough to care about what happens to them. The action scenes suffer from the typical Western problems: you can't SEE what's going on because the cuts are too fast. It's like the filmmakers don't want you to know just how much they cheated in the scene.<br/><br/>SPOILER:<br/><br/>I know I should have left my disbelief at the door when I went in to see this film, but the cave-dwelling creatures are just ridiculous. The action wasn't riveting enough to distract me away from all the implausibilities of their, uh, evolutionary descent. So they live in total darkness and rely only on hearing to track their prey? You'd think that smell, too, would come in handy. Also, does this cave and the surrounding woods really have enough animals and people to support this many human-sized crawlers? A predator's habitat usually develops an equilibrium dictated by the prey-to-predator ratio. And why are all but one of them male? Well, this is just one of the things that ruined the film for me.<br/><br/>I'd say it will come short of becoming a cult classic. It's not solid enough to be seriously good, and the problems aren't funny enough to make it a Mystery Science Theater item."
"Phantasm01","10","2","5","5 August 2006"," A must see for any horror fan!
","A group of friends go on a caving expedition only to be assailed by a pack of carnivorous, subhuman monsters. This will doubtless cause many ignorant individuals to suppose that this film is a knockoff of 'The Cave', but hopefully the superior quality and craftsmanship of the film will carry it during its American release. Either way, horror aficionados will know the score, and that Neil Marshall has clearly established himself as one of the most, probably the most, promising up and coming horror director of the new millennium.<br/><br/>Marshall says, in interviews, that his prime inspiration for the film is the early 70's classic 'Deliverance'. This may seems a little strange at first glance, but they have a lot in common under the surface: Both focus on a group of friends who enjoy going on athletic, adventurous vacations only to find that they've now bitten off more than they can chew, facing dangers from both murderous individuals and the natural setting itself. Of course, replacing 'rafting' and 'crazy rednecks' with 'caving' and 'monsters' is a pretty substantial reworking, but it's not tough to believe that this is where Marshall got his main inspiration. In contrast to the all-male major cast of that film we've got an all female ensemble here. We've got 6 people here, perhaps a few too many to allow for any real characterization of a couple of them. (i.e. Sam and Becca) Other then them we've got Sarah, who is somewhat more timid and low-key then most of the others, partially due to the tragic accident which occurred during their last trip. Then we've got Juno, the one American and the authoritative leader of the group, and her reckless Irish protégé Holly plus Sarah's best friend Beth. Again, we don't get to know all of these characters terribly well, as there is little time for characterization prior to their horrific adventure, but they at least aren't the obnoxious clichés you'd find in most horror films, and Marshall manages to create some real pain and sadness in their deaths.<br/><br/>'The Descent' uses an interesting, very effective tactic that you might recognize from Hitchcock films like 'Psycho' and 'The Birds': The film pretends like you are watching a completely different movie from the one you really are up until the point where things really fall apart. This isn't like in some horror films, where they just kinda sit around for an hour before the killing starts, as we've got an actual plot and conflict here: Shortly after entering the cave the entrance collapses, trapping them all inside a previously unexplored cavern which may or may not have another exit. Thus, they have to deal with a wide variety of concerns prior to the appearance of the monsters, including a gruesome compound fracture where they have to cram the bones back into her leg in order to splint it. There are relatively few hints that anything is actually going on prior to the appearance of the monsters, and I suspect that anyone who watched this completely blind would likely be in for a big surprise. This plot works because the pre-monster spelunking is generally very interesting and quite suspenseful. Lotsa horror movies, even good ones, tend to wear out there welcome and become excessively repetitious, but 'The Descent' avoids the pitfall entirely.<br/><br/>Once the crawlers show up things really get out of control, and the film is just this side of incoherent, as the various characters are separated, wandering around looking for each other, hiding, and fighting the crawlers etc. A monster movie needs a good monster to work, and the Crawlers are quite cool. Not truly remarkable or anything, but nasty and gruesome enough to be effective. Needless to say this film is extremely dark, not so much that scenes are poorly lit, but that many portions of the screen are not lit at all, with nothing but flashlights to illuminate it. At a few moments I literally could not tell what the hell was going on the first time I watched it, but these are rare enough that it's not too big of a problem. One minor concern is that the characters are frequently extremely tough to tell apart in the later scenes, but honestly it doesn't really make that much of a difference who is who. Personally, I didn't really find this movie scary, but it is intense and severely watchable, which is just as good. That's another nice thing about the long, buildup, as that it allows Marshall to throw everything at us in the climactic 35 or so minutes, and the film is just unrelenting from the first encounter on.<br/><br/>Many have claimed this film is old-fashioned, and while that it true in many ways, that isn't correct regarding the violent encounters, which are exceedingly modern, particularly reminding me of '28 Days Later'. Here Marshall uses incredibly frantic editing, sometimes makes the movement haphazard and jerky by speeding up the action or cutting frames. (Or, I think that's what is being done, anyway.) This sorta modern presenting it is risky, and many films like this are tiresome and incoherent, but they get it just right here, making it genuinely chaotic but maintaining coherence. I should also mention that the film is fairly gruesome. It doesn't linger on the gore, but there's plenty of spurting blood and flesh eating going on.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is somewhat controversial, and I neither particularly like nor dislike it. Ending horror movies is pretty tough, so I'm pleased as long as you don't blow it, and they didn't do so here. And yeah they did change it for the American release. I've seen both and don't particularly prefer either ending. Despite what you may have head, I don't think the American ending suggests anything different, I think it is still implying what was explicitly shown in the original ending, but whatever."
"marshall_web","8","2","5","4 August 2006"," Its not Alien, but it leaves The Cave(2005) in the dark
","The Descent really captures the true terror of being trapped and essentially being led into certain death. And not since Alien has this been so well presented. This time instead of a space craft, we find people fighting their way out of a cave, while fighting off cave predators that live on flesh and have evolved over the years, killing everyone that has attempted to go through the cave.<br/><br/>Unlike most horror movies, this movie provides us with great character development and what true terror goes along with being alone..in the dark. And from that we see them evolve and the movie becomes a fight for survival.<br/><br/>The story begins with a group of women who live for adventure that set out to explore an unknown cave. The first problems that arise have nothing to do with the gollum-like predators, but they slip, fall, and break legs in the cave that was not meant to be explored. When they first encounter the creatures, the creatures are relentless in their attack. Some of the girls fight and some of them run. As one is brutally eaten, one of them decides to fight back.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses they all figure out for themselves that they can't outrun the beasts, and that they only way the might survive is to fight back. It really takes a toll on one of the women, who had lost her daughter and husband only a year prior to this, the movie really shows her relentless struggle for survival as she transformers mentally from woman to beast. It is that very thing that allows her survive.<br/><br/>Like most horror movies there is only one survivor, and the movie basically comes a survival of the fittest as we see all the women turn into hunters in order to survive. As woman who survives fights off the creatures that separate her and freedom, she realizes she can trust no one and leaves her friend behind to die. A decision that will haunt her the rest of her life. The movie is great in the sense that it shows the will people will go through in order to survive, even if it means sacrificing another human, no matter how good of a friend, in order for yourself to survive. The movie is about decision making, and the outcomes that go with. The movie feels like Silence of the Lambs and Alien had a baby, the overall feeling was Alienish, but a few night vision scenes while being trapped in utter darkness while fighting for survival was very Silence of the Lambs-esk. Although it is not as great as either of the movies, it is a solid movie that should rank up there with the Ring as great modern horrors."

","Horror movies always had a sweet spot in my heart ever since I saw ""The Exorcist"" at the age of 12 and didn't sleep right for the next few weeks! Unfortunely, horror movies have been downhill for the last 10 yrs or so and sometimes it seems this genre is completely lost. Nothing could be further from the truth, however, when you see ""The Descent"" A descent not only physical, but also mental as the characters experience hardcore fear. This movie is scary, really scary. It messes around with one of humanity's greatest fears (claustrophia) and the directing is just amazing.

"jpschapira","8","2","5","7 April 2006"," What horror is all about
","I'm really glad with this so called ""renaissance"" of the horror genre. Well, I call it like that, but there are different names of course. A time has come where filmmakers are determined to frighten the viewer and not just with sounds and images and blood, but with a story and characters that help creating the tension in the environment. In other words, not a remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"".<br/><br/>Kind of what ""The Others"" did, memorably, in its time. Neil Marshall is the name of the British man who made all of this possible with ""The Descent"". He's made a motion picture that's very, very scary. In the line of ""Saw"", but gratefully with more intelligence, Marshall wrote his centered story focused in a little number of characters and one particular place; six girlfriends and the mountains: a cave.<br/><br/>At this moment I'm regretting not having seen ""The Cave"", which I assume must have been a piece of crap and a perfect example to compare with this movie. It sounds simple, yes; some friends, an expedition, an inconvenientIt's not. Before we are taken to the encounter, we witness an accident: Sarah looses her daughter and husband. With this, Marshall is able to draw the relationships between the girls and explain future actions.<br/><br/>You know when a movie is working on the characters when you can think about what the will do next. In ""The Descent"", there's a lot of that. After these friends go down the cave and events start unfolding, it's clear that survival comes first but: whose survival? Marshall allows us to watch, accurately, how the situation or the atmosphere may change the attitude of a person.<br/><br/>As the movie advances, we began to wonder about what's going to happen; to whom. We start making our predictions and we think we've got everything right when, unexpectedly, Marshall survives the test of predictability too: he constructs human beings with feelings and the capacity of reasoning even in the most difficult situations. It's not that I won't, but that I can't tell what happens, which is different.<br/><br/>Luckily, the characters do things that help every inconvenience, and any thing that seems supernatural is not; all is kept between the limits of reality. The film is very good because it drags you inside; it drags you inside the cave when you could have stayed outside, if you know what I mean. It is very good because Marshall coordinates his cameras professionally, with shaky movements and a lot of darkness that becomes another main character.<br/><br/>The girls are portrayed by several British actresses with lots of roles in T.V and an Asian actress with a Latin name. They are all perfect, but ultimately it's not about them; it's about Marshall's accomplishment with his independent company and surprising film that shocks you with its ending and instantly activates a conversation about the film itself and the world of movies."
"SimonHeide","7","2","5","29 March 2006"," zombies in the underground
","First of all I would like to point out that I really enjoyed the movie. It is a horrifying movie, very claustrophobic and intense. I also liked that the plot didn't evolve around something superstitious (like demons coming up from the abyss) but rather around the idea that humans had stayed in the caves for centuries and had followed their own evolutionary path. This makes the movie more plausible and thereby also more scary.<br/><br/>On the downside we have the dialogue between the girls which is both tedious and very macho - at least until the scary part starts. And here we also have a very traditional horror element; the person which is the cockier is also the person that falls the hardest (a sort of hidden morale; be prepared or else....!).<br/><br/>You have to raise your eyebrows at the idea that these people that they meet in the caves should be able to survive by hunting wild animals. They don't use tools or weapons and they can't see. How are they going to catch a wolf? In the attempt, I will guess that they would be eaten.<br/><br/>Well, I will surely recommend it anyway - the good parts out weights the bad parts by far.<br/><br/>/Sigmund"
"Nerdboy1423","9","2","5","22 March 2006"," The best Horror Film since Alien
","I love me some horror films, enough so that when I was over at cinefile and saw the region 2 version of this movie on sale for 40.00, I quickly plunked down the cash based on the sole UK audience response to it. And I wasn't let down one bit. I was terrified to the point of screaming, and had nightmares for two days after I saw it. This is no cheesy B-Grade picture. It features themes and metaphors that are mature and has a statement on the value of human life, and the road to self-destruction. The Cave, the fact that all the characters are fully adult women, the issues that are on the surface and beneath for each character even if each character isn't put front and center is realistic and has a depth not seen in Marshall's previous film, Dog Soldiers. I really felt the pain of Sarah as she suffered internally throughout, and could feel the regret, the horror and shock of Juno as she makes her fatal mistake. The ensemble works greatly, each character not feeling like a cardboard cut out but a fully realized woman, with a past, present and future. The terror, which comes in the form of ""Crawlers"", is insanely claustrophobic and terrifying, considering this film takes place in complete cramped isolation and darkness. They are not portrayed as movie monsters. They have no over-dramatic flourishes. They are presented as wild animals in their natural habitat. And the body of the film takes place within that habitat, where these women meet abject horror and each deal with it in their own very personal way. It reminded me a lot of the original Alien, with a little Deliverance on top for good measure. It also contains some beautiful artistic flourishes which really put it over the top. The only complaints I have is that some of the action scenes involving Juno were shot a bit ""posy"" for me. She did a knock down drag out performance, but the way the camera framed her when she was fighting off the crawlers in some instances smacked of cheese. But that was it, and that's nit picking. Other than that, if you want the crap scarred out of you, if you want to be traumatized, see this film, it's not only good horror, but good cinema."

But this film was the shocker within, it was the best shocker film I remember (maybe this was just because i was terribly tired, and it was late at night). I didn't know anything about this film as I started to watch it, and if i had seen the review I would never ever watch this film. But the Film banned me from the beginning accident with Sarah and her Family in the car. But now to the point I want to talk about, I found it some kind of cruel of Sarah to sign Juno's death by injuring her leg and then leaving her all alone with the crawlers. But I can understand that Juno was so shocked about accidentally hitting her Friend (in the first fight with the crawlers) that she just left without thinking' about what she was doing. And so on, Juno said to the 2 other Women with whom she was escaping:""I'm not leaving without Sarah"". So I found the action of Sarah kind of not understandable for me, because she would need any help she could get to escape from that cave. I think even if Juno had something with Sarahs husband, in that situation the first thing is to get the hell out of there. Whatever all in all a very good shocker (also for persons who hate such films) for me: 9 out of 10<br/><br/>PS: please excuse my bad English nearly 7 o'clock in the morning, too much beer, and German ;D."

Yes, a Brit! Showing the American movie moguls how a horror movie should be made! Rumour has it that this movie hasn't even made it to the cinema in the US. Wake up America!! This is a movie that will scare the life out of you, I didn't relax from about the fifth minute until the very end it was so tense. This isn't for the faint hearted, I'm not just talking about the moments that make you jump out of your chair yelping but also the moments of suspense when you're on the edge of your chair and also there are some pretty gruesome oh-my-god moments in there too! You can see the trailer here but it doesn't really do the film justice. The director has used a very small cast of mainly low-key female actors, I didn't recognise any of them which made the film so much better for me. (You know a horror film will be shite when Sarah Michelle Geller or Jennifer Love Hewitt are fleeing from a masked murderer with their breasts bouncing all over the place).<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a group of adventure seeking friends who go pot-holing in America. Things go wrong and they end up trapped in the caves below, cue darkness, claustrophobia, and of course, death. The idea of predators lurking in the darkness might seem a little far-fetched to you but the director has based his creatures on the scientific and if you think about it a little, it isn't that unlikely! I thought that the ending was going to be spoilt by some sort of Hollywood finish but I was saved from such tripe. The director takes you on a roller-coaster ride and you don't get off 'til the very end. When the credits were rolling I couldn't move from my chair. The horror movie had done what it was supposed to do , frighten me to death and although the idea of extreme sport attracts me I can safely say that I'll never go pot-holing!"

","To be honest, I wasn't expecting a hell of a lot from this. I was hoping for a lot - because I do like it when they get horror right (and it doesn't happen very often) and I really enjoyed Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall's previous offering - but I was half expecting to be disappointed. Thankfully though, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>If you've seen Dog Soldiers, forget about it for the purposes of this movie - the two aren't even vaguely similar. The earlier work is very tongue in cheek and a good laugh; this one is tense, gripping and jump-out-of-your-seat scary at times. It's not scary in a Shining or a Ring kind of way - it won't get under your skin like those do - but it will have you on the edge of your seat, make you feel deeply uncomfortable and made me jump a mile on several occasions.<br/><br/>The acting is very good - don't listen to these people who are saying the actors phoned in their performances. It's not Oscar-worthy stuff by any means but they're unknowns who do a very good job of becoming distinct, realistic people and making you give a crap what happens as the story unfolds. An essential part of any decent horror movie.<br/><br/>I watched this and Wolf Creek in fairly quick succession and actually think this is the better movie. Wolf Creek goes a little too far for my liking, and the main characters in that - far more prestigious - movie are so frustrating that there are times you kind of want them to die.

","Neil Marshall follows on from his previous Brit-Horror outing, Dog Soldiers, with this tense gory offering about a group of female friends who every year meet up and participate in an adventure, this years excursion is Caving, in deepest darkest middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>Interesting characters and a tense storyline make this movie well worth watching and proves that Marshall really has got his finger on the pulse of what is a difficult genre to come up with new and interesting ideas. He does though, in parts, borrow from other movie makers to good effect and keeps you guessing as well as thinking about this film until well after the thought provoking ending."

","This is my first comment in this site on some movie ever! Well, it's strange to have the first time here... :) I mean, I used to dislike horror movies, considered them stupid. But, anyway, it happens I make exceptions. Rarely, though. This is definitely the occasion. I find something really extraordinary in this, let me say, masterpiece. It is made just great, not TOO frightening and definitely not boring either. It is impossible not to get involved. Frankly, you are there from the very beginning! It is always the question ""what happens next?"" that holds your attention. You get naive hoping for the another happy ending, but... I didn't feel too optimistic in the end. Something no one should miss. However, highly sensitive, jumpy people should avoid watching it before sleep...<br/><br/>I recommend! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Fan of intellectually worthy movies"

","""The Descent"" is like ""Steel Magnolias"" crossed with ""Deliverance,"" with a healthy dash of ""Alien"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" thrown in for good measure. What a truly creepy, scary movie this is, and what a nice surprise to find that good horror movies are still being made.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for those with a weak stomach, as it's pretty gory. Yet it doesn't rely on gore for its scares. The director creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that would have been scary enough had the party of female cave explorers had nothing out of the ordinary to contend with. But throw in a batch of icky psycho tunnel dwellers and this movie becomes a nice blend of psychological and visceral horror.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that stuck with me for a long time after seeing it. It made me feel really bad, but in kind of a good way if that makes any sense. I felt after seeing it much like I felt after ""The Blair Witch Project."" This is one definitely worth hunting down (pun intended).<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","This movie was a real surprise for me as I had low expectations. I did not recognize any of the cast and do not recall it making it to American theaters. From the first 5 minutes to the very end I was on the edge of my seat, it took me over 3 hours just to watch it because I kept stopping it to catch my breath and calm down. This movie really makes you ""jump"" and that is rare these days, not to mention the possibility of this being such a reality. You just never know. I liked the ending as they leave it wide open and I hope they do a follow up. This is definitely must see viewing at it's finest. I have told all of my friends and a couple have not been able to finish the movie or even get into it due to the content. It ""IS"" that scary! Very creative, with two stories going on at once, all entwined together. Well done, Bravo, a keeper for sure!"
"jangu","8","2","5","28 December 2005"," Wow! Edge-of-your-seat-movie of the year!
","This movie starts with a bang (the car crash in the beginning is truly shocking).<br/><br/>Then the movie settles down for some character introduction as our ""heroines"" begin their travel downwards into the unknown abyss. Soon they are trapped within an unfamiliar cave system and have to find another way out than the hole from where they entered. While the terrors of climbing in a dark and claustrophobic environment makes itself felt quite early (I developed sweaty palms long before I had expected!), the introduction of the underground creatures was enough to send me flying out of my seat when I watched this (among with almost the whole cinema salon audience). The atonal score that accompanies the mayhem is very effective and contributes to the overall atmosphere of dread. It's also a very nicely shot movie, gaining much from the contrast between dark and (occasional) light.<br/><br/>There's a lot I like about this movie, but also a few things that doesn't work (according to me):<br/><br/>The latex creation of the creatures are not very convincing when they are viewed up close (they should have been kept in the dark for a longer time) and the ending...well, let's just say that I thought it was interesting and very frustrating in about equal measures (sequel, anyone?!). And the women were not very interesting from the beginning. They act as good as can be expected with this type of material, but the audience is not given enough of background information to really care for them...well, maybe for Sarah. There are also a few lapses in logic. Nothing new with this genre, I would say..;D<br/><br/>All in all though, a superb horror movie with guts and gore and enough tension to fill at least three or four lesser horror movies. For the fans, it's a MUST!"

","I loved The Descent, its the best scary movie by far in the last year, except for perhaps The Devils Rejects and Wolf Creek. And its British. I went with my friends and we could see some of the audience literally hiding for the most part once the film got intense. The plot is fairly simple but the shocks are effective and the violence is graphic. The acting is fairly good and the effects are kept basic, but it works, as the amount is blood in the movie is a a lot. My one complaint was that I didn't really find the ending that satisfying, but thats a minor problem, as the basic outcome is clear anyone who likes a good scare should go see this movie."
"joshua-88","9","2","5","28 November 2005"," Top of the line...
","There are few monster films released these days that have the intelligence and symbolism of Neil Marshall's ""The Descent."" The very title of the film is, in and of itself, symbolic. This film can be viewed as a study in the descent of the mind, under great stress and terrible tragedy, into madness and helplessness. It can be viewed as a descent of humanity to its most primal defensive/offensive instincts. Or simply the descent of a team of cavers/climbers into a network of underground caverns inhabited by seemingly prehistoric creatures that scavenge off of whatever happens into their lair from animals to human beings.<br/><br/>Each of the characters in the film is superbly scripted not only in their dialog but also in their reactions internally and externally. Their reactions to their situations varies as per their character's attitude towards things. All of this is well established from the first scene of the film.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the wonderful aspects of the technical attention in this film. Every shot in the film flows seamlessly from one to the other, the action is frantic and nearly impossible to make out during the fight scenes as is fitting in a film that takes place virtually by lamplight or in total darkness, and the the attention to sound design in the film creates a wholly alien sound-scape where every sound could bring danger.<br/><br/>In film there are two kinds of fear: A. The fear of being surprised by a loud noise or a loud orchestral clang, or B. The fear of what you can't see or even more importantly... what you DO see. Generally this film starts off with surprise scares. I'm not a fan of those kinds of scares and for a while I thought that this would be another typical shock-fest... but the director and writer seem too smart to fall into that trap. The film makes a slow, almost invisible transition from surprise to genuine fear as the creatures are seen constantly and are lurking, but haven't yet attacked. We, as the audience, and the characters know what is coming... we're just waiting for it. Like being in the dentist's office and hearing the drill... but you're still in the waiting room.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the end of this film and it has been talked about endlessly as both symbolic and quite matter of fact. It seems to me that most of the interpretations of the ending in this film have a degree of believability to them. Since the film represents many different things in terms of its title, I see the most plausible interpretation as that of Sarah, who has lost all of the things in her life that she loved, been betrayed by her friend who sadly is trying to make up for her betrayal but never gets a chance to, who has had to kill one of her friends who does not want to die at the hands of the creatures, and who is suffering from post-traumatic stress, as having finally lost everything that makes her herself and (like in the film Brazil) has escaped into her own insanity.<br/><br/>The ""dream sequence"" at the end of the film before she awakens in the cave again carries with it so much symbolism that it is almost heartbreaking to watch. The visual metaphor of escape for Sarah has not so much, it seems, to do with leaving the caves, as it has to do with escaping EVERYthing that has happened to her in the past year. The loss of her husband and child, the affair her friend had with her husband, the constant nightmares of her dead child, the possibly endless amount of guilt and despair over killing a friend of hers and finally the helplessness of being trapped with no hope of escape. It is a brilliant touch when Sarah, after getting into the car, buries her face in the steering wheel obscuring her eyesight, in essence making her as blind as the inhuman creatures, and sobbing as the raindrops fall on the windshield of the car and the wipers push them aside. This seems to me not only a beautifully sad scene not just of the tears of her despair but also of the wipers trying to push aside the memories. Notice that we lose the sound of both the wipers and the raindrops as she looks back up to see Juno staring her down.<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended and hopefully will get a release theatrically in the United States if not in the theaters then hopefully on DVD! I eagerly await the next film from Marshall and his more than able crew! Bravo!"
"uke2se-1","9","2","5","26 November 2005"," Simple and effective
","Was brought to this movie along with a group of friend, and none of us knew anything about the movie... well, we figured as much as that it was about cave-crawling, but at least I had no clue about the plot.<br/><br/>First third of the movie really creeped me out. It was the most claustrophobia-inducing piece of film I've seen since... well, I don't know. I was on the edge of my seat, getting into the quirks of the characters, and waiting for the inevitable breakdown of moral, leading the group to start killing each other - a la Lord of the Flies. Imagine my surprise when we are suddenly shown a silhouette of a gaping maw... A collective ""What?"" sounds through the audience.<br/><br/>Paranoia sets in. Who - or what - is in the cave with the group? More claustrophobia, and still no explanation. Something primal starts gnawing in the back of my head. Then, suddenly, we see it, and along with the rest of the packed auditorium, I scream. I'm not a screamer, hell I may flinch, but I never scream. I laugh at my own reaction together with my friend sitting next to me. Surely it can't happen again. A few minutes later it does.<br/><br/>The resulting chase through the cave system in search of a possible exit is as suspenseful as Alien, something no other film has been able to be, and when the end finally comes, it all makes sense. Why bother with scientific explanations? Why have everything spelled out for you? The true horror lies in what you cannot understand, cannot put your finger on. This is it. Combined, the truly unnerving setting, the strange creatures (what were they, and how did they come to be? We'll never know) the dynamics of the groups, ably set up during the first few minutes of the film, and most adequate acting, makes this one of the top horror films I've seen.<br/><br/>If you want a Hollywood ending, pseudo-scientific explanations, bad CGI and big explosions, you're better of renting something like AvP, or if not ""horror"" (pah!), perhaps Day After Tomorrow (How perfectly awful that movie is). On the other hand, if you want a good movie with a terrific (horrific) atmosphere and well timed moments of terror, then I suggest this one."
"Ihad","7","2","5","14 November 2005"," Forget ""The Cave"" and take the descent into the dark. You will be scared. Promise.
","If you scare easily then you might not want to descend into that cave with those girls. It is pretty tense. Be warned. ""The Descent"" is a classic horror shocker from British director Neil Marshall, featuring an all girls group and their love for extreme sports, aka ""No risk no fun"". It centers on two of the women, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), in a caving expedition that goes all wrong, the rest is just - as in all horror flicks - extras and their fate is clear from the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie starts slow and builds on the traumatizing car accident in which Sarah loses her husband Paul and daughter Jessica. One year later her five friends organize a caving expedition to help her get back to her old self. Sarah is still on heavy medication and has not overcome her loss. The six girls set out to explore a cave somewhere in the Appalachian mountains and that is where the movie unfolds its menacing claws and grabs you right at your throat and never lets go all through until the end.<br/><br/>It's dark, it's intense and you feel like you squeeze through these tunnels yourself, getting stuck any moment with the rocks collapsing on top of you. If that weren't enough, you start seeing pale human like creatures that seem to live down there in that cave, predators. They hunt you. They eat you alive.<br/><br/>There are plenty of gory scenes and there are plenty of scenes that make you wince and depending on how easy you scare there are plenty of scenes that make you jump. Watching this movie on a cold dark night together with your girlfriend, maybe with a little storm outside, rattling at the window shutters should provide you with the perfect thrill. Be warned, covering your eyes is not enough. The sound leaves little room for speculation and while some may think that a group of six women will result in helpless screaming and running I can assure you this is not the case. There is screaming a plenty but then again you would scream, too. Besides, Juno is one hell of a fighter and when she kills she does it with a ferociousness that is beyond comparison. She makes Rambo look like a school boy - let alone the fact that she simply looks hot - something I cannot attribute to Rambo.<br/><br/>You can pretty much picture out the whole movie and it's not that hard to predict what will happen in that cave. It's pretty straightforward and its predictability is possibly the movie's greatest drawback. Still, it's one hell of a descent into your darkest fears, predictably so or not. Who will survive? Will anyone survive? You will need to watch until the end to find out. I do not want to spoil anything here but it does have a very fitting ending, at least that's what I think. Just one tip, watch out for ""Love each day"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack just adds to aforementioned tension and ever present menace. The lighting and the different colors are very effective and create an overall atmosphere of impending doom. Again, you will get no rest once you descend into that cave. If you are not too scared you will also have fun spotting all the references to classics like ""Carrie"" and ""The Time Machine"". Keep an eye out for those! As this is a British production you can expect the actors to speak in rather thick dialects at times, e.g. there's one Irish girl which might be hard to understand. It has not yet been released in the States at this time but is already out on DVD here in Europe and it's an 18+ release, too. You can buy the R2 release of ""The Descent"" already. A must have for all horror fans.<br/><br/>Forget ""The Cave"" and take the descent into the dark. You will be scared. Promise."

","I'm a major horror film buff. I was actually at the Dead By Dawn Festival in Edinburgh this year listening to (director) Neil Marshall talk. Nice, funny guy. Loved the stories about his previous film DOG SOLDIERS, a movie destined to be THE Italian JOB of British horror movies.<br/><br/>But the endless re-runs of THE DESCENT trailer put me off. Its just a humourless chick flick about cavers right? It can't seriously be good yeah? Shamefully I've just caught this on DVD and I'm struggling to remember anything as efficiently scary made recently. It uses darkness like the best of BLAIR WITCH, the character dynamics of ALIENS and has the black heart of STRAW DOGS Comparing DOG SOLDIERS to DESCENT is like comparing DUEL to JAWS. (I don't say that lightly - JAWS is my favourite movie) When it gets moving THE DESCENT is less like a roller-coaster ride and more like being in a lift dropping down a mineshaft You know the acid test? When a confirmed horror film nut has to turn the lights on when he goes upstairs. When this movie crosses the Atlantic you won't know whats hit you.."

One year later Sarah is still not over her loss but never the less she sets off to the Appalacions for her next adventure, a trip down a rather large cave.Once in the cave the same group of girls marvel at its beauty and begin immediately to descend through very tight holes indeed.Sarah is the last one through on of these tunnels but gets stuck, but in freeing herself the ceiling of said tunnel collapses leaving all six girls trapped in the darkrevelation No1.the girls find out that they are not in the cave they were supposed to be in and hence nobody knows they are there.the cave is unchartered so they have to search for another exit before their light runs out. Revelation No2:very soon they realize they might not be alone and that finding an exit might just be the least of their worries.To say any more might ruin the surprise. <br/><br/>Review:with some SPOILERS BELOW <br/><br/>Well I never did catch this at the Cinema so I was delighted to pick up my copy over the weekend and after the splendid Dog Soldiers and nearly universal praise for Marshalls follow up film, my anticipation was growing by the day.So is it scary.well yes.First off, This film is not for anyone with claustrophobia, my breathing was erratic watching them struggle in very tight spots, this part of the film is superb and then to compound the girls misery they meet the inhabitants of the cave who feed on all sized animals and bring them back to their lair. These creatures are blind half human/half Gollum like things who track down their prey just like a bat or so we are told.When these creatures do turn up the gore factor really kicks in as they pick off the girls one by one. I had a bet with the other people I was watching it with about how many of the girls would actually survive and I am still not too sure whether or not I won because the ending is such a shocker and also quite ambiguous..or is it?.......My one gripe with the film is that they showed the ""creatures"" far too soon a little more tension on the ""is there something out there or not"" question would have been nice. 8/10"

","I have found it hard to find anyone that hasn't enjoyed the joy that is Dog Soldiers. It's grim, gory, action packed and very very funny. But for all it's wonders, it is (forgive me for saying this) very flawed in places. Thank god for The Descent, a film that takes all the good points of Dog Soldiers and amplifies them ten-fold.<br/><br/>If Dog Soldiers is Six guys, one house and a whole lot of guns then The Descent is Six girl, one cave and a whole lot of pain. Despencing with the pitch black humour of Dogs, The Descent plays it completely straight, working more on the sheer terror of the situation rather than the quirky one liners.<br/><br/>Although this is most definitely a creature-feature, the first half of the film focuses very much on, not only the characters but the aspects of primal fear that are inherit in all of us: claustrophobia, paranoia, and most importantly, the fear of the dark. We are with the characters every step of the way and, as such, we empathise with them, sharing their dread, as the situation worsens and their relationships begin to crumble.<br/><br/>Director Neil Marshall adds to this tension in the first hour by only showing us fleeting glimpses of the ""crawlers"". Marshall is a man the truly knows how to scare the living sh*t out of us and does so with expert precision. Only minutes into The Descent, he has audiences throwing popcorn in every direction. But this is just a mere taste as to the pain that'll unfold.<br/><br/>And there is a lot of pain in this movie. Once the ""crawlers"" finally make their grand entrance (and what an effective entrance it is) the movie takes an unsettling turn for the worse, turning an already dire situation into a truly epic nightmare. And there is gore...lots of it! Although we see the monsters in full for the second half (often a HUGE mistake for this kind of movie) the film still has the audience in its clutches, ripping away every aspect of comfort, leaving the viewer feeling bare and vulnerable, very much like our characters.<br/><br/>If feeling deeply uncomfortable for an hour and a half isn't your sort of thing, then avoid this movie at all costs because this is not for the faint hearted (or the squeamish). But if being scared beyond all belief IS you thing then this is a must see! Like Saw, The Descent has no saving grace, no Dog Soldiers style humour to ease us, just pure, relentless, unadulterated terror, complete with it's very own downbeat ending.<br/><br/>Hurry up Neil and makes us another! <br/><br/>5/5"

","I loved Dog Soldiers and was keen to see this new outing from its director. What a disappointment! <br/><br/>Girls trapped in a pothole system with not one mobile phone between them...come on now, this is 2005. Then there are the unoriginal monsters stolen from 'Creep' who live underground and are blind, but we're expected to believe they can't smell a woman or feel her even when they've got a hand on her face. So how do they catch all the humans and animals whose bones litter the cave floor if they can't see, smell or feel? <br/><br/>And where does all the light come from in these caves we are told beforehand are pitch black? Not from the light sticks and torches of the actors, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Yes, it's slick, stylish, and gruesome enough to please those who get a kick out of a thumbs-in-the-eyeballs style of violence, but unlike Dog Soldiers, which was a fresh take on an old story, this is a hackneyed and derivative tale that frankly bored me well before the end: an end which is a total cliché and an obvious teaser for a pointless sequel."

The build up is tense and creepy, and clearly a cut above the usual schlock. You know something bad is coming.<br/><br/>The trouble with most horror films is that after the ""reveal"", it's all down hill. But not this. After we see the antagonists in a blistering scene, the horror never lets up or gets boring. The director is clever in offering the viewer the tantalising idea of human descent. We see the characters fight for survival, and becoming equally as primitive as the very things that are trying to have them for dinner.<br/><br/>On the surface, it's gory and satisfying, underneath, it's enters heart of darkness territory.

I have been watching horror movies since around the age of nine and due to this, on a whole, have pretty much become desensitised to anything with blood & guts or that attempts to make you leap out of your seat. I am happy to say that for the first time in a long time, I very nearly left the comfort of my perch as this movie shocked and delighted with an entourage of darkness, gore and screaming woman. A must see movie for any fan of the horror world but if your partner is squeamish, be ready for some heavy cuddling and the odd buried face. If you still have the opportunity to get out to this one at the cinema then do so. If not, a dark room and an excellent sound system is required for the full effect."

I drove back safely, but was making a point that this film has been one of the scariest, frightening and intense movies I had seen for a VERY long time! Being an 18 certificate here in England made all the difference, a grown up gore movie for a grown up audience, its not all about ""the gore"" but a good story line and script does help, nice one.<br/><br/>I really am getting tired and bored of having to put up with going to see a kids film, 15 certificate or younger, that refuses to treat you as an 18 certificate or older and then try to do its best with the restrictions of a 15 certificate, thus selling you short of a true gore movie, i.e. The Cave.<br/><br/>People who have the mentality of wanting to watch it (any) on DVD first just don't know what the Cinema Experience really means. The Big Screen IS the only way to see a movie of this calibre, ironically it's the telly addicts that are selling themselves short.<br/><br/>The pace never slackened, the claustrophobic atmosphere never gave way to their enclosed plight, causing the senses to give way to sheer helplessness and doubt that transcended this feeling of fright into my knotted stomach.<br/><br/>The irony is that the woman with the least to live for, she just wasn't having a very good year was she?

The reason it is a step above the awfully mediocre horror films from the last years is the same reason that ""Dog Soldiers"" (Neil Marshall previous film) got a similar response: both films have a heart. They're not products ready for consumption. They are the vision of somebody. Let me explain its virtues and its failures.<br/><br/>For the first hour, the film is sort of atmospheric. it's cleverly claustrophobic, dark when needed and has the edge few other horror movies have. To cut it short: it is what ""The Blair Witch Project"" should have been instead 3 guys arguing in the daylight for 70 minutes. The characters, despite some corny dialogue and with the exception of the angry-rebel-youngster-by-the-numbers, and maybe Juno, are not paper thin. Nobody is free of guilt and nobody is a straight bad girl. They are human. Maybe they share teen conversations, but they're human. Maybe their choices are dumb at times, but most of them are even credible.<br/><br/>So this is how the movie goes in its first 60 minutes: well developed tension, some reasonable gore, and a feeling of abandon and menace. Then its little failures flourish: cannibals are shown too clearly, making their sight a lot less shocking, even familiar, towards the end of the film; action kills the atmosphere (just re-watch ""Alien"" in order to learn how not to do that) and the movie takes a turn to blood & action which would have nearly spoiled the movie hadn't it been for the highly stylistic shots and the gorgeous use of color. Both aspects do not only redeem the film last 30 minutes, but add something different. Despite being cinematically less compelling than the first hour.<br/><br/>One more thing. 'The Descent' has the highest jump-in-the-seat rating in recent memory.<br/><br/>RATING: 8.2"

","I was very much looking forward to seeing this when it came out and I was not disappointed at all. This movie really shows what one can do with a good story and atmospheric setting. The acting is top notch and they also did a brilliant job in the way they shot it. It's a far fetch from the Hollywood take that relays on special effects and ""good"" looking celebrities to pull the audience in. Like the directors previous effort ""Dog soldiers"" nature plays the main fiddle in this drama. So when humans stumble upon things they should not have during some occasional leisure time activity all hell breaks loose. The story is about a group of female friends that have decided to get together and do some real cave exploring in an uncharted cave. Along the way they get into some trouble and have to venture deeper into the caves. Problem is that the cave is already inhabited by some other creatures, and they have some habits that does not resemble those of civilized humans :-) If your slightly claustrophobic from before, this is NOT the right movie to see. The ending is brilliant as everything else and I really would put it up there along with The Shining and Exorcist as my fav. horror flicks. I also strongly recommend that you check out Switchblade Romance and Madhouse too. These are excellent and should get the attention they deserve."
"Groundziro","9","2","5","4 September 2005"," A really nice horror movie, which is not that easy to find.
","Well I've found this movie really god (and I'm not much of a horror-fan). It's hardly cliché, (and that's rare !) gore (not phoney like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", real gore lol) , well directed.<br/><br/>It is to scare you, it does, and most important it entertains you. And for those like me who love those accents from the UK, you'll be served: Four of the girls have a British accent :)!, one has a Irish one :D! and the last one sounds American :/.<br/><br/>It reminded me of ""Haute Tension"", a french horror movie which has been released in the USA and many other countries (when it's produced by Luc Besson's production company it helps...). Not because of the plot but because of the great use of suspense and gore scenes (IMO ""Haute Tension"" was better than this one though).<br/><br/>Anyway, go see it. It rocks !"
"pickles4uk","10","2","5","20 August 2005"," The latest greatest British horror film ever made!!!!
","As i was preparing myself to go see this film at my local cinema i was still trying to figure out what i was going to see. after surfing the website and watching the trailers numerous amounts of times they still gave nothing away. first of all this film NEEDS to be seen in a cinema as it is very dark but it would be possible to watch at home at night (but i wouldn't recommend it) i'm sure this film made me jump at least 5 times and had me sitting on the edge of my seat tense like i'd never been before. like Neil Marshall's previous film Dog soldiers it is very British and is quite gory but lacks the black humour. i believe this is a positive thing though as the comedy would ruin the atmosphere. the film surely is a great horror and is capable of scaring anyone (even the scene at the beginning will make you jump) and i recommend this to not only horror fans but anyone looking for a great film."
"differentbutsimple","8","2","5","8 August 2005"," A decent horror
","If you have not seen this film don't read this review or come to that any other reviews. Just go and see it. The less you know about the film beforehand the better.<br/><br/>This is an extremely atmospheric and disturbing film. The first scene cleverly lulls you into a false sense of security only to reawaken you from it with a sharp shock that will leave you reeling for the rest of the film. Making good and frequent use of the sudden jump and with just enough psychological edge to have your nerves well frayed by the time they begin their descent into the caves' claustrophobic depths.<br/><br/>The story follows an all girl group of adventure sport enthusiasts, as they embark on a subterranean bonding session to try to patch their relationship. In particular it focuses on the relationship of the 3 central girls, which has become strained after the opening events of the film. They are joined by 3 others, two Swedish sisters and a cocky Irish teenage protégé. But the girls' confidence soon begins to evaporate as they quickly run into trouble down in the caves, and their situation suddenly becomes much worse when they realise they are not alone in the dark.<br/><br/>The group's all female makeup appears to be a conscious decision by Neil Marshal to set it apart from the laddishness seen in his previous film 'Dog Soldiers', and to distance the main character from Martin Sean's character in 'Apocalypse now'.<br/><br/>Unusually for a horror film the emphasis is on the relationship between the girls, providing much of the films tension. A considerable amount of time is spent at beginning of the film developing that tension, which makes it all the more interesting later on watching the girls' relationship crack as they are put under increasing strain in the caves. This builds to an ending where you are as concerned about what they might do to one another as to what the monsters might do to them.<br/><br/>This has a plot that has you thinking throughout and probably for a good while afterward. It trusts the audience to come to conclusions in their own time. The number of comments left on the IMDb show that it has stuck in people's minds after the film has ended. The reason for the final twist, in particular, is not immediately obvious but becomes apparent when you consider the double meaning behind the films title.<br/><br/>The modern horror genre is a complicated one, with so many categories: psychological horror (Psycho/Seven), minimalist Japanese horror (The Ring), slasher (Halloween), ghost story (The Sixth Sense), zombie (28 Days Later), disaster (Alive), and monster movies (Aliens) to choose from. The Descent manages to combine elements of all these into a genuinely disturbing whole."

I thought Dog Soldiers would be hard for this lad to top, but he has done it.<br/><br/>i am relatively sure that if you are reading this comment then you have read others, so i will not go into details of the plot as such. <br/><br/>this film seems to be suffering with a really bad distribution run. like Dog Soldiers, it is a hard film to find. a great shame - compared to some rubbish that gets released, it is criminal to keep this one buried.<br/><br/>it's quite possibly more violent than any ""video nasty"" i can recall. the graphic violence is not for the squeamish, and probably not for many who think they can handle the strong stuff.<br/><br/>an all-female cast may put some people off, but you should not let it. these are no ordinary ladies, and they are certainly not dumb stupid American ladies either.<br/><br/>this and the previously mentioned Dog Soldiers makes for a quality double bill. roll on the next one from the same team!<br/><br/>if you are a horror fan, see this film as soon as possible. it will be 90+ minutes that you will never regret."
"sybaritic_vixen","9","2","5","2 August 2005"," bit like going on a big scary roller-coaster but for 2 hours - yes its that scary-good!
","This, quite frankly, scared the sh*t out of me. And i'm not easily scared!<br/><br/>The film revolves around a woman who the year previously lost her husband and daughter in a car accident. She is taken on a caving expedition by her old friends to re-bond with them - basically, they are attempting to cheer her up but to be quite frank i think a spa break, booze and chocolates would have been more appropriate - and this is from a geologist. however, each to their own!<br/><br/>The 6 women get trapped down in the caves they are exploring (how surprising, the whole cinema DID NOT gasp) with no way of knowing which is the correct way out as it is previously unexplored. or so they think...they find evidence of people who have been there before - yet how come they never declared the cave system themselves? what happened down there? after just some normal scares (rock falls, slipping, and the such like) our main character sees some human-type creature following them at random moments, and when you see the silhouette of this thing i personally screamed so be prepared cos its just frightening. they eventually find out what this thing is...and it has friends...and they have to find their way out of the cave before they get eaten - yes eaten. But it being a horror film they have few lights or weapons and the creatures(lots and lots of them) are pretty resourceful even though they are blind - they are like bats supposedly but i quite like bats and i didn't like these things - and have bloody big teeth. Having to guess their way out isn't helpful either. <br/><br/>If you love being scared i'd say watch it - i do and i was very pleased. But watch it with someone since you will need them to hide behind. Even my fella was squealing and he's pretty 'ard himself. Never before have i seen a film where the whole cinema jumped and screamed like in the Descent - so do yourself a favour and watch it!<br/><br/>P.S after watching it, you will know what i mean. Don't you feel sorry for Juno? I mean, it takes 2 to tango and she did go back for her friend!"
"DirrtyX_84","10","2","5","31 July 2005"," how many heart attacks can one person stand?
","I went to this film expecting to be trembling with fear and I was 99.9% right. It was very jumpy... when the music starts you know something is coming up and you prepare yourself for it but it still catches you off guard... like a good horror film should.<br/><br/>I loved the all female team... very refreshing to see. The only male was the husband at the beginning who only lasted around 5-10 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that they weren't all American actresses. Only one was American. The others were a mixture of Irish, English and Scottish. But it seemed like a huge budget American film... hard to explain but usually British just don't cut it, so this was a real treat!<br/><br/>A lot of good twists, gory/bloody scenes and what I was quite impressed with, although not surprising, was the one-liners some of the characters came out with. Added a bit of humour to it now and again, which was ideal as I love comedy the most.<br/><br/>One death scene caused a lot of upset for one of the characters, and it did hit a nerve with me. That was a good little bit in the story, to keep it real to the fact that here are these 5 or 6 friends who are all fighting for their lives and they desperately need their friends when things go wrong.<br/><br/>If you haven't got time to see it at the cinema, rent it on video/DVD as soon as it's released near you! Well worth it! But you will need someone to grab onto at the jumpy parts."
"theantigaz","8","2","5","31 July 2005"," Horror like it should be
","Neil Marshall follows up his surprise hit Dog Soldiers with claustrophobic creature-feature The Descent.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the horror genre I have found myself constantly disappointed with nearly all the horror movies I have seen at the cinema in the past few years. Hollywood keeps churning out terrible remakes of average Japanese films (the grudge, Ring, Dark Water etc.) terrible remakes of really terrible American films (House of Wax, Amityville Horror) and rarely do we seen a decent horror film with some good scares.<br/><br/>Mr Marshall delighted me with his previous film, Dog Soldiers. While the film wasn't original, big nor clever, it was tense, scary and comedic all at the same time, mostly though it was just entertaining. The Descent has a much darker tone than Dog Soldiers do and this is apparent from the beginning. as the main characters are introduced, we quickly learn that before any 'horror' has taken place, these are troubled and tormented people. The characterisation isn't majority developed, but enough so that we actually care about the main characters and we are given enough back-story to understand their motivation. Much better than the usual method of introducing 2 dimensional pretty-teenage cast members who are there purely for slaughter.<br/><br/>After the introduction of the characters and the situation, the second act begins with the girls heading off on an expedition into the caves. In my opinion, this presents the most excellent part of the film. The direction, lighting and wonderful sets (and locations) really broadcasts the sense of claustrophobia and risk involved in pot-holing/caving. Before we get as far as seeing any 'monsters' I was already squirming in my seat at the thought of the girls getting trapped in the caves. As the caving gets harder and the tensions rise, the strained relationships between the group members begins to show.<br/><br/>As we move into the final act, Mr Marshall lays on the 'horror' as we fans of the genre like. Subtle at first, throw in a few double takes and false starts, then lay on the scary/gory stuff thick and fast.<br/><br/>I'll not spoil the climax of the film, but it was most enjoyable. The director clearly demonstrates his understanding of the horror genre and how best to execute it. There are quite a few references to other classic films which are fun to watch out for as well. A lot of people have said there is an ambiguous ending which may or may not lead to you reading much deeper into the meaning of the film. Whether or not you agree, it doesn't matter, I felt this film was a most entertaining horror flick that will probably work on several levels.<br/><br/>Not too clever, but much smarter than 99% of recent Hollywood horror movies. Neil Marshall has to date made two excellent horror movies on a relative shoestring budget and still delivered the goods. I look forward to seeing his future work."
"richard-924","9","2","5","28 July 2005"," The scariest English language horror I have seen in years!
","This is, as I said above, the best English language horror films I have seen since I was given nightmares by a Dracula film when I was 4!!! This film itself charts the story of a group of friends into extreme thrills such as White Water rafting and the focus of the film - caving. Following the death of Sarah's husband the group go caving where things begin to go wrong (very wrong!) and very quickly stretch their relationships to the limits.<br/><br/>Some of the acting and cinematography is a bit ropey but it's all in the feel of the film. The story can seem a little far fetched at times too, but stick with it as the ending gives most of the extremes context.<br/><br/>The feeling of claustrophobia is nasty and regardless of whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan; you'll love this."
"henry-williams-1","9","2","5","25 July 2005"," bloody good
","Just caught this one and I'm still reeling a bit. I really didn't expect very much of it at all, and was a bit concerned about the idea of Neil Marshall playing it straight. Part of the reason why Dog Soldiers worked so well was it's very English sense of humour, and without that I thought The Descent would flounder. Turns out I was very wrong indeed.<br/><br/>Where the film succeeds most is simply by scaring the bejezus out of you. The whole cinema was wincing and shrieking along with the cast members, and there is an emotional depth that I'm surprised hasn't been made more of. Okay, so the cast are a little too photogenic for their own good, but then I suppose this is the movies. I don't think we'd care quite so much if Anne Widdecome got stuck in a cave.<br/><br/>I suppose the only potential minus point (largest selling point if you wear black, listen to nu metal and manage to combine a comfortable middle class background with like, so totally hating yourself)is the degree of bone crunching violence (literally). There is a great deal of blood. But... the film was quite restrained for the genre in that <br/><br/>1. Everyone stayed pretty much fully clothed for the entire movie <br/><br/>2. There was none of this psychological/ physical torture crap that everyone seems to feel obliged to put in anything even vaguely horror related these days (Takashi Miike, be very ashamed. Only kidding, love you really! Just from a distance. A very long distance). Okay, so one or two people got eaten, but the bad guys weren't doing it for kicks, they were hungry. For some reason that doesn't sit so badly with me. There. High horse dismounted.<br/><br/>Anyway... at the risk of rambling. Rather a pleasant surprise. Just go watch before they remake it, Hollywood style. The Descent is just the kind of film they'd bugger up royally given half a chance and a $40 million cheque. Which is why it's so nice to see we can make it instead."
"HMForster","9","2","5","17 July 2005"," So going caving is pretty much scrapped off my 'to-do' list now...
","I saw this film...this unbelievably brilliant film, last night. I haven't been able to get it out of my head.<br/><br/>I love horror films, the scarier the better. This film is in a league of it's own. It's the very first horror film that has not only scared me, but has actually had me upset about the characters. Yeah, when you see someone die in any horror film, you feel 'sorry' for them, but it's usually because, well, they die!, but that's it. One doesn't usually feel a connection to people in horror films, because they simply aren't made like that. This film ropes (apt word considering) you into the story, letting you get to know the characters (A third of the film isn't even in the cave, it's with the women before they set off - something I'm glad they did), thus making it unbelievably hard to watch as the situation they're in unfolds. <br/><br/>Yes, the film was scary - it made me jump a good few times, but it wasn't so much scary in the 'nightmare' sense. For me, the film was simply 'horrible'. What happened in it was horrible, and I found myself feeling sick with worry for the women, and I was so upset (and I mean sooo) by a number of scenes (those who have seen it will probably know which scenes I'm referring to....especially if you're a female). I think this film is ultimately a womans film. The all female cast added not only suspense (seeing women terrified is entirely more enveloping them seeing men, I find) but a sense of intimacy, which made it hard to watch.<br/><br/>A couple of things about this film I just didn't like. Some of the effects were a little shoddy, and something one of the characters did was just wrong in my opinion lol, but that's just me. Overall, this film is a masterpiece. An excellent premise, and one that I don't find unbelievable, which is even more frightening. The camera work was excellent, the cast was SUPERB! You absolutely have favorite characters in this film. I think especially if you're a woman, you'd relate to one or more of the characters. Special mention for Nora-Jane No one, Alex Reid and of course, Shauna McDonald.....actually, Natalie Mendoza was brilliant too....oh OK, they were all fantastic! lol.<br/><br/>I give this film 9 simply because of the aforementioned effects issues, and the thing with one of the characters. I won't say what, in case you haven't seen it...but I didn't agree lol.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, go!! Especially you ladies!! If you don't come out of that cinema with a 'favorite character' and a 'sick to your stomache with upset' feeling, then I'd be very surprised."

"badgerdaddy","9","2","5","14 July 2005"," The scariest movie I've seen in ages.
","For a relatively low-budget horror movie this punches way, way above its weight.<br/><br/>Six female friends go on adventure holidays every year, for kicks. On year, one of the women loses her husband and daughter in a terrible road accident. A year (or two?) later, she rejoins her friends for another adventure, as she rebuilds her life.<br/><br/>Tension builds slowly, and without the wisecracking soldiers of Dog Soldiers to keep things flying along, some of the dialogue may seem stilted - but to be fair to director and writer Neil Marshall, some exchanges are loaded with unspoken and difficult emotion and should come across that way.<br/><br/>The performances of the six friends who go caving are all excellent, from warm and caring to stripped-down, bare panic and fear when their jaunt goes wrong.<br/><br/>When they are underground a combination of bad luck and injury leaves their exit barred; hungry subhuman creatures lie in wait ahead. With its claustrophobic surroundings, Marshall has shot the film beautifully. I have not squirmed in my seat this much in the cinema since really, really needing the toilet in Return of the Jedi - but this was from pure discomfort, almost fear. The shocks jolted me, the pain of the characters came right through, their fear cuts to the quick. It's a simple movie which works brilliantly. Marshall has another winner on his hands, and hopefully he'll be making movies for years to come. For the sake of the genre, I hope they're horror movies as he has an innate understanding of what makes them tick.<br/><br/>Horror buffs... The credits are in the same font John Carpenter used on The Thing and Escape From New York, while the score builds from the very same staccato bass sound used in Ennio Morricone's The Thing score."

","Now I'm a sucker for horror/thriller jumpy films. But there are very few that have actually ever made me jump. I went to the cinema to see this thinking it could either be quite good, or extremely bad. I was pleasantly surprised! I was worried at the start of the film that the acting was going to be a bit bad but they really were good. The varying accents became slightly confusing at times as they don't really explain the friends backgrounds at all such as how they met, where they are from etc.<br/><br/>But I lost count of the amount of times this film made me jump! The ""crawlers"" I thought kind of looked like the orks out of Lord of the Rings! But I was impressed as they could have taken it way too far (aka Jeepers Creepers, man thing with wings! What was that about?!) It really did keep me on the edge of my seat and in parts my mouth fell open in slight shock! I'm sure this film won't be everybody's cup of tea but I really enjoyed it. I think my main tip will be, if you don't like gory images, then this film probably isn't for you as there are quite a few gory/bloodbath images! Anyway, a definite thumbs up from me & I will be buying it when it's out on DVD. I recommend it!"

A few of my group even screamed out once or twice. There were a few inconsistencies but generally did not make any difference to my enjoyment (can I call it that???) of this film. The claustrophobic atmosphere, the darkness and the use of different light sources all added to the tension and scares. It was good to have a group of girls and no men at all - showed a different dynamic and none of the girls were silly and pathetic like they can be in some films. Definitely recommend it!"

","The trailer promised little and offered less. Thirty seconds in a parade of snapshots promising more of the generic horror films that seem to be swamping our screens at the moment. But having sat through Neil Marshall's second film  a tale of humanity pushed beyond its limits and into its most gruesome instinctive self, I have been forced to tell myself once more never to believe the trailers. <br/><br/>The film is surprising for several reasons:- Firstly, it is a horror film about a group of women who do not a) do nothing but run around screaming or b) take their clothes off. There's not even a scene featuring people in their underwear having pillow fights. Secondly, It's a horror film that's been released in the last year that a) isn't a remake of a successful Japanese film and b) doesn't have Dakota Fanning in it. <br/><br/>Marshall explains that he wanted to make horror films that are entirely for adults, and this film thoroughly deserves its 18 rating. The women loose their veneer of humanity faster than a rat up a drainpipe and quite willingly become brutal killing machines fairly early on. The scare factor is increased somewhat by their attackers taking almost human form  making it even more unwholesome when the women celebrate and seem to relish killing their enemies, a part of the narrative at its most gruesome when Sarah (as played excellently by Shauna MacDonald with a ""Creepy Carrie"" expression that would make Sissy Spacek blush), the woman who is still mourning for the loss of her husband and child a year before is attacked by and kills a child crawler in the cave. The movie also smacks of a well put together action film with the show being stolen by Natalie Jackson Mendoza who plays the tough cookie with something to prove  Juno. Who chops up and kicks her way through monsters in a way that forces the words ""you go girl"" from your mouth before you even knew they were there. <br/><br/>Marshall is a technically skilled film maker and the tone is almost playfully set up with the beautiful extreme long shots of the vaguely threatening landscape (in a style deliberately reminiscent of Kubrick's ""The Shining"") contrasting entirely with the later fast paced low light close up action within the cave. Probably the most irritating part of the film is the excessive use of choppy editing throughout the fighting sequences which seems to act to distract from the action on screen and leaves the audience feeling slightly unwell, (like they've just sat through Blair Witch again), but this is, thankfully, limited. He does, however, use some fabulous visual tricks to overcome the lack of a natural light sources below, by eerily illuminating the cave with flares and the piercing spotlight of torches which maintain an air of authenticity throughout. <br/><br/>The British have always made good horror films, from the success of the Hammer films to Don't Look Now. You can make a scary film with a low budget, about three lights and some good story telling and The Descent keeps up this tradition. Overall the film left me feeling upset, disturbed and desperate never to go potholing, which I think is a measure of its success. The fact that I actually grew to like the characters before they were maliciously picked off one by one is a credit to the writer / director and the injection of some good old fashioned human tragedy to the proceedings lifts The Descent slightly closer to (although by no means amongst) the acclaimed movies of the seventies that it so wishes to join and far away from the mass produced rubbish of Hollywood."

"love2bescared","8","2","5","10 July 2005"," Great twist on dynamics of friendships and survival instincts
","This film is refreshingly different to most - although it contains traditional blood and guts/mutant monsters etc, it has quite an interestingly psychological twist on it - ie the relationship between the six friends. Although the girls' characters could have been developed more, frankly I think this film could have been pulled off without the 'crawlers' - I didn't find them at all scary, as they were idential to the 'creep' monster and too stereotypical. And you could never really see what they were doing to their victims. I think it would've worked to just play on the girls' breakdown of relationships, the emerging of their primeval survival instincts etc, just by having the rock-fall and then somehow making it that in order to survive they had to fight each other for the way out/food/water whatever and gradually lose all inhibitions as survival instinct kicks in. <br/><br/>I found the scene where Juno kills Beth the most disturbing. It was totally unexpected but really awful. What was really bad was the way hours later Beth was still alive and Sarah had to finish her off (surely she would have bled to death by then??) From then on juno did nothing to redeem herself- and it turns out she was sleeping with Sarah's husband before he was killed -what a bi*ch!! I thought this was a really good part of the plot and added depth to the film that, for example, creep totally lacked. There was no character development at all in creep, and frankly I didn't give a sh** about the main character in it as she was so unpleasant. It would've been good if Descent has developed the girls' friendships a bit more at the beginning to make the way they end up more chilling. For example at one point Sam says 'what about sarah' and rebecca says 'we can't wait for her,she's probably dead' which seems harsh but would've been more sinister if we had seen a real closeness between her and Sarah at the beginning.<br/><br/>I don't think all of the film was realistic eg Sarah stabs Juno in the leg to prevent her escape - a big turnaround for Sarah's personality! I know all your primal instincts would come out, but would she really resort to this? She must realise Juno didn't kill Beth on purpose, and if Sarah was so disgusted at Juno leaving Beth to die suggests she would hardly do the same thing to Juno!! If it was because of her husband, it seems slightly extreme!!! she could have just killed her rather than leave her for the crawlers! Sarah's dramatic change was questionable. It as also a bit dubious the way the girls fought off the crawlers, especially when J and Sarah were attacked by a group of them. The crawlers tore bodies apart -they would have just sunk their teeth into the girls' necks before they had a chance to fight!! It was hard to see what was happening, especially when Holly is killed and Juno then kills a crawler. And what did Sarah do to Holly's body to make her head fall off?? The bit when they climbed across the void -I didn't understand at all how they secured the lines, moved along etc. Was someone holding the rope at each end as each girl went across? If it was secured instead, how would it be secured tight enough at each end to take their weight?? I found it frustrating.<br/><br/>A lot of people criticised the ending but I think its very effective. When we see Sarah escape, burst out of the ground, run to the car and drive away, I had shivers down my spine because I could imagine myself there, and the need to get away would be so intense.I found it so creepy, half expecting the crawlers to appear, the fact it was so deserted and all her friends were dead inside the cave, the way it brings you back to the scene where they first arrive at the cave. Then she wakes up and realises she hasn't in fact escaped... she sees her daughter and stares at her with an insane smile as the crawlers close in...You know that basically she's f**ked...as the camera pans out you see she's come to another yawning void with no way to get to the other side and thus no way out. She is just waiting to be killed, but the fact she's pretty much lost the plot by now means she isn't afraid. I found this quite moving in a way, the little girl 'sees' her mum all bloody and just says 'Mummy', it's like she's comforting her and keeping her distracted.<br/><br/>Basically I loved this film. it was well-paced, brilliantly acted and really creepy."

","When was the last time a really good horror movie was released at mainstream cinemas?? Unfortunately we are forced fed Hollywood Teen Scare drivel such as House of Wax, Hide & Seek, Darkness Falls etc. Well finally The Descent has changed all that. OK, it probably won't gain the iconic status of say The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it delivers exactly what I hope people want and expect of their horror movies that is nail biting suspense, underwear soiling shocks and plenty of blood.<br/><br/>Kudos to the director for his patience in building the tension slowly and creating an unbearably claustrophobic atmosphere before his evil ""creepers"" are perfectly introduced around the hour mark. From then on its carnage.<br/><br/>A message to the big studio execs.....give Mr Director a blank cheque and then DO NOT INTERFERE. Perhaps then we can see more horror movies of this calibre."

","Having seen dog soldiers, I was expecting a rather comical, tongue in cheek, run of the mill horror movie. But I was pleasantly surprised. Usually, horror movies with such in your face gore don't scare me at all. I'm much more unsettled by implied horror. But this movie brought a whole new perspective for me. I can honestly say I have never jumped and screamed so much in the cinema. I think I screamed out loud about 9 times, and this is highly unusual for me. Although the plot is paper thin, as was dog soldiers', it is still a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It takes a while to get going, about half an hour in before you see any real action, but once it gets going it's like a roller coaster ride. A real scream. I can't wait to see the next movie form this director. This movie is great if you like your movies bloody and shocking. I highly recommend it."

","INSANE!!!!!<br/><br/>PROS: To start off, the build up of tension in this movie was flawlessly executed. From beginning to end the was a constant state of uneasiness with every scene. I really enjoyed that the film was able to capture enough tension even when there was a non monster scene. The next part that goes with this is the ending, which was remarkable if I might add. The whole process that led up to the finale was just outstanding, then when the end finally came to be you got sucked right back in again. This was all helped by some impressive acting. Each and every character had a place, and each character wasn't a stereotype. I use character for an overall image, but the actors weren't characters, they were people and acted like people. The fact that each role in this film was captured in a very genuine manner was quite nice. The final thing that I liked was the direction the movie went down. What the movie tried to accomplish was simple and well executed, it was not a clouded idea nor was it not realized.<br/><br/>CONS: The one con that I found was a small amount of plot holes. Although I liked the way everything was addressed and though it was addressed carefully, I just had wished that what got us to the problem was more clear. The initial problem was looked over in order for the main problem to get discussed.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"
"oaspag-71318","10","2","6","17 August 2016"," Need more than 1000 words. IN ONE WORD. PERFECT.
","Hi !<br/><br/>This movie is pure excellence, unlike the 'it's pure garbage' that I am reading from people whom did not like it at all. I will respect others opinions and if they fell it's an utter poss and it's 'the worst film I ever saw in my life.. With that said. So back to my feelings on this. I really can't understand people, I just don't...I'll try... I know it is not a movie that tries to be Oscar-worthy with deep layers of morality (there is some in this movie) and complex character development around a dramatic story. For horror ones (I despise this term I prefer thriller/suspense with horror elements, I know this is high categorizing which I don't like either, since it's pigeon holing, The audience also forgets that there are over 50,000 movies, it's 'normal' if someone else remade what you did. At some point, things can look similar when there are so many movies. ..so please cut some slack and be considerate of how hard it is to make a movie. So with that, further, said. <br/><br/>I want to say this movies is pure excellence because it hits the right notes : claustrophobia (some don't like that, hence hate the movie..understandable, still this element raises the movies scare factor), darkness (extremely important to increase the psychological factor (who is isn't afraid of utter darkness - stuck in a cave?), extremely impressive soundtrack and aural experience (the sound designers made sure there is reverberation and 'cave echo' everywhere in the movie (unlike in Descent 2, which is more flat sonic-ally and greatly affects the viewers spatial situations effect (trapped in a silent cave where every surround sound is heard in echo 3D surround sound fashion. In fact, The Descent boasts an incredible 7.1 channels instead of regular 5.1 (still great), the difference is massive, you hear creatures behind you, (side left, side right) everywhere this level of 3D surround sound 'envelopping/engulfing' effect is not heard of in other horror movies, where you feel more a passive eye, here you feel on the scene right in the cave - with the women.))), it features all-women cast (new, but not,,but new enough - as spelunkers, very new thus a originality), the creatures (which everyone laughs out as poor man's version of 'ghollum troll' or some other 'fake *ss' ''costume-prosthetics''...great ''prosthetics'', like great '3D CGI', as a tool, have their place and I don't think the 'bareness' of these cave creatures should be so dismissed (''a 'naked dude' with a 'ghollum mask'...nice..very scary.not.''). For me, the first part is a slow build-up, and the best one, I saw this at Fantasia in 2005, it took my breath away (No movie had done this in at least 20 years time, since the first Alien, and this movie is an homage to it also, Mr.Marshall said that he was inspired by these great horror movies such as the terrifying and slow potboiler Alien 1 of Mr.Scott),<br/><br/>I remember looking at these women fighting the Cave, fighting themselves (friendships dissolve as they are now - each fending for themselves), fighting death (pure survival), fighting creatures (yeah OK they don't exist - its a 'FICTION' read that word/Calm down with the 'it doesn't make sense/it's stupid and nonsensical brainless movie' accusation and an Excellent at that, but still they are late enough and have a certain degree of 'fitting in', it 'could' be possible (even if some said, these creatures would have evolved outside the cave/left it...not necessarily, they could have evolved Inside), When they face the pits/chasm it's utterly terrifying (to try to cross over and not fall to their death), the cave is so mean and unforgiving. Mr.Marshall uses important elements like coloring palette (he uses red during deadly scenes, green in more danger-free scenes, important red flare lighting and deep shadows blacks darkness to hide the elements and enhance utter fear) scares (great) hate the 'jumpscare' 'boo! a flying cat!' categorization (so pejorative and demeaning, it cheapens the horror genre to a big joke - 'cheap scares'...thanks..but dread is scary...but you do not scare someone - with ONLY dread, you need higher than that, 'jump' scares are that element that TAKE people by SURPRISE, you need it, you may despise it but it's a reality, to scare you, you need to be startled. The actress are incredible and heightened the fear (they are screaming, emotions and full of tears, you know this could BE YOU in the cave, surviving). , the scares are extremely well made with musical accents (staccato) but the whole movie is almost in surround silence (we only hear the surrounding noise of the cave and women's footsteps echos- frightening), there is utter viscerally and 'fight to the death' to live. It's a story of pure survival (blood, gore is never just for the sake, they really fight to death and Mr.Marshall makes sure we feel the grittiness of the survival. Survival Horror categorization (is what is used in games like Resident Evil)). <br/><br/>The cave is so foreboding is takes a form of 'character' itself (the shadows sculpt all the nice rock patterns, very detailed and realistic set construction, I saw the making of the Styrofoam rock sets). SIMPLY PUT : THE BEST SUSPENSE THRILLER HORROR/WITH HORROR ELEMENTS SINCE ALIEN 1 AND SHINING, YES, EVEN SHINING OR EXORCIST. Congrats Mr.Marshall, please make The Descent 3 (Descent 2 was great but nowhere near 1st one), I await it so much."

A year later, Sarah's all girl friends group reunite in hopes of bringing Sarah out of her shell. The thrill seeking group adventures into an underground cave and tunnel system that Juno (Mendoza) has set up to explore.

A few of them keep hearing sounds of things moving in the dark around them until they are confronted by a human form creature that looks like a bat. White, blind and hideous the creature shockingly pounces on one of the members and the nightmare has begun. Writer/Director Neil Marshall unleashes his version of hell on both his characters and the audience. The truly horrifying Crawlers begin to pursue the girls and it turns out there are many of them. This disorienting movie consistently keeps you off balance and engaged throughout. Once the crawlers are brought in and revealed, Marshall uses every classic and stylish trick in the book to get as many hair raising moments, jump scares and bloody mayhem as can and boy does he deliver. This is an unrelenting thrill and scare show that forces you to travel its nightmarish road. Never becoming exploitative or cruel, 'The Descent' maintains a highly entertaining path while dragging you through the terror. Bloody, nasty and downright scary on every level, this is Neil Marshall's masterpiece and should be considered a classic for years to come."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","6","8 October 2013"," The Very Definition of Horror in Its Purest Form.
","One of the most genuinely frightening & paranoia inducing films to come out in a long time, The Descent is an ingeniously crafted horror masterpiece that seamlessly intertwines its incredibly tense & cleverly paced story with inventive cinematography, tight editing, mesmerizing score & strong performances from its all-female cast to create an undeniably creepy atmosphere of unrelenting claustrophobia which eventually launches such an all-out assault on our senses that the ensuing events turn into nothing short of an escalating experience of nightmarish horror.<br/><br/>Inducing fear from its isolated look, grim tone & eerie mood rather than relying on typical jump scares, The Descent is the very definition of horror in its purest form and with its sinister plot & nerve-jangling adventure, easily qualifies as one of the scariest films of this or any other decade. Its story concerns Sarah; an adventure junkie, who accompanies her friends on a spelunking trip after suffering a horrible tragedy an year ago. But their adventure soon turns into nightmare as their cave expedition goes horribly wrong & they find themselves being pursued by strange blood thirsty creatures.<br/><br/>The direction by Neil Marshall is very impressive as he lets the claustrophobic nature of his film play mind games with the viewers & by employing the 'less is more' trick, he truly succeeds in letting our imagination run wild. The screenplay makes sure that plenty of time is devoted to creating the build up, tension & mood of isolation while moving the story forward. The mountains & underground caves are exquisitely photographed but it's the effective use of shadows & lighting where cinematography plays its best part. And David Julyan's score contributed immensely in evoking the perfect tension & mood this film was aiming for.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, this film features an all female cast of six beautiful actresses who all chipped in with strong & sincere performances which apart from providing this film a realistic mood also made the drama all the more plausible. The character of Sarah is the centered piece around whom the whole story revolves, and Shauna MacDonald has done a terrific job in elegantly capturing the trauma, uncertainty & survival instincts of her character. The rest of the performances are no slouch either & everyone did an amazing job in their given roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Descent is a claustrophobic horror that works as a masterfully executed piece of original work from Neil Marshall and is an illustrious example of a horror film done right. It plays with your mind, forcing you to make assumptions & imagine the outcomes, and yet manages to surprise & shock you psychologically & viscerally. Destined to bring a smile on the face of every horror fanatics along with many screams of horror, this bloodstained nightmare of a spelunking adventure gone horribly wrong is absolutely recommended.<br/><br/>P.S. Make sure you grab the Unrated Cut of The Descent for it contains the original ending which sensibly wraps this film in a way that was always meant to be. The alternate ending (which was included in its US release) cuts to credits before its real ending & only ends up destroying so many of the possible outcomes it could've had, just for the sake of cashing in on its success with an uninspired sequel which eventually happened."

"kooleshwar","9","2","6","30 January 2007"," As good as they say it is.....
","I was looking for a good action film when I came across Dog Soldiers quite obviously I didn't find it, but I looked for other movies by Neil Marshall and came across ""The descent"", I immediately remembered the movie as being similar to ""the Cave"" and being released close each other.<br/><br/>What occurred to me is that both have obviously been inspired, by ""The Descent"" a popular novel by Jeff Long, but the difference(Hehe) ends there, while Cave is one of the better PG-13 (the bane of movies) rated movies which is quite clearly inspired by the novel, a movie with that rating can only get this good, ""The Descent movie"" even though it shares the same name as the novel is quite different from both, if you've seen ""The Cave"" or read the novel then in fact the movie will have your mind ticking even more.<br/><br/>I've seen hundreds of movies and thanks to a traumatic experience in my childhood when I saw The Omen, and was mind-fu##ed for 2 weeks (boohoo), I've lost all fear of horror movies and rarely and I mean rarely get surprised by the timing or nature of the ""Shock Scenes"" and even by THOSE SHOCKS THAT NEVER CAME, but hell there were all of 4 scenes that left me completely shocked and thats more than I've been in a few years, one particular scene had me chilled to bone (and freaked my mom, a horror movie fan even more, when she watched it separately),trust me when I say THIS MOVIE HAS BOUGHT A FRESH BREATH TO THE ACTION-HORROR-THRILLER GENRE NOT SEEN IN DECADES.<br/><br/>The movie is a pioneer of sorts in the action-horror-thriller genre some examples are:- <br/><br/>1) No guns.<br/><br/>2) All women cast.<br/><br/>3)No black people who get killed first haha kidding (not that I care but luckily the film-maker realises others don't either you cast according to your vision not to be demographically correct).<br/><br/>4)Lots of unanswered questions, in fact a dramatic standoff that I expected never came, everyone will have many different viewpoints to at least 3 or 4 major events in the movie.<br/><br/>5)The heroine is not a perfect, moral, indestructible, lucky person but in fact vulnerable and I BELIEVE displayed a major lack of judgment in a particular scene.<br/><br/>6)A creature that's probably as vulnerable as the people.<br/><br/>7)Fantastic depiction of the mental condition of the characters that changes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>and many more.....<br/><br/>For a B-movie the production values were fantastic including the sound effects, cinematography and direction, the script was extremely well written with absolutely no corny dialogues or scenes.<br/><br/>One of the only complaints was that the claustrophobic confines of the caves was never really effectively captured and even though the tension always remained the feeling of claustrophobia never really hits you SAVE FOR ONE BRILLIANT SCENE, if this was done then this would have been as near a perfect film of this genre as possible, Maybe some more POV (point of view) shooting was required (the caving videos on TV have me squirming).<br/><br/>The acting of this movie was top notch with a brilliant and subdued performance from the entire cast, none of the histrionics that you would expect from an all women cast. The number of QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED AND ANSWERED JUST BY MERE LOOKS speaks volumes of the quality of acting.<br/><br/>The movie has too many brilliant sequences to name but the end and the opening sequence are worth mentioning.<br/><br/>This movie may not be as scary as other films due to many points but has its fair share of horror and shock moments, besides other great points, it is after all a multi-genre film.(Not a good judge of fear but i feel a movies only truly scary when the movies based in real life situations, because I'm definitely never going into unexplored caves so its difficult to identify with).<br/><br/>Besides the one flaw this movie has some minor plot holes and inconsistencies of which only one is alarming but cannot be mentioned without spoilers, these too marginally help in removing this movie from the near perfect ratings.<br/><br/>In all we have a near perfect ACTION-HORROR-thriller movie that a breath of fresh air, and has brilliant acting and superb production values even when compared to the better budget films.<br/><br/>A must watch if your fan of the genre in particular or horror/action/thriller movies in general.<br/><br/>-s some plot holes and inconsistencies, claustrophobia doesn't hit.<br/><br/>+/-s the error in judgment (I'm fine with it though). <br/><br/>+s brilliant acting, superb production values, large number of brilliant scenes, breath of fresh air, a true multigenre film.<br/><br/>total 9/10 (if you factor in the budget, and the fact that it exceeded expectations, and that such efforts from British filmmakers need encouragement then this movie is a ten but will take a call on that after many years and some repeat viewings)"
"anicerman","8","2","6","13 January 2007"," One of the best horror films in recent years
","I would admit that I'm a big fan of horror films and this one is certainly a surprising piece of work, which makes you feel tense as much as Saw does.<br/><br/>After one year since the deaths of Sarah's husband and daughter, Sarah's friends invite her to have a cave adventure to help her get through the tragedy. However, Juno, who's responsible for leading the way, brings them to a not-yet-named cave. During the exploration the tunnel collapses so they can't get back to their way in. When they get deeper to the cave, they understand that some people have been to the save long time ago but never managed to get out and some kind of unknown creatures are inside the cave...<br/><br/>The whole film is so thrilling and addictive as you are like the group that you don't know what's ahead. A lot of incidents also make you feel worried for them. This is better than those so-called horror films that only try to frighten you by the sudden appearance of someone/thing.<br/><br/>The unknown creatures also surprised me as when the film goes I thought those might be something like those in The Cave that makes the film so terrible. They make more sense to me as their existence is rather possible (though I don't think it's possible for the women to beat them that easily).<br/><br/>I like the first part more as it's more adventurous. The second part, especially after Sarah finds Beth, is too bloody and there's a pond of blood all of a sudden. It's just not necessary.<br/><br/>Of course this is another film describing the weaknesses of human beings. What you'll see are betrayal, hiding, cheating, selfishness and revenge. I would say they are quite true and happen in daily life.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this film to any film lovers, especially horror film ones as this is much better than those bad mainstream horror films. The story surely makes up for the wrongly-put bloody scenes so just go for it and you'll find it's worth it."

","If you want a good scare and not another Japanese remake look no further. Neil Marshall is one heck of a young writer / director and he doesn't make it easy on you with this film. He brings the thrills, gore, and the best scare of recent times. He has a nice set-up so you get to know the ladies and start to get to know them- this is key to a decent horror movie. If you don't care about the characters than the horror movie will most likely fail which is what most writers / directors of recent times forget. Neil, you should also check out ""Dog Soilders"" by him, gets you into the characters just enough than whacks you over the head with the bad bad things that happen to the ladies. Take a bit of time, turn out the lights, fire up the DVD, and enjoy the descent (cheesy line but had to be done!). ***THIS IS THE REVIEW FOR UNRATED DVD = recommend that because you will see the proper ending!"

","If you are tired of renting horror DVD's that ten-year-olds would laugh at, then you are ready for ""The Descent"". As I watched this truly stomach-churning nightmare unwind, I found the film reminiscent of some of the most repulsive films I have ENJOYED, like ""Wrong Turn"",""Cabin Fever"" or Rob Zombie's underrated ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". I totally relish trying to envision or predict exactly how and when the small groups of people featured in these types of film realize that something is not quite right. That one precipitating event that occurs in a good horror film should always be unique and creative, and the rapid progression from boredom and normalcy to surreal lunacy should occur with savage cruelty but also with the smoothness of a frozen lake in a Minnesota winter. It is in this way that this film is a resounding success, along with an ending that is somewhat open to interpretation. Indeed, if you want to rid the room of bratty preteens who THINK they like horror films, simply screen ""The Descent"" and count how fast they cower away like cockroaches from sunlight!"
"charchuk","9","2","6","25 December 2006"," Surprisingly effective creature feature
","An exceptionally scary, effective, and surprisingly involving horror/thriller. Despite the monsters not appearing until over halfway into the film, the story not only manages, but excels, at staying exciting and thrilling throughout. The story is built up quite well in the exposition, though a bit more character development was needed before the mayhem begins. The car crash at the beginning of the film was so well-executed and yet still made me jump. Even when they are just lost in the cave, without any monsters, the suspense is nearly unbearable, just through the claustrophobic set and dark lighting. Once the action sets in, it's sufficiently gory but also serves the story well. All in all, just a great horror film.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, for a no-name cast. The girls were all believable as spelunkers, although not so much as action heroes. Technically, the film was very effective, with some great camera work and terrific creature makeup. And the story was well above a typical creature feature flick. The character dynamics underlying all the action was what made the film so involving. Sarah's transformation was very 28 Days Later-esquire, and the ending - the original, international one - was quite interesting and very Jacob's Ladder-esquire. Quite the surprise for what seemed like a generic horror film."
"nobbytatoes","9","2","6","22 November 2006"," one thrill ride
","Film is a great medium. Film makers have utilised the medium to entertain us, but the greatest element of film is its ability to force an emotional response from us. Laugh, cry, enrage, move and scare. Horror has always been a genre with drawing power. Whether to simply scare, or injected with a contemporary or political edge. A current trend of horror films is torture porn. Agonising scenes of pain and misery, violence through at the audience without restraint. While some film makers have made great pieces of cinema with the torture porn, many have lacked the merit and style ending with a pointless film with an abundance of gore.<br/><br/>The Decent is a drawn back to the classic seventies horror; Alien the main point of reference. A year after Sarah loses her husband and child, she and five other friends pick up their thrill seeking trend on a caving expedition. Obviously while the expedition starts fine, yet soon after goes wrong. When their only point of exit collapses and traps them, they need to find another way out, but that's not their only problem. Fear, claustrophobia, paranoia from the dark, and the current inhabitants of this cave.<br/><br/>Director Neil Marshall's previous film Dog Soldiers was an interesting yet muddled film. Not sure where he wanted to take it; dark comedy, action or full on horror. The Decent sees Marshall knowing exactly where he wants to head, with methodical precession. The Decent is one of the first horror films in a very long time that hasn't relied upon violence to make the audience uncomfortable. From the get go dread and the most foreboding atmosphere surround you. The beginning of the caving routes are extremely claustrophobic and unsettling. Deafning silence and minimal sound effects, perpetually keep the anxiety levels high.<br/><br/>Marshall has brilliantly use the widescreen format by hardly using it at all. Crawling through tunnels and paths, only small amounts of the screen are lit, highlighted and washed from the womens flash lights, red flares, glow sticks and the eerie, grainy night vision camera. The crushing, empty blackness intensifies the unknown and unseen. Marshall wrings every last bit out to scare and unnerve, he shows he's a horror fan boy, brings out all he can to pull out the biggest punches he can muster.<br/><br/>While the story may not be very complex, the character interactions are far from it. Friendships strain from past events, Juno's ego of leadership which only leads to recklessness. The danger starts internally of the group, even before the unknown starts to draw its head out. The dynamics of the group is kept believable by a very strong cast. Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Nora-Jane No one, Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid and MyAnna Buring are all strong and fight against the stereotypical heroin in trouble.<br/><br/>The Decent is fist clenching, terrifying and physically exhausting.

This movie will keep you on the edge of your sit and the ending will leave you even more horrified. It's well crafted to keep your eyes on the screen, and the cinematography is brilliant.

"cereneau","9","2","6","18 August 2006"," The Best Horror Movie I've Seen
","Its weird. I woke up yesterday morning and went straight to ironing the wrinkles out of a pair of pants I was going to wear. For some reason, while I was ironing, I started thinking about ""Alien vs. Predator,"" and then ""Freddy vs. Jason."" I remember how lame ""Freddy vs. Jason"" was, but then I started thinking about how much Freddy and Jason both scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. With that thought floating about, I became a bit saddened by the fact that I am now an adult and would probably never be scared by a movie ever again. You see, for the longest time I have been adamant about my ability to walk away from a scary movie completely unscathed. I have worn this trait around as a point of pride.<br/><br/>No more.<br/><br/>In some ironic turn of events, I ended up seeing ""The Descent"" last night, you know, just for the heck of it. I can honestly, truly, say that this is by far the best horror film I have ever seen. Be sure to make the distinction there. While movies like ""Boogeyman"" or the upcoming ""Pulse"" will bill themselves in the horror genre, the majority of the films will rely heavily on scare tactics (pop out and scare you) and very little on actual horrific sequences.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is a film that is truly horrifying.<br/><br/>The movie starts fairly quickly. We meet a group of adventure-seeking women who meet up in the Apalachian Mountains to do some cave-exploring. Okay, so its a bit unlikely, but this is not as important as what happens once they are inside the cave. From the very beginning, the cave has a very chilling aura about it (One of the women even places her fingers in what appear to be claw marks in the rock). Despite the eeriness of the cave, itself, the women press on, squeezing through tight passages and enjoying all that the cave system has to offer. However, a collapse of rocks soon makes their exit plan unattainable. To survive, they must work together to find another way out of the cave. However, as they progress, they run across something that is truly horrifying, something living in the depths of the cave system. Together, they must help one another, fend off the terrifying creatures, and make it out of the cave alive.<br/><br/>By itself, the plot seems a little lame. But take my word for it, this movie is anything but lame. The setting of the cave is truly brilliant. With each new corridor that they enter, things get more and more frightening, and people with claustrophobia will undoubtedly be tense as can be watching these women barely make it through these tight cave systems. In addition, the creatures in the cave, though fictional (hopefully), are some of the most terrifying incarnations to ever grace the screen. The comparisons to ""Alien"" that were featured in the trailer are spot on here. There's a truly alien-like nature to these creatures, and they offer a much more terrifying experience than ghosts (""The Sixth Sense""), dead women crawling on the ground (""The Grudge""), inbred hillbillies (""Wrong Turn""), or flying witch-a-mahoosets (""Darkness Falls""). These creatures are horrific!<br/><br/>If you are like me, by then end of the movie, you will be so disturbed that you will contemplate not sleeping, you will be utterly amazed by how frightened you truly were, and swear off caves for the rest of your life. Though there are some scare tactics in the movie, there are much more frightening things going on here that are sure to get under your skin and stay for long after the movie closes. I never thought I'd like a horror movie so much, but this is truly a brilliant piece of terrifying cinema.<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of ""Alien"" and for anyone wanting to be scared out of their mind!<br/><br/>Directing: 5 out of 5 Stars Acting: 4 out of 5 Stars Writing: 4 out of 5 Stars Overall: 5 out of 5 Stars"
"bonnie91","8","2","6","17 August 2006"," Dark and Claustrophobic Horror
","The Descent is a horror movie that develops a plot that's original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. I had never seen the actresses who play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.<br/><br/>The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and uncompromising (European version).<br/><br/>Support the WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES campaign!

","I went into this movie with pretty low expectations,having read about it a year or two ago and thinking the plot was for the most part unoriginal.Though the plot may be similar to many other films in the horror genre it really did not matter.The film is in fact very original in its execution but even if it were not the acting and camera work were nothing short of fantastic.The mood and atmosphere work so well no monsters are even needed they are a bonus. The caving scenes are so intense someone without a bit of claustrophobia(myself included)will be gasping for air.As a frame of reference for anyone reading this I am a horror film lover but am constantly let down, and very rarely impressed. My idea of a well done horror films are The Exorcist,Alien,Don't Look Now,Black Christmas,The Changeling and Halloween(The only well done slasher film)I have other favorites but they are all up to this caliber.The Descent now falls right along side of these it is a classic and classy horror film I highly recommend."
"jaredmobarak","8","2","6","12 August 2006"," Love every dayThe Descent
","I am not a big fan of the horror genre. Many of them are just too campy or schlocky to be terrifying, too derivative of each other, or too slow and drawn out while trying to be suspenseful. Besides the first two masterpieces of the Hellraiser series and the original, read only good, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I could do without the genre completely. I don't mention Hostel here, because as I've said in my review for that film, it isn't as much a horror as a thriller told brutally. A horror film needs to have genuine jump out of your seat moments as well as creepy, dark visuals. Fortunately the buzz surrounding Neil Marshall's 2005 film The Descent is warranted, because going to see this movie allowed for the best time I've had seeing a horror flick in a dark theatre since the final fifteen minutes of The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>Marshall is definitely a storyteller. He allows time for the audience to get to know each character and facilitate a connection to them so we care about what will eventually happen, much in the vain of Ridley Scott's opus Alien, which many compare this to. Sarah, played with a real range of emotion by Shauna Macdonald, has suffered a great loss. Her mind wanders often to visions of her manifested grief, (these moments are very effective on the scare level as well as a psychological one). Sarah's friends decide to continue with their yearly extreme outdoor excursions, this time to a cave system, hoping to get her mind off of the darker areas of thought and into one of companionship and hope for the future. Yes, the cast of characters are pretty much the ones you'd expect: the hotshot, brash adventurer Holly; the vocal leader Juno; the English teacher, self deprecating and looking to the wellbeing of her friends Beth; the young med-student, who you know will eventually need to use her expertise for the cause, Sam; and Sam's big sister Rebecca, who goes through the entire movie cautious until she must show her strength. All the women do a phenomenal job in their parts making them fully fleshed and real. The beauty of the film is the reality it is steeped in, this isn't a fantasy with myth and magic; it is just a heightened world where what happens could actually have some possibility to it, as far as evolution and science play a role. Unfortunately, the realism, which caused the most suspense, knowing that maybe this could happen, eventually gives way to blood and gore. It is a shame because the abundance of blood almost took me out of the taut story; it wasn't necessary at all as it's not the gore causing the frights, but the conflicts shown. Subtlety works best and thankfully there is more of it than the small bursts of excess later on.<br/><br/>The beginning half of the movie sets up a wonderful sense of foreboding and intrigue for what is to occur. We are shown a story, an almost buddy orientated tale, with mishaps and light moments as well. While the visions Sarah sees are the main focuses for thrills, there are also many instances from nature. Thankfully we are allowed this period before the real horror is revealed, because it builds up the suspense to finally be released. The handling of the second half is for the most part just as effective as the first. Adding in the crawlers ups the stakes for sure, but Marshall doesn't fall into any traps of the genre where he makes everyone into a hero. Each character pulls from within herself and does what she would do in that situation. What Juno does during her first foray against the creatures is uncommonly genuine. Natalie Jackson Mendoza plays the emotional range like a pro, from fear to anger to hatred to remorse. Her actions are all reactionary and I applaud the writer/director for taking it as far as he did. Mendoza is the star that I will remember most, her character was at the crux of the story; she brought them out there and her reasons for this, as revealed during its course, were not so much selfish, but apologetic. Macdonald also shines as the distraught widow trying to prove to her friends that she won't be the adventurer that backs off first. She needs to prove to herself that she can be normal again after her tragedy. The visions allow for some mystery as to what she is seeing and hearing in the cave, and whether anything is real. There are many homages, especially with the Sarah role, including a nice Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, rising from beneath a liquid pool, and multiple mirroring of her face and hair to that of the final scream in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Also, the final frame is highly effective; that's a vision I'm sure she will be seeing for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>In order for The Descent to be successful, one needs to have successful acting, emotions amped, and as many light, humorous parts to offset the brutal shocks following. Marshall seems to be one to watch in the horror rebirth happening of late. Hopefully he won't shy away into the PG13 crap and instead stay the course to tell the story as it needs to be told. Unfortunately there did seem to be some compromise with the US release, as the ending is not the original one. Hopefully this was a decision on his part and not the producers strong- arming him. I will also definitely be seeking out his previous movie Dog Soldiers, to see whether this one was an aberration or a sign of things to come."

Ahhh, it makes sense now. Down-to-earth solid thinking people. The Descent was intelligent and intricate with each girl having a personality that wasn't one-dimensional. I liked many of the characters and got upset at a couple of them but liked them anyway.<br/><br/>With a well written story, great characters (girls connected through deep friendship), they were all strong girls, smart, ambitious with the world at their feet. it was a true horror to see them descend into their fate."

","I've just returned from seeing this movie and can honestly say that it held me in suspense from beginning to end. I now see that it was released in the UK last year and has an alternate ending that hopefully will be on the American DVD. Some minor criticism: SPOILERS (1) Why was it necessary to kill Sarah's husband and daughter in the beginning? The affair with Sarah's friend was what caused tension underground. (2) The creatures really weren't necessary. The tight spaces, darkness and being trapped in a cave without a way out were frightening enough, especially once the infighting and mistrust took root. (3) Those creatures could not have gone unnoticed even though they hunted at night in a very isolated area. They would have been part of the folklore of early settlers or Indians.<br/><br/>Still, I recommend this movie and will watch it again on DVD."

","I saw this movie a few months before it was released theatrically in NA, and haven't actually had a chance to see in the theaters yet, but rumors have it that the ending has slightly changed for the North American release, where it cuts off the last few minutes of the film....which in the 'real' ending her whole escaping from the cave was actually just in her head and she is doomed never to leave the caverns. But anyways, in the goofs section it says when Sarah escapes from the cave she doesn't have as much blood on her forehead and she should, because the whole scene was actually in her head it wouldn't matter how much blood would be on her due to the fact it didn't really happen. Just thought i'd point that out."

"jupiter2-6","9","2","6","8 August 2006"," A Nasty Little Tidbit
","Apart from some odd dialog in the beginning, this thriller/horror/monster flick is very tight, nasty and thoroughly frightening. From the uneasiness created by the tight spaces as a prelude to the action, the creepy photography and speed at which this film propels, the audience is rarely given time to breathe. Little is offered of the characters' background but enough development is in place to frame a harrowing circumstance neither these women nor the audience is ready to confront. From their point of entry into the dark hole, you always have a sense that you're in trouble and once the action takes off, you feel as hopeless as they do. It's sprinkled with references in tone, visuals and music to other films like ""Alien"", ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" ""Carrie"" and even John Carpenter's, ""The Thing"" but it never steals from them. And you rarely have a moment to even worry about how much it may resemble other films. Certainly, gore is a major element in this so be ready to cover your eyes but for those who appreciate a monster film with violent action and a predominant sense of originality, this flick will smack you upside your head and often. It never feels cheap. Except for 2 cheesy scares(which are very minor and you don't have a moment to care), this film stands tall on it's own, even offering a couple of ""morally questionable"" scenarios that don't get tidied up(a plus in my book). It's a breath of fresh air for the audience if not for the trapped cavers. I can't wait to see the DVD version with the original, downer ending. Because of the ""committee"" decision to not use it, I've kept from giving this film another star."

","I went to see The Descent last night and that was a decision I don't regret. I literally left the theater with a smile on my face showing my extreme satisfaction. <br/><br/>The Descent is about a group of British women cavers that gather in the Appalachian Mountains for a caving adventure. As they begin their quest it seems that nothing could go wrong. Everyone is happy as the cave seems very captivating. But of course, the team eventually encounters an accident that traps them inside the depths of the cave and leaves them desperately searching for an alternate path out. Then, they are suddenly under a stealth attack by a group of strangely developed creatures that have been living in this cave for God knows how long. Let the gore fest begin. The story line may seem somewhat familiar but its the brilliant film-making that sets it on a whole new level.<br/><br/>Excellent camera angles, perfect timing, and a very respectable script make this a horror movie that will truly scare you out of your seat. So long I have waited for a movie like this as the characters react like real humans would. How many times have you watched a ""scary"" movie but you end up just laughing at the stupidity of the characters? Not here. This movie makes you feel like you are being chased from start to finish and you will come to respect it greatly. I give it a 9/10. Well done!"

","The movie literally cribs from Aliens... but thats a good thing. The movie's story was typical horror film fare, BUT the atmosphere and tension exhibited in this movie is far above the typical horror show. The movie had me literally jumping out of my seat on SEVERAL occasions (including one in which I kicked the person in front of me in head :-D). Probably one of best parts about the movie is that there is a feeling of dread and tension through the entire time they are in the cave. Its claustrophobic environments make an excellent setting for a horror movie. Much like Aliens there is also the tension in the air that something is about to jump out and attack. Although the movie is slow to start (some would disagree with me) after the action begins there is not one dull moment. Basically your subjecting yourself to a 2 hour cardiac episode. If I had one complaint (other than the cheesy story) over the movie it was the overuse of gore... which was completely unnecessary... it felt like the director was putting gore in the movie just cause he could: it doesn't add to the scare factor at all... which is impressive for a horror flick. Most scary movies NEED gore to get a reaction from the audience... this movie, didn't even have to have it, and people actually walked out the theater at some parts because of it. I give it a thumbs up though, and its the scariest movie I've seen in a long time."

Lots of shock moments, too many really. And the different elements of the film remain somewhat choppy despite excellent chemistry with the cast. It's worth your money to see in the theater.

Even the critters were somewhat believable though they seemed jacked up on Crank.<br/><br/>I think the director and writer went to the Shock Well 1 too many times and that detracted from the movie. The other thing I found really bothersome was the use of camera shake to imply activity and the light cutting in an out in an unbelievable way.

"Craig_McPherson","10","2","6","17 July 2006"," Sets a new benchmark in horror
","After watching Director Neil Marshall's The Descent, I can only wonder what has taken the movie so long to garner an international release. Due in North American theatres this August (2006), the movie was initially released in the UK a year ago, roughly around the same time Hollywood was pushing an uncannily similar The Cave upon the cinema-going public.<br/><br/>Both movies revolve around a group of adventurers who get trapped in an underground chasm, only to find themselves stalked by creatures that long ago learned to live in a world without sunlight. Where The Descent comes out ahead, however, is in its refined use of characterization, suspense, and action.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, a group of largely British female weekend adventurers head Stateside for a spelunking expedition to explore an uncharted cave system. As we follow their harrowing exploits in the claustrophobic underground confines we are treated to a movie that is riveting and suspenseful as the women run the gauntlet of injury and survival from perilous cave-ins and assorted other rocky dangers. In fact, Marshall, who cut his teeth (pardon the pun) on the werewolf film Dog Soldiers, probably could have nixed the creature-feature plot device, which only turns up around the midway mark of the film, and still produced a nail biter based solely on the underground exploits alone. Bringing the slimys into the mix merely serves to ratchet the already existing suspense to an almost panic-inducing level.<br/><br/>Sporting impressive production values, this most unusual of ""chick flicks"" (only because there are no male characters in the entire film) sets an impressive benchmark for modern day horror, with a fully realized story, no discernible flaws, excellent pacing, and power packed action.<br/><br/>In spite of all this, the studio backers have still felt the need to tinker with the film for its North American release, modifying the ending. Viewers seeking Neil Marshall's original conclusion will likely have to wait for the DVD release, or try and catch the original UK version, which is guaranteed to produce even more post-viewing chatter.<br/><br/>Easily among the Top 10 horror films of the past decade."

The story of some girlfriends on a cave-trip that goes awfully wrong, is full of claustrophobia in its first half and already there it it scares you in a deep and tense way. When the creatures appear, it hits another level, closer to an ordinary horror-flick, but nevertheless still scary. Now you hit both: claustrophobia, darkness and a fierce danger that makes the whole situation hopeless. And I say ""you"" because you feel with that girls as the acting is excellent and very natural. There are no American teenage scream queens, just a few ordinary girlfriends out in a dangerous and tight cave system with an unpleasant surprise. Probably you will never want to visit a cave after watching that movie. And even without the creatures your would feel unpleasant by the thought of doing so.

The build-up is a fantastic, it lasts for a good 45-50 minutes but does not at once feel dragged out, it feels like every minute of this build-up is essential and you are constantly on edge during it. I cannot fault any of the all-female cast and the film greatly benefits from all of them being unknown. It makes the experience a lot more tense and chilling as you can relate them to real people more. If you like your horror you must see this. Terrifying stuff."

","THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS. A really great film, a god mix of blind horror, claustrophobia and gore. The film is quite slow at the beginning but introduces the characters (and gives an essential back-story for one). The build-up is authentic and tense, and once the action does begin, it begins fast, with 2 characters being killed almost instantly. This film also contains one of the best endings I have seen for a film of this type, continuing the horror, creating sympathy for the last character alive and partially disallowing any rubbishy ""The Descent 2"". On top of this, the infrequent but explicit gore scenes make the whole experience much more believable - BEWARE: SPOILERS AHEAD - a car crash scene involving the drivers head being skewered by a copper rod, an awful scene with a broken shinbone and one character having her neck sliced through with a climbing Axe. All in all, a good watch. Highly recommended"
"kevin-tufo","10","2","6","3 July 2006"," Incredible!
","FInally a movie that really got me to the edge of my seat! I saw the DVD version so maybe some scenes aren't there in the theatrical version which would suck because all the gory and bloody scenes were what made this movie so intense! This movie starts out like a normal drama movie or maybe even a rom-com, a bunch of friends just having fun and no sign of anything that is going to happen to them later on. In between the entering of the cave and the beginning of the film there is also a shocking scene but I won't spoil the fun. The movie's main characters are a bunch of women who know each other for probably quite some time and they're all into extreme sports and the like, so they decide to enter a cave with their gear and they think it'll just be another fun adventure but as the trailer has already shown you, this will definitely not be the case! What happens next is an extremely difficult situation because they can't get out of the cave and the further they go the creepier the cave gets. Weird sounds can be heard and it's almost impossible to see anything in those dark tunnels but thrust me, the first time you'll see the creature(s) you'll wondering just what the hell it was. This all creates a sort of Alien/Predator (great movies, too bad they made AvP...) atmosphere in which you know only one thing for sure: No one's getting out without a fight! The adventurers get wounded and weakened and driven by fear and panic and hallucinations and they all know they're going to die. The battle is no longer in the real world, it's in their minds! At a certain point the fight for survival begins and it contains some disgusting scenes with lots of blood and lots of insides becoming outsides. All in all it was a GREAT movie which was finally able to life up to the reviews I read, which was the reason why I got this movie. I had read someone say that this was better then Alien and they were right! This movie is absolutely amazing and everyone who likes thrillers and a bit of sci-fi and lots of horror should see this!!"
"halodarkly","9","2","6","26 June 2006"," The downward spiral
","This excellent film is probably not what you think it is...<br/><br/>First off, I'm not sure that tagging it as a traditional ""horror"" does the film justice. I hope that film-goers who are not horror fans will get the chance to see this. It's more of a tense, atmospheric setting for a character exploration piece. It's essentially a deconstruction of the ""chick flick"".<br/><br/>A group of female friends who haven't spent time together in years get together to go on a caving expedition. This will give them a chance to bond, and, for Sarah, a chance to get over the death of her husband and daughter in a car crash. Her friends are there to support her in her time of need. Initially things go well, but the cracks in the civil veneer are just below the surface. Once underground, some bad decisions by the impetuous Juno lead the women astray, and things go from bad to worse. And when the chips are down, the women get to see who among their number they can really count on.<br/><br/>Those who would not normally like horror are probably asking ""yes, but is there blood?"" To which the answer is ""oh yes. By the gallon."" But don't let that put you off. The focus stays squarely on our heroines, and their descent into chaos. It's just that something is down there waiting for them...<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound design are outstanding. During one particular scene, I could see the audience squirming! The performances range from OK to very good. The ending (actual, non-US ending) is unexpected, and for some in the audience I was part of, perhaps a little too unexpected. But I think it's more symbolic than anything of where Sarah ends up. Writer/director Neil Marshall certainly doesn't take the easy road, and the film is better for it."

","Six gorgeous women with an unhealthy love of extreme outdoor pursuits (whitewater rafting, rock climbing, absailing  you get the idea) meet up in the remote Appalachian mountain range to explore a labyrinth of uncharted caves. These are strong, confident women who can hang by their fingertips from great heights without fear of breaking a nail. But this is not a chick flick; it is an adrenalin overdose of tension and terror.<br/><br/>For anyone who is claustrophobic, afraid of the dark, or unnerved by the sound of constant dripping, the fundamentals of caving are horrific enough. Add mutant crawlers and psychotic friends and we were scurrying for the light switch. Unfortunately we were disoriented in the dark and unprepared with flares. For all the times that we strained in the dark to see what was going on, there were also times when we really could not bear to watch. And that was even before the Crawlers got hungry.<br/><br/>But this horror film is not only buckets of blood and slashing rock picks, it is a desperate descent into madness. And just when you think you can see the way out, any such sentimentality is immediately skewered. We are left wondering who really is the enemy  those creepy crawling humanoids, that traitorous tramp Juno who organized the trip, or the primitive paranoia that stalks us all? Scary! A group of girls stumbling round in dark, confined spaces with a bunch of mutants could have been a crashing cliché, but this is one of the best horror films we have seen, ever. For all their confident athleticism and boyish camaraderie these girls are completely credible. When the girls first view the dramatic drop that is the entrance into the caves Beth's first reaction is ""You're having a laugh..I'm an English teacher, not fing Tomb Raider."" These girls are not feeble, frivolous, or petty. And they certainly don't deserve what happens to them in the depths of those caves.<br/><br/>So get ready to hyperventilate and then stop breathing altogether."

This year they decide to go caving in North Carolina. The problem is, they chose a cave that hasn't been explored before. So of course, they aren't alone in this cave.<br/><br/>The movie is very freaky, so many creepy moments, I was hooked the whole way through. Everyone in the theater was jumping and screaming, there was even a girl a few rows back that was crying the whole time.<br/><br/>Filled with blood, filled with scares, this is THE movie for horror fans.

"rchalloner","8","2","6","13 June 2006"," A scary ride.
","I think this is a great example of how films in the Horror/Suspense genre can be intelligently and originally handled. One of the most important aspects is the dynamics of the relationship between the six women and how their relationships are affected by their experiences in the caves. I think this is handled really well and adds another dimension to the film. The crawlers, or whatever they are, are plausible creatures and the director answers the obvious questions the viewer might have about them. I agree with other comments that The Descent grips the viewer from the very start and never lets up. It is exciting, disturbing and frightening in turns, though I did feel that the violence and gore could have been toned down a little without harming the tension or the quality of the film. Maybe it's just me, but I also thought that the ending was a little rushed, with two much happening suddenly in the last 15-20 minutes. I wasn't too happy with the way it ended either. I think small changes would have made a more effective conclusion; but that didn't spoil the overall impact of the film. It's the kind of film that hits hard and stays in the memory and I reckon most people will come out of the movie theatre feeling quite exhausted. I have to say that for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia it is a doubly scary ride!"
"bareman","7","2","6","12 June 2006"," More Horror than Thriller
","I went into the film having heard it compared to Alien and thus had my expectations set on a little more suspense-thriller than horror. That was an incorrect expectation as the film tended to try to shock the viewer at least every 4 minutes with a ""Boo!""(scary) moment and didn't build them up like they did in Alien (or like you'd find in classic thrillers from Hitchcock). It's mostly a splatter fest in the last half of the film. People looking for a gory splatter fest will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>It's scary though and most of the viewers at the Waterfront Film Festival were frightened. I know my wife was scared."
"rom_sade","10","2","6","25 May 2006"," One of the scariest movies I have EVER seen!
","After a horrific family car crash, Sarah (Macdonald) is finally ready to start her life over again with her four best friends (Mendoza, Reid, Buring and Mulder), plus one new one (No one). Their traditional extreme holiday this time involves cave exploration, but a stupid decision and a couple of accidents leave them lost underground. They spot signs that they're not the first spelunkers to pass this way. And also that they may not be alone in the dark.<br/><br/>The closed-in space makes a superb horror movie set--we can barely stand to watch them squirm through the tiny gaps, traverse Lord of the Rings-size chasms, and cope with things that go bump in the dark. It helps that Marshall spends just the right amount of time setting up the situation before the women head into the cave. They're all well played, but only Macdonald, Mendoza and No one are able to add any real definition; the other three feel completely interchangeable.<br/><br/>To make up for this, Marshall lays on the chills early on, with the terrible car crash, dream sequences, jumps and false starts, sudden birds and bats lunging at the camera. And most of all, an obvious willingness to get seriously grisly. By the time the women see strange marks on the cave walls, we're already completely unnerved. Then it gets increasingly blood-soaked and primal. There are some problems, mostly in the difficulty we have in meaningfully connecting with any of the characters, and it's not easy to keep up with the chaotic, poorly lit action sequences.<br/><br/>But Marshall is clearly having fun here, and he effectively assembles all of the elements to gross us out and scare us half to death. References abound, most obviously The Blair Witch Project and Carrie. While the final turn of events (well, the final few turns of events) are seriously unhinged--and surprisingly emotional for this genre."

Evolved in the sense that they turned into something human-beast like. Will they get out? What are those creatures? In the beginning of the movie we'll see that Sarah lost her husband and little daughter in a road-accident. They are all in the car, and everything is well. Until the road is slightly going uphill. The driver is her husband and as she should pay attention to the road Sarah just asked him if he was OK. The second after he answered they bump into another car and steel pipes from the other car pierce themselves through the car and through her husband and her daughter.

Then 'they' make an appearance, first by clever use of sparse flashlight and a Gollum-inspired double-take; and then by...well, it's probably best I don't go there.

"ProphetTenebrae","7","2","6","17 July 2005"," Not bad at all
","It's seems that cave related horror films are like buses - none for ages, then two come along at once. While The Cave, has yet to grace our screens The Descent is already out there, fulfilling the movie going publics people-trapped-in-a-cave-and-attacked-by-monsters needs.<br/><br/>Like most horror films, there is little to no plot or character development. There isn't really any need. There is genuine tension and the cast seem to work pretty well. The camera work is a bit variable, very much from the 28 Days Later school of thought. So at times - generally the action - it can be quite hard to tell what is actually going on at points.<br/><br/>Despite that, it actually manages to create a rather convincing sense of claustrophobia and fear. It also doesn't use too many of the old cliché tricks for making you jump.<br/><br/>So overall it hangs together rather well, some will no doubt be confused somewhat by the ending - but I think that's because it's confusing. Overall all though, it's quite compelling viewing and rather pleasantly surprising."
"Gary-161","Null","2","6","16 July 2005"," Don't sit too near the front
","Like I did. Despite horror films being a touch old hat, the jumps in The Descent are by no means as predictable as expected. I was too old to see this movie but I bribed the management into giving me a ticket. It is about some girls who go potholing in the Apelican mountains. There are no pelicans, I just can't spell Appalachian. The director's last film failed because the budget did not extend to actually having special effects. A hairy dummy which I took to be a werewolf was jigged up and down by a window by a prop person while the camera was flung about in attempt to fool us into thinking the wolf was something other than an inanimate object. By that point I was nodding off causing even more jitters. This time the director was able to afford monsters but made them look like Orcs from Lord of the Rings. What is Lord of the Rings? Well it's about a mythical kingdom called Middle Earth that is populated amongst other things by little people called Hobbits and a wizard called Gandalf and there's this ringno, best not. Anyway, it is one of a curious number of decisions, such as beginning the opening scene with quick cuts like his last film. This meant I almost entirely missed a plot point about an affair which I only 'got' when belatedly reading a review. Confusingly he has also hired two actresses with identical boat races. It was also unwise to pull the rug on sympathy for his lead actress. A film this bleak really needs someone to unambiguously root for, rather than frown upon for moral reasons. I also noticed the odd out of focus shot and the climatic fight was botched to say the least. None of this is ruinous, however. I would say that the only glaring fault is the running time. Eighty five minutes tops, please, for movies that have the intellectual content of a grape. The enigmatic ending seemed contrived to create a buzz for the film on Internet message boards. Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>So to sum up, The Descent is slightly above average. It is depressing and pointless but then so are the last few Woody Allen films so it's Hobson's choice really. Anyone wishing to corner the director into explaining the ending should look for a bald gentleman with fangs standing in an airport departure lounge, clutching a one way ticket to LA. I'm not jealous."

","Very entertaining and very scary. I liked the slow 'Alien' type buildup early on, which, apart from introducing the characters, also serves to emphasise the dangerous remoteness of the situation the women are getting themselves into. The film has such a great, simple premise that I'm surprised it hasn't been used before. Or has it? I'm no expert. There was just one instance of poor effects - the bats! Fortunately this was early on, and there was no recurrence. And it had just the sort of ending you somehow feel a real horror story should have  a horrific ending. The only thing which I questioned was : these things are perfectly adapted to life in the dark, and they hunt, so they have good ears - wouldn't they have good noses as well! If sight has gone, all the other senses would be heightened, surely. Which means there would be no scenes with scary faces right up next to you which can't smell you. That apart, great film. The bottom line is: a very good horror film."

I wanted to kill her myself, which means the writers did their job by making me emotionally vested (good or bad) in their character. Not to mention, she was fine!!! I absolutely love brunettes.<br/><br/>The whole cave dwelling creatures plot caught my attention as I am a city-rat from birth. I have never been in a cave. After watching this film, I never wanted to go inside one (lol). What often gets overlooked are the actors who play the creatures. They did a phenomenal job and brought a lot to the suspenseful scenes.<br/><br/>Although this film isn't epic. It was a cool change of horror especially for 2005. I don't know how they filmed some of the scenes but they had me convinced they were deep inside a maze riddled cave.<br/><br/>As a horror flick, the blood and gore is on par with the bloodiest goriest flicks you can imagine.

","The Descent 2005 review "" Good storyline, tense at times with okay acting"". (8/10)<br/><br/>Quite a pathetic beginning, with a lot of unnecessary details. The main concept was set out clearly though which helped the sense of adventure. It was a long while before the horror seemed to truly build, yet tension was met early on cleverly at a lower level. 
The sort of film which only gets better as time goes on. <br/><br/>The lack of music and diverse range of gore, horror and despair worked well to keep the viewer entertained throughout the adventure. Relationships played a key part of the outcome and the film did well in bringing out personalities, and how they differed in traumatic moments. <br/><br/>The film gives you a sense of context aswell throughout, keeping you aware of the significance of what is going on. The title is good and reflects enough to describe the themes of the movie, without spoiling the plot. <br/><br/>I would have liked a little more music in tense moments and some modern effects in places as well. Cliff hangers were given which provided the opportunity for a sequel. I wouldn't rule out watching it based on this film. <br/><br/>While in the opening the acting was a little overplayed, the expressions did get better throughout. The film could have given more tension, and became scarier with better acting. <br/><br/>Overall the movie storyline was good, the acting wasn't great, but the tension was built well, with clever use of the camera and setting. I would recommend certainly for those into adventure horror as it is one of the better ones I've seen. For those looking for a truly epic film though, you may wish to look elsewhere."

","This is another one of those films that I have heard a lot about but never got around to actually watching it, most of the time these films are good and only a small amount turn out to be disappointing, ""The Descent"" its another movie that turned out to be good, as I was expecting it to be, but its nothing really all that memorable.<br/><br/>Its more interesting than good, but it manages to be entertaining in spite of its flaws. Its starts out pretty messy, with forced sentimental scenes with people that were never developed, but then it has time to breathe and be calm for a while, that's were I was kind of starting to be invested in the film. After a while the action starts and its pretty good, it stays interesting and tense but then it goes from being a bit silly to being just stupid (I am not just talking about the ending), however, I still think its quite well made for the most part.<br/><br/>The effects are pretty great and the gore is enjoyable, these are arguably the best elements in the whole movie, besides the setting.<br/><br/>I would recommend it, not incredibly original but it is different from the average horror flick, at least different enough to not become boring after a while."
"thelastblogontheleft","7","1","2","12 July 2017"," Claustrophobic
","Written and directed by Neil Marshall, who broke onto the scene with his horror comedy Dog Soldiers, it did amazingly well at the box office despite taking a hit due to its release coinciding with the 2005 London bombings. Turns out having posters that read ""Outright terror bold and brilliant"" on the walls of the subway doesn't go over so well when over 50 people died over the span of multiple terrorist attacks utilizing the public transport system during rush hour. Ooof.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of six women who gather at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina for a sort of reunion weekend. The main character, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) had suffered a huge loss with the tragic death of both her husband and daughter the year prior, so it's a very emotional trip for her. They all plan to head down into a nearby underground cave for a self-led expedition and all is going well until one of the passageways crashes down behind them and the leader of the group, Juno (Natalie Mendoza), admits that they are not in the fully explored cave system she had promised them, but a completely new system that had yet to explored or mapped. Things only get worse when they realize they aren't alone down there<br/><br/>**SPOILERS!**<br/><br/>Honestly, while I was psyched to see an all-female cast, I wasn't a HUGE fan of the acting. I just felt like I didn't form an attachment to really any of the characters, which was a shame. I also didn't really see the purpose in the car accident killing Sarah's husband and daughter. Her visual and auditory hallucinations of her daughter while in the caves definitely aided in her going further through her own psychological maze, but it was a scary enough movie without the semi-paranormal aspect, I thought.<br/><br/>THAT BEING SAID, pretty much anything could have happened in those caves and I would have been scared as hell. I'm super impressed that the caves they shot in were simply a set and not actual caves they looked incredible. They paid attention to use just available light as much as possible and it really lent a sort of otherworldly feel to many scenes as us viewers are seeing their expedition either via night vision camera, a wash of green from the glowsticks, or lit by these bright red flares, shadows abounding.<br/><br/>The feel of the movie is claustrophobic in the best, most terrifying way. Again, regardless of what else is happening, I was feeling panicky just watching them wriggle on their stomachs through passageways just barely big enough for their bodies. It's the whole idea that if anything does start pursuing you, or anything goes terribly wrong, you're stuck. The way back is caved in, the tunnels are narrow, you are UNDERGROUND, and no one knows where you are. Shudder.<br/><br/>The whole film takes the term ""nail biter"" to the extreme. Running (er, crawling) from rubble piling up around them, rigging a makeshift line to get across a massive chasm, pushing their physical limits there are many scenes where your heart is pounding just wondering how they're going to make it out alive.<br/><br/>The first real sighting of the creatures — the cast and crew referred to them as ""crawlers"" — was TERRIFYING. You've already got an idea that something is lurking in the shadows and that first real glimpse in the night vision on the camera made me straight up scream.<br/><br/>They also did a great job at moments that were less jump scares and more just instances that make you do that quick, surprised inhale. When the girl slips going across the chasm and almost plummets to her death, when Juno accidentally stabs Beth in her adrenaline-fueled state after killing a crawler, when the girl's watch alarm goes off as they're ""hiding"" from the crawler stalking them so many moments where you are just genuinely panicked for whoever is on screen.<br/><br/>There's pretty decent gore but I really don't think the movie relied on it too much. Holly breaking her leg and needing it cracked back into place, some intense crawler killings, but my favorite was Sam going across the chasm and a crawler slashing her throat from above and leaving her dangling brilliant.<br/><br/>Ultimately the movie kind of focuses on what people will do to survive, the desperation that seeps into every interaction, the almost inhuman way people have to act to preserve their own lives in the face of danger. Sarah having to kill Beth with a rock, or her rising up out of that pool of blood (??) like a damn crocodile, or the crawler killing spree they go on at the end, straight up gouging one's eyeballs out with her thumbs.<br/><br/>And the ending — THE ENDING. So many mixed feelings packed into what, less than 5 minutes? Sarah is sort of reborn as she emerges from a hole in ground, bursting out and gasping for air, you can FEEL her relief which is only escalated as we see the side shot of the car just BOMBING along the road, her wanting nothing but to get as far from that cave — that experience — as possible. But when she stops to take a breath, sob, and vomit out the window and sees a bloodied vision of Juno next to her, our only conclusion can be that she's nowhere close to being free from the cave, and this is merely a more complex delusion. Daaaaaaaaamn. That's just the American version, too — the UK version has her actually waking up back in the caves, experiencing another vision of her daughter, with shrieking and clicking all around her. GAH.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the most genuinely terrifying moves I've seen in a long while."

","This was one intense movie. I can't remember a girl power movie this intense. I call it a girl power movie because it starred six women that were outdoorsy risk takers.<br/><br/>They all decided to go cave exploring being led by Juno (Natalie Mendoza). They were supposed to be going to Borenham Caves but Juno chose to take them to a totally new unexplored cave. Of course they ran into some serious trouble and the worst of that trouble came in the form of some underground creatures.<br/><br/>The movie took a while to get to the action and the meat of the movie. The time leading up to that point was usefully spent character building and taking us inside of a wicked cave.<br/><br/>It was nice to see the women in a strong role. Their fight and will to survive wasn't absurd to the point they were pulling off supernatural feats. It was just as it should have been: they fought with everything they had as far as energy, fortitude and weapons and they didn't just roll over and die. And at the same time you understood that they could fight because they were already tough, they didn't just morph into badass chicks simply because they were in a life or death situation.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" was a great addition to the horror genre. This wasn't so much scary as it was an edge of your seat thriller. There were losses and triumphs and some internal conflict between the girls but I was totally dialed in to the action. Probably the best movie taking place below the surface."
"yasminafusiondancer","9","1","2","27 December 2015"," Absolutely harrowing, not for people averse to gore
","Dear god this movie was terrifying. It's one of those films where all the characters are killed off one by one in the most excruciating way possible. You came to know the characters just well enough that you felt their pain and wanted them to survive, which made it worse when they didn't. Creatures beautifully executed. Very scary. Ending a little heartrending. Not in a sappy way. Definitely an asset to the film. Also: rad strong women in this. Passes the Bechdel test with flying colors. So nice as a female horror fan. Overall a fantastically suspenseful, terrifying, atmospheric piece. REALLY SCARY. Absolutely amazing. The only reason I'm not going 10 out of 10 is because at the beginning, the soundtrack seems choppy and somehow quite out of place, almost like some other piece playing in the background which is totally disconnected from the movie. By the time there's blood everywhere and scary slimy cave people running around and just general hell breaking loose you stop noticing."
"pal05052003","8","1","2","10 October 2015"," A group of cave explorers are trapped in a cave full of strange predators and have to escape.
","I was not expecting much but this movie really surprised me. The best part was the setting. It seemed so real, and no CGI. It starts like many horror movies: the protagonist has a tragedy she wants to get over, and that tragedy influences the outcome of the story. However, in this movie, all the characters are strong independent women who can definitely take care of themselves in our civilized world. Yet even for them, the cave proves too much. I like the fact that the director did not use the loud noise to show a scary moment. The atmosphere and soundtrack makes the movie a tense thriller. In fact, this could be a very suspenseful movie without the monster, but the monster was foreshadowed early in the movie, so when the monsters really appear, it does not seem out of place. You can say this is a Predator movie set in cave. It also helps that all the characters are likable, even the supposedly bad girl. I definitely recommend this movie if anyone wants to enjoy a great horror. P.S. this still will not scare me out of cave exploring. On the contrary, now I am interested in cave exploring."

"culmo80","5","1","2","27 March 2012"," I Feel Cheated
","I was completely with this movie up until the ending, which really was terrible.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>Okay, the premise of being trapped underground has been done a few times in the last half decade, but this one was pretty good.<br/><br/>Essentially, there are a close group of women who are thrill-seekers. There is a not-so-fleshed out love triangle with one of the women and another woman's husband (who is quickly killed in a car wreck, as is the daughter of the same woman).<br/><br/>A year later, the women are in North Carolina to do some cave-exploring. More women are involved. A total of 6 women head off to explore the cave without any male supervision, so you know it won't end well (I'm joking). We soon learn that the leader of the group (and the one having the affair with the other's deceased husband) did not take them to the cave they all thought they were going to, meaning the Park Service won't know where to look for them. Plus, no one has ever explored the cave. Great setup, actually, even if they are stupid decisions.<br/><br/>After exploring a while, the group become trapped after a small cave-in. The further on in the caves they go, the more creepy it gets. Finally, we see the creatures, which are very scary. Eventually, the group are attacked and a couple are killed, while the others scatter and the rest of the film is them eventually getting picked off.<br/><br/>The ending was fine, until we see it was a trick ending. The real end apparently is Sarah waking up after dreaming she had escaped. She wakes up and sees her daughter with a birthday cake in front of her. The camera pans out to reveal that no, her daughter is not actually in the cave and we hear the screams of the crawlers. <br/><br/>I still don't get the dreams or how they played into the plot and why the ending was supposed to be satisfying. Apparently, originally, this ending was only released outside the U.S. <br/><br/>I would have given this movie a better rating if the U.S. ending had been the one I watched. I think the ending that leaves you hanging only works sometimes and we went through so much in this movie that we deserved a better ending.<br/><br/>The acting is good The creatures are well-done the setting is perfect Only the ending totally ruined it for me."
"tom_koopa","8","1","2","14 December 2009"," Best creepy movie I have seen in a long time!
","I wasn't really sure what to expect when I saw the cover of the movie. I figured it would be something bloody in caves. Probably a standard horror movie with buckets of gore and a lame story.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>It's NOT a standard horror movie. This film is very cleverly filmed. You'll jump on your chair at unexpected moments.<br/><br/>So what's the story? A group of six women go explore a new cave. Stuff goes wrong and to make matters worse, the group is hunted by strange, creepy predators in the dark. There's also a rather important background story of one of the women who lost her husband in a car accident. It plays a part in this movie.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was on the edge of my seat while watching this movie. Especially the second half. This movie really is creepy. There are a lot of good scenes and frightening moments.<br/><br/>The acting is good too. It's not Shakespeare, but I didn't find the actors annoying. They play well as a group too. There's good dialog and some humor.<br/><br/>Yes, there is gore. And it's quite nasty at times too. But if you are at home in horror movies, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>I also have to mention that the creature design is very creative. The cave dwellers are really scary, mostly because you don't see them half the time and usually don't know when they will show up. Call it an 'Alien' effect. Note that the music stops and plays at certain parts. It helps building up tension.<br/><br/>I really don't have any complaints about the movie other then that the runtime was slightly short for a movie like this. Standard horror movies are usually 90 minutes, but this film could have used some more depth (no pun intended) and runtime.<br/><br/>Still, The Descent is most definitely a worthy watch for fans of creepy horror movies. Be sure to check this one out! <br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars."

Then one of them lies about the cave, and it turns out no one as any idea what this cave is, or how to get out. I saw this movie on cable television, not at the theater... all I can say is that the entire movie was WAY too dark and I couldn't see anything. It was hard to follow along. Also, we received virtually no background information about the living monsters inside the caves. Why were they there? How long had they been there? None of these questions were answered, and I was left with many questions. No happy at all."

After seeing such films as Hostel, The Hills have Eyes etc, do there business in the gore hound category and such boring non-scary films as The Amityville Horror or The Grudge, it's really great to be scared for once by something original.<br/><br/>I see this film as my favourite horror movie because i cannot watch it in the dark without being scared shitless, i watch it with others and it still scares me, so much fun to finally be scared.<br/><br/>The idea with this film is that before the creatures appear, before anything really violent happens the film is still scary, showing a group of spelunking girls trapped in a cave, the atmosphere is horrifying and pure dread works on so many levels.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a scary film, with a perfect ending, a more realistic approach as opposed to all these shithouse remake films of today.<br/><br/>See The Descent if you love getting scared, This is like Aliens on speed."
"slayrrr666","8","1","2","6 March 2008"," A tad overrated, but still a great movie
","""The Descent"" is a slightly overrated if still enjoyable creature feature.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>After a terrible accident, friends Sarah, (Shauna Macdonald) Juno, (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) Beth, (Alex Reid) Rebecca, (Saskia Mulder) and Sam, (MyAnna Buring) decide to meet together to forget about the incident. When their friend Holly, (Nora-June No one) shows up, it's decided to turn it into a spelunking trip once they find a nice cave nearby. As they descend into the cave deeper, they suddenly learn that they've been tricked and are heading into a newly opened cave that has never been explored before. Stuck inside when a cave-in strands them inside, they try to find a new way out and are instead stuck in the dimly-lit tunnels with different fears about the situation putting them on the edge of their sanity. During their quest, they realize that they're stuck with a race of cannibalistic dwellers who figure them intruders and voraciously attack them, making them even more desperate to get out of the caves.<br/><br/>The Good News: This one here wasn't that bad at all and had some good points to it. The fact that this one has most of it's time inside a series of caves which are on their own incredibly creepy, well-designed and perfectly capable of making up the required set-pieces in the film. These scenes are absolutely flawless, being appropriately dark and untraveled enough to appear that it manages to get some incredible tension out of these scenes. All of the cave-diving and exploration scenes are just perfection, as the lighting is just perfect to get that darkened, underground look and the design of the caves themselves are just excellent. They look incredibly realistic and original, giving them some very impression locations that are molded well with the action presented to give it something to be grateful of. The attacks here are great, as the creatures aren't that imposing but get their threatening nature from how their attacks are coordinated, simply rushing in and slashing and then using lightning speed to retreat or prepare for the next wave if detoured away. Their initial attack is a thing of beauty, making it due to the darkness of the time, the spectacular location it chooses and the voracity of what they're doing. That leads into another big area, their really brutal and gory encounters. There's a lot of flesh-ripping and tearing, some amputations, bites to most areas of the body as well as a brutal spike pierced through the neck. There's also the damage done to the creatures, which makes it pretty brutal and graphic when it wants to be. The last thing it gets right is a superb sequence at the end where the characters are forced to proceed in total darkness using the video screen from a camera to find a way out of danger, and this is played up magnificently and is one of the most original and creative scenes in the film genre. It's a high point in the film, which is part of all these that it gets right.<br/><br/>The Bad News: This one here has surprisingly more flaws than expected. The main one here is the terribly slow-going opening to this one. It takes a really long time in the beginning to get going on the cave-diving due to a really long sequence where they're sitting around doing nothing for what seems like minutes on end with nothing to do for the entire duration. It's a seemingly endless parade of banter that really only seems funny to them is at times painful to sit through just hearing them go off on rants about whatever and hearing them all laugh at it when it's really not. It continues on for so much of the beginning of the film that it goes for what seems like forever and it makes for a period of time where there's nothing of interest in the scene. At times, the darkness in the cave is something to get over, since at times it works but others it's completely annoying and hurtful towards the film. That, coupled with the jump-cutting during the scenes makes them somewhat flawed. The other main flaw here is that the creatures look absolutely terrible. They look exactly like a small person covered in white skin and given fangs, which are absolutely the opposite of what fear-inducing creatures should be. It's quite hard to take them as serious threats when they don't look imposing at all, and are a really terrible design that won't get much attention. Otherwise, this one here is a really entertaining film.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: A little slow-going at the beginning is more than made-up for with a fun and exciting second-half, making this one really watchable. Give it a shot if interested in the subject matter, have a preference for these kinds of films or are in the mood for a classy creature-feature, otherwise heed caution with it.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language"

Upon watching it a few times I was able to pick up on the greatness of its story and camera work. Many parts before of the movie you actually see the ""crawlers"" if you look closely in the distance and darkness you can see them watching the girls and it adds to the creepiness factor. With this new US re-cut ""horrible mess"" they changed so much. You know that the crawlers exist now even if you haven't seen the movie before. They make it so obvious that they exist that it completely ruins the surprise. The new re-cut ending is complete crap. There was nothing wrong with the original WHY CHANGE IT????? To suit US standards? To please the rating board? You know why there hasn't been a good scary horror movie in North America for over 20 years? Its cause overseas is not as uptight as we are and know what it takes to make people scared. If we were not so picky and prissy about movies then maybe we could make something worth while too.

I cannot recommend this film enough, if you like well made horror watch this. The scares in this don't only come from the horror side.

After they enter the cave the suspense grows to its highlight and the jokes become bitter reality, which catches you till the end. All the characters are different and each of them has to face its own fears- themselves. The movie can be taken in a real way or in symbolist way- the genius stage, the play with colors, sounds and the relation between everything makes it possible... the claustrophobic atmosphere is unbelievably real so it makes your hands wet holding the seat-handles just to feel you're still in the theater and not in the cave too... the end closes the circle and makes the symbolism obvious..., but also lets you in this fear-mood,... but u gotta see it on yourself...<br/><br/>...for me it was the best horror-movie experience ever... ...and we see again: u don't need money or expensive computer-effects to make a good movie- u need imagination... its so simple and so brilliant!"

","This could well be the scariest most shocking film you will see in a long time-be warned. Like the excellent ""Deathwatch"" this film takes place mostly underground and Neil Marshall uses the dark and sombre surroundings to his advantage. I think that this film works so well because it attacks you on two fronts and plays on two of mans most primal fears-the fear of being trapped in an enclosed space with no chance of escape and the fear of being stalked by the unknown. I would compare this film to the finding of a strange box that you have no fear of opening but when you do you find something totally unexpected that could possibly kill you. Another similarity with ""Deathwatch"" is the ending which doesn't explain itself and leaves much to the viewers interpretation. Watch this film if you get the chance but I will give you a friendly bit of advice,don't watch it alone and keep concentrating till the credits because the ending doesn't come when you think it should. Marvellous ,nailbiting and gory,I give this excellent British Horror film10/10"
"octoshark","Null","1","2","14 January 2006"," Who's the hottest woman?
","Now don't tell me I'm being shallow. The film-makers obviously cast beautiful women (who can also act) as that can only aid the selling of a movie. So lets be honest and discuss who is the most attractive. Cutest-definitely the younger of the two sisters. Most beautiful-the older sister. Most attractive personality-the best friend of the main character. Personal choice-got to go with the Irish lass. I have just finished watching this film after having bought it on DVD and really enjoyed it (though my computer is not really up to the job of providing the necessary sound quality). It is always great to see a fantastic looking woman getting goddamn p*ssed off and taking an axe to something. Think i'll watch Switchblade Romance next."
"The_Only_Man_Who_Can","6","1","2","14 November 2005"," Pretty scary.... if your are afraid of modern dancers
","Billed as the 'best British horror film since 28 days later' I was looking forward to The Descent, not only because I'm a horror fan, but I had enjoyed Neil Marshall's previous (and altogether more fun) film: Dog Soldiers. However I can only admit to enjoying half the movie, for reasons that will become soon apparent.<br/><br/>Several female friends go on a thrill-seeking caving adventure somewhere in America (or Canada, going by the car's number plates); one of whom is trying to forget a terrible accident that killed her husband and daughter just after the group's last trip. Shortly into the expedition a tunnel behind them collapses, not only trapping them far underground but in a series of caves that have never been mapped (ruling out any chance of rescue).<br/><br/>Up to this point the film works almost perfectly. The characters (though falling into roles lifted from a dozen other movies) are all played with skill and charisma, giving greater credence to their choices and emotional deterioration later in the film.<br/><br/>The caves themselves are even better; from their tight spaces to open, Gothic chambers, the excellent cinematography unsettles without being too obvious. When the friends discover they have been led to their doom, you completely sympathise with their hopelessness and utter despair.<br/><br/>The main problem with 'The Descent' is that it could have worked perfectly exploiting this set up to the fullest, without resorting to the 'Cave Vampires' that stalk the friends in the second half of the film. The scariest scene comes when one of the characters traps her foot while crawling through a tight tunnel. This is before they are even lost, but her slow but steady descent into utter panic is both believable and terrifying, using nothing but her perfectly judged performance. Contrast this with the later scenes which sadly fall into the well trampled pastures of 'Spam in a Can' features, whose greatest desire is to be labelled as ""its 'Aliens'... in a CAVE!"" Now, I have no problem with those sort of flicks, it's just that the later half of the film fails to deliver anything as tense as the earlier scenes, preferring to stick a creature into the lens and shout 'boo!' And the creatures... this is where the film is most embarrassing. I'll admit I'm a stickler for monsters in movies, but the way I see it if THAT is meant to be the scary aspect it better be pretty damn scary, right? Unfortunately I found the creatures to be almost comical, moving like a modern dance troupe rather than flesh-hungry monsters. The creature make up also fails to impress or frighten.<br/><br/>Do not allow your expectations to be raised too high by the first half, and no doubt you will enjoy The Descent. I however can only wish Neil Marshall had the confidence or willingness to leave out the schlock tactics to make something scarier, better and more unique.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

There are lots of flaws in this movie but im not gonna spend writing that down. The only good i felt was the music and the scares. The movie is at times scary. But when you look at the whole product, it just isn't satisfying. Mainly because of the lead actress. She is a mess. Literally.

"ian_bell","4","2","7","23 August 2010"," Have we been here before . . . ?
","Neil Marshall comes up with an idea for a horror film, and once again it smacks of everything from Deliverance to Alien, with more than a little Hammer horror for good measure.<br/><br/>The Descent is not a bad film, it's just completely unoriginal as, it seems, are all Marshall's films. The film starts with a clip of an accident, which I think involves a child dying. A year later the narrative picks up with six women uniting for a bonding trip as they go potholing. The mother of the dead child is on board, as well as one of the women who is, I think, subconsciously blamed for the accident. Either way, one of these women has 'issues' which you just know are going to come to a head at some point in a 'big scene' involving a confrontation and a few home truths.<br/><br/>Talking of truths, whenever I watch a Marshall movie I always get the sense I am watching a soap opera. Something like EastEnders. In other words something that tends to repeat itself over and over again.<br/><br/>After watching Dog Soldiers it confirmed my suspicion that Marshall, not unlike Wes Craven, is a man who can take an interesting premise and absolutely slaughter it up on the screen; and no, that's not a compliment, even though a horror director might take it as one.<br/><br/>Put simply The Descent is merely a mishmash of other horror films. There is a little of Deliverance in here - city types lost amid the wilderness - and a little bit of Alien - a group of people picked off one by one by a largely unseen monstrous entity, but The Descent never gets anywhere near the emotional impact of either of those two films. After watching Alien for an hour I felt like I knew the crew of the Nostromo; sadly, after watching this particular film I couldn't even SEE who was down in the cave, much less care about whether they lived or not.<br/><br/>Going by the other reviews on IMDb it seems Neil Marshall has his fair share of fans. Good luck to him, but on this evidence I simply can't see what the fuss is about. Perhaps next time someone should switch the lights on."
"Scarecrow-88","9","2","7","26 December 2006"," The Dark
","I got existential with this film. It reminded me greatly of ""The Blair Witch Project"" where we see these characters unknowingly entering certain horror..we know what will happen, but they have no idea what certain doom they willingly will be entering. You can not fault anyone but one and that is the guide who takes them into an ""undiscovered"" tavern; that would be Juno(Natalie Jackson Mendoza). The others believe they are taking a trip into a known cavern, and the fun of entering is very lively on their faces. These thrill-seekers have did all sorts of wild things such as rafting down rough currents over dangerous rocks..but those experiences won't even compare to what waits for them in the dark. We see these young women leaving their off-road vehicles just like those three documentarians about to enter in the woods of Burkettsville, but they will enter a whole other territory where you can not see the sky above.<br/><br/>Sarah(Shauna Macdonald)is the main character of the film for we see what has occurred to her already. Sarah is indeed a tragic character we can latch onto for her husband and daughter were taken from her in an awful car crash. We see the dreams of watching Sarah's daughter blowing out the candles of a birthday cake..this would never happen, but it provides peace when there isn't much in reality. One might ask what the point of this is, but it matters more when one views director Marshall's bleak ending to this film. Sarah follows her supposed guide into what she believes to be a friendly cavern, but never realizes what she will become during that very trip inside a completely different cavern than she was led to believe.<br/><br/>This film shows a sign mid-way as the girls encounter a major problem. They follow a small passageway further into the cavern. When that hole caves in, the girls must find another exit. Once they discover Juno's secret of being closed in a supposedly uncharted cavern, that's when the terror of being trapped starts to swim deep in their minds. That feeling of hopelessness increases when they discover something sinister awaits them as they continue. They will find that this cavern has lots of paths that stop at deep drop-offs where they will have to rope-climb to get from one place in the tavern to another..it's the only way if they seek to find an exit. Once they begin to rope across from one place to get to the other side, there's a grave discovery..someone had once been in the cave when they find a rope-locking device attached in the rock! They are not the first to have been in this cave and the device they find is over 100 years old! Soon, the true horror begins as they travel inside this portion of the tavern and encounter creatures that seem human, but act anything but. They have the appearance of a possible species of bat. They can only detect movement with sound. They don't seem to have the ability to smell or see. That may be any of the women's only way of combating the evil that longs for their flesh. Yes, these creatures are meat eaters! And, when they eat, they enjoy it with a feverish intensity.<br/><br/>Marshall's film is as grim as grim can be. If one group of climbers couldn't make it out, why should the ones we watch escape? There's a glimmering hope when Juno, amongst any that survive the initial carnage that occurs as the creatures run amok on them out of nowhere, finds markings perhaps telling them a possible way out. But, they would have to make it past those creatures which may not have certain senses available, but do move fast and seem to know how to climb all around the tavern.<br/><br/>I started thinking about these women who are not victims by choice because they trusted Juno for whom seemed somewhat trustworthy before this situation. I tried to understand their terror. That hopelessness ran deep within me because these unfortunates have been placed in a dire state with little chance of survival."

","In short, wait till the DVD comes out if you plan on seeing this film at all. I hate to be that guy who comes out of a scary movie saying that they saw everything coming so I'll try not to be. I was definitely scared in this film but predictable is not even a good word to describe this movie. After using some blatant rip off's from movies like Blair witch Project, Pitch Black, and Silent Hill, they still didn't achieve anything unique. During this film I was more startled by the reactions of those around me rather than the film itself. I would see something develop and think that's interesting, just in time for everyone in the theatre to scream, then laugh at themselves. That comment should of course tell you something in that if everyone in the theatre freaked out, you might as well.

","It is very difficult to really scare modern horror fans. We have been brought up on the full gamut of styles ranging from special effects laden gorefests to minimalist (low budget?) films designed to make your imagination do the rest. Whilst this doesn't rise to the heights of finger gnawing tension we all crave, it does manage a few genuine jumps and some uncomfortable situations. Where it falls down is in the area of character development. We never get to know or like any of the characters sufficiently to really empathise with them. It is only this empathy with the characters that leads us to really share their fear. Nevertheless this is a pretty good effort, a bit different from anything we've seen before, and well worth a couple of hours in the cinema."

The second scene was towards the end of the movie when the camera was all over the place leaving you suspenseful. Overall this movie was very boring up to the last 45 minutes.

"pets-4","1","2","8","19 February 2006"," Extreme. Bad, bad movie. And I think it has many stolen concepts.
","This is one of the worst movies I've seen for many, many years. It contains so many stolen concepts, and there's no doubt about it. The idea to those cave creatures is from ""Riddick - Escape from Butcher bay""(game version). They have exactly the same look and the same sounds, and even the music sequence's is from the scenes where Riddick (starring original sounds from Van Diesel) is fighting those same creatures in the caves under Butcher bay. <br/><br/>And it's just so bad to see a bunch of girls fighting the same creatures that a 3D animated Riddick is fighting easy all alone.<br/><br/>And another thing is that they have stolen the concept about humans fighting abnormal creatures down in dark caves. All this is without doubt from the movie ""Aliens vs. Predators"". It's the fast shifting cameras and fast moving cameras in small caves. And the idea that this will lead to extreme excitement and intensity. But I think The Descent is failing totally here, giving me no such satisfaction at all.<br/><br/>The following doesn't affect the entertainment part, but is something I was thinking about after ending. After all, there where some positive elements. - Having only females in the lead roles is new and smart. - And I think the movie have a strong message to the American game and film industry. The message is clearly that USA should be more descent and try to stop thousands of bloody extremely stupid and low IQ games and films that have been released from the American marked the last decade, especially last 5 years! Well that's my meaning..."
"GiraffeDoor","3","2","9","22 February 2019"," A real Let down
","I'd heard that this movie was ""not like other horror movies"".<br/><br/>Well, It kind of is (like them).<br/><br/>It annoys me when these kinds of movies try to milk empathy from the viewers by showing us that people are doing the whole nuclear family thing, which is swell, but I'd rather find empathy for them by actually having some characterization. On this note, once the movie begins properly there's a tragedy and it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. People love to quote ""we all lost something that day"" but that's not the same as it having any real consequence.<br/><br/>And do they just let the tragedy speak for itself and hint at the hurting with visual clues? You should be so lucky. And what is the deal with those hospital lights going out one by one? The crux of horror may be mystery but there is a difference between being mysterious and just making no sense.<br/><br/>So we get ""one year later"" AND ""Appalachian Mountains, USA"". In case you confused them with the Appalachian mountains in Slovenia. And here come the girls... Now women are great. I love to see women do everything men can do. But please do not make a mainly female movie if you're going to make them all one dimensional and forgettable. No, Juno was not a formidable character. That was an informed attribute. I had no sense of character, no sense of relationship beyond that they tolerate each other. And we get five minutes of them drivelling on. I believe a man can write memorable and believable female characters. Women are just like people after all. But no.<br/><br/>Before they even get to the cave you get a bunch of crows. After they get to the cave there's a swarm of bats jumping out at us. This is the level of freshness we can expect. It even does my least favourite thing for a movie to do: have a dream jump scare. Something shocking happens and then she wakes up. I don't care if it's demonstrating her emotional state. It's a cheap scare and only exploits something redundant to the story anyway.<br/><br/>So now we're in the cave (and expect a couple more character-gets-scared-but-it's-just-a friend-surprising-them moments). They don't do anything to draw attention to symbolism of spelunking or make it seem like some grand thing. They're just doing it. Apparently the writer thought he was being different by building up to showing the antagonists but all he's really doing is shoving in filler. Like people who give the impression they have something to say by taking forever to say nothing.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is just all over the place. it doesn't building up, it just stalls. it makes a development and I feeling like it's almost no big deal. I didn't get any of the groundwork on these characters and their motivations and relationships to really believe they could all get into such an unfortunate and stupid situation. A good writer can pull off an infeasible situation but they would put in the work, which this movie does not.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a whirl of screaming and rock fragments with all the scenes blurring into one. The monsters...they had nothing to do with how they got lost. This movie has way too much going on. I hate the creature design. It's just uninspired. They really expect you believe they are perfectly adapted to their surroundings but they can't smell them? Are you serious?<br/><br/>The Descent is a movie that tries to be ""not like the American horror"" by taking shortcuts to compensate for its lazy writing and cheap scares. People appearing scared does not equal horror.<br/><br/>And God the ending ticked me off. I saw the British version. It just does not respect its audience. What was I supposed to take away from this? What was the point of the car crash?"
"david_rudy_lee","10","1","3","13 April 2019"," Terrifying Descent in Horror and Madness
","This was a film that I checked out after it came out on DVD. I thought the previews looked good, but I didn't realize how good until after that viewing. It's been some time since I've seen it and got the chance in my local theater. It was part of their Horror 101 series and I'm glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen. The synopsis is a caving expedition goes horribly wrong, as the explorers become trapped and ultimately pursed by a strange breed of predators.<br/><br/>We kick off with a few women white water rafting. There's Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid). Awaiting them is Sarah's husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) and her daughter, Jessica (Molly Kayll). He helps Juno out of the water and Beth watches them. Sarah and her family get into their vehicle to head back to the hotel. Sarah's world is turned upside down when they get into a car accident, with Paul and Jessica not making it.<br/><br/>A year later, she meets up with Juno and Beth as well as the rest of her friends. Joining them is Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) who is a pretty experienced climber. Also there is her sister, Sam (MyAnna Buring), who is in medical school and Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) who is Juno's protégée. The following morning they are going to check out a cave in the Appalachia Mountains.<br/><br/>Something doesn't feel right when they get there, but they go in anyways. On the way up, they see a dead elk, but no one really thinks anything of it. They go into the cave and they encounter their first problem, tight tunnel. Sarah is hearing children's laughter and ends up getting stuck. She starts to panic and Beth helps her through. A cave-in happens and they are now trapped. To make matters worse, Juno lied and no one knows where they are as this is an unexplored cave system. They have to find a way out as no one is going to come looking for them. They run into a much more dangerous threat though as well.<br/><br/>I wanted to lead off stating that this film is really two different ones combined together. One of the scariest aspects of the film is the setting. I'm not claustrophobic, but this film really got to me a couple parts. They are trapped under the Earth, it is pitch black and some of the tunnels are extremely tight. The unknown of will they or will they not make it out creates a feeling of dread. There is good writing here when Rebecca is explaining the descent into madness in the cave could cause and actually states a bunch of symptoms that will come back up later.<br/><br/>Now the second half of the film becomes a creature feature. What I like about this though, is the truth of what they are. There are some subtle things that this film has in it. For one, there's the cave painting. While I was watching it this time, I was wondering how long it would take a species to become what we have in this film. Originally I was thinking that this would have come from Native American times, so it would be a couple hundred years. The more I think about it though, this could legit be caveman times, which would really explain it so much more.<br/><br/>There is another aspect to this film that happens at the climax. Juno is harboring more secrets than she is letting on and there is an amazing change in Sarah. I absolutely loved it and seeing her rise from the pool that has this nasty layer of floating things on it is great. The character arch there is wonderful. It actually gives the film a dual meaning to the title. Not only are they descending into the cave, but they are also descending into madness dealing with what they do.<br/><br/>To the pacing of the film, which I think is great. The film never hits a lull and it really just builds tension throughout. As I stated above, we get two different films that mesh together seamlessly. I think that getting the characters trapped is scary to start off with. I could have had a film with just that and still enjoyed it. It really raises the stakes. The only complaint I have after this viewing was the ending that we got. I do believe this was the original American theatrical ending where the DVD I have has the original ending, which is much better.<br/><br/>Shifting gears to acting here next. Macdonald is an interesting character to me. She had her whole world turned upside down due to tragedy. I feel horrible for her. She is trying to piece herself back together and then this happens. Her character is broken at first, but as I said, I love the change that happens to her to become the badass she becomes. Mendoza really becomes a villain in this film. She seems like a good friend, but there are subtle things we see. Once they are revealed, she becomes worse and worse. Her performance was solid. I thought the rest of the cast is also solid and each is unique. This really shows as they are attacked as well. I couldn't finish this out without giving props to the actors that played creatures. They did an excellent job.<br/><br/>The effects of the film I liked for the most part. Whenever they went practical, I thought they did a good job. The blood looked good. There is a bit of gore in the film and one scene in particular really made me cringe. The look of the creatures was absolutely amazing. There was an issue I had with some of the CGI. It really doesn't hold up and I feel there were a few scenes in front of a green screen that wasn't great. The film is shot amazing though on top of that.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover before wrapping this up would be the soundtrack. I will admit for the most part it didn't stand out to me. What did though was the use of sounds in the cave. We see that with Sarah and the children's laugh. We know it isn't real, but it is creepy. The yelling and the echoes are used strategically as well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I liked this film the first time I saw it and it just got better to me after this film. It is very well written and the two concepts that are meshed together are seamless. The acting really reveals this and was great to bring these characters to life. I feel the pacing was good and builds tension throughout the film. The setting really helps there as well with the building of dread and claustrophobia. Practical effects were good, but I did have some slight issues with the CGI. The sound design was solid as well. If you haven't seen this film, I would recommend it. I found this to be great film for sure."

","The Descent hits every nail on the head in regards to how a horror movie should be made. And i mean everything. <br/><br/>I was so pleased to see that we have a modern horror film where the women are not hyper-sexual, clueless annoying airheads that you actually WANT to die. We actually got a back story on these womens' relationship at the beginning of the film. It allowed me as a viewer to actually connect with these women and care about them. Sarah and Juno are by far the stars of the film. and they are bad ass! It's so refreshing to see women in horror films making smart decisions and fighting back, that brings me joy<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere of the film was also very amazing. Tons of clausterphobic atmosphere's and overall creepy, eerie, uncomfortable settings that are instilled in the audience through great direction. There were many moments of the film i was clinching the arm rest or biting my nails while my eyes were glued to the screen. it was just overall a great, uncomfortable ride.<br/><br/>What's so great is we don't even see the creatures until maybe halfway through the film and the film does not suffer because of this. It beautifully shifts from an dangerous cave hunt where the characters battling with mother earth, to an apocalyptic, survival monster film. Its scary, its action packed, its emotional, its a film you don't want to miss!"

If you love the sense of dread and claustrophobia in movies like Alien, you're gonna love this. Although is highly likely that it will make you squirm in your seat. The whole cast does a superb job. You're gonna really care about these characters and what it's going to happen to them. That just elevates the tension through the roof even more. The music is haunting, emotional and raw, going along perfectly with every sequence of the film. The only downside for me was the presence of a few cheap jumpscares. Personally I hate those because I think a horror movie does not have to rely on them to make you feel frightened.That's why I have to lower the score a little bit.

A year later the same girls, previously introduced, get together with a few more to do some cave diving. Juno, my girl, decided to take everyone on a cave dive never claimed before. <br/><br/>First of all this movie made me claustrophobic as can be and I almost switched over to a cartoon because of it.

Really!? You're going to take her out like a savage?? What if Beth was in shock and making up tales because, you know, she is bleeding out the neck!?

","""The Descent is possibly contender for the best horror film of the decade. This movie is very disturbing, on so many levels. When you are trapped in a cave, that is scary enough. The idea of being lost underground and know one above knows where you are, is such a scary concept. The parts where they are crawling through the tight passageways made my stomach turn. This movie also has terrific writing and the conversations among the girls are enjoyable to watch and sometimes quite funny. Once this movie ended, I felt like it was a tragedy. All of the characters that I wanted to see get out never escape; and die somewhat gruesome deaths. This movie has well-done and well-built characters & character relationships, I actually wanted to see them escape (Most movies rarely make me think that), which is the reason why the ending was a stinger. The ending also made a lot of sense, at least for me. Think about the life of any of the girls if they made it out, they would be traumatized and all of their friends would be dead... <br/><br/>Go watch this movie! It is simply Amazing!"

","When I first saw this movie when it first came out on DVD, I thought it was a really solid horror movie. Watching it now, I personally think that it still holds up today. The plot has enough to draw you into the lead characters and how they go about trying to escape from a cave they descended into. The descent into the cave really does bring about madness between the characters. And it shows the true colors of the characters as things start to escalate. I thought the set design were for the most part quite believable with it's claustrophobic setting. The scenes where the characters had to queeze through tight crevices brought about tension. And the design of the creatures that tries to attack and eat the people that descended into the cave to be believable. So when the creatures pop out and attack, I was on the edge of my seat. What really stands out about this film is the transition of the characters. How they all start to become survivalist and the sight that grossed them out in the beginning doesn't faze them as much. And some of them transition into total badasses in a realistic manner. This is a well crafted and designed horror movie with great pacing and build up.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"davispittman","8","1","3","30 November 2016"," Well made horror film
","The Descent (2005) is definitely a well made horror movie. The film is about a group of women who decided to explore a cavern, One of whom has just a year ago lost her young daughter. The group of friends go down into the cavern and start to explore, but soon become lost and come to the realization that they might not be able to find a way out. And if that isn't bad enough they start to hear these strange noises and the star of the film sees these weird creatures and they discover that they are not alone down there, these creatures that lurk in the dark are flesh eating monsters that hunt on the surface and then bring their food down to the bottom of the cavern to eat. I will definitely say that this movie is very well acted and I think that the script and dialogue is well written. I really liked how they made the creatures look, and I loved the whole cavern setting, the setting really did a lot to increase the creepy feeling the whole film had to it, especially towards the end. I think it's safe to say that if you do not like tight spaces or dark settings or creepy creatures then this is not the movie for you. The ending is different based on whether you see the UK or US version. I had mixed feelings about the ending (I originally saw the U.K. Version by the way). And I do prefer the UK version to the US version because I think the US version's ending is disappointing. I would definitely suggest seeing either the unrated version or the UK version just because I think the ending is more interesting compared to the U.S. theatrical release. I give The Descent an 8/10."

","This film is riveting. It scares on such a fundamental level that it's quite hard to shake off after seeing it--and not so much for the cave dwellers, who seem remarkably easy to kill (if revolting), but for the actual caving. I loathe caving. I was forced to do it a few times in a previous job, and each time I swore I'd never submit to it again. This film brilliantly captures the horror of discovering you are lost in a vast cave system, no one knows where you are, and the only way out you know has just caved in. Sure, the creatures add some very nice additional fear, but by the time they encounter them I was emotionally strung out to the point where nothing about this cave system would surprise me. Without giving any spoilers at all, the ending makes this film for me. True horror. I'm shuddering just thinking about it. I'm a sun and fresh- air freak and this movie really went to a place of nightmares for me."

","As I write this review, there are currently 1103 user reviews of this movie on this site. 1103? That fact alone ought to tell you something, right? I mean 1103 people felt strongly enough about this film to go onto a website and write a review of it.<br/><br/>The reason is quite simple, this movie is a modern masterpiece of horror. It is chilling and truly frightening and far more intelligent than most horror films of this era. While there are a few cheesy jump scares at the beginning of the movie, they mostly serve as place setters. The movie is taking its' time, building up characters, introducing us to a diverse group of women who each have their own personalities and are far from cookie cutter roles. During this buildup we get a few moments of Hollywood jump scare. Once we enter the caves, though, the movie provides some terrifying tension. That first moment that one of the crawlers appears behind our heroines will make even the hardest horror fan jump a moment. Marshall keeps the tension ramped up to 11 throughout the movie expertly, slowly ratcheting up that action to a fever pitch.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the women in this movie are not teenagers (thank god). They are not cardboard cutouts waiting for their moment of death. You get to know each woman and exactly the kind of person that she is, which is important for the dynamics of how the movie plays out. There is real internal tension here among the characters that works well and would have made for a good movie without any monsters, but the monsters are here. Oh yes.<br/><br/>These crawlers are excellently designed. In a genre full of retreads and repeats, it is hard to present something I've never seen before but Marshall managed to do that. They look scary as hell. They make the sort of noises you'll hear in your nightmares. They move with a quickness that is relentless, yet they are not unstoppable monstrosities either. They don't see so well. Every monster needs a weakness, or they become a cartoon cliché or just boring. It also provides our characters and, thus, us as the viewer with hope.<br/><br/>Many have an issue with the ending. Many people don't like to think for themselves either. It's bleak. It's ambiguous. Not everything needs to provide you with spoon-fed answers."

","This is a film I've been wanting to see for quite some time but I never got around to it until oh about an hour and forty minutes ago. And I must say all these years of ""waiting"" were worth it. The plot is pretty simple; after a tragedy a group of friends go exploring a cave and end up trapped only to find that they aren't quite alone. For some people the film may start off slow but I think this works to the film's advantage. You get to see the dynamic of all the women; who they're characters are and how they interact with one another so you care when they start dying. Once they're in the cave I could feel every muscle in my body tense up. I'm 23 years old and I am still afraid of the dark. .... Done laughing now? Good. I'm also slightly claustrophobic and this film has plenty of scenes that triggered that fear for me. Overall this is a great horror/thriller that is definitely worth the watch. Great atmosphere. Great set designs (Can you believe it wasn't even a real cave?). Good acting. Great visuals. Awesome gore. It's almost October. You really have no excuse not to see this film."

Each is well defined and dodges the typical clichés of a female character. it's quite refreshing.

"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","19 June 2016"," Creepy, gory underground horror
","THE DESCENT is a decent British horror film, very much along the lines of WILDERNESS and DOG SOLDIERS, the latter also directed by Neil Marshall. Although it falls into the trap of using all the tired clichés of modern horror films – if I never see another fake scare scene it'll be too soon – and has one too many obvious jumps along the way, for the most part it's a strong, gory film packed with suspense, and tension which sometimes becomes unbearable as the climax nears. The plot is simplistic, the script nothing special; things kick off with a nasty road accident which reminded me of the beginning of BUTCHER, BAKER, NIGHTMARE MAKER but then we're in slasher territory as a group of women head into the unknown and get picked off one by one by the nasties.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the atmospheric location: Marshall really gets his money's worth by photographing the eerie, dust-filled caves and natural wonders that are to be found beneath the ground. This is not a film that claustrophobic people should watch, or indeed those with weak stomachs: the blood flows pretty freely towards the end, although it's not really disturbing as it's included in the action scenes.<br/><br/>The idea of using an all-female cast is a nice one, that makes things feel different, and there are one or two excellent performances here which lift things a lot (Natalie Mendoza's ass-kicking heroine makes Ripley look like a prim and proper schoolgirl). The monsters, a combination of Gollum-style CGI and more traditional men in monster suits, are creepy and eerie, especially when glimpsed briefly in torchlight. The only thing I really disliked – and which stopped this film from being truly great – is the silly twist ending, one of those dream things I wish had never been thought up. It's dumb and makes you think ""what the heck?"", cheating the viewer, but aside from this THE DESCENT offers good solid chills."

If you are looking for a good horror film, this is not it. Unless you have an hour and a half to spare thinking when is this going to end?

"Robert_duder","8","1","3","30 October 2015"," A cult horror/thriller that lives up to its hype
","It is excruciatingly hard to be original when making films but its even harder to be original when you're trying to settle into a tried and true genre. As a fan, the horror genre is especially crowded and hard to fit into. You have good, bad, really bad and really really bad. People of every walk are making horror films for $10 and their phone or sinking millions into bid budget ghost flicks. Every once in awhile you find a horror flick that really stands out because of smart, cutting edge film making/writing and The Descent is exactly that. It isn't easy to truly get under a horror fan's skin and genuinely creep you out. The Descent's pacing is brilliant because you've got a group of girls, going exploring, almost feels like a survival ""127 Days"" type film and then horror, horror, horror! Not zombie, not monster, not slasher...and yet somehow all of that and more. Screaming and terror and isolation and dark, damp setting that just leaves you wide eyed and breathless. The Descent is one of those movies that I kept hearing about and seem to grow in reputation and when I sat down to watch it, I was expecting it not to live up to the hype but it does. It isn't quite what you'd consider a ""big budget"" Hollywood flick and yet it definitely has no indication of being low budget.<br/><br/>The best thing about this cast of girls is that they're all as good as each other. There really isn't one ""stand-out"" performance to me and for this film in particular it works because you feel like you're part of their group. We still have a ""main"" heroine, a scream queen so to speak played by Shauna Macdonald. She gets more story as we are shown what has traumatized her to end up on this trip. She is very good and very down to earth and all of these girls you just feel like they could be anyone and I mean that in the best of ways. Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, Myanna Buring and Nora Jean No one are the other cave hunters and they have great chemistry with each other and they all have their purpose even if its to be fodder, they have distinctive personalities and you really believe their performances even if its just believing they are regular girls in a terrible situation.<br/><br/>I've actually seen quite a bit of Neil Marshall's work and it doesn't surprise me that he's now helming a big budget Hollywood blockbuster (Skull Island.) He has a great story telling ability and makes you feel things no matter how implausible. He sets this film up like a nature survival story and then suddenly they're being picked up by mysterious cave monsters in bloody horrible ways. Its shocking, twisted, disturbing and really well made on what was probably a low budget. If you're looking for something that will genuinely creep you out this Halloween, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed. 8/10"

"brchthethird","7","1","3","5 November 2014"," A tense, thrilling, and claustrophobic survival horror film
","THE DESCENT is a movie I let sit in my video library for a while before actually watching it. Not because I was scared to, but mostly because I wasn't sure if it would be as good as I'd heard. Thankfully, my fears were assuaged when this turned out to be an effectively creepy and claustrophobic horror film. I'm not particularly scared of confined spaces but I can sympathize with those who are, and this film does a great job of creating an maintaining such an atmosphere for most of its running time. The basic plot is about these six women who go on a spelunking trip in the Appalachians. As a group, they've gone on similar adventures before, but nothing quite like this. As they get farther into the cave and deeper underground they are pushed to their limits and their sanity is tested, as well as their bond of friendship. They also discover that they may not be alone. Or are they?<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the acting was sound and the characters were believable as a group of friends. There wasn't too much in the way of character development, but they were established well enough in the beginning that once things started to go south you cared about what happened to them. Of the six friends, only one is really given a back story, namely that her husband was killed in a freak accident after water rafting trip with a couple of her friends (who are in the main group). Her mental state is actually very important to the story, but in a way that I'll save for whoever wants to watch the film.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the film that I thought very well-done were the cinematography, lighting and use of space. A lot of the film takes place in a cave underground, and it made good use of natural and artificial light to create a dark and mysterious atmosphere that kept you involved in what you were watching. You often get the sense that something could come out of the shadows at any moment and, in fact, there were a number of jump scares that utilized this very effectively. Although somewhat predictable in this regard, I didn't think they were overused and were germane to the story being told. Also, considering that this is a Neil Marshall film, the gore effects were well done and suitably gross.<br/><br/>However, I do have a couple issues with the film as well. First, the score, while appropriate and engaging, was a little too insistent in parts. I don't really like when a film's music telegraphs how you're supposed to feel in a particular moment, and the music here gets used like that occasionally. With such a dark and claustrophobic film, I thought it would have been more effective to dial back the score a bit and let the scenes breathe a little on their own, creating a more natural sense of terror rather than inflating it with somewhat overblown instrumentation. I also thought that the story and character development could have been a bit more substantive. Instead of being rich and layered, it was minimal but effective.<br/><br/>Overall, despite my misgivings about the score and thin plotting, I rather enjoyed this film. It's most effective at establishing an maintaining a tense mood and claustrophobic atmosphere that really works. At no point was I ever bored, although I would scratch my head at some of the stupid things that the main characters would do. But what horror film doesn't have characters who make ill-informed decisions at one point or another? What I got out of it what is a tense and thrilling survival horror with strong (but loosely defined) female characters and their descent into madness (the title works as a double-entendre). Highly recommended for genre fans."

","Heres a super intense thrill-ride of a movie that effectively utilizes the pretense of not showing the creatures for the first 50 minutes of the film.

A year After a tragic automobile accident resulting in the death of a woman's husband and daughter, she and her five thrill-seeking friends decide to go on an expedition involving an underground cavern witch is allegedly unexplored. After realizing that they are lost and running out of time, they encounter a breed of evolved creatures that feed on living flesh. Director, Neil Marshall, who's known for brutally violent films such as ""Doomsday"" and ""Dog Soldiers"" pulls no punches in displaying his technique of gory flash-sequences of bloody peril, but the most prominent attribute of this film is how the suspense is gradually built up into an intense climatic struggle for survival in a situation that is just about anyone's worst nightmare. The female cast does it justice, and the sets ,visual effects and cinematography are unrelenting not to mention the terrifying creatures and their way of prowling about and pouncing at the worst moments. This is obviously inspired by such classics like ""Alien"" for its ability to prey on our fear of whats lurking in the shadows. The ""tease"" ending leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but overall this is film-making worth it's weight in gold. Highly recommended."

It's not overly long and it doesn't take much of my brainpower to understand it. Basically, a group of women go underground caving and get hunted by some of Golem's relatives.<br/><br/>I like the way it's shot and scored. For some reason it reminds me of John Carpenter's early work, but for a film that lasts ninety minutes, the beasties don't make an appearance (properly) until over half way. You have a lot of creeping around dark caves before you get to the gore.<br/><br/>As I say, many horror fans LOVE this movie. So, there must be something there I'm not seeing. Personally, I'll stick with an average 7/10 and probably watch it again in a few years time (maybe I'll 'get it' then? After all, I am the only man alive who doesn't like either Bladerunner or The Godfather!)<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"Botsu","6","1","3","13 April 2014"," Not bad, just not creepy
","The Descent is one of THOSE movies. Those horror flicks that have a lot going for them in terms of production value as well as acting and build- up, but screw things up right when you think they could've impossibly done so. Point in case: a bunch of women, one of which suffered a horrible trauma a few years ago, retreat themselves in the mountains as they go ahead and do some spelunking. Note: you won't care about any of the women as only 2 of the 6? 7? members of their little club have an actual personality worth mentioning, be them very generic ones. Interesting twist: they're in a cave no one knows anything about, so on one side, it's theirs to explore, on the other, this could be incredibly risky, dangerous, even. Like any good scary movie, this one has a lot of tension and suspense going on for it before the actual scares make their entrée. The downside: once the ""good"" part of the movie is over, it quickly translates into a bland jumpscare fest, free of any imagination and/or breathtaking moment, excluding some scenes. Granted, it has its moment past the figurative point of no return, but they're scarce and really far in between. In general, I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but I have to grant it an extra point for its good ending, lifting up the experience as a whole and handing it over an extra point. Could've been better if the director knew what he was doing in some places where it was really necessary."

","This is a modern day classic horror far superior to other perceived modern classics like Alien. This is a unique, tense, gory and actually scary movie that doesn't disappoint on any level. <br/><br/>The acting is a cut above the normal horror movie. The characters are believable and it makes a nice change to see an all female cast. The claustrophobic set pieces are dealt with superbly and you almost feel you are down there with the girls. The monsters when they come are terrifying and remarkably believable. Once the action hots up it is almost unrelenting. <br/><br/>There is plenty of gore to keep horror fans happy as well as a sharp well written script. <br/><br/>The bleak UK ending has split opinion but for me it is a brave and fitting end to a superb film.

And it sets up a creepy atmosphere with great writing and cinematography. Also a horror movie that does not rely souly on jump scares.<br/><br/>This movie is about a group of young women who go on a cave expedition. What they don't know however is these caves have never been explored and soon after becoming trapped by a rockslide they soon start to be hunted by a strange predatory creature.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years and of all time.

","I watched this with my girlfriend Kelly not knowing what to expect. We knew it was a horror, but it was also a British film. There are some great British films but would this be one of them? The film is about a group of women who get together to explore a set of remote caves. During the expedition they encounter strange creatures and end up having to fight for their lives. Staring Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring & Nora-Jane No one. All are great in the roles of the six friends, however Natalie Mendoza stands out for me as Juno. There are undertones of something more with her character and her performance is eerie and mysterious. This film is one of the best modern horror films I have seen. While many modern horror films fall under the category of torture porn like Saw and Hostile, this film doesn't rely on gore and gross out moments to shock you. It manages it in traditional ways using subtle camera effects, building tension and good acting. The director is a genius in his ability to scare you. He builds the tension to a point where you feel you will burst. There are no cheesy moments just good old fashioned scares. And what scares they are. There are moments that truly scare and surprise you. This is one of the best horror movies and a very well made film. The intro is just long enough to give you a good background to the friends and then all hell breaks loose! If you like classic horror movies check this one out. Keep the lights on and if you are watching with your girlfriend, watch out for your hands. Kelly was so scared I thought she would break mine when she squeezed it really hard when she jumped!<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"nathanjeremy","4","1","3","11 May 2012"," Somewhat Disappointing
","""The Descent"" had the potential to be a good movie, one which can drop the stereotypes of women in many horror movies and turn them into real protagonists. Unfortunately, this didn't happen.<br/><br/>The characters were developed pretty well. So have you ever watched a movie and you're thinking this is a pretty good movie, and then the ending can make it or break it? In this case, the ending broke it. I'm not talking about the ending ending, but I'm referring to near the end of the movie where Sarah decides to become the judge, jury, and executioner of Juno. True, she didn't actually kill Juno, but she basically was giving her a death sentence. She didn't know all the facts, she had only one side of the story, and yet that was good enough for her to decide the fate for Juno. OK, so perhaps she wasn't killing Juno because of Beth... Perhaps she was killing Juno because she was having an affair with her husband. That gives the right to kill someone? Anyway, I personally think it would have been a better movie if the movie would have shown how they used their courage and ingenuity to get out of the cave... But in the end, this turns into a typical slasher movie where they get killed one by one."
"StevePulaski","9","1","3","3 April 2012"," All they wanted was a vacation
","After watching Neil Marshall's The Descent I seem to have less motivation to go spelunking and get involved in cave exploration. If that's even possible. I hate claustrophobic locations, but love them in films. I've mentioned before the reason I admire them is because due to limitations geographically, the film must work intricately in the fields of progression, character development, and suspense. Suddenly, the neglected things in horror films become the dominant things, and that's the beauty of a film with a limited setting.<br/><br/>The Descent left me with an almost incorruptible feeling of sorrow and dread for its characters, so much so, I can safely say the last horror film I was this depressed by was Frank Darabont's The Mist. This is a gloomy, pitiless film focusing on a group of women, lead by thrill-seeker Juno (Mendoza), who go out to explore an unnamed cave that no one has entered before. Juno neglects to mention that part.<br/><br/>The reasoning behind the trip is one of the girls, Sarah (Macdonald), lost her husband and young daughter in a collision a year ago, and they want to have a grand adventure, throw caution to the wind, and just take their mind off the depressing events that occurred the previous year. This is where the sentimental part of the film really kicks in. All they wanted was a good time. It reminded me of Open Water (one could dub that a claustrophobic film if they wanted to), a film about a couple who boarded a ship to go diving, hoping to have a fun, enjoyable, and peaceful time. Instead, they were forgotten in the water, and are left without resources in a shark infested sea of despair.<br/><br/>I can sympathize and pity characters who were looking for a fun, distracting getaway. It's a bit difficult to do such a thing when the characters are just concerned about getting high and having sex. It's much more sentimental when we see characters trying to escape the monotony of reality, and sincerely wanted to have a good time, but circumstances go beyond sour and they are left fighting for their own lives. It's the strongest example of calamity I can think of.<br/><br/>The gang winds up getting trapped in the cave, and are lost, hopeless, and growing weary of the darkness and murkiness of the underground. They discover they aren't the only ones down there, as they find vicious creatures who hunt by sound and movement. Once these beings are presented, the film becomes relentless, as it not only makes its characters lost and wandering, but gives them unknown predators to fear.<br/><br/>The film avoids misogyny by actually (a) giving most of the women identifiable traits and (b) portraying them as fighters, not weaklings. Hostel: Part II, a deplorable exercise of snuff and cruelty, portrayed women as helpless mutts with no story to present other than ""we want to party."" Here, these women are strong and capable, as both characters and actresses.<br/><br/>Also, for a film set underground, it's beautifully lit. A few years back, I watched James Cameron's Sanctum, which took place deep underground in caves as well. In 3D nonetheless; the absolute last place you'd want to see in a dimmer, more murky area. The film was drab, repetitive, void of substance, and an all around bland experience, mostly because character development was replaced with care and attention to cinematography. The Descent multitasks as Neil Marshall, who also worked on the impressive yet unsung B-movie Dog Soldiers, gives us about forty minutes to get acquainted with these characters. Enough time to form a liking for them, and sympathize when things turn sour.<br/><br/>The Descent is a pleasant surprise in the field of horror. It reaches the feeling one doesn't get very often, and that is dread. Scenes are difficult to watch, one comes exactly at the hour mark, and the fear and hopelessness practically bleed through the screen in no time. The ending is again like The Mist; gloomy, disheartening, and full of despair. Not that it's different from the rest of the film. I guess you can say, it stays true to the central tone, and by then, it's perfectly clear what that tone is.<br/><br/>Starring: Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring, and Nora Jane No one. Directed by: Neil Marshall."

I just watched the trailer after seeing the movie, and I think it just gives away too much. Better to just watch and be completely ignorant as to what's going to happen. I rented the movie and had to pause it repeatedly just to ease the tension and relax a little. My family was very surprised as I'm generally not the 'look through the fingers' type and don't get phased too easily. I do agree with some of the reviewers that it's probably a bit overrated, it's not Exorcist, Nightmare on Elm Street (original), Halloween, etc... by any stretch, but it's not the typical mindless slasher either. It's an above average horror movie that I think you'll find worth watching."

However, after having just watched this film, I must say that the score for The Descent is WAY higher than I can possibly fathom. How it got a 7+ is beyond me, but I digress.<br/><br/>This film was also in my opinion not very scary at all. Perhaps the ""found some crazy creatures while spelunking"" ploy never has worked on me, but to some it may.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is just another average ""horror"" film. It's not good, but it's not any worse than you would expect from the any similar title (ie The Cave, The Cavern, etc). I'm assuming that the people giving this film a higher score do so because of the subtext of the film's meaning and admittedly well done shots throughout (I guess?), but I think they give it too much credit."
"axismladen","5","1","3","18 September 2011"," It might be because i wasn't in the mood for a horror film when i was watching it, but i didn't find it that scary!
","A small group of friends get trapped in an unknown cave and encounters some monsters that are something like vampires only without all the sunlight and biting and stuff, and now they have to find their way out. That's pretty much all that the movie's about. There is some tragic background story and stuff, but it really doesn't matter.<br/><br/>From the moment the movie started, even though i read some good reviews, i really didn't think it will be any good. A, caves became like the biggest horror cliché in this last decade, B, when the entire story is set in a cave there is really not a lot of things that the movie can be about other than people trying to find their way out, and C, there's been far too many movies in the last couple of years about people trying to find their way out. We've seen that kind of stuff over and over again in movies like The Cave, even Pandorum and even some new ones like Sanctum and so on....<br/><br/>But even though i got tired of these kind of movies, considering all the good reviews it got, i decided to give it a shot anyway. And like i said in the summary, maybe it's because i just didn't feel like watching this movie at the time, but i just didn't find it that scary. Not scary at all, actually. There are certain scenes that got a bit out of me, but that's about it. It uses the same formula as any horror movie. Sudden appearances, light going on and off and so on... Since the reviews were so good, i at least expected it to be a bit fresh and innovative. It wasn't. Like i mentioned earlier, when the entire story is set in a cave there is really not a lot of things that the movie can be about other than people trying to find their way out.<br/><br/>And the ending is missed. When there is only a few of you left, i wont say how many because i don't wanna spoil anything, i don't think it would be a good idea to do what certain somebody did at the end of this movie. It would be completely illogical and no matter how crazy a person might be i highly doubt it that anyone would do it given the circumstances.<br/><br/>And why do certain characters, one or two, have no problems killing a whole lot of monsters through out the movie, but than at the ending they have trouble with killing only one, for instance?!? That's one of many irritating things(clichés) about The Descent.<br/><br/>It's not boring or dreadful, it has some fun, but there is really nothing more to it at my opinion. Just another horror film with nothing new to offer."

","""The Descent"" is a movie I've been wanting to get my hands on for quite awhile now. It had received near-universal positive reviews over the past few years and I was curious to see if it would live up to the hype. The answer is YES, it does, and in spades. ""The Descent"" is one of the creepiest, darkest, nastiest little movies I've seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty simple: a group of women who enjoy extreme sports/adventuring start out the movie on a white water rafting trip. On their way home from that trip, Sarah (our eventual heroine) loses her husband and young daughter in a head-on car crash. A year later, the still-grieving Sarah meets up with the group again for a new adventure, this time exploring a cave in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. Things start to go bad for the group virtually from the get-go. After crawling through a number of tight tunnel passages, a cave-in traps them underground, at which point ""Juno"" (the organizer of the trip) reveals to her friends that the cave they're in is not the one they originally intended to visit, but an unmapped cave that she wanted to ""be the first"" to explore. Therefore no one knows they're down there, and their only hope is to find another exit from the cave system. If you think it can't get any worse than that, well, you're wrong. One of the girls eventually breaks her leg falling down a hole and from there, well, everything hits the fan, as they encounter a race of pale, toothy, humanoid creatures with a taste for human flesh. From there all bets are off as the gang struggles to survive against the creatures -- and each other -- long enough to find a way out from the cave.<br/><br/>The main strength of ""The Descent"" is how it builds slowly; in fact we don't even see the creatures (dubbed ""crawlers,"" though I kept thinking of them as ""C.H.U.D.'s"") until the film is more than half over. The first hour is scary enough without them, as the girls squeeze through holes in the rock in near-total darkness, occasionally getting stuck, fighting amongst themselves as the stress of the situation begins to get to them, etc. Eventually a revelation pits Juno and Sarah (the two last surviving girls) against one another in a bleak finale that will stick with you long after the film is over.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is one of those movies that actually works better on a TV screen, as long as you're in a dark room; it heightens the film's claustrophobic vibe. Make sure you pick up the ""uncut, unrated"" DVD, which contains the original ending from the British release of the film, rather than the truncated/fake ""happy"" ending of the American version.<br/><br/>Monster movie fans can pick up ""The Descent"" with confidence. Those with claustrophobia or fear of the dark should probably pass on it."

","Same story of a lot of ppl here, I checked rankings, forums, and it turned out to be that this movie had lots of positive reviews, etc.<br/><br/>After I saw it I was really disappointed, there's a lot of things that are messed up but we have to admit that it has positive aspects: P.A. 1 - The performances are great, sorry If I disagree with most of the negative reviewers as I am one of you, but they were excellent. Truly believable. 2 - Lightning / camera: It gave an spooky effect, unexpected. 3 - Good Scenario: That fake cave looked really good, narrow spaces also added up a bit in the tension. (In the slight tension.. but it helped).<br/><br/>Now, as you can see, this movie had potential to be a good movie FOR REAL. But.. N.A. 1- Back stories weak: You can tell a little what's going on between them, but they don't ever empathize with the viewer because you don't know anything about them, besides that they like extreme sports even though they're a bunch of old girls, and.. the accident/romance thing, sigh. 2-Monsters / fighting scenes/ cameras: I don't mind if they look like gollum or not, they're supposed to be humanoid, so stop whining about that, it's a minor detail. But, I don't get how a ""race"" of humanoid creatures with skills to hunt, get defeated so easily by a bunch of 30+ girls who just practice some sports eventually?. And, the camera, it was doing great but in that scenes, God, it moves so much you can't understand what the hell happens, remember, IT'S REALLY DARK. 3-The flow:A infinite chain of mistakes started to happen non-stop, it looked forced and dumb. The girl who was supposed to be good fells and break her leg in no time (it was one of the best characters), Juno is annoying, incredibly dumb and she rather sacrifice all her friends than making a stop and think for 2 seconds.. oh my I won't go on with this.<br/><br/>Anyways.. what had a lot of potential turned out to be a mass of crap, there are good things as I mentioned, but the movie as a whole was a major disappointment. 3 / 10"

","This is easily one of the most uncomfortable movie experiences I've had the pleasure of sitting through. The atmosphere once the women are inside the cave is absolutely suffocating. I watched this on my 17"" laptop screen and was squirming as the women squeezed through those tiny spaces. <br/><br/>And the scene where Sarah gets stuck... oh god. Still makes me shift about as I think of it. <br/><br/>(SPOILERS) My only real complaint with this movie was the introduction of the ""crawlers"". Although they add a whole new sense of terror, I just found them to be too ordinary. It's almost like a little Hollywood attention to the monsters could have helped the movie. I did find a few inconsistencies, though. They are blind but have an acute sense of hearing and smell and yet they continually pass by the women. I don't know if I missed something but I would have thought that even a whisper would have given them away but, evidently, there was some other factor (i.e. they are figments of Sarah's imagination).

"krazieandwickedal","8","1","3","8 July 2009"," I usually hate horror films but...
","this one is an exception.<br/><br/>I hate horror films because they're meant to be scary and they're not. Most of the horrors that came out in the 60's and 70's were brilliant, solely because it delivered scare tactics that went unseen before during that time period. As soon as the 80's rolled around and movie studios relied on the typical low budget slasher flicks, which constantly regurgitated scares that were seen many horror films before it, horror was dying. Horror films were no longer scary. This genre was revived a bit in the late 90's (I think so at least) and ever since the 2000s began, they've been down the drain once again. I honestly hate horror films with some exceptions of classics and ones that are actually entertaining and I think that there hasn't been a good horror film in 10 years (with the exception of just very few films).<br/><br/>The trailer for The Descent drew me in. It caught my attention like no other horror film trailer ever has and there was a part of me that felt that this could actually be a good horror film. I saw it, expecting it be to great, and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is simply brilliant, a phenomenal horror classic, and a rare gem in a world where really really bad horror remakes reign the box office. I'm sick of the Prom Night remakes and the constant torture sequels (thanks for that one Saw) and yet another Friday The 13th sequel. In a world where horrible, horrible horror films have managed to be released by money hungry and cinematically impaired studio owners, this film is unique. Why? It's actually good, really good.<br/><br/>It was just a grand refreshment. The horror is unique and unlike anything that I've seen before and for the first time since A Nightmare On Elm Street, I actually jumped out of my seat in fear. It offers new horror instead of grabbing remains from Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's also a dark film, really dark. Not Saw, you have to gut someone else in order to escape dark, but bathing in blood, eating dead corpses dark. There are scenes that are grandly dark in such a great Dracula fashion, I loved it! The lack of lighting in the film and the touch of adding general fears (claustrophobia, paranoia, etc.) into the film just makes it that much better so now more people, especially horror impaired (like me) can actually get in on the scares. Never before has a horror film wowed me this much, especially one released after the year 2000. Such a rare gem and bound to become a great horror classic aired every Halloween on AMC 30 years from now. To the people who wrote and directed this film, thank you. You made me love horror again.<br/><br/>Don't rent this film, buy it!!!! You will not be disappointed. I give it a 10 out of 10. (an 11 out of 10 it were possible (Spinal Tap joke))"

The direction must be commented on because I think there is no other movie that can make you feel every scene as if you were right there. The end is not what you expect it to be and that is a major point in the success of this movie.

The plot is pretty simple but sometimes simple is best. I think the production design for the cave network setting was well done and suitably claustrophobic. I liked how the whole thing was lighted, in a place with no external light sources. It was played seriously and for me the actresses were quite convincing with a stand-out performance by the lead. However sometimes it was tough to distinguish the actresses but I did like the ambiguity of certain characters who don't always act heroically although they're basically good people.

","I've had some minor problems in the past with horror films in which the bulk of the action transpires mainly in the dark, or in which the monsters go largely unseen (even in such classic entertainments as ""Alien"" and ""It's Alive""), and so sat down to watch 2005's ""The Descent"" with some degree of trepidation, despite its great rep. And it turns out that my qualms were justified, but not enough to matter. In the film, a sextet of sexy and spunky spelunkers--significantly, all semisuperwomen--explores an undiscovered cave system in North Carolina's Appalachians, becomes trapped after a cave-in, and encounters some truly ferocious underground dwellers. Though not a sufferer of claustrophobia, I have had many nightmares in which I am crawling through a very tight space underground (Freudians, make of this what you will!), and this film really does capture the frightfulness of those dreams. The monsters themselves (""Crawlers,"" the filmmakers call them, in one of this DVD's many extras)--though perforce only seen dimly and in flashes, for the most part, as I suspected--are a truly horrifying bunch. Humanoid, albino and vaguely batlike, they make a catastrophic situation enter the realm of the surreal. As it turned out, my only real problem with ""The Descent"" was the fact that it's very hard to differentiate between the six gals once they strap on helmets and start crawling around in the dark, although a repeat viewing did admittedly clarify things a good deal for me. I felt as if I'd been put through a wringer by the film's end, actually, which I suppose is high praise for even the murkiest of horror films. And I would imagine that this picture would be as welcomed by feminists for its depiction of sisters sticking together as it would be damned by the National Speleological Society! ""The Descent"" will certainly not be drawing in new converts to the sport of caving, that's for sure; another indication of its power and effectiveness!"

It is certainly claustrophobic as most of the time it's filmed in the dark cave but I thought it only added to the tenseness. It comes with some very good unsuspecting frights and the 'creatures' that live in the caves are convincingly portrayed as a thoroughly ravenous species. **Spoiler *** One of the final scenes where Juno, the Asian woman that mislead the other women but not in a bad mischievous sense, is left with only a flare and a badly severed leg amongst a hoard of these creatures leaves an imprint in your mind for a while.

","I universally despise horror movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic. This is a wonderful film. The characters are 3-D. This is a girl flick with an attitude.<br/><br/>For those about to rent or buy this film: ignore the crappy DVD cover, and don't read the back jacket. The film cover does this film no justice, and neither does the summary on the back of the DVD cover. This producer took inspiration from several horror movies, but he made this movie his.<br/><br/>Do not rent this movie--BUY this movie. I watched it four times in a row. Also, do not forget to watch the commentary from the director and the producer."
"lindsey_docherty","8","1","3","21 July 2008"," Good for a gore-fest
","I watched this film for some thrills on a night in with a few friends and may I say that it failed to disappoint. At the beginning, the various personalities of the different characters are made very apparent, and quickly I began to guess some of the events that may unfold. However, with the fast paced storyline, this doesn't spoil the film at all, as the various twists in the plot soon have you trying to think again of what might happen. This is a great movie for those who like frights, and a good share of gore on the side, and had me and my friends hiding behind the cushions, and guessing till the very end, where the plots biggest twist takes place."
"Tweekums","9","1","3","10 July 2008"," Watch this in the dark
","I probably wouldn't have bought this but when I saw it in the bargain section I recalled it getting a good review on the radio. I'm glad I did get it as it was thoroughly entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>In the introductory scene we see the group of women white water rafting in Scotland, then as one of them going home with her husband and child they have a head on collision which leaves her in hospital and her family dead.<br/><br/>The next time we see them they are meeting up in America for a caving expedition under the Appalachian mountains. After a night in the cabin where we get to know the characters a bit they head into the caves and we are plunged in to a claustrophobic underworld. Soon after arriving they are cut off from the way they entered by a rockfall and they learn that the one who organised the trip decided to go into an unexplored cave system rather than the one in the guide book. As they go deeper into the caves the tension continues to mount. After going for some time they realise they aren't alone but the caves are inhabited by fierce humanoid creatures which rather reminded me of the subterranean Morlocks from H. G. Well's ""Time Machine""; creatures that were once human but have long since adapted to a life underground. It is then a fight for survival against the crawlers and in some cases against each other.<br/><br/>To full appreciate this film one really has to watch it in the dark and preferably alone. I was scared as soon as things went wrong in the caves, long before we learnt that they weren't alone, that feeling didn't go away till the end credits were rolling. There is a fair bit of gore but I don't think it was over done nor was it sadistic. Over all I think this film is just the thing to watch if you want a good scare, just don't watch this if you plan to go caving any time soon."

","This is a great scary movie, without any of the post-Scream humour that was fun to start with, but enough is enough, already.<br/><br/>Just a couple of points; Anyone who has read the book will be disappointed as it covers only a tiny fraction of the book's contents. The book is well-worth reading.<br/><br/>There is an appallingly sexist comment that ""all girls are the same in the dark"".

","Claustrophobia and bloody mayhem collide in the high-adrenaline horror flick The Descent. Six women (including one who lost her husband and child the year before, and one who harbors a bitter secret) spelunker in an unexplored cavern system that turns out to harbor mysterious, predatory creatures. That sums up the story, but--as with writer-director Neil Marshall's previous low-concept movie, Dog Soldiers--the plot doesn't begin to describe the riveting, stomach-lurching thrills this movie provides. The script affords the relatively unknown cast (led by Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza, both excellent) just enough room to make their characters distinct and genuine, so that when they're dropped into utmost peril our empathy is engaged as much as our fear. The dynamic direction and editing make the cavern a palpable, physical presence, even before the creepy beasts crawl out of their nooks. This is not a movie for everyone; it is extremely gruesome and will induce panic attacks in anyone with even a mild fear of closed spaces. But for anyone seeking something smarter, faster, and more wrenching than static torture-feasts like Saw or Hostel, The Descent will draw you into its unsettling ooze."

","As any critic will tell you, the rule of thumb is that the more developed a character is, the more you care about what happens to them, which translates into how effective the movie will be. There are exceptions to this rule however (John Carpenter's masterpiece ""Halloween"" being a prime example). Some films try to bypass this route and go straight for an all-out action scarefest. This is extremely difficult, and in order to work, everything else has to be pitch-perfect. Neil Marshall has the guts to attempt this ambitious trajectory, and he certainly has the skills to do it.<br/><br/>In movies like this, plot is inconsequential; it's just a set-up for the director to go wild and provide a plethora of scares. Basically, a group of women go on a caving expedition after one of them suffered a tragedy the year before (of course). As one can probably guess, nothing goes as planned.<br/><br/>It's really pointless to try and address the acting. Apart from two or three of the women, no one really has a well-defined character, and apart from the two I just mentioned, I challenge anyone who watches this to remember anyone else's name. They're all just a bunch of faces and voices. However, the women are normal enough that we care about them simply because we are human, and they're not irritating or dull. They act like real people.<br/><br/>This is Neil Marshall's movie through and through, and with this movie, he makes a grand and bombastic entrance into the list of most memorable horror movies. Marshall uses everything at his disposal to maximize the scares and keep the adrenaline pumping throughout most of the 99-minute movie. His camera angles are expertly chosen to get the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in a cave, and they give a chilling insanity and disorientation to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>It's no secret that this is a monster movie, but what's really interesting is that the monsters don't come until pretty late in the movie. Marshall skillfully sets the mood and gets the adrenaline and uneasiness going by throwing in some realistic situations long before the monsters ever show. I won't give any of them here, but it works.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked is that this is a horror-movie through and through. There are no self-referential jokes, no cute pop culture references, or anything like that. In other words, this takes the dark scary route head-on and doesn't follow the trend that the ""Scream"" movies started by adding jokes in it (nowadays they're usually added because few people know how to make a movie scary anymore, and the producers want SOMETHING that's definitely going to be marketable in their movie, so they cover two genres with one movie). Marshall makes this a pure heart-pounder and it's so much more refreshing because there's nothing to dilute the scares.<br/><br/>Not everything Marshall throws at us works. Some of the non-jolt scares don't work. Additionally, the prelude where we are introduced to the characters is a little long (though that was probably me just eager for the scares to start).<br/><br/>With every horror movie, there are always low-grade critics who label every movie with praise like ""scary as hell"" and ""terrifying"" and the like. Usually, those blurbs aren't worth anything, but here, those are descriptions that I would use any day to describe ""The Descent."" It's a 90+ minute adrenaline rush."

","This was a very good horror movie. The beginning takes time to set up the relationships between the woman. We learn the group of friends like to get together every year to go on a thrilling adventure. This year they are exploring a cave. One of the women, Sarah, is still trying to get over the loss of her family. The movie does this without dragging out the story; hence this part is entertaining not boring.<br/><br/>We finally get to the cave exploring. I think it is so creepy to think about crawling around in such a tight place and dragging yourself over rocks and water in the dark. There is no way I would do that. The group experiences a cave in and that's when they learn from Juno, the girl who planned the trip, that she did not lead them to the planned cave. They are exploring a new cave system and no one knows they are there.<br/><br/>Instinct kicks in and it's about survival for each individual.

Red flares and green glow sticks. When the cave people start attacking, that's when it gets gruesome. Some of the best gore and blood I've seen. Amazing how rock picks can make blood spew. But, I don't buy Juno and Sarah at the end being able to dominate the cave people like that. But it sure was cool.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's creepy and got lots of blood and guts.

"sddavis63","8","1","3","21 January 2008"," Much Better Than I Expected It To Be
","From the description of the movie, I hadn't really expected to get very much out of this. It seemed like a pretty standard horror-type movie, and in some respects it was. A group of women who have some sort of annual ""adventure"" trip, go exploring a cave in the Appalachians in North Carolina. Trapped beneath the surface by a cave-in, they encounter what seem to be mutant humanoid type creatures who, to say the least, have quite an appetite for human flesh and blood. For the first little while, innocent things happen suddenly and unexpectedly, and I jumped because I knew there were creatures somewhere, then the creatures begin to appear suddenly and unexpectedly and I didn't jump as much because now I knew they were going to appear suddenly and unexpectedly, and there was a lot of blood and gore. So far, pretty standard horror stuff. But there were a lot of things I liked about this movie that really raised it up.<br/><br/>As the movie started, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her husband appear ready to have a heart to heart conversation about some marriage difficulties. Instead, they end up in a horrific car crash that kills the husband and daughter. A shocker right off the top. Then, once the women are stuck in the cave, I'm expecting a sort of female version of male-bonding. Instead, there's the exact opposite. The group starts to splinter apart as they deal with their situation. (Thus perhaps a double entendre to the title: the descent into the cave and the descent of the group into an every woman for herself type of mentality.) I found myself guessing from moment to moment what was going to happen, and my guesses were generally wrong. That says two positive things: first, the writers put a lot of thought into this rather than going for the boringly predictable, and, second, this was interesting enough to keep me wanting to guess. The ending of the movie caught me totally off guard. First, there was Sarah's way of dealing with Juno (Natalie Mendoza) which totally shocked me, then there was what seemed to be the totally logical ending to the movie and the only guess I thought I was going to get right (about who survived) only to be taken in by an unexpected final scene, which causes uncertainty about whether the encounter between Sarah and Juno really took place, and which serves as a completely fitting (and completely unexpected) form of closure, as Sarah finally comes to terms with her daughter's death as she awaits what surely seems to be her own inevitable fate (a fate which is mercifully not shown.) A very violent and bloody movie finishes on a very gentle and peaceful (and one could even say spiritual) note.<br/><br/>This was really well done. The women fought perhaps a little too well against creatures that had evolved specifically to live in that dark environment and therefore should have had a huge advantage which too often didn't seem to be the case. The only other thing I would question is the addition of three extra women to the group. From the opening scenes of the rafting trip, my impression is that the usual group is of three friends. Why expand it to six in the Appalachians? The three additional women didn't seem to add very much - except a few more victims for the creatures - and a focus on the relationship between the original three might have been a more interesting study of the group dynamic. But that's about all I can find to criticize here. 8/10"
"AloysiusWeasley","9","1","3","4 January 2008"," One of the best horror movies in YEARS!
","All right, I'm going to try to do this one without spoilers. A short summary of the movie goes like this: This movie has a bit of background in the beginning, establishing that there's basically this group of chicks that gets together to do some adrenaline-pumping activities every year together (no, not that kind). First, they go white-water rafting, and I won't spoil what happens after that. The next year, they get together with a few more friends and decide to go spelunking. They set out the next day, after spending a night in a cabin. For what happens after this point, look at the genres this movie is in, and decide where the movie goes from there. ;) All right, on to the goodies! Even as a horror/thriller fan that's seen a whole lot of these types of movies and is getting a bit jaded, this movie was GREAT! There are no stupid people in this acting in moronic ways to move the plot along. No ""Let's split up"", no moments of ""Hey, what's that noise, let's go check it out (unarmed)"", and best of all, no stupid bimbos (with or without clothing torn in creative ways). There's not even really any moments of ""Wow, that was dumb, I could have done way better"". This movie is chock-full of intelligent women who can take care of themselves, and that's certainly a breath of fresh air that this genre DESPERATELY NEEDS.<br/><br/>Now, the acting? Awesome, considering there's no actresses in here you've probably ever heard of. Plot - really sound. What they face in this movie is very realistic, and not really that implausible at all. Also, when you're watching this, you won't even be able to believe this wasn't actually filmed in a cave. Probably my favorite part of this movie was the atmosphere - incredibly tense, this is one of those movies where you shouldn't even bother getting the popcorn, because there's a pretty good chance you might your tongue off at some point.<br/><br/>I just saw this a half hour ago (I'm still shaking), and I'm trying to think if there's anything I didn't like AND how to tell you in a non-spoiler way. Well..occasionally they're a little hard to understand, since a couple of the women have fairly thick UK accents. Oh, and there's a particular pool in the cave that may render a ""Bwah? How did that get there?"". However, that's IT.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Rent it if you want, but this one's well worth the buy. Make sure you don't get it confused with the Cave (which came out just after this movie), because the Cave is absolute dreck, especially compared to this. Also, if you're in the U.S., make sure you get the unrated version, since our version over here got cut.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. You won't want to go spelunking after this one. Ever."
"johnny-08","7","1","3","3 January 2008"," Six women, one cave, plenty of nasty creatures and lots of blood, well why not?
","I heard lots of positive comments for this one, so I decided to take a look. Why? Cause I like horror movies. My expectations were low cause it's been a while since I watched a really good horror movie of newer date. So I sat to watch this movie on my computer, all alone, in the dark. ""The Descent"" starts like any other movie and actually in the first 50 minutes (without nasty creatures) we are meeting all the characters involved in this movie. Six women who all love dangerous adventures, like rafting on wild rivers (beginning), climbing on high mountains (that picture) and finally going into caves. So our six ladies decide to go to this cave not knowing what might be in there. They all agreed to go on a trip because of Sarah, who had a terrible road accident a year ago in which she lost her husband and daughter. Sarah needs change and all other characters need adrenaline so the adventure can begin. But Juno, the bravest of them all, decides to lead them into cave that no one went in before.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall directed this one after the success of ""Dog Soldiers"" and he's a classic example for the fact that good horrors could be made even if you don't have extravagant budget. What Marshall brings in new in his movie is great way of telling a story. First he starts slowly so he can introduce characters. Accident that happened to Sarah, friendship between Sarah, Juno and Beth and finally preparations for the trip. When they finally come into the cave strange things doesn't start to happen quickly. And then blast. Marshall hits us with that creatures, music, atmosphere and on top of all, with his directing. It is absolutely amazing how Marshall manged to film all that scenes in dark. Most of the movie happens in a cave and there isn't many light but Marshall succeeds on that field and he proves that one European horror can easily beat all those new American crappy horrors (there are few exceptions). <br/><br/>Maybe at one point you will find this movie to bloody, that everything that happens to main characters lacks sense but I think that you can either like or dislike this movie. There is no middle. One thing you have to admit: directing was great, atmosphere was fine and gives you plenty of room to think about it. From Juno's accidental killing of one of the characters to the very end when Sarah stays alone in the cave and when she creates the picture of her dead daughter; and of course was Sarah to cruel to Juno. My favorite part was the ending, cause it was simply great to watch Sarah's dream and then the reality. This is nothing new but it's a great way to end this movie.<br/><br/>Universal message of this movie is that evil cannot be destroyed and that caver is not a good profession, at least not in a cave that no man visited before. Or it did, but they stayed there forever!"

","Wow what a great film, what is not to love about ""The Descent"". I can not even start talking about this masterful flick. Quite frankly I did not expect such a shocking cinema from U.K. But hey, apparently the British did not stop with ""Shaun of the dead"".<br/><br/>The Descent is about a group of caving voyagers finding themselves trapped in a cave filled with human eating predators. There was a surplus of demonic creatures and gory fight scenes, which, by the way, I enjoyed. Great special effects and lengthy gruesome fights overwhelmed me throughout the movie. The plot, too, was exciting, I mean what would anyone do if they find themselves trapped in a cave full of flesh eating blind mutants with no way out?<br/><br/>The other enjoyable aspect of the movie was its consistent suspenseful scenes. Unlike some painful-to-watch flicks in the same genre such as ""captivity"" with Elisha Cuthbert, The Descent had me in a terrorizing yet overwhelmingly exuberant experience for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>overall, if you are someone who is yet to see the movie and have claustrophobia do not watch it. but if you are man/woman enough to see a gory flick that will scare the crap out of you, well what are you waiting for? I guarantee you, you will love it."
"jenkins-stewart","8","1","3","14 December 2007"," ""Love each day""
","The most intelligent, well-structured, and poetic horror movie to be made in first decade of the new century. It will likely be the only one for a good while longer.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: If you want to get the full effect, watch the uncut version. If just want to see a good movie, watch the American theatrical release and do not read the following. <br/><br/>The Descent is about the descent into madness. As such it begins with reality, linearity, and rationality, but de-evolves into parable, circularity, and emotion. There are several markers which will help you through the darkness of this complex and intimidating plot. One is the ""Birthday Candles."" There is one candle for each of the friends. This plot device is not a cheap-trick, that is, don't expect one candle after another to be snuffed out as each friend is killed! It is merely a structural marker to tell you where you are in the plot! They don't spell out a code or anything as absurd or gimmicky as all that, they are like the axe-heads from Homer's Odysseya sort of thematic placeholder to lend the story structure and cause it to reverberate with its own resonance. If the break-down so far has scared you, fear not, it will become clearer.<br/><br/>There are several places the ""birthday candles"" show up. The first is as the friends are enjoying drinks in their cabin. A strange shot shows a row of beer-bottles, out of focus, with the light of the fire-place glowing in-between. The beer-bottles are not important! He's drawing your attention to the negative space in-between them. This is your first glimpse of ""the candles."" Later, as the friends drive to the cave, there is a deer-crossing sign which is riddled with bullet holes. Again, the light shining through the holes is your ""birthday candles"" marker.<br/><br/>Then, as the friends are approaching the cave on foot, they find a slain elk its antlers are another reverberation of the theme.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not going to say anymore about ""the birthday candles"" because this isn't an essay and I want you to figure out for yourself where the other instances are, and what they ultimately lead up to. Also keep in mind that I've only listed a few ""easy to miss"" shots what I've pointed out is not all that has gone on so far I purposely left stuff out so that you can fully enjoy the effect without my giving it all away.<br/><br/>Here's your second clue. The plot of this movie is not linear. It comes full circle. Remember that. Pay VERY close attention to the beginning or ""prologue"" of the film. Don't look for petty little details, because you'll just waste your time. Just try to remember it, and keep it in mind. In particular, think about the abstract structure of the film, and compare the beginning to the end and see if you can't figure out why the ending isn't just a random twist.<br/><br/>Your third clue is the screams. Notice how the girls scream in the beginning. Towards the end of the film, are they still screaming? What other sounds do you hear? How do the sounds change? What do the sounds remind you of? Are there any sounds that seem out of place? <br/><br/>Your fourth clue is the crawlers themselves. The director of this film said, in an interview ""the crawlers are the cavemen who never left the cave."" Some of you may be quick to point out that there were no cave-men in that part of north-America. You're right, but the director's not stupid! The crawlers are men who have ""de-evolved,"" what else is de-evolving? Why are there old mining helmets and other signs of human life among the crawlers? Are there any female crawlers? And child crawlers? If so, is there a meaningful reaction between these special crawlers and any of the girls? Does this interaction come at a critical point in the plot? When the crawlers first appear, who sees them? Who doesn't see them? What about the camera that was brought along, what does it see? Is there a significance as to when the camera is lost? When the others finally see a crawler, how is it that they see him? <br/><br/>Finally, I leave you with this question. Who's fault is it that everything goes so horribly wrong? The answer may surprise you And this is my final hint. It isn't Juno. It isn't Sarah. But it is someone! You'll have to wait to the end of the uncut version to find out! Hope that helps! I know this film ain't easy! <br/><br/>At its heart, The Descent is a parable for and meditation on destructive jealously... not a true horror film, action film, nor is it a vindictive tirade against the treacherousness of women or some other form of limited satire. I challenge you to figure out what (or perhaps whom) is central object of this jealously. Your last hints are as follows: It isn't the necklace. It isn't Sarah's husband. Holly is part of the answer, who is makes up the other? <br/><br/>((The Descent is a blisteringly intelligent film and beautifully made, but too cerebral to be widely understood 100% for a tremendous concept and execution, but -20% for its extreme difficulty and the fact that even fans of the movie fail to understand it. Final grade 80%. B grade work only limited by its own refusal to be less cryptic in its message))"

The scenes of the women cave diving and having to traverse chasms of unknown depths after the cave in is where a lot of the suspense comes from, and the further they get into the caves, they realise that they're not alone down there. They begin hearing strange noises. They begin seeing shapes following them. Claustrophobia starts to get to them, and me. But what the hell is it that's down there with them? Is it animal or human? It's actually vampiric looking creatures that hunt by sound and rip their victims limb from limb, with these ladies next on their menu. The creature makeup effects are relatively restrained, but the climax is an absolute bloodbath, with people being torn limb from limb, pools of blood, the creatures getting their eyes gouged out and stabbed through their necks. It actually goes slightly overboard with some of the effects, drastically changing the tone of the movie from claustrophobic suspense to excessive gore. A terrible, inconclusive ending, which leaves the viewer hanging is most detrimental, but the suspense, good acting and pacing, and photography in the tight confines of the caves mostly make up for it. <br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Have to say that I didn't have great expectations plus it sounded as a cheap B-movie from what you can read from the cover. But that changed. The first about 40 minutes builds up the story, but then it slowly starts to win in on you, and the pace of the story quickens up from there. I was pleasantly surprised of the twists and turns that came up during the movie - without revealing anything or too much (I hope). Get this one in your DVD-player and be entertained.

Before that, the film gives us a shocking and essential back-story to the group....a characteristic usually void for the genre. The film starts with meaning....then it begins to build tension...the tension seems to grow to an incredible crescendo right when this film really goes horror...and in a deliciously BIG way. There is a beautiful balance of positives here...the music, the pertinent back-story, the well-fashioned gore, the lighting and tension...the chronic, unrelenting nature of the situation... this movie basically knocks it out of the park. An uncomfortable, ghoulish, terrifyingly terrific horror flick. A must see for fans of the horror genre. The premise seems unrealistic but it is pulled off in quite the opposite manner. It feels like your right there with 'em.....that's what makes this a real winner. This movie buff says, ""Highly Recommended"". 81/100"

","I hadn't heard of Neil Marshall before the Descent. I hadn't heard of Shauna Macdonald before the Descent. But the movie as a whole and the acting of the main character Sarah really impressed me. I thought it was going to be a cheap British slasher movie, and by the end it turned into that slightly; gory deaths, lots of blood and innocent women being feasted upon. There were no big stars and I hadn't heard much about the movie's success either but after the first 30 minutes or so, I was on the edge of my seat. In the first of Sarah's dreams, I received a huge fright and from then on I was scared all evening. On finding out what the monsters were and what they looked like I lost a little bit of love for the film but it by no means put me off it. I enjoyed all the thrills throughout, including a disgusting image of Sarah walking out of a pool of blood (maybe trying to be the new Carrie) and all the jumpy moments (there were many). The movie has very little music and a lot of silence, building up the tension and leading up to some frights. The Descent is a good film with a fitting ending and a great final girl in Sarah. Well done."
"kenvandenbussche-2","8","1","3","1 November 2007"," More than just decent ...
","I had never seen a movie by English director Neil Marshall, but this is certainly a guy to keep your eyes on. I don't know if this movie is going to be his one hit wonder or the beginning of a great career, but the thriller-horror movie ""The descent"" isn't just decent ... it's bloody fantastic! The story evolves around a bunch of women who regularly come together to organize a truly overwhelming adventure. Only this time they might have exaggerated in doing so since they find themselves trapped in a cave as a result. To make matters worse: they find out that a strange breed of predators have made a home here.<br/><br/>The greatest achievement of this movie is that you genuinely care about its characters. Without that: this would have been another slice-and-dice slasher film. But ""The descent"" is much more than that. This excellent thriller does not just feature six beautiful women. The acting of these ladies is also very inspiring. Each character is different from the next and this makes the story even more interesting. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Some camera-shots create such a disturbing and claustrophobic mood that it almost feels as though you were actually there with them (wishful thinking; I suppose). The different set-pieces are also amazing and make you forget that you are watching a movie. Once the six wannabe-Tomb Raiders descend into the mysterious cave, the tension is very delicately built up. How these crawling cave creatures look like is spoon-fed to us so as to not spoil the big ultra-terrifying moment when we meet them face-to-face for the first time ever. After that: it becomes an action-packed horror movie which is both fun and frightening to watch, but it never descends in quality.<br/><br/>In short: ""The descent"" is a masterful thriller-horror movie which excels on all levels. It is pretty much flawless and should not be missed by any and all who love a good scare! Thriller-wise: this is as good as it gets!"
"mirwais-orbit","8","1","3","28 October 2007"," It's safe play with old formulas
","This is a better version of The Cave. We have an outdoor adventure group going to explore a cave, the way back is blocked and finally they meet a group of monsters who lives in the dark and are hungry for human meat. Also there's a villain in the group who are responsible for all the wrong turns, a cool and uncommon one to break a leg and be the first one to die and a beholder to be killed by the b*tch.<br/><br/>But the differences here that makes this movie a great one is: 1st) it's European; 2) It's all about the direction, that's why the movie is quite effective; 3) All the actresses are great.<br/><br/>Those are the 3 reasons to waste a good time watching this movie and that's enough.<br/><br/>Of course that even being European the movie is filled with Hollywood clichés because it's safe play with old formulas than try new ones, but just a small part of the audience should be troubled with that."
"ExpendableMan","9","1","3","18 August 2007"," The best horror film of the decade thus far
","Neil Marshall's follow up to Dog Soldiers sounds quite similar when you consider the plot synopsis: a group of six female friends on a caving trip in the mountains are attacked by cannibalistic subhumans. But while the same-sex group under attack in a tightly packed space, located in the wilderness motif may be repetitive, The Descent is actually a significantly different film. Dog Soldiers, for all its wanton gore and violence was played as much for laughs as horror, off-setting the werewolf frenzy with bickering between the soldiers and references to the Evil Dead. The Descent on the other hand plays it relatively straight. There are still nods to pop culture but from the horrific opening sequence to the beautifully dark ending, there isn't a laugh to be had. Instead, Marshall plunges cast and audience alike into a claustrophobic nightmare scenario and the result is not only the most relentless horror of the decade thus far, but arguably the finest as well.<br/><br/>What is especially striking about The Descent is that you could quite feasibly remove the monsters from the story and still have an hour and a half of raw terror. Central to this is the lighting, the film foregoing all standard light rigs and relying solely on the fluorescent caving equipment and helmet bulbs to illuminate the darkness. When a bulb breaks, the screen is plunged into darkness. As a result, light becomes the most precious commodity in the film and simply watching the cast crawling through tight spaces and narrow tunnels in the rock is a nerve-shredding experience. Dust falls from the ceiling and there is the constant threat of a cave-in looming overhead, providing The Descent with a bleak and oppressive atmosphere even before the first monster comes crawling into view.<br/><br/>When they do though, Marshall pushes the tension as close to breaking point as film is likely to get. The teasing snippets of drooling shadows and huddled, shadowy forms give way to some highly effective 'jump out of the seat' scares. And don't think for a second that just because the protagonists are women that the director will be pulling punches, the violence is brutal, messy and grim. While this will be nothing new to genre fans who in the past few years have seen flesh eating viruses, blood splattered Euro-torture and rural massacres brought vividly to life on screen, The Descent is still effective: one scene where a girl trembles in fright, watching the corpse of a friend being ripped asunder through a video-camera lens only inches away finding the perfect balance between old-school claret and white-knuckled tension.<br/><br/>Marshall's trump card though is the level of intelligence that he provides, something that is sorely lacking from the large number of mainstream horror films. There is a subtle implication of adultery motivating character actions and an even more subtle hint that the entire scenario may simply be the nightmare delusions of the lead heroine. After all, she experiences hallucinations before the trip and noticeably leaves a prescription bottle of pills behind. This grants the film an edge over its contemporaries, as it rewards repeat viewings by allowing the possibility of multiple interpretations.<br/><br/>In short, the best film to crop up from the resurgence in old-school horror. It's definitely aware of its genre heritage, mixing elements of Deliverance (same sex activity trip) with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the blood-drenched lead looks just like the 'final girl' Sally) and even Alien (the trip into the cave resembles the entrance to the derelict) but reconfigures them for an intense and unforgiving ride. Decades from now, this one will be considered a classic and no doubt, the 2030 remake will result in all kinds of derision."

"kosmasp","8","1","3","6 July 2007"," A few good women
","You have a group of women here, who are about to enter a cave, to forget something that happened in the past. A sort of going deep inside, to find a way out of one's misery. As you can guess from the title, the cave is in/down the earth rather than in a mountain. Although that's not where the film begins, it's where the movie starts really.<br/><br/>The movie begins quite some time earlier than the cave event, but this back story is held to a minimum amount of time. You then get served a bit of character moments, before the women go ""down"" ... and the action begins. The acting is pretty good, but it's the setting itself that creates the tension and will keep you on the edge of your seat. A great horror movie, that has quite a few references, even to war movies in it ... see here at IMDb for details on that one. Good scary ""fun"" then!"
"crooow-2","8","1","3","30 June 2007"," Well-crafted thriller
","I enjoyed this film because of the attention to detail. For a ""monster"" movie, it was surprisingly believable (unlike ""The Cave""). Many of the ""flaws"" mentioned on this website are because people didn't pay attention (or perhaps couldn't understand all the dialogue due to the various accents). In fact, this would have worked well without any monsters at all. The cavers show a nice variety of reactions (mostly fear and panic) - I never felt like any of them were acting inappropriately. Suspense is built up well and the few subplots actually contribute to the story. My only criticisms: it is too obvious who will go first and who will remain until the end (or near end); it would have been nice to develop all six of the characters instead of 3 or 4; and there are early sequences where it is hard to tell which person is doing what or where. The last is probably intentional by the director to convey the claustrophobia and confusion but it was still annoying as a viewer. I found myself thinking ""Okay, just wait this part out and we'll see who is where.""<br/><br/>Also the opening whitewater rafting sequence is fairly weak but don't let the first couple of minutes deter you."

","Two problems for me here, I'm not overly keen on 'suspense' as a device because it makes me very uneasy with not much pleasure associated and the other is I have a fear of crawling forward into narrow spaces. So, once the early girlie introductions are over and we begin to go down, I'm already wondering whether this 'torture' will be worth it. Of course it is, I start to relax just now and again enough to enjoy the harrowing descent and then was completely surprised by all the gloriously horrible final third. I purposefully not read about the story and just imagined they spend half the movie getting stuck and the rest getting unstuck. How wrong, this is a masterful movie and if the first section is possibly slightly overlong all is forgiven by the end which I have to rate as probably the best ever last third of any British horror film and clearly should be considered for any top twenty horror list."

","A group of adventure seeking women become trapped in an uncharted cave with a bunch of Nosferatu like creatures looking for a meal. The Descent is an effectively menacing, cautionary tale. Every one of the women is dead the moment they put their lives into the hands of the self centered Juno. She slept with her best friend's husband and deliberately sent them into the cave for ""a little fun"" to cheer her up. Her friend's, Sarah's, husband and daughter died in a car accident. Beth(Alex Reid) is the best friend of Sarah, who is left for dead by Juno after accidentally stabbing her in the throat. Reid is great as the best friend and I found myself wishing that she had the lead. The creatures are never really seen very closely and have no personality. The movie is about the two women, Sarah and Juno, and the creatures could be said to just be the demons that haunt and are hidden by them. They have finally come back to drag them down."
"phonenumberofthebeast","8","1","3","9 June 2007"," Two different movies
","This film exists in two very different versions. The original British version, which is about three minutes longer, and an edited version released in the United States. The edit, which removed the original's ending, was, in my opinion, akin to castration. The final three minutes of this film are a shattering visual kenning that elevates ""The Descent"" from what would otherwise have been a very well-crafted but still fairly clichéd monsters-in-the-dark movie into a great horror film. It alone added at least one star to my rating. I understand that the original edit is now available on US DVD. If you live in the US and have never seen ""The Descent"" before, demand that you receive that version.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is not without flaws. The story is an anachronism that has existed in some form or other since Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" and was given its first modern reworking by such films as ""Deliverance"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" A group of headstrong individuals make their way to a lonely, isolated place, and are gradually picked off one by one by a malevolent, relentless force. In this case, the headstrong individuals are an all-female group of adrenaline junkies led by Juno (played by Australian rock star Natalie Jackson Mendoza), a slim, acrobatic Lara Croft-wannabe with guts of steel and an ego of titanium, and Sarah, (Shauna MacDonald) a fragile, haunted woman still recovering from a senseless personal tragedy. The isolated place is that ultimate of isolated places: a cave system somewhere under the Appalachians (one of several oblique nods to ""Deliverance""). The force that ultimately forms their nemesis is a hungry tribe of carnivorous, batlike anthropoids waiting for them in the depths.<br/><br/>The group, all in the name of helping Sarah forget her pain, decide to take a day spelunking. Things start to get fishy when Juno very deliberately leaves the map of the system in the truck. When, miles beneath the Earth, they are trapped by a cave in, the girls soon realise that Juno has led them into an unknown system, and that they have no idea how to get out. Then the shrieks begin. At this point, suspension of a great deal of disbelief is required: genuine cavers will doubtless cringe at the characters' basic lack of knowledge of their supposed calling, and evolutionary biologists might puzzle over the creatures' plausibility. But these are nitpicks. The reason this film works (and works well) is because director Neil Marshall (who made the excellent ""Dog Soldiers""), for all the lunacy of the concept, plays it absolutely, totally straight. There is not a knowing wink to be seen or a pithy catchphrase to be heard. These women are not superheroes, nor are they screaming claw-fodder. They are genuine people acting as people would in impossible and increasingly insane situation. The performances are committed, the setting as realistic as possible (the caves were entirely created in a studio set, but people have posted on this film's message board asking which system it was filmed in) and every chance is taken to evoke every possible human phobia (this movie plays the tension, grinding exertion, and sickening claustrophobia of its environment so effectively that the monsters are almost unnecessary).<br/><br/>This film's first act plays like a tragic domestic drama, as the girls meet and trade subsurface animosities during a night round the fireplace. Its second act plays like a subterranean version of ""Touching the Void"", as friendships break down and anger rises in the face of incredible physical hardship. The final act evokes all the best examples of this genre, from Chainsaw to Alien, and even Robert Wise's The Haunting. And like I said, the final scene elevates this movie to a higher level, and indeed, echoes the terrifyingly uncertain ending of the first of its kind, ""Ten Little Indians""."

The beginning sets the scene nicely, a group of female friends reuniting to go on another dare devil adventure, adding a few shocks along the way to set the pace. These were shocking but predictable, so you are always ready during the first part. But it's when they climb into the cave when things become unbearable. There are some horror films where they show too much and end up becoming a joke. This film shows a lot, but the horror is done so effectively. The claustrophobia of the never ending tight cave, the fact that the climbers are all women with nowhere to run. It is all a dream for horror film fanatics.

"banderle","7","1","3","7 May 2007"," Great horror film, but that elephant on the table
","I am amazed that among all of these very well written reviews, no one is critiquing the underlying themes of this film. And yes, horror films can and do have them, and this one has a few. Actually, while I agree with most of these reviews that this was a great horror film, viewers might want to keep in mind that, at least in this reviewer's opinion, the plot and relational dynamics portray women metaphorically in a rather nasty, vindictive fashion. So let's check the talk about empowered women for a minute... <br/><br/>I mean, let's just put it out there...the Juno character quite obviously was having an affair with Sarah's husband--just listen to the DVD commentary--and as the film unfolds, it is not a leap to realize, from the various smirks and furtive glances in Juno's solo shots, that there is something else going in with her deceptive little spelunking adventure a year later. Does Juno not harbor anger at Sarah for, in effect, taking away ""her"" man? Does she not wish to take some sort of vengeance out upon Sarah, whose fragile state might lend itself to harm if she ends up lost with the rest of the group in uncharted caverns? And then there is Beth's admonition to Sarah about Juno, ""Don't trust her."" And then, of course, Juno's eventual comeuppance,with Sarah turning the tables on Juno by becoming the vengeful predator rather than the prey as intended. I didn't make this stuff up, I personally have much more respect for women, but it's really right there in front of us. What does all this say about women and the nature of their relationships? <br/><br/>And in what context are all these catty, hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned themes played out? Strange that there is an abundance of ""penetration"" happening throughout this film, from the opening car accident to the women writhing through those somehow-strangely-familiar-shaped holes in the ground and tunnels below, to thumbs in eye sockets, to pick axes in legs. And then those white, slithery creatures slinking through the holes after them to eat them? I felt like I needed to smoke a cigarette when the movie was over. But seriously, one is left with the sense that women first are reduced to primal vengeance and jealousy by all this ""penetration"" and those responsible for it, and then, inevitably are destroyed by it. Hmmm.<br/><br/>So, feminists and post-feminists take warning. Or maybe this film proves your point, I don't know. Still...really a fantastic horror film."

","I enjoyed this movie about six gals mainly from England going caving. The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish. The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident. She was apparently an extreme sports junkie, but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones. Now, however, she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving, girls only. They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills, however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered...and what the girls discover there is sheer terror. This movie was very effective, even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense. There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place, a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg. I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh. So there ya go, finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out. It is not all good though, I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support. Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty. Wait and try to get out then settle differences. Still this horror movie was really good and tense."

","Actually, I think this was one of the better horror movies in the past several years. Recent films like the French ""Haute Tension"", the Australian ""Wolf Creek"" and the American ""Saw"" have all been decent, but they conjure up images of other, better horror films - i.e. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Psycho (1960) and ""Last House on the Left"". ""The Descent"" manages to be highly original while paying homage to ""Deliverance"", especially. The story revolves around a group of thrill-seeking women. Apparently, they get together every year for a new adventure. As the film opens, three of the women are white-water rafting. In the opening ten minutes, we learn a) that these ladies are serious about adventure, b) one of them is having an affair with the other's husband, and c) a horrific accident will prove extremely important to the rest of the film. Skip to next year and now there are six women and the adventure is spelunking. Juno, the leader of these women warriors, has decided to take the ladies into a cave system. None of the women are overly experienced in caving, but they like their chances initially. What follows is some extremely claustrophobic and tense action (and this is before the Crawlers even show up!). The darkness is cloying, but the viewer still can tell what's happening. As the ladies descend further into the cave system, they slowly realize that all is not what it seems. Juno's ego becomes too big for the group and panic ensues. After this, all bets are off and the action is nonstop and pretty damn scary. I've seen (and own) a lot of horror films and I'm happy to say that this has been added to that canon for repeat viewings.

","This was an excellent movie in my opinion.First lets say there are a few errors in production,but if you are paying attention to the story line,and the actors,you wont notice.<br/><br/>This is an all female cast,but don't be fooled a couple of the ladies in here are bad asses.The lighting in this movie is very freaky,its hard to see whats going on sometimes,and I think that is the appeal.The creatures are very fast,and agile...and gross!<br/><br/>I think these actresses pulled this off wonderfully,they seemed to behave just as anyone would in the same situation.The acting flowed seamlessly and even.I love watching movies,and if I could make a career out of it I would,and therefore I notice when an actor isn't putting in 100% and lately its hard to find a horror movie where the actor is giving their all.Trust me,these ladies give 110% the whole way through.<br/><br/>I think the caves were very realistic and scary,and dangerous.Not a whole lot of computer animation,if any,but the movie didn't seem to need it at all.Its so fast paced you don't realize that hour and a half went by.<br/><br/>I only voted this movie an 8 because of the ending.I was very disappointed in the ending,although you will never see it coming.All and All this movie rocks seriously,just the ending isn't the greatest in the world.But then again,how many other movies have you watched that had you all the way to the end and then blew it? Quite a few I'm sure.The ending doesn't blow the movie at all,but it will disappoint.If it weren't for the ending,this movie would have gotten my full approval at a ten!!<br/><br/>Its definitely worth watching however,if only to see what the good actresses are supposed to do in a horror!"
"Horror_Fan01","8","1","3","25 February 2007"," The Descent pulls you down into a dark nightmare and doesn't let you come up for air until the end-credits roll.
","Once the six women rappel down into a completely isolated, totally unexplored network of dark caves deep the in the Appalachian mountains, their fates are sealed. I was not a huge fan of Neil Marshall's first film, Dog Soldiers (then again, I saw it on the Sci-Fi Channel, very cut down), so when I heard so many good things about The Descent, I was leery. I was afraid it was another Blair Witch Project. Or 28 Days Later. (Both over-hyped disappointments, in my opinion.) Having seen The Descent (and having to take two ibuprofens afterward to soothe my tensed muscles), I tremblingly tip my miner's hat to Marshall. Not much affects this lifelong horror fan, but The Descent is by far the most frightening film I have seen in years. (Note to other chiller fans: You'll get some extra tidbity treats in the form of homages to scary movies of yore, such as Carrie and Aliens.) It's deep  in more ways than one; The Descent is very smartly written flick. Ever since The Descent was released in England last year, the buzz has been deafening and the bootleg DVDs have been burning - But do see it on the big screen; it's more effective in a large setting as the screams, snapping bones, and freely flowing blood come fast and furious. For once, the movie is worthy of the hype: The Descent pulls you down into a dark nightmare and doesn't let you come up for air until the end-credits roll."
"socrates99","9","1","3","6 February 2007"," The first movie to convince me that women can go full-tilt into action
","The six women in this film are so believable in their roles that I was completely drawn into the story. For me, that's the most impressive thing about this cautionary tale. Very few actresses seem to have any affinity to real adventure. Starbuck in 'Battlestar Galactica' is one of those exceptions. But somehow this movie's producers managed to get together a terrific group of very watchable, and completely genuine, women friends so that an action junkie like me actually felt that the movie was better off being all female. I'm not sure why, but I'm very surprised.<br/><br/>Next in impressiveness would be the direction which somehow conveyed the experience of being in a cave so well that I was reminded of long ago experiences I hadn't thought of in a long time. If you've ever been alone in a cave, you'll find this movie dead on and extremely skilled in taking you back. There's a very refined sense of horror that I appreciated a great deal. This is no-holds-barred film making at its best and for my money deserved far more recognition all the way around than it got. I'm looking forward to Neil Marshall's next directorial outing 'Doomsday'."
"animesurreal","Null","1","3","30 January 2007"," Good for lovers of graphical violence, but the plot is lack of originality.
","This movie was recommended to me by many, but I was disappointed after watching it. Seriously, I do not understand how this movie got a 7.4 out of 10. Well, what I say might be a spoiler to you, but be assured that none of the plots will be revealed. However, I may give you some insights to the theme of the movie. Also, keep in might that I maybe biased because I have very high expectation for horror movies simply because ""things that defies logic"" won't scare me a bit. <br/><br/>The Good: This would a good movie for you if you enjoy watching graphical violence for a whole 40+ minutes. As the story unfolds, I get a feeling that this movie is trying to reveal the ""hidden"" dark side of human nature. Whenever we are in a desperate situation, friendship and ""brotherhood (or sisterhood?)"" breaks down and survival takes the lead. Then, there are the monsters, and this reminds me of ""Journey to the Center of the World,"" which is a good idea for a horror movie. If you enjoy that type of adventure/horror movie, you'll probably enjoy this one. <br/><br/>The Bad: However, I felt that this movie failed to illustrate anything well enough for me to ""get it"". It just ended up being everyone fighting everyone else, and of course, battling the ""monsters"" as well. I did not feel a bit terrified by this movie because everything just ended up being incoherent and therefore, seemed that the director just wanted to ""get it over."" And because of the simplicity of the story, I literally figured out what was going to happen next after 30 min. If you wants to see a movie that truly reveals the dark side of human nature, watch ""Cabin Fever."" At least something like that could happen in reality.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A good movie for high school kids (but was this one rated R?)"

This movie i do not recommend for children under 14. Cause it is very scary. I had to cover up with the blanket during most of the movie. But it was awesome!! If you get scared easily from freaky looking things, lots of blood, and things popping out at you, this may not be the right movie for you. But if you do. This is the best movie you could ever possibly see!!! In recommend it big time. Real thriller, and i love the fact that you feel like you're actually there. :) Awesome movie! They did a great job making it! I would like to see more."
"miniboo","8","1","3","28 January 2007"," Refreshingly Horrific
","It was such a pleasure to watch a horror film with some originality. I thought the characters were great and the plot was interesting. The movie has sparked some debate between my friends and I on whether the creatures were vampires and Sarah was turned during the blood bath scene. Or maybe the violent deaths of Sarah's friends was just a traumatized hallucination (there was a shot of Sarah's pills on the nightstand before they all left the cabin for the cave dive which she neglected to take). I heartily recommend the movie to anyone looking to break up the monotony of the steady dose of boring comedies and dramas pouring out of Hollywood."
"drfraud-1","8","1","3","18 January 2007"," Six chicks go caving
","This is by far one of the more amusing horror movies that came out in the past few years. It delivers a good performance by all actors, involves good drama and interesting horror techniques. <br/><br/>When the horror drama picks up, we are amused with interesting claustrophobic shots and tons of unexpected scenes, as well as gallons and gallons of fake blood. Although most of the scenes are too dark to appreciate the gore, the sound effects create a necessary mood for most of the setting. <br/><br/>Unlike the other cave movie of 2005 (ironically entitled The Cave), none of the character pretends to be something else. There are no sonar devices or million dollar equipment. It is simple and beautiful. Six girls go on a caving adventure with nothing more but the basic spelunking equipment. The idea and the premise is the same in both movies, but the simplicity of The Descent makes it a much better flick than The Cave. <br/><br/>There are few shortcomings to this movie that could have made it a lot better: For one, the relationship between characters is not very well established. In most cases, you have to guess who is who and how they know each other and whether they are related at all. The protagonist's tragedy in the beginning of the movie seems to be absolutely pointless. It does not add anything to the storyline and seems like if taken out of a context, could have made a good movie on its own. The idea does revisit us throughout the movie, but it looks like it was added after the movie has been made just to add some footage time. Although there is an obvious conflict between the main character and her best friend, we have to guess as to what exactly it is until the final climax, which is not explained well either. Finally, the storyline takes too long unwrap; almost an hour is literally wasted on chick flickery which is sort of a waste. We are in a sense prepared for the horror to come and are kept on the edge with constant boo effects, but after an hour of these, a viewer might get a bit bored.<br/><br/>8/10"
"nafifield","9","1","3","16 January 2007"," Surprisingly very good.
","I didn't see this movie in theaters because I didn't think it was going to be very special. Much to my surprise it was my favorite horror movie of the year. It is not like ""The Cave"" like many people relate it to. The acting was quite good, the scares were perfectly placed, and the movie actually scared you. The lack of male characters didn't hurt the movie, it helped it. The movie is about 6 girlfriends who decide to explore some cave, After the opening scene the movie slows down, and if you can get by that until the women are actually in the cave and the creepiness begins, you'll be in for a non-stop thrill ride. The director wisely did not include the usual T&A that comes with these types of films. Instead focusing on scaring the audience with the real terrifying aspects of claustrophobia and helplessness. The Gore is absolutely sickening and actually is so not over the top its believable. This is definitely not for the squeamish. I really enjoyed it and if you're a movie viewer who likes a good scary gore fest that isn't cheesy, I would highly recommend this British import."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","1","3","15 January 2007"," extraordinarily terrifying...with that said, there are problems
","Remember, this film came out in two different years (2005 in the UK, 2006 in the USA) so it can be categorized in two years. The Descent is the best horror film of 2005, but Saw III out does it in 2006. However, it does take the cake as the scariest of both years. The horror within this film is excellently displayed, and the only reason Saw III was the better film in my opinion was because it had a story filled with twists and was near unpredictable. The Descent is a straightforward story about 6 friends who, a year after one (Shauna MacDonald) lost her husband and daughter in a car crash, decide the best way to bond is to go cave diving. I know, that's the last thing any normal person would do to 'bond'. Soon after they enter the cave, they realize that this cave is special in a way that one of the other friends (Natalie Mendoza) conveniently forgot to mention, and that they are not alone.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall cements his place amongst the great horror directors with this film, and as you're watching, you'll see why. Marshall teases us with typical jumpy clichés before unleashing everyone's worst nightmare upon the audience: claustrophobia. If you are claustrophobic, you may become sickeningly scared by this film. This is the type of horror film that makes you jump and will make you look away. The gore is, at times, very difficult to watch. Marshall was so intent on scaring us half to death (which he does) that he forgot to actually write a good film. The plot is straightforward and predictable, and the ending will leave much to be desired. Some will like it, but most will be left clueless and upset at the ending. The characters seem to be, well, not really characters at all, as none of them besides Mendoza's character actually develop, even though MacDonald's character has an interesting backstory. Marshall's writing tries to establish something for each of them, but in the end it doesn't work and what you have is 6 people we don't like or identify with fighting for survival. The mood of the film is also a strength. You will not laugh at all in the film, like you're tempted to in other horror films. You won't even feel an urge to laugh. The music and lighting (I know, lighting sounds unimportant, but in a film like this, it's everything) are top notch. Marshall's cave is just scary itself. He is the real star of the film, not the actors. Due to the extreme graphic and relentless horror of the film, I recommend this film to anyone ages 17 and up. The direction and scare factor get a 10 from me, while the writing gets a 4, giving the film an overall rating of 7, which I believe is a good enough. The Descent is a very scary movie that suffers from the inadequacy of its script.<br/><br/>7/10 --spy"
"nightmarescalling","4","1","3","15 January 2007"," The Descent - A Let Down
","When I heard of this movie and it's similar plot competitor, I figured I'd check this one out because it was the highest rated of the two. When I rented this, I was disappointed to say the least.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good of this movie. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting of the girls. It was top notch and made me believe that they were truly in a life-threatening crisis. The mental strain and the way they played it out was completely believable.<br/><br/>But good acting cannot save a poor storyline. I'll skip past the beginning parts because they were okay. When the breed of monster finally appeared, I laughed because it reminded me of C.H.U.D. meets Resident Evil. The way the monster moved, attacked, everything made it a laughable experience.<br/><br/>To sum up, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they scare easily and are looking for a cheap fright-fest."
"AnthonyGODugan","8","1","3","10 January 2007"," Scary, especially in a dark basement
","Potential SPOILER ALERT: The ""unspeakable horror"" First, I just watched this movie yesterday (1/9/07), so I have already seen the Justin Timberlake SNL skit where he and his crew of rappers are trapped in a cave (the same show with the D!ck in a box skit). Obviously, the skit is a spoof on the movie, but the SNL creatures were spot on. Nevertheless, the movie was still scary despite the humorous reference.<br/><br/>Keep in mind: One: ""say sausage!"" Two: ""I say we do how we do, yoK-smoove, lay down a beat."" Three: see if you notice a theme in horror/thriller movies where the first scare comes at about 14 minutes and 14 seconds. You know it's there, waiting, and it's going to be a cat in an alley or a plastic bag caught in some branches, but it always scares the crap out of you.<br/><br/>Overall, a good horror movie. If you think of horror movies the same way I dohow would I avoid this monster in real life, if it was real, of coursethen my suggestion is stay away from caves. I mean, crawling into tiny black holes is the first in a long list of potential psychological disorders. Also, isn't cave water typically freezing? These ladies don't shiver after falling into the water. And where did the creatures get underpants? True masters of their domain, indeed."
"siobhansmith-3","9","1","3","8 January 2007"," good film
","This was one of the best horror films that I have seen in a long time, and I absolutely LOVE horror films. The plot, while unrealistic, was fun. If you saw the American version however, you got ripped off. Buy the Uncut version on DVD and watch it, it makes the movie so much better. I thought this movie was excellent. I admit, at times it was a little hokey and the ""crawlers"" are not realistic at all but come on, what movies are realistic anymore? Isn't that the fun of movies? Being able to see something that could never really happen? For all of you people who knocked this movie for the ""cliche"" monsters, get over it, it's all about imagination. Who cares if the crawlers are not scientifically correct, you have probably enjoyed other horror films that have unrealistic events in them. Take ""The Shining"" for example, that is a wonderful horror film but so unrealistic. If you want to see this movie though, I would strongly suggest seeing the ""uncut"" version as the ending makes the movie that much better!"
"rralawrence2003","9","1","3","8 January 2007"," Finally!
","Please note that this is a review of the unrated director's cut, rather than the US theatrical version, which cuts a part of the movie that significantly changes the tone, and ultimately, weakens the emotional impact.<br/><br/>It's very sad that American horror has fallen to the level of ""See No Evil,"" ""The Cave"" and ""Saw,"" especially when the Brits bring out a superior horror movie with ""The Descent."" The six unlucky spelunkers are not stock clichés, but rather are played as full human beings, which makes the tragedy hit hard. Claustrophobic and creepy, and quite gory as well, one of the best horror movies of the past several years. I can't wait to see what this director brings us next."
"my-dog2","9","1","3","7 January 2007"," Executes suspension, tension and primal fear very effectively
","I never got to see this in theaters, but I'm sure if I had, the audience would've been very into it. It's a sort of movie that not only demands, but is able to get an honest knee-jerk reaction from viewers.<br/><br/>It grabs hold of you as soon as the six unfortunate women enter the dark hole that is the entrance of the cave. For the first half of the movie itself, a buildup of suspense and tension grips you fiercely. Even before the creature/action scenes commence, you can't keep your eyes off the screen. The feelings of claustrophobia and the darkness are well executed. Once the creatures start to appear, it's all over. There's no way you can miss even a second of what's going on. The music in the background adds perfectly to what's happening, being thundering and pulse-pounding one moment, low key yet still ominous the next. The usage of color and lighting makes the atmosphere even more compelling, with the setting and actresses bathed in bright red, green, and blue light. There's no peeling your eyes from the screen until the very end.<br/><br/>My only issue (however small it is) is that I usually find extremely minimal usage of creatures is more effective. You find with a movie like Signs, that when you see too much, it starts losing its edge. Though that may be, the creatures were realistic and not too out there for this kind of movie, and I suppose the number of creature sightings in the film can't be helped. Overall, I was thoroughly pleased and spooked by the end. Well recommended."
"Movienator","8","1","3","5 January 2007"," Into the Depths of the Earth and the Human Spirit
","The Descent takes the viewer down into the depths of the earth and the human spirit via the vehicle of a group of six female cavers/adventurers. The bond between these women have been seriously damaged due to a tragic incident that occurs to one of them during a rafting trip that we see immediately at the beginning of the film. The others, led by one determined woman for reasons of her own, put together another adventure as a means of reforging the bonds between the group. The civility of normal life leads to a good start as the group has a carefree night in a cabin drinking and laughing on pedestrian matters such as one's silly pajamas. But even here, some disturbing portents begin to show. This skin deep camaraderie continues until they start their descent down into an uncharted cave as stresses begin to creep to the fore. The strains manifest themselves even more when an unexpected earth tremor strikes the area sealing the women off from their entry path into the cave. As the situation worsens with the introduction of unexpected underground elements, we see the women descending further and further into the depths of the earth and their own despair with gory consequences. This movie is part Deliverance, one of the director's favorite films, and part 50's grade B monster flick with the two being melded together into a fine film alloy. Highly worth seeing, especially the darker UK version on the DVD release."

","Before I watched the film, I didn't expect much out of it and guessed that it would be one of those clichéd unknown-monster-attacks-and-kills-everyone horror movies. And I guess it was true to a certain extent. Even though I have never been a fan of horror films, because I think they are dumb and have never been frightened by any ghost film since I hit maturity, I was disturbed by The Descent(in a good way).<br/><br/>The reason why I was terrified of The Descent was because it showed me that the most dangerous creatures wasn't the creatures in the cave but the explorers themselves. None of the explorer's were sadistic evil people. They are normal people just like us. But due to the circumstances and incidents that they experienced, the dark nature within them was brought out. The degradation of the characters' sanity led to an horrific conclusion. Which is also why I think the biggest flaw and the biggest strength of the movie are the characters. While the main focus of the cast was clad on two people, the others were vaguely boring. They were interesting but not developed well enough.<br/><br/>This film is a must for those who enjoy watching Man's subtle dark side and horror fans alike."

","Good actors + Creepy Horror Creatures + an Entire Movie Not being able to see anything = LOUSY MOVIE The acting was good and the idea that a group of women would go out an do some adventure caving is wonderful. But when every camera angle is showing the lights on the helmets instead of showing what the lights illuminates, its too much work.<br/><br/>What could have really made this movie great would have been a period of time (like the beginning of the cave scenes) where we got some really tight light play in those small passages that each girl passed through one at a time. Then the rest of the caves could be illuminated partially citing light bouncing off all the light sources of the girls. Then I wouldn't have had to ask every time, ""What is she doing?"" The other thing, depending on which ending you saw, is our MC gets stuck down in the cave after waking up from ""dreaming"" her escape. The problem is that I was more excited to think that this girl was about to reveal to the world that there was another ""humanish"" species living in this cave. Instead,to the rest of the world, they are just a case of disappearing women.<br/><br/>The intentions were good for this movie--better than most horror flicks, but I lost my patience with the lighting thing. I can only look at a screen that is mostly black for so long, and it is as equally frustrating when what is illuminated is barely comprehensible for minutes at a time."

","""The Descent"" is the story of a group of adventure seeking young women who choose to go caving, but are unprepared, in more ways than one, for what they find in the dark depths below the Appalachian Mountains. The film is like a heady mixture of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", and H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear"".<br/><br/>The film is terrifying in a way that most films of the genre strive for, but fail to achieve. Many horror films rely only on often predictable sudden starts to convey their scares, while others rely mostly on gruesome imagery (and some sadly on neither). ""The Descent"", however, melds the two in a way seldom seen.<br/><br/>But, ""The Descent"" is more than just a scare-the-Hell-out-of-you thrill ride; it is also an exploration into the limits of the human psyche. The ""Descent"" in this movie is both a literal one and a metaphoric one, and that's what makes it a cut above (or should I say below) most horror flicks."

Some will spit of the fact that the movie takes a while to begin unwinding, but without the long ""assembling of the situation"", a viewer would not care as much. Not enough to actually follow the movie anyway.<br/><br/>See, the long beginning is perfect since the second half of the movie takes place in low-lit, red and greenish almost undecipherable sets.

At some point, I even though one of the chicks might get to communicate or reason with one (Now this doesn't happen, and I'm happy I predicted wrong... this means the movie's plot wasn't very easy to predict) Additionally, I think the director did great by using the UK ending (the one where Sarah wakes up only to realize her relieving escape from the cave was only a dream) on the DVD version. This made me extremely frustrated and I actually complimented the director out-loud at the rolling credits by saying ""You cunning, clever bastards!"" Heartbeat; 165, sweat; about two liters, cigarettes; about 11 (yea, I smoke a lot when I get stressed) - This movie truly deserves this eight to the point where an eight point five would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>This movie film make me very thrilled and excite.

Other than that, nothing struck me as humorous in any way.<br/><br/>The scene where the tunnel starts to collapse shook me a bit. I'm not really claustrophobic, but I swear I felt a bit of panic watching that.<br/><br/>The creatures were excellent. They were thoroughly threatening and single-minded: ""kill-eat-protect the community"" was all they knew. As horrific as their behavior was, they reminded me of the Morlocks in H.G. Wells's novel ""The Time Machine"": not truly evil, merely the products of biological evolution catering to adaptation to the environment.<br/><br/>The film has some of the finest production values I've ever seen. From the choice of actors to the monster makeup to the use of green-screen projection and the (few) solid sets, it all came together.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't like the ending, which taken at face-value was a complete downer. I wanted to have at least one of the party succeed, but then again, life itself very frequently hands us a bad hand."

","A group of friends out on vacation in the United States face what hides in remote cave deep within the mountains of rural North Carolina. While not a big budget film in anyway and lacking any major stars on this side of the Atlantic, The Descent manages to give a good horror film through suspension and not special effects or lots of blood as most American horror focus on.<br/><br/>Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald) lost her family a year ago due to a tragic accident. In an attempt to find healing, she agrees to a vacation in the states with friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (Myanna Burning), and Holly (Nora-Jane No one). A group of experienced outdoors women, a trip in the mountains is something that should be without too much challenge or difficulty. Indeed, there is little to give warning for the terror they are about to face in the depths of the earth. <br/><br/>What makes The Desecent so good is that there really is little to it. Most of the film consists of Sarah and the others crawling through small caverns and roping over and down rock walls. When they do come face to face with the horror of the cave (troll like creatures), the movie consists with more crawling through caverns, falling into water pools, and/or being torn apart. A simple plot which actually works because The Descent demands really little from the story itself to give suspense. The suspense centers around the darkness that constantly surrounds them and the feeling that the deeper the go within in the earth, the more they are certain to face death. It was as if the cave itself was the main part of the script and everything else was written around it with that idea in mind. <br/><br/>Another positive was the actresses themselves. While none are major stars or even well known in the US, each held to their part. Again, it shows that a good movie doesn't need major stars to promise a good story. That Hollywood misses this so often says something more about the industry than those who write stories. Star power, in most cases, it what most movie center around and it as interesting to see one good movie where this was not the case.<br/><br/>If there is one complaint to be made its that the ending left more to be desired. While it is expected that none of them would escape, the movie could have been given more of a solid ending. The discovery that Juno was having an affair with Sarah's husband before his death was rather obvious but did little for the story overall because we really don't know much about it before the end. It would have been good to know more of the background of this relationship if the director and writer wanted it to be a more important conflict between Sarah and Juno.<br/><br/>A good movie if one wants a quick scare and a good example of how a horror movie should be made. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Descent is about a group of adrenalin addicted UK women who take a caving trip to hillbilly country in the USA. They start out the caving after a wild night of partying and everything seems to go just fine until there is a cave in that blocks the entrance. Then they find out they are in a cave no one has been in before. As they try and find another way out, they find they are not alone in the cave system. The humanoid inhabitants seem to have been in the cave for a very long time. And they are not vegetarians or mushroom eaters. The film is spent with the women kicking cave dweller ass while looking for an other way out. One of the women lost a child and husband at the beginning of the film, but that didn't seem to take a very prominent role in the film. They could have done without that part. Technically a good and exciting film with a relatively short intro to the characters. A nice film to watch in the dark with a large bowl of popcorn."

","I was really creaped out by this movie. It was so much better than I expected. The plot is believable, it could happen. More important than the basic plot though, was the interaction between the characters, the sub plots. The way characters relate to each other, in most horror or action movies these days, is not given enough thought. And so you end up not caring who the ""make believe"" people are and not caring if they live or die. I fealt that these women had real relationships, not like they just met a day ago to film this. I could tell things about them by the way they spoke to each other. The dialog was very well done, very mature, and very well thought out. The fight scenes were filmed in a way that kept me trying to focus and feeling like I was in the fight myself. The use of color and makeup and costumes, and of course the boogey men, was all really well done. I highly recommend this one."

","This is hands down one of the best horror movies made in the past quarter century. What passes for horror currently is nothing more than cheap scares and gross torture. This movie was relate able to aliens, in the ominous stalking of the cast. The play on human fear of tight spaces makes it almost hard to breathe, it's so good that every horror movie director should watch this until their heads explode. Best of all, it doesn't try to stretch itself out into something it's not.

","This is, in my opinion, an incredibly spooky and scary movie. I knew very little about it going into it, and the first thing I noticed was the all-female cast. Don't expect stereotypical women from this flick, these characters are all tougher than a lot of men I know. Despite the initial scene, halfway through I started to think it would be a bore, but it quickly picked up thereafter. It had me squirming in either anticipation or disgust all the way to the credits; it was rather bloody. The performances were all top notch. An explanation of what they are encountering is nearly nonexistent, so for that it loses only a point - since I could hardly fathom a plausible explanation for them myself, or a place to put it in the story without making it cheesy. I give credit to the cinematographers for making what they could out of such horrible lighting conditions. And although it was very difficult to figure out what was going on at times, it becomes clear soon enough, or it didn't matter anyways. I thought the spook factor for this movie was high; this is one of the scariest movies I have seen, if not THE scariest. A definite must-see."

","I walked into this movie expecting something almost entirely predictable and just a movie to pass my time. But I was able to apply very little suspended disbelief and really enjoy this movie. Even though the director involved me throughout the whole movie and almost convince me this kind of movie was possible, I have only minimal criticism for this movie.<br/><br/>The few unanswered questions the movie allows the viewer to have allows for a predictable and satisfying speculation afterward. Maybe a sequel might help quell these minor ""flaws"". But what was done was enough to satisfy me with only one movie made. But then again, I am a person to wonder ""what if"". Maybe if only Juno had a fighting chance at the end for her life, allowing for a slightly more peaceful ending. Or was it a point of the movie for this movie to end the way it did?"

If you are into GOOD horror, unlike crap such as the FOG(remake), then go see this ASAP. An all female cast pull off this awesome follow up to Dog Soldiers. It has a similar feel to it, but with a lot less humour than Dog Soldiers. I don't know why, but I feel the poms do movies better than the yanks, they just seem to have a more realistic, better feel to them. After excellent character building, this movie all of a sudden kicks in big time at about the half way mark, and then doesn't let up until the final scene, with an excellent ending.

"Drusilla1235","9","1","3","10 November 2006"," ""Good Girl""
","I found myself whispering to myself ""good girl"", whenever Sarah or Juno, kicked, punched, stabbed, or bludgeoned a ""crawler"". Okay ""crawler's"" are the creature's in the depth's of the murky and dirty caves. They eat people, pretty simple plot, they eat whoever have ventured or has descended down into their habitat. But what is so genius about this plot? Is it the diverse group of female character's that ventures down into the caves? Is it the tragic back story behind one of them? Is it the fact that, with these six girls, anyone is game (like to be mutilated by these fierce creatures)? No it is the impending doom, upon the discovery of these creatures. The claustrophobic tunnels of the murky caves, as the women, scrape their bodies, against the rugged rock, trying to survive, the already treacherous adventure. I honestly believe this movie would have had the same thrilling aspects had the ""crawlers"", not come into play, it probably would have had a larger audience for it. But it didn't, and I am happy that it kept the ""crawlers"". The reason I gave this a nine, is because of the acting and the diolougue, some of it is choppy and some of the lines aren't delivered perfectly. But I doubt anyone would really notice it, considering the being scared and all. This movie provides a few ""jump scenes"", but doesn't have any disturbing long term affects, which I don't mind. But the true meaning of this movie, lies within the plot, this movie screams feminism, but what horror movie doesn't? This one is just upfront about it, and you identify with the characters. When Sarah's bloody fist smashes through the outer surface of the intertwined roots, revealing a bluish, greenish, wood and mountain like area, it was truly and deeply refreshing. When she screams with a warrior's triumph, you want to scream with her, as if you have been standing along side of her. Well that was me, screaming for the feminist triumph, I am sure other's were screaming for other reasons, which they did, in fact the audience around me, screamed more then the heroine's. Good but not great horror movie. Definitely worth a ticket, and a DVD purchase or rental."

","So, I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone around me enjoyed it as well. I couldn't come up with anything that would make me say ""Don't go see it"" unless people don't like blood and guts getting ripped out of young chicks. I thought this was well put together, they made you like the cast, grow attached, and force you to watch them get dismembered by nasty monsters. How is that not good? The director did a great job in putting the cave chicks into a position where they had to kill or be killed, which normally happened in the latter. The cave creatures were great as well, nasty looking, slimy, fast, and killed with no remorse for whomever was around. They had one motive, EAT!!!! Not many movies make me sad when some of the characters die. This made me root all the way for the good guys when normally I laugh at every time someone else gets devoured. Anyways, I can't wait until this comes out on DVD. If you liked this movie you probably would also like 28 Days Later and Dog Soldiers. Both were European horror flicks that also enjoy splattered guts."

","I've just saw this movie. I was like wow.. It was kick-@$$. I have to agree with one of the reviewer comments written. There are scenes in this movie for over some long periods of time that make you feel a bit smothered and closed in gasping for air. I also this Juno was judged very unfairly towards the end of the film. I think both girls should have made it out and resolved differences after encountering safe grounds. After all It was Juno who didn't wish to leave until she found Sarah. The other were going to leave her for dead and look how Sarah repays her. Juno didn't even get a chance to explain that it was an accident, with all the craziness happening, there really wasn't much time to talk and I can believe she was still shaken by the events and had to bury the guilt of killing her own friend. That part where the really injured friend still living and snitching. on Juno to turn Sarah against her sucked. She ran up on her after she had just killed two of them hungry bastards. I would have stabbed your ass too.. Anyways, what kind of friends are they for leaving Juno while she was battling those things trying to protect her slain friend's dead body? The Juno's ghost thing at the end kind of sucked also. The timing was too soon. I would have rather seen a mauled Juno barely escaping the flesh-eaters and making it back to the other jeep just to seek revenge on Sarah. She could have crushed her head while she was puking out the window. Oh well, overall still an interestingly good film. Dvds? Anyone?- Avri."
"azderoth","8","1","3","8 October 2006"," A darkness within and below
","The Descent proves to me that the idea, or subject, of a movie doesn't always have to be interesting in itself. Sometimes it is the presentation that matters. Quite simply The Descent is about some women who go into a cave. Hijinks soon follow. The A.P.W. (read: All Powerful Writer) is tempted to say that The Descent is nothing original--that the A.P.W has seen movies like it before, years ago, when scary movies weren't afraid to show consequence and a good fright for a fear of appearing ""unsophisticated"". But it is this return to basic scare tactics that makes The Descent work. The director uses misdirection, develops characters, shocks, and unfolds events like a pro. The creatures too (I thought of them as subhumanoids) are well constructed--even if couldn't believe that they were unaware of fire, or heavy breathing, on a few occasions. The A.P.W. also had a little difficulty believing that a character could throw a dangerous tool with such lethality in a cave with zero visibility.<br/><br/>But these leaps of cinematic logic are, in a way, what keep this movie entertaining. The director, Neil Marshall, knows when to push the movie into more excessively stylistic territory without making it seem forced. In the end The Descent is an excellent movie, if somewhat unoriginal."
"michael-hanlon","Null","1","3","22 August 2006"," Lovely horror film, but ...
","Hats off for an unusual, genuinely scary piece of gore. But there are some serious inconsistencies. OK, the 2-endings shenanigans means all sorts of interpretations are up for grabs, but there are more practical problems as well. If these mutant-things are supposed to be real, and not a figment of Sarah's imagination, then what do they eat? The suggestion is that they come out of their cave at night and hunt deer and things. But how? They are blind. Blind creatures like that would make terrible hunters. You can get away with sonar if you are a bat and eat insects, but an elk would just spot them a mile off then have a good laugh as the mutants ran around bumping into trees. We saw that they weren't terribly good at hunting even in their own element ... lightly-armed (and terrified) people were perfectly capable of killing them with minimal bother. As monsters they were, frankly, a bit rubbish. But a good film nonetheless."
"sdkfz1822002","8","1","3","18 August 2006"," Tense and claustrophobic
","A bit linear, but for what it's supposed to do (horror/terrror) it succeeds. The realistic, minimal lighting (unlike ""The Cave"" or other films where ambient light always seems to come from ""somewhere""- much like guns with the never-ending clips) makes this movie uncomfortable for those with claustrophobia. The gore was first-rate and made more believable by the realistic environment the filmmakers established (unlike the Friday 13th fare). A few things at the end were a bit unrealistic (from a physics and evolutionary standpoint), but the fast pace (minus a slow beginning that didn't quite develop the characters for me to relate to them individually) makes it an original horror movie to see."
"siderite","8","1","3","18 August 2006"," A rather good horror movie
","As horror movies go, this is a chick movie. Nah, I am joking, but the cast is entirely female. The few unfortunate males that try to act in this script are quickly killed in a brutal way. And as horror movies go, I will rate it as high. The director, also known for Dog Soldiers or 28 Days, has a feel for tense situations and the extreme way in which people react when faced with unpredictable danger.<br/><br/>Now, if you've read most other comments, you would have understood that this is not a cliché movie. Wrong! It follows a very known horror recipe: closed environment in which a team of people face danger and die one after the other until the twist comes. The problem with most movies of this sort is that you never understand why strong military types or world renowned scientists completely collapse mentally when faced with animals or monsters or whatever, neither do they explain the maddened kill frenzy that usually ensues when the stress gets high enough. Well, this movie solves the problem: the entire cast is female! :)<br/><br/>The strange predators are also cool and the fact that everything happens inside a cave makes it truly scary and disconcerting. But what is a cave without claustrophobia, rheumatism and a few trolls, right? Go see it."

","Went to go see the movie based on the ""excellent"" reviews. I completely disagree.<br/><br/>It is a run of the mill, cliché horror flick. Average in almost every way.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT There was almost no character development. There are a few cookie-cutter set ups: ""the brash one"", ""the scarred for life one"" etc... But I couldn't get attached to any of them as viable living, breathing people. They just threw them all in a bag together and said ""tada a cast!"" Were they all English? Juno went in and out of accents, it didn't seem right. The acting was so/so.<br/><br/>The ""Gollums"" were unoriginal. Rather boring antagonists. So they are perfectly evolved cave dwelling morlocks, but they'll walk over a human if they can't hear them? How do they find the one's they've already killed? They sure aren't making noise. If they have an acute sense of smell and hearing, why can't they find a girl who's heart is beating 160 and is covered with blood? The suspense gets old real fast. If you've seen even a few suspense/horror flicks, you know the old ""it's clear...see...really...even though the music track went high then stopped"" thing. It's used for every single part of the movie. And the wonderfully overused ""is he dead"" trick. Like a broken record.<br/><br/>And then the end. I haven't seen BOTH endings, but the one I saw was horrible. AGAIN if you haven't seen it, and think the sub-par, non-cult mass monster movie thing is cool, no matter the quality, DON'T READ THIS. So when Sarah kills Juno, who just accidentally killed her friend, reappears in her car...Why? Is she crazy? Is it a ghost? A zombie? WHY WAS THAT ADDED? It just seems like a cheap ending. Or a writer who ran out of horrible ideas and asked a friend how to end the movie. ""um, dead friend comes back from the dead?"" Only way it could have been worse is the Cave monsters hot-wire the left behind BMW and go on a high speed chase after her.<br/><br/>Ugh."

","My girlfriend took me to this movie, as I am not a big horror movie guy. Let me tell you it was one of the best scary movies I have ever seen. What was interesting is that it was a very simple concept that was (I thought) executed to near perfection. No big stars to distract you, great locations, and fantastic camera work. The pacing was done so well, I might have thought it was edited by Chris Nolan or M. Shyamalan. There was a double element of horror in this movie as not only were the crawlers very freaky, but the descent into the cave was enough to almost unnerve me. There was truly a sense of no hope and inevitable doom through most of the movie. Aside from elements that are always lacking in scary movies (this one is no different), I thought it was a fantastic flick that most horror fans should not miss."

","The poster lists this movie as the suspense successor to Alien and for once, I can agree with the hype. While horror/suspense movies are generally a genre that requires me to be in the right frame of mind to truly enjoy, I can remember the first time I saw Aliens and was fully on the edge of my seat. The kind of edginess that is independent of who is with you or where you are; the gasps and jumps are involuntary. But once the movie is seen once, the surprise and suspense are lost and another title must be found to replace the same feeling. This is one of them. The Descent offers a slow build-up, introducing the characters who are believable as friends and anonymously unknown to the North American audience so no preconceived opinions of who will make it out and who is wearing the Star Trek ""red shirt"". While character development is minimal, there is nonetheless a developing tension within the characters that builds to a tragic and rather original conclusion. CG effect monsters are replaced with traditional makeup and gore that present a visceral, real (and probably, given the situations probably realistic) depiction of the atrocities that ensue. My only criticism is for the first half of the movie, some of the characters are difficult to distinguish from, as costumes and hair are similar the inevitable culling commences."

I won't write any spoilers, but I will say that this movie was put together very well and I don't think movie goers will be disappointed. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie and it made me jump several times. The actresses in this film did a very good job.

And, more importantly, they behave in a somewhat rational manner. There's no bimbos checking out ""mystery sounds"", all alone, clad only in bikinis. It's tough chicks in for the fight of their lives.<br/><br/>The movie does an admirable job of conveying a sense of claustrophobia and urgency in the beginning. To be honest, I thought the lead-up to the ""introduction"" of the creatures was quite a bit creepier than the creatures themselves. As a matter of fact, once the creatures make their presence known, the movie does tend to devolve into more traditional slasher fare.<br/><br/>But, in the end, it's a decent horror movie with some downright chilling moments.

This was the reason why this film doesn't get a higher rating. While gore and violence makes for good movies, it doesn't really help in the horror genre. But the real triumph with this film was the great make-up, and not just for the creatures. When you saw the compound fracture, you were genuinely grossed out. Even the blood looked real.<br/><br/>All in all, this film was really nothing more than a popcorn munching showcase.

In a movie of only Caucasian women, the one ethnic woman--Filipina actress playing a Native American--is the bad person amongst the women. Still she played the role well.

If you take it at face value, you will be entertained, but the ending may not make a lot of sense, for there are things going on at different levels that will affect your interpretation of the outcome.

'what are these creatures' 'where do they come from'. I wasn't ever frightened during the flick. I never found myself biting my nails wondering 'oh god, what's going to happen next?' There was no cringing in my seat. There were a couple parts that did make you jump in your seat due to a combination of loud music, crawler screams, and appearances quickly from off camera to on camera. (one especially good scene involving a night vision camera) Otherwise, this movie had no real fear or horror involved in it. It was awfully gruesome and bloody, however. If you are mildly squeamish from the sight of blood, do not see this movie. And the acting, I found nothing special in it. The Punk rock chick was the definition of sub par acting. I did give this movie a 4, instead of a 1, b/c it had a couple moments of promise, but failed to deliver, probably the very reason why I felt such a waste of time when I left the theater."

The story line was very intence, and it left many people in the theater a little wierded out. My personal opinion of this movie was that it was a great laugh, compared in my mind up with Jeppers Creepers 2 and Candy Man on the laugh scale. The movie was a typical thriller, lots of jumps, but an overall light movie (kind of interesting considering it was based in a CAVE).

So far the reviews of the Descent look good. Did anybody see both movies? Can you tell me if the premise is the same? I am going to see The Descent based on what I read here on IMDb. And can anyone recommend a really SCARY movie, like the Grudge? Thats out now, I mean. Unfortunately, IMDb requires ten lines so I will keep discussing scary movies generally. I liked all the Scream movies, although not really scary they had great sense of humor. The Grudge and The Ring I thought were great and hope Grudge2 doesn't disappoint. The trailer seems to show way too much of the movie, I hope it doesn't take away. The Descent doesn't look scary but does seem to be suspenseful. The reader comments make it a go."

I can't say that I'll watch it again because I am a coward, but I'm glad (well... sort of) that I did. The only reason why I didn't give this movie a ten is because I'm terrified of small spaces.

","I thought the basic storyline, and backdrop could have been much better served had the director worked on the mystery and suspense aspect rather than the gore. I had a problem right from the start. Being involved in a serious accident, our girl ran from her hospital room after pulling out all the hookups from the machines monitoring her. She continues running until she is sitting in the middle of a corridor in the hospital, in her hospital gown, being consoled by her friend also sitting on the floor, and everyone else was stepping around them. I had assumed she was in serious condition. Am I missing something here? Let me put it this way, when I see a rating of 7.5 for a horror movie (The Descent) on IMDb knowing that Night of the Living Dead received a 7.8, I was expecting more of the ""on the edge of your seat"", ""heart pounding"" type suspense.

One of the amazing things about the film is how a very common injury - something thousands of doctors see every day - is one of the most tense, squirm-inducing moments on the screen. <br/><br/>And that scene, along with the cast's hair-raising squeeze through the caves, really primes the audience for the horror that comes afterward.<br/><br/>We all squealed, winced, gasped, laughed, and eventually clapped in appreciation at, in my humble opinion, one of the finest horror films to come along in years. <br/><br/>If you want to go the theater for a night of fun scares and entertainment, you will not leave disappointed!"

Soon they find themselves trapped in a cave feverishly searching for an exit with man-like, or Gollum-like to be more exact, creatures who have perfectly adapted themselves to their environment. The film had some immensely terrifying moments, my favorite being a scene in which they main character is trying to see all of the cave using the night vision mode on her camera and being attacked by one of the creatures. The film suffers from having such a great opening scene that it makes it hard for the rest of the film to live up to.

It's a decently written, solidly acted, fast-paced effort that has it's excesses (a few cheap scares and a virtual lake of blood that really aren't needed -- it's scary and gory enough already, thanks), but it's hard to hold it's weaknesses against it, given how well it delivers the scares.

Characters are well placed and individual traits, weaknesses and strengths are so well developed by the end of the movie that you can't help but feel sorry for the fact that some of them will not make it out alive. There were moments in the movie, where the audience cheered or cursed, in loud fashion as a response to the action. This was largely emphasized by the superb pause and pacing of some scenes, where it leaves the moviegoer cringing with suspense, just waiting on some large, scary screeching outcome. A classic genre taken to great plateau of quality.<br/><br/>This film places a red carpet for Neil Marshall and most of the actresses with high hopes of sustained success ahead of them.

"zetes","7","1","3","7 August 2006"," Scary? Yes. Original? Not by a long shot.
","I'm tempted to rate this higher than I'm going to because it's so rare that a horror movie is genuinely scary. When it's at its best, The Descent is extremely blood-curdling. Don't read any further if you don't want spoilers (though they are light spoilers, they are nonetheless spoilers). It also avoids effectively my pet peeve in horror movies: the women characters (and the major characters in this film are all women) don't fight back like wusses. Most women in thrillers and horror movies whack their enemy on the head once and then run away. These ladies know that if they don't give it their all, they'll be dead. So, anyway, it's a horror movie that's scary and not stupid. What's not to love? My problem was that writer/director Mashall goes out of his way to hit every cliché in the book. It may be effective, but it's far from original. A lot of the film is just Aliens, and that final shock is total J-horror. Most of the scares are achieved by the cheap ""boo"" tactic. The film is much more effective when it isn't deafening us with musical stings. The entire prologue feels extraneous, and there isn't even a pay-off that involves it. The film really should have just started with the six women meeting at the cabin the night before the spelunking. They would have lost 20 minutes, but that resulting 80 minute horror film would have been better. The characters in general are pretty weak. They aren't as bad as your run-of-the-mill horror flick, but they aren't that much better, either. Still, it works and it's well worth seeing. Definitely see it in the dark if you do."

","The Descent - Six women go spelunking in an unknown cavern. But the cavern is not all it seems, and their survival skills are put to the test.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I do not often go to see horror films in theater (The last one would be Silent Hill, which I had mixed feelings about) because I find them to be lackluster in general. Let me say that this one is by far one of the scariest movies in the past few years. My friends were not as scared by it as I, but they still admitted that it was a fine piece of work.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything for you, btu suffice to say that the film is content to play out the ""Jaws"" element for the first half hour and let us get to know these women better. The casting, which is by far the folly of your average horror flick, was well done and these six girls are believable (for the most part. Who goes into an unknown cave in the first place?) and in numerous scenes, applaudable for their actions.<br/><br/>The scares at first are psychological, playing out almost everyone's fears of claustrophobia, heights, and the dark, all done, in a very documentary-esquire way of filming, but not like Blair Witch where the cameras motion itself is the nauseating thing. There is also a great deal of gore. This is hardly for people with weak constitutions or bladders.<br/><br/>My friends and I were unable to agree on the level of scaritude (if I may invent a phrase here). They argued that the movie put too much into the sound effects so that even if you knew something was going to happen it was still a huge jump when it did happen because of the level of sound used. I think this worked to the movie's advantage more than it's detriment, as the result was more shocking and frightening.<br/><br/>The film never clarifies why any of this is happening, but I rather liked that it was unencombered by copious exposition.<br/><br/>This is not only a frightening and well done piece of film, but it has put me off of spelunking for life. This is a better and (strangely) more believable piece of work than than Saw and Bostel. For horror afficianados, one not to miss. I give it a B+"

","This is a ripoff of other movies, some good (""Blair Witch Project"") and some not so good (""The Cave""), but one of them is not ""Alien"". Admittedly, there is a high level of suspense once the action starts approx. 50 minutes into the film. There is also a high gross out level. However, the writing is lame. I sat there and predicted when most of the shocks would happen. Characters do and say things for no apparent reason other than to have some extra lines to speak during the first 50 minutes.<br/><br/>Speaking of that 50 minutes, the movie should be titled ""Six Annoying B*****s"" because I couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them when the body count inevitably started.

However, within the context of the film I still couldn't suppress a giggle when the line is uttered."
"LostintheDarknessofNight","9","1","3","5 August 2006"," A masterpiece in modern horror
","""The Descent"" is obviously not an American movie. It's got imagination, smarts, and, dare I say it, actual SCARES. Everything the American horror film lacks. The latter is one reason I've stopped watching movies, period. Once a video store clerk licking his chops to see every new release that came in, and every horror movie we carried, I quickly grew bored of watching the same movie over and over again, in which all the characters that should live somehow manage to do so, and vice versa for all the characters that should die.<br/><br/>""The Desscent"" is a film in which none of the characters SHOULD die. It also brilliantly nixes the ol' ""love tension"" cliché that kills so many movies. How so? By filling the entire cast with females. Strong females. These aren't the typical all-they-do-is-scream-and-die women from American horror movies. These are women who fill their free time with white-water rafting, mountain climbing, and anything else that can give them a rush of adrenaline.<br/><br/>To quickly sum up the plot, we follow a group of seven women lead by Juno, a women with perhaps more of a thirst for the extreme than all the others. The women all plan to explore a ""level 2"" cave, which is a cave of roughly ""average"" difficulty. Or as one character puts it, ""a tourist attraction."" But Juno has other things in mind. Before you know it, the characters are exploring an unnamed, unexplored cave that may or may not even have a way out.<br/><br/>That's just a rough summary of the plot. If you want more, you can read virtually every other review on this film. But what I want to focus on are the scares. Oh God are there scares. I am not a person easily fazed by horror films, basically for the reason above (that all of them follow simple formulas that, once known, give away the entire movie). ""The Descent"" follows very few formulas. Since all the characters are strong, you really have no idea which ones will die, and which ones will live. You can't easily guess where scares will pop up. There's one brilliant scene (don't worry, I won't give it away) where you KNOW for a fact something's coming, and you think you know exactly when, and you're wrong. So you start to relax. Then it finally comes, jerking you out of your seat and sending your heart-rate through the roof.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is a brilliant film, though not without flaws. Though I realize the darkness is for atmosphere's sake (and it works for the most part), there are a few times when it becomes difficult to tell who's who, once the females separate, simply because you can't see their face. It's also tough to tell what's going on during the ""struggle"" sequences between the characters and the creatures, which leads me to another complaint: The creatures look like Golem extras from ""The Lord of the Rings"". They are creepy-looking, but the one way the movie could have been even better...well nearly perfect, is if the creatures were never shown in whole.<br/><br/>As it stands, however, ""The Descent"" is a modern masterpiece in horror, a film that would theoretically make that perfect first date movie--except there's the good chance that the boy, who's seen every horror movie and, like me, has figured out the formulas, might also be clinging to the girl by the end."
"TensersFloatingDisk","3","1","3","4 August 2006"," Victim of its own hype
","We heard it would be the second-coming of horror cinema. Inevitably, The Descent suffers from comparison to the massive internet buzz which greeted its arrival here in the U.S.<br/><br/>The Descent is really two parallel stories, the literal descent of the heroines into an unexplored cave system, and their figurative descent into madness and brutality. It's a metaphoric ploy which could work in the hands of someone with more experience, but in the oafish claws of Neill Marshall, all that is on display here is slickly produced gore, to no real end. There's promise, in some early scenes, of real tension which is never fulfilled, and the much-touted psychological characterizations of the five cave explorers is lost in a lot of shrieking during the second-half of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has its moments, but they're not where you'd expect, and not, sadly, where Marshall spends any time as a director. The natural paranoia and claustrophobia of the early cave exploration, as these people are shoved into tighter and tighter confines (and tighter and more uncomfortable psychological space) should be riveting...instead, we get a few cringe-worthy scenes of shifting rocks and then...more running about and screaming.<br/><br/>By the (highly anticlimactic) end, you're simply not sure why you bothered. There's a certain grim fun in guessing which of the heroines will meet their doom next, but by then you care so little about any of them that it's too easy to dismiss this as yet another substitution of fake blood for story, or scares.<br/><br/>Grade: C-."
"lpas220","7","1","3","4 August 2006"," Descend to the depths of quality horror
","After a half-year of horror films that play into every cliché imaginable, the movie-going public searches for a quality horror movie. The Descent, released to rave reviews in the U. K. last year, attempts to be no more than what it is  a simple horror movie with a simple theme: six girls enter a cave; trouble ensues. While it recognizes its simplicity, The Descent offers more than most of the big-budget films of recent memory. It stands out amidst the remakes and goes back to the roots of horror  tension and fear. Shauna MacDonald plays Sarah, a woman who is haunted by a horrible accident and decides to break from her depression by going spelunking with the girls with whom she used to adventure. In this group there's the lead daredevil, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and her new protégé, Holly (Nora-Jane No one), Sarah's close and loyal friend, Beth (Alex Reid), and the newbies  sisters Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Buring). Following Juno, the girls explore a cave system in the Appalachian Mountains and everything goes wrong. There is a reasonable amount of buildup that some viewers may find dull, but it keeps the movie from being full of gratuitous gore and worthless attempts at scares. The cave monsters that arise and attack are quick and frightening, with a familiarity that brings memories of the creatures in House on Haunted Hill (1999). For a simple film reliant on many jump scares and some physical gore, there are still some complexities. The relationships and feelings among the girls only add to the viewers' enjoyment and the caves themselves force the viewers to empathize with the characters' feelings of claustrophobia, paranoia, and panic. The Descent was advertised as coming from the production company that brought us Saw and Hostel, and Lions Gate is definitely making its mark in the genre. The Descent fits nicely into the category and should not be missed."
"editor-299","5","1","3","2 August 2006"," Middling thriller; better than 'The Cave'
","Basically, just an all-female version of 2005's ""The Cave,"" in which a gaggle of ladies, led by the adventurous Juno (Natalie Mendoza), jaunt off to various extreme diversions and discover a world of terror beyond their imaginations.<br/><br/>We see the group, including Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Samantha (MyAnna Burring) and Holly (Nora-Jane No one), in the beginning, white water rafting, before a horrible accident takes Sarah's husband and daughter away. Other than Mendoza, all of these actors are British, so I've never heard of them before. But they do a good job in their rather limited roles.<br/><br/>A year later, Juno (who has never gone to see her ""friend"" in the hospital or anywhere else), decides what they all need is a little recreation time exploring a cave in the Appalachian Mountains. Why the other women, all seemingly intelligent professionals, follow her is beyond me.<br/><br/>Of course, this being a spelunking film, nothing can go right, and we know they will be menaced by strange, mutant-like creatures (see, once again, ""The Cave""). Things go bad right away when Juno takes them top the wrong cave; then an earthquake seals their only means of egress (that they know of). Later, they are accosted by annoying little creatures that have adapted to the dark, can crawl on the walls like flies, eat flesh and look like they could be Gollum''s backwoods cousins.<br/><br/>The film is also very bloody. Let's me give you an example if I can. In one scene, Sarah actually fights one of the beasts in a POND of blood. With people and monsters having their bones broken, eyes gouged out, being burned, eaten, crushed, smashed, stabbed, bludgeoned, dismembered and sliced apart, this certainly earned it's ""R"" rating.<br/><br/>But despite critics and others claiming how scary it is, I just cannot agree. Yeah, it's gory all right, and sure there are some frightening moments, but these are mostly due to stuff jumping out at the characters on screen. After a dozen so of these ""innocent"" occurrences (i.e. birds, bats, the other girls, etc.), when the real horror comes, you're pretty much immune.<br/><br/>To me, it would be terrifying enough just to be trapped in a cave with no way out. That would probably make an interesting film. Why insert some make-believe ""monster"" in the story? What's the point?"
"soxlade","9","1","3","27 June 2006"," 1 year on and it is still terrific
","I'm not a horror movie fan. I don't particularly enjoy them, usually find them far-fetched, overly nasty, and basically an excuse to do lots of expensive special effects. I was bored on a Tuesday afternoon when a friend phoned up and suggested we went to see ""The Descent"". <br/><br/>My friend, a lovable if shallow type, sold it to me as ""a thriller with fit women underground by the bloke who did Dog Soldiers"". I'd seen Dog Soldiers, and really enjoyed it. I also didn't find it excessively gory and is was bloody (sorry) funny. Combine that with a few girls in tight tops and covered in mud and yeah - sounds like a good way to see off a dull evening. Boy, was I wrong. <br/><br/>The dictionary definition of trauma is:""An emotional wound or shock that creates substantial, lasting damage to the psychological development of a person, often leading to neurosis."" I am writing this nearly a year after seeing the film and I'm still thinking about it. When I left the cinema I felt deeply scarred; as battered and bruised emotionally as the characters in the film were visually. My friend and I were both, by our own admission, traumatized. <br/><br/>All this from a FILM? Yes - The Descent is utterly, utterly terrifying. That is a word that should not be used lightly, but frequently is. Terror is when your breath comes in small gasps, your heart is racing, and your mind is pleading for the tension to ease. The Descent will put you in this place and then, without any mercy, keep you there for at least an hour. <br/><br/>What is even more astonishing is the speed and skill with which this film draws its audience in and puts you in such a state of fear. This movie should be held up in class to show how a genuinely talented director and writer can setup characters and situations with such little fuss but such effect. <br/><br/>Marshall's 'chicks with picks' are a likable bunch, but we don't really get to know them. There is a rudimentary 'meet and greet' the day before they go to the cave, but it doesn't reveal their true characters. Instead, as we follow them through the cave, their flaws and strengths are revealed piece by piece, and each time they have a direct effect on their situation. <br/><br/>And what a situation. Filmed entirely on cleverly constructed studio sets, with minimal lighting (much of it 'dynamic' from flares and helmet lights as opposed to static studio lighting) and realistic camera positions, the film puts us in amongst the girls; we squirm through narrow passageways, gaze around rugged chambers and crawl through fetid pools. If I'm honest, the creatures (who appear at about the halfway point), were not really necessary. The feelings of claustrophobia and insecurity are already at high levels. All the creatures do is tip it over the edge. <br/><br/>The creatures are nicely worked out, with a logical development back story and sensible origins. Yes they are fantasy, yes they are hardly believable, but it works in this kind of a film. They are also sufficiently nasty to give real impetus to the panic and terror that afflicts our heroines. <br/><br/>After the initial assault of the crawlers it would be correct to say that we are in familiar 'stalk and slash' territory, but that isn't being fair to the film. The tension, locations, characterizations and acting all combine with savage action and gruesome effects to produce a truly shocking effect. This is a film that will have you despairing, not for what is happening on screen, but for what is happening to the characters on screen. This is a long way from the 'horror porn' of ""Hostel"" or ""The Hills have Eyes"" where the point of the film is the suffering of the characters. Marshall's characters suffer, and suffer horribly in some cases, but it isn't suffering for suffering's sake. They make an understandable error and pay for it, or they get caught out by a creature, or they put up a good fight and eventually succumb to force of numbers. Marshall doesn't shrink from showing us the gore and viscera (though as a non-horror I think it would have been better to have shown a little restraint in places - sometimes it is better to not see something), but it is an expected result of an action. <br/><br/>Finally there is that ending. An ending that is sadly removed from the US release. A genuine WTF that leaves the audience reeling. It is a masterpiece ending that does not betray everything that has gone before as many films are wont to do. it is a staggering, breathless, bold, dark, twisted ending that slaps you in the face. It will probably be copied mercilessly by lesser films in the future, and more's the pity, because this truly one of the great movie endings. I hope the US will get the option to see it on DVD. <br/><br/>Oh enough - see it will you. Even if you don't like horror movies. This is a superior thriller that doesn't waver from its purpose to scare the sh** out of you. Very good films come along too rarely, and when they do their stories, characters and standout moments remain with you for long afterward. Last year only one other film had the same level of emotional impact that ""The Descent"" did, and its name was 'Million Dollar Baby"" (different set of emotions though, I'll grant you). It doesn't get 10 as there are flaws including one character moment that just didn't ring true for me, and the odd clunky line. However this is that very rare thing - a horror movie that is frightening rather than repelling, that is intelligent rather than patronizing, and the end result is genuinely terrifying."
"matt-dalton","6","1","3","16 June 2006"," Overrated
","I bought a copy of The Descent last year when I read raves about it from British presses and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. I thought the subplot involving the lead character's husband and daughter was distracting and lessened the impact of the horror. There are several good jumps and lots of blood but the ending sucks. Try to ignore the commercials for the American release - it gives away the film's best scare! I liked Hostel a lot more - it was fun and it didn't try to be meaningful and insightful. It just delivered the good stuff, something The Descent should have learned. The film is also too long and takes too long to get to the action."

","Minor spoilers, not specific.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" is a pure horror film, probably the first (hopefully not the last) of the century. Firstly, there's no cutting corners for a bigger audience as so many horror films from the West do nowadays; secondly, it doesn't bog itself down with the convoluted curses and supernatural themes like horror films from the East do nowadays. No; there are some people. In a cave. And there's some monsters. And it's really dark. And there's no explanations.<br/><br/>The darkness and the tight spaces are frightening enough. The film could be just as chilling without the mysterious predators, so when they do arrive its impossible for the situation of the six women to feel any more hopeless; there's a feeling of isolation constantly apparent throughout the film that hasn't been seen since 1982 (Meaning The Thing). In fact, this feeling of dread is much more effective than the monsters themselves. Even if one of the creatures is slaughtered, there's no feeling of happiness or success; the group is still trapped 2 miles underground. It's apparent from the outset that there's no hope for these women; yet Marshall's skill with the material keeps you hooked, waiting to see how many more circles of hell the poor victims will fall through.<br/><br/>If the film slips up anywhere, it's in Marshall's decision to actually show the predators in all their glory. Unlike his fantastic debut Dog Soldiers; the monsters aren't kept off screen, they're given almost as much screen time as the human cast. This sort of white washes over the initial mystery surrounding the strange shapes that are moving in the darkness and often the film leans more towards a gore shocker than a well crafted nihilist horror film. There is also a lack of the black humour that made Dog Soldiers so memorable and enjoyable; a film which I probably still prefer subjectively.<br/><br/>Still, I haven't seen a horror film this bleak, claustrophobic and downbeat for a very long time. The decision made by some studios to cut the film few moments of the film only goes to show how out of touch the industry has become with horror films; because the talent's out there. If only more people had the freedom Marshall has, the horror industry wouldn't be as farcical as it is nowadays.<br/><br/>Round of applause for everyone involved."

","While The Descent is not as original as 2004's Shaun of the Dead, it's still a breath of fresh air to the genre, and another reason for me to like the British horror even more.<br/><br/>The Descent tells the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), a mother who loses her her husband and daughter in a car accident. One year later, she goes with 5 other friends on a caving expedition that goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the thing I liked most about The Descent was its story. The film only has six characters, and each one of those is essential to the story. They're not there just to be killed. We have the grieving mother, the supporting friend, the suspicious friend, the doctor, her older caring sister, and the adventurous newbie. Another great thing was the direction the story took in the second half of the film. In 99% of the horror films made these days, there's an inevitable teaming-up between the characters to escape the trouble they were sunk into. That's not the case with The Descent. In The Descent, the characters don't trust each other, deceive each other, and they even start hurting each near the end of the film.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is very creepy, and very reminiscent of horror classics Alien and Aliens. Director and writer Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) kept building and building the tension in the first half, and fortunately the second half really paid-off. When the chaos started, I could even hear my own heartbeat.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I read a long debate on these boards regarding the film's end. It seems there are 2 endings for The Descent. The film's original ending, and a new ""happy"" Hollywood ending for the American version of the film. I've seen the original, and while I wouldn't exactly call it a feel-good ending, I still think it's a perfect one. It makes The Descent much more than a horror film. It makes it a redemption tale.<br/><br/>The Descent wasn't flawless. You could predict who's going to die 15 minutes into the film. You might even be able to predict the order of the deaths. Also, there were a lot of cheap jump scares we've a thousand times before. But, on the other hand, the acting, sets, and music were all very good.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, do yourself a favor, and go watch he Descent."

","My and my friends saw this movie a late evening. We got into the movie very fast, and it was a good accident in the beginning. Only the cave exploring scared a little bit of us. And when some creepy creatures lived in there made us go into panic. The people in the movie act very realistic. Good camera views and really good empathy. I can really imagine the situation they came into. The only bad was when a women didn't die when an Axe went through her throat. Good environment. It was a relief that it wasn't some guy that played hero. I did a smelling thing all over my pants, it went brown...:P<br/><br/>Good freaky movie!"
"PeterRoeder","7","1","3","15 February 2006"," Overrated
","I liked this better than ""Dog Soldiers"", and I think Neil Marshall is a great talent in the horror genre. I look forward to seeing more movies by him. However, I think both Dog Soldiers and The Descent are problematic as horror movies. There's no real supernatural feel. The shocks are not scary. Japanese and south eastern Asian horror (such as ""the eye"") make scary shocks. The move by Hollywood to just try and copy what they couldn't have done themselves is pathetic, I think. The descent is a British movie, and it shows. It is better than a lot of recent American horror. However, my main problem with the descent except that it has little or no suspense is that the plot is devoid of logic. What is the connection between the accident and the descent into the cave with the monsters? Let me tell you: THERE IS NO CONNECTION. Thus the plot is not making sense. You can analyze this as much as you want to and try and see connections but take my word for it: there isn't any. It's just some kind of plot decoy which in the end didn't seem to fit although it might have been intended. Moreover, whereas the accident is exciting and seems to make sense in terms of horror, all the non-horror things in this movie is just so borderline superfluous that it sort of ruins the occasional splendid elements of successful horror."
"kp0508","3","1","3","5 February 2006"," What is all the fuss about?
","I seem to be in the minority strangely, but I thought this film was simple, predictable, hammy and cringe-worthy in so many places. Sure it was entertaining in a don't think, lazy film-watching way, but certainly not worth the fuss everyone seems to be giving it for being such a 'scary movie'. It was laughable not scary - you know, in the way you crease up when Freddie Kruger runs after the girl in Nightmare On Elm Street, with long arms outstretched and wobbling. Not to say there aren't a couple of alright moments, the start and the end are OK. But that's it. The rest is insulting in a 'you go sister whoop whoop!!' kinda way. I guess maybe guys like it because it has pretty girls in tight rubber suits doing Charlie's Angels moves. Does anyone seem to notice the glaringly obvious plot flaws too? And the blatant stealing of scenes from better, scarier films? No? Must just be me then. Maybe watch it if you're intrigued, but don't buy it - you'll only encourage them."
"FrankieDees","9","1","3","27 January 2006"," If Marshall doesn't quite reinvent the wheel, he certainly added some nice and shiny tires....
","Deceptively simple. If pushed to describe the film in two words. Those would be the two I choose. Horror more so than any other genre, with the possible exception of the western, does not have to work hard to please most fans of the genre. Look at the fan-base behind such franchises such as Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and all but one of the Halloween films. Can anyone argue that these are great films? Good films? Yet there's no denying their imprint as contemporary film iconography. Horror films only have to get one thing right and that's to tap into somebody's adrenaline. Be it through legitimate scares, visceral gore or just simple exploitation, fans of horror can be easily pleased. Which can explain how dreck like Cry-Wolf, Venom, Darkness, They, Darkness Falls, etc continue to be made and more often than not make money. So, surprise, surprise, when a new horror film actually gives us something new.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall's sophomore effort does exactly that. And If Marshall doesn't quite reinvent the wheel, he certainly added some nice and shiny tires. Marshall, if you remember, made his debut with 2002's Dog Soldiers, a competent low-budget amalgam of Aliens and Predator which finds a group of British soldiers trapped in the Scottish Highlands by strange, immobile werewolf suits. While not necessarily an auspicious debut; the special effects were limited, the acting amateurish, there was just enough spark in the writing and direction to peg this director as somebody to watch. Cut to a few years later. If you were one of those who pegged him as somebody to watch, you can now pat yourselves on the back. This is one of the most confident horror films I have seen in years. Every move by the filmmakers seems to be assured and a capitalization of the medium and genre.<br/><br/>Mere minutes into the film and we have our first superbly executed jaw-dropper. Before this however, we meet our daredevil heroines (yes, heroines, the only appearance of the x gene registers as barely a cameo) fighting through the rapids of some nameless white water deathtrap. An extraordinary sequence in it's own right, every splash, pound and crack will put you right in the middle of the action. (On a side note, seeing this film in theaters is the obvious preference but if you don't have 5.1, do what you think you need to do to find somebody that does. The Region 2 release creates a new reference for 5.1 PAL). This sequence lets us know what kind of women we are dealing with. Strong, tough and brutal, always looking for the next challenge. Make no mistake, though, none of these women are what you would classify as 'butch'. No easy stereotypes here. Tough and feminine. Another nod to Marshall's seemingly favorite film. Once this sequence ends, the aforementioned shocker occurs. The friends seem to drift after the travesty. Guilt drives Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) to America and sorrow plunges Sarah (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) into a slightly unhinged stupor. A year passes. Juno tries to assemble the group together for a healing trip. The women reconvene in the Appalachian mountains for a tourist-friendly spelunking trip in which all hell breaks loose and a descent is made both figuratively and literally.<br/><br/>I think the success of this film is in the succinct, economic concept of six women and a truly frightening antagonist. A horror film set in a cave is such an obvious conceit, it's amazing this is the first film to exploit such a unique atmosphere (ignoring last year's abysmal 'The Cave'). Aside from a few cheap scare tactics, the tension mounts slowly, palpable in every frame. David Julyan's deft score (inspired by a few choice Carpenter themes) accentuates every move with an early slight nod to 'Deliverance'. As the women progress deeper into the cave, claustrophobia takes control. As someone who has done some spelunking, it's obvious Marshall has done his homework. Even if you have taken one of those guided tours through well-lit tourist traps, you can feel how oppressive those Earth walls can be.And wouldn't you know it, through the deceit of one of the characters who wanted a more personal bonding experience, they don't find themselves in a tourist attraction but a new system. A cave unmarked by human presence. Yet something is found that might lead a character to believe otherwise. To delve too deeply into the plot would be to spoil surprises, but the level of suspense generated by the film is truly nail-biting.<br/><br/>The use of lighting in this film is masterly, making expert use of the subtle blue glow of a flare, the flickering red and yellows of a kerosene-soaked torch, the lighting seems to be swallowed up into blackness in all the appropriately strategic spots. Even an ingenuis use for the oft-abused night-vision camera is incorporated here. The two leads, Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Jackson Mendoza, are quite good throughout proving equally adept at the melodrama as the action. When a climatic confrontation happens, don't be surprised to find yourself conflicted about where your loyalties might lay. One of the two minor flaws is that some of the supporting gals never quite get the screen time to fully flesh out their characters. An early dialog scene in a cabin gives us a few names and personality traits but nothing that truly stays with us. An issue that might lessen what we invest in these characters and ultimately their fates. <br/><br/>Minor quibbles aside, if you consider yourself a horror fan, you would do well to seek this film out which sadly also continues the trend of having to look outside of America to find something new in the horror genre and, dare I say it?, scary yet poignant. From Miike and the Pang brothers to Gans and Aja to now Marshall, the least we can hope for is to keep these guys out of Hollywood a little while longer."
"BA_Harrison","9","1","3","24 January 2006"," Bloody scary!
","Neil Marshall is a horror fan. This superbly crafted shocker smacks of being made by someone who has spent his life thus far absorbing the great scary movies of all time. The basic plot of a group of friends fighting for their lives against a terrible foe in an inhospitable environment is hardly new (Aliens, Predator, Deliverance, Wrong Turn, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc), but Marshall doesn't worry about that  he's having too good a time using every technique in the book to scare the pants off us.<br/><br/>The first half of the film starts as an adventure story  6 female cavers get trapped underground and have to find their way out  but eventually gives way to pure horror when it is revealed that the ladies are not alone; blind flesh-eating creatures dwell in the cave and they're hungry! If tense, gruelling, nail-biting horror with lashings of gore is your cup of tea, hunt this movie down immediately.<br/><br/>With Dog Soldiers and now the Descent, Neil Marshall has proved that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of horror. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next."
"HEFILM","9","1","3","22 January 2006"," What THE CAVE should have been
","The director of Dog Soldiers is back with a less jokey and even more scary film. It does however retain a Brit aspect to the acting though not as heavy on the ""what did they say?"" accents in Dog Soldiers, and lacks any American names, which will probably unfairly limit its exposure in the United States where it has all the thrills that were lacking in THE CAVE. This is a more realistic climbing, crawling and caving movie than that, which makes it more effective. The film has personal drama and perhaps just a touch too much grimness when it's all said and done but it is miles ahead and much more involving than most horror films. Solid drama aspects and tough minded true to the heart of the matter drama also keep it ticking.<br/><br/>Creatures are cool and mostly briefly glimpsed. They seem to be based at least in part on some ""real"" cave demon photos that have been circulating, and recently discredited, on the web for the past several years.<br/><br/>There aren't many Caving horror movies, though this does remind me of WHAT WAITS BELOW which unfortunately fell apart when it was about half way through another film that comes to mind is the seldom mentioned, not bad, THE STRANGENESS.<br/><br/>Weakest element is the overblown, Howard-Shore-like music score,though it sounds great it is really all volume and little musicality. However the cave bound elements of the score, which comprise the bulk of the film and music, are effective.<br/><br/>Well made on a limited budget this film also shows you can make something totally pro and slick if you're clever with your concept and execution--and at the same time you'll make a movie that has scares, guts, heart and logic. What's the last monster movie you saw that can make that claim?"

This colors the whole tone of the film as it's first part feels just like any other typical girl-movie.

","I have just seen this movie and i think although it is not bad, it is not great either. Really enjoyed the movie and the beginning though it is progressing a little to fast with too few details about the characters which i think is important in a horror/thriller movie because it makes u care for them and adds to the tension. Second thing that really bothers me is that as the girls run into the creatures the camera is spoiling the audience by showing them too much and its starting to get predictable what is going to happen in most of the scenes. By not showing too much it helps in building up the tension and the mood (Alien for example has all this witch i think has the greatest tension of all horror-films). Sometimes showing less is a whole lot more. Great concept though about being trapped in a dark cave with a bunch of ugly monsters =)"

","Neil Marshall has done it again like dog solders he leads the way for British horror. The only slight criticism is that the actresses some times seem a bit cheesy with their one liners and sometimes greenwood script although this is mainly in the non action parts of the movie. Apart from this the film is well made. the cinemamatography is great and the shocks and jumps are plentyfull. fans of gore will also be pleased. In modern times the idea of remaking classic horror seems to be a trend but this film although not a remake managers to take the aliens meets deliverence engine and add a post modern take giving this already tried and tested formula a fresh modern approach. I am in two opinions as to if certain plot parts should have been developed more, but as the film is presented it leaves you thinking why this and what actually happened also leaving room for a sequel.

"clockworkstu","9","1","3","29 December 2005"," Neil Marshall has found an unusual niche!!
","I would assume that anybody thinking about going to the cinema would expect The Descent to be a cheap, late 80's style, horror movie designed to appease students and teenagers. Any film about a group of caving, pot-holing, babes going underground and facing a horde of sub-human lifeforms intent on devouring them just screams a blood and breasts fest, but those who damn it without chance would be wrong. Incredibly wrong. Neil Marshall, the director of the delectable Dog Soldiers, has discovered a real talent for taking premises that otherwise could be deemed tacky and unoriginal and turning them into roller-coaster shockers with as much intelligence as your average David Lynch film.<br/><br/>Marshall's talent lies in his desire to frighten, I mean really frighten, by using John Carpenter's age old trick of relax your audience, make them feel comfortable and then, when they least expect it, stab them in the back. He did this in Dog Soldiers by introducing a biting humour to his script, setting us up for genuine chills when the blood started flowing. In The Descent he introduces us to a warm group of friends, who's emotional cracks appear early on, we feel safe and secure with them, knowing that whatever happens we can trust their abilities and if not at least their bond. But the gradual breakdown of their relationships only add to the paranoia we as viewers are starting to experience. Our fears are heightened when, at the first instance off trouble, the girls split up in a panic and we are lost with them, in a seemingly endless maze of rock and caves.<br/><br/>Marshall's limited budget never shows and we spend the entire film in awe and wonder of the fantastic set design, always wondering how they did it. The true magic of cinema! Only small problems arise in sentimental subplots that can occasionally detract from the story at hand. Our leading lady Sarah loses her husband and daughter at the opening of the film and a recurring dream/hallucination Sarah experience becomes quite tiresome and one starts to wish that Marshall had left them at ground level. However, problems like this are mere quibbles in the face of what truly is a force in British horror. Hollywood has tried to smudge it's veneer recently with the gruesome, if not slightly inadequate, remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it is this film along with the truly horrific Wolf Creek, that I feel is offering us a real resurgence of the unflinching, exploitative horror only the Seventies could supply us with.<br/><br/>Congratulations Mr Marshall, keep up the good work. It's about time people got really scared again."

But as to The Descent....first the Good: Believable cave sets. Unlike this years' other offering, The Cave, the sets here enhance the claustrophobic feel of being underground. There is lots of wriggling around and squeezing through tiny passages and the vast vaulted caverns are (for the most part) absent.<br/><br/>The Bad: Call me old fashioned, but when I'm told ""These creatures evolved underground"", I expect them to make use of more than just the sense of hearing. Sure, they may be blind, but does that mean they can't smell either? Or feel the heat of a burning torch when they are sat right next to it? Or, good God! Simply reach out and explore a suspected victims hidey-hole with their mits? The Ugly: The last fifteen minutes or so. Down to the final two survivors, one of whom has (entirely by accident) killed another party member and the other who (has found out about this killing, but not HOW it happened) and they both square off. Two against untold numbers of Gollum-wannabees. So what is the logical thing for them to do? Put aside their differences and work together to escape? Or maybe quickly fill each other in on what happened with regard to that killing, then scarper? No! The obvious thing to do is for Miss Self-Righteous to ice-pick the other girl in the leg and leave her for the Golllums to devour. Mmmm.....good cinema! And I won't go into the ""twist"" at the end. Just switch off when blondie climbs out of the hole and pretend she lives happily ever after. God knows I hate Hollywood happy endings, but in this case it's preferable to the psycho-drivel that follows.<br/><br/>Of course, you know the ""bad"" girl had to die, because of unresolved issues from the very start of the film. It's not so much telegraphed as spammed in your face right from the off. And ""bad"" girl tricks them all into thinking they are at another cave too...ooooh! bad! bad girl! Strange then that, by the end, I was rather hoping she'd survive and not the other one. Oh well! So much for wishes.<br/><br/>Comparison to The Cave: The Cave - schlocky monster movie that knows what it is.

In fact I wasn't really scared much at all, BUT my wife and her friend were scared out of their minds...which made it more fun for me. THE DESCENT is a very well made chiller with excellent pacing and a bunch of great jump-out-of-your-seat moments.

But ""The descent"" is not merely action since the director and the wonderful actresses get to unleash properly, very properly, horrific moments and tension.

I favor the idea the girls become so much like the monsters in the end, even ripping out the throat of one monster, that it's become hard to differentiate monster from human. Actually, the monsters care for each other, while we end up fighting each other out of fear and suspicion. I also like the idea they built sets and didn't go on location at all for the caves. They covered up their cheap sets by lighting the movie with the actors' cave lights, making things even eerier. I haven't seen ""The Cave"", which DID go on location, but I can only imagine they went through a lot of trouble only to have a lot of people dump on how dumb ""The Cave"" is compared to ""The Descent"". One friend summed it up nicely and made me bark in laughter, ""This director sure doesn't like people."" This one, and the upcoming Hostel, are the must-see horror films of the year for me."

"hellfireblue","9","1","3","12 August 2005"," The Two Items (possible spoiler)
","I thought ""The Descent"" was fantastic. I was a little puzzled with the ending, and some other things that happened throughout the movie, but they're now apparent. Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone noticed the two items from the cabin that also appear in the cave (but only for Sarah). When Sarah and Beth arrive at the cabin, and Juno arrives, Sarah goes into the cabin. But before that she puts her hand on a post, with some sort of bone or animal object on it, and I can't remember fully, but she's like ""yuck"" or something. Then the camera switches to show Sarah going into the cabin, and it gives you a clear view of a little tin object I think, with a face or pattern on it.<br/><br/>Sarah finds these exact objects in the cave. The tin thing just before she spots the first crawler, and the bone thing she used to kill the female crawler, by stabbing it into its eye.<br/><br/>I'm sure some of you may have noticed this. Sorry if it's been mentioned before in other threads; I haven't read them. Anyway, my question is: what's that all about? I have an idea that the simple answer is to do with Sarah's mental state, so she see's those objects in the cave. However, she didn't notice the little tin object at the cabin. Lol, I'm confused. Maybe it's just meant to be that way.<br/><br/>Your views would be nice to read ;)"
"Rich B","9","1","3","7 August 2005"," Superb horror with scares and surprises aplenty, real characters, dialogue and actions.
","Neil Marshall is a supreme talent in horror that should not be ignored, especially by Hollywood who did just that with Dog Soldiers and is repeating it with The Descent, both of which have not had US cinema releases For his second movie he's decided to stay with horror but this time dropping the fun factor and relying on pure horror, scare tactics and something he's proving to excel in, a very strong and realistic script. Something that hit me during the early scenes of the all female climbing group sitting in their cabin chatting, is the realism of their vocabulary and delivery. It's something that was obvious in Dog Soldiers as well and it appears that Marshall has a talent for this. He picks actors who are not widely known but have a knack for a natural style, and then gives them some of the most natural scripted lines I've heard in a long time. It's very refreshing and very obvious, making it stand apart from many other films in and out of this genre.<br/><br/>From the outset Marshall tells us in no uncertain terms that there's no fun in this film, this is going to be hard, in your face horror. Oh, and expect the scares to be off tempo and unexpected. No matter how atune you think you are to avoiding jumping, shouting out, or just sitting with a grimace on your face, he'll hit you just about every time in this movie. It's scary and very dark.<br/><br/>One of the interesting things about this movie is how dark it is, they used as many realistic light sources as they could through the movie. That means the head torches of the pot holers, flames, torches, etc. Frankly I can't imagine that they got away with realistic lighting throughout, but you certainly have that feel from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The whole movie gives you the feeling of enclosed spaces, darkness and the total loss of any bearings. For the most part you realise that the team are going in and deeper, but when trouble begins you loose all sense of direction and depth along with the characters.<br/><br/>Once again the creatures in the movie are superb, not over the top like other horror offerings of the same ilk, but grounded in reality. Again Marshall has looked at the creature of the movie and worked out what it would look like and how it would behave based more on science and our real world than folklore and fantasy. What he comes up with is a strangely unnerving creature which isn't as all powerful as other films would have, and is real enough to prey upon your own fears rather than allowing you to distance yourself from it with the comfort of that very word, fantasy.<br/><br/>The editing goes a long way to providing us with the shocks and scares on an offbeat tempo. You'll be expecting something, and nothing happens, you'll be expecting nothing, and then the audience screams or leaps. There are more than just scares in the movie though, there are plenty of surprises, twists and quite a few ""oh my god"" moments, all extremely well crafted, written, edited and directed onto the screen.<br/><br/>As for the talent of the female cast, there's not much to fault them. They are all so believable in their terror and confusion, but particular attention should be paid to MyAnna Buring as the lead, Sam, who takes you on a fantastic change of character, as does Natalie Jackson Mendoza. There's also the super sexy Alex Reid who has some fantastic lines early on in the movie. Nora-Jane No one also gives a superb and agonising performance during a few scenes where gasps and groans were echoing through the audience - that Marshall is a nasty man.<br/><br/>What I really like about this movie is the reality of it all, okay there are some belief suspension moments, but we're not talking parasitic worms that grow into forty foot winged beasts, we're talking something that isn't that far from what could actually occur. Then there's the characters themselves who speak and behave as you think you just might too, and it's that part that really grabs me into Marshall's movies. He's got a realistic script combined with actors who deliver realistic performances. With these positives in the movie you're hooked, pulled in, and there's nothing to distract you from being thrown around with the movie.<br/><br/>The ending is another strong part of the movie, it's also very well conceived, and you'll be sitting watching the credits roll still thinking about the movie, you'll even have walked away and still be thinking about it. You might feel slightly cheated, but I believe that's because we're too used to having everything handed to us on a plate in Hollywood, and this is perhaps why Hollywood hasn't taken either of Marshall's movies as yet, because they don't follow their standard movie template.<br/><br/>Looking back on the movie, I'd like it to have had a little bit more - and please excuse the expression - meat on it. Tying something more in with the main character and her state of mind, as well as the opening of the film, and perhaps a tiny little bit more on the ending of the movie would have made it perfect for me. I think it does a superb job in the horror\scare departments, but there was room for a bit more psychological based subplot, perhaps involving more character interplay."
"agmoldham","5","1","3","6 August 2005"," Not for the claustrophobic
","From the maker of Dog Soldiers this film shares a lot of the same characteristics.<br/><br/>A group of twenty something women like to live life on the edge. Following from a tragedy after a previous outing they embark on a pot holing expedition. Instead of visiting an easy cave they embark on a trip to an uncharted cave that conveniently has a track to the entrance.<br/><br/>For me the film is at its best in the first half that really recreates the (few) joys and (many) pains of pot holing. I tried it several years ago and found it a thoroughly horrible experience. I was therefore squirming at several of the early scenes. Once the cave reveals a few unexpected creatures the film moves into normal territory as the women desperately try to find the open air.<br/><br/>If you like your horror films to have lots of blood you'll love this one. It's never dull and well worth a viewing if you ever think about going pot holing."

The only reason i haven't given it a 10 is because i found the beginning build up a little predictable and not much scared me. (to be honest i found the blood more scary than the actual movie!!)

I won't tell you when or what at, though....<br/><br/>I loved Dog Soldiers, and although that movie wasn't exactly scary it had a lot of energy and was intensely exciting. This movie is all that AND scary with it.<br/><br/>All the characters come across as well drawn (just as with Dog Soldiers), so as the movie develops you know something about each of them. The movie presents them with very real pot-holing threats (cave-ins, false hope, precipices to dangle across) as well as the fantastical ones, so even when things get really outlandish you always feel a sense of reality.<br/><br/>The use of natural light really works, making the shadows very menacing indeed, you keep expecting things to jump out. The creatures are pretty horrible to behold when they appear, giving you a queasy feeling.<br/><br/>For the movie geeks among us, there are plenty of nods to other horror movies (the Shining, aliens, Carrie, the thing, to name some of the obvious ones) but you never feel the movie is derivative.<br/><br/>If you love your horror scary and gory, go see this great slice of Brit-horror!"

"philip-209","9","1","3","25 July 2005"," Finally a decent, scary horror film
","I saw the trailer for this a while back and immediately thought it looked rubbish. Another by the numbers horror film following the usual rules and ultimately leading to the usual, drab, gore-fest. How wrong I was! Off the back of a Mark Kermode review in The Observer I thought I would give it a crack - particularly as my girlfriend's a horror fan and I needed to redeem the genre after suffering her making me watch Creep. The plot is basic and borrows from numerous other horror films. Group of friends ""with issues"" get trapped in dark place with nasty things there out to get them. However, the way the material is realised on screen keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, jumping repeatedly, however telegraphed the scares are, and cringing away from the fairly gruesome gore. One scene in particular when the group use the infra red setting on a camcorder to check everyone is OK had the entire cinema (including myself) screaming - an experience completely new to me and a real pleasure to endure. The pace is very cleverly set, with a slow, but never boring, build up of menace as the women's situation plummets from bad to downright hellish, before exploding in a finale that will leave you scared, breathless and absolutely terrified of the dark. I have never ever had the desire to go potholing, but now would probably go so far as to sit through Hollow Man, Vertical Limit AND Weekend at Bernie's II before venturing below the earth's crust into a dark hole. Go and see it... please! I was really pleasantly surprised and have been telling everyone I know to go and see it whereas normally by attachment to a movie ends when I leave the cinema. What's more, Alex Reid, who plays Beth, is from my home county of Cornwall - wahay!!!"
"Bungle-9","8","1","3","13 July 2005"," Truly chilling
","Alright, let's get the bad stuff out of the way first - for me at least, the start of the movie was really boring and dire. It barely established the characters, but I think it was aimed more at bringing them all together to get a feeling of togetherness in the group. I also thought it was a bit too long.<br/><br/>OK, now that stuff is gone, lets get to the good bits. I haven't really been this chilled by a British-helmed film since I first saw Alien, and there are definitely elements of that movie (not to mention Predator too) in this little gem. Almost the entire cast is female, which makes things even more chilling as things go on. After the boring ending things really start to kick off and send shivers up your spine - some of the caving scenes in particular were extremely claustrophobic, and Marshall really ratchets up the tension at times. Some of the characters really come into their own in the caves. The movie is also quite cruel with the viewer at times, particularly at the end, but this ending and other moments in the movie demonstrate Marshall's newfound cinematic flair to great effect. Oh, and the music is fantastic!<br/><br/>Overall, this reviewer says: Dire start, bit too long, yet cinematic ally intelligent, cruel and scary as hell!"
"matley85","8","1","3","12 July 2005"," Does 'The Descent' hit rock bottom?
","Chasing his acclaimed cult first film, Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall brings us another horror flick within the same vein as that ever so comical werewolf movie. Does it hold up to it? Why yes it does!<br/><br/>Although the beginning half of the movie it doesn't appear at all to be a horror movie, instead a dramatic thriller simply about six girls who get trapped down a cave while rock climbing. It's only until an hour in when...WHAM!..the whole situation changes. The movie has a whole change of tone from tight spaces to human hunting creatures from...I've not the slightest idea where the hell from. Hmm, maybe hell, who knows.<br/><br/>It's a common writer/director technique to change the genre/tone half way in. Tarantino and Rodriguez explored this with From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). It's used to tell the story so the audience feel as shocked as the six girl had. Does it work? Indeed. The creatures are fragmented enough so that we are slowly introduced to the beautifully ugly buggers.<br/><br/>The look of the creatures is very much like the Orcs from Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and you get the impression inspiration originated from there. The make-up is the main star of the film in my opinion. Like in Dog Soldiers little digital effects are used and gives the film a more synthetic, ultimately realistic, texture.<br/><br/>The gore factor just increases as the movie goes on, and I felt a slight homage to Brian De Palma's Carrie when our main character turns almost in-humane while drenched in blood after committing several killings.<br/><br/>Overall the film qualifies with flying colours. Though the film may not be a box office success it may gather its deserved attention in DVD sales upon its release in a few months time."
"stephenmurphy28","7","1","3","11 July 2005"," Better than Dog Soldiers?
","The Descent is summarily along the lines of Dog Soldiers...WITH GIRLS!. Director Neil Marshall makes his second major feature (first being Dog Soldiers) with a story of 5 girls who get together for a yearly ritual of adventure seeking, this time being Caving. Although character development & the story unfolds well from the get-go, it does take some time for the all consuming sense of dread to creep in,even though you know that it is coming, even inside the claustrophobic caves. Although brilliantly shot once again by Marshall's regular cinematographer, Sam McCurdy, I felt that the action takes place all at once - too fast & its over before you know it. Worth a look if you like low budget horror!"
"pandabat","8","1","3","11 July 2005"," Shocks in the Dark
","I'm glad I went to this without really knowing anything at all about it. It begins in a gentle way until the main characters life becomes completely and suddenly unravelled. Cut to the future and we see her and her friends united together to go explore a cave system in the Appelachian mountains. What begins as a journey of discovery and team work descends to a journey of survival and self-preservation. The claustrophobic possibilities of caving are captured pretty well in this movie and certainly the camera angles must have been pretty hard to work out. There are shocks aplenty here and gore comes as a more than hefty side-salad. The characters are barely more than two dimensional and their decision making and rashness within the confines of the caves leaves a lot to be desired at times; in fact it borders on the laughable to see people running full speed around a cave with no protective headgear on - I'll say no more. However flaws aside, this is still a good ride. The use of women as the thrill-seeking risk takers makes a change from the muscle bound 'jocks' that we're used to and indeed later on leads to the questioning of the validity of tighter emotional bonding between women while also exploring and exploiting the exposure of women to predators in the dark. This is something that probably plays on very real fears for women in the audience but I can only speculate. As a man, I quite enjoyed it. It's sharp, shocking and packs a punch that keeps you rolling from the start of the action to the pointed finish. I tried caving once and enjoyed it. If you fancy trying it, it's probably best to try it before you watch this movie!"

Their ""fun times"" in the cabin seem forced, fake and slow, mixed in with cheap, pop out scares, however i had little invested in the characters and i found myself waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen. Secondly, the cave creature were unimaginative, unoriginal and stupid. They looked like a cheap and angry imitation of Gollum from LOTR. Apparently these creatures cannot see, hear or smell. They function totally by sonar. They also haven't evolved to use tools or weapons and can be beaten up and killed by humans. Not very scary or smart. It also make me wonder, how do these creatures actually survive underground and hunt/gather food? We see a lot of bones from dead animals, but these creatures are not smart, cunning, powerful or fast. The ending was OK, and probably the best part of the film, but it wasn't enough. Annoying, dumb and boring. Give is a miss."
"coastin_on_a_dream","9","1","4","18 January 2014"," Most overlooked horror film of the last 10 years!
","I can't believe this movie is never mentioned as one of the scariest movies of the early 2000s! Despite glowing reviews upon is release, it did not make very good money at the US box office. I guess it has gained a sort of cult status since then, but it's still very underrated and overlooked.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciate it that there is actual CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! For once! Finally! We have characters in a horror film that we care about! These characters aren't just filler characters who are lining up to be killed. They have actual purpose and real personalities. Sure, the first hour might have been a little boring because it slowly took time to build things up and develop its characters a little bit, but it pays off later because the death scenes are much more tragic and the chaos that ensues was worth the wait.<br/><br/>This movie does not hold back on gore and violence, but it is as much as a psychological thriller as it is a bloodfest! The movie really plays with your mind since the setting is so creepy and claustrophobic. The fact that they are lost hundreds of feet below the ground in a cave they can't get out of is creepy by itself, regardless of the monsters that are chasing them. Also, you can't help but wonder- has the main character merely just lost her mind? Is she imagining all of this? This is a highly effective horror film. Very few movies scare the living crap out of me, and this is the closest horror film in a very long time that has come even close to doing that. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good horror movie!"
"stephen-hoyland","3","1","4","16 August 2013"," Dark and Dreary
","A group of teenage girls go caving where they become stalked by a band of Humanoid creatures('Crawlers')who have evolved to life In the caves. While there's certainly a few suspenseful moments that will make you 'jump',what spoilt It for me was the 'silliness' of It all - I'll elaborate.... From living for however-many generations In the deep,dark caves,the creatures have become,unsurprisingly,blind. They've also lost their skin-colour and are albino. But humanoids living underground In total darkness,In a constantly freezing-cold and wet environment,would surely encourage the growth of body hair? Strangely,these creatures are completely devoid of any hair - even If they'ed manage to overcome the cold In some other evolutionary way,why would they lose their hair? It doesn't make sense. Such creatures would - with the loss of one sense(sight)have a compensatory Increase of other senses - and Indeed,these cave dwellers rely mainly on sound,having developed a highly-evolved hearing ability. This Is exemplified In a scene where a 'Crawler' passes within Inches of two girls who,staying silent,aren't detected by the creature - but surely such powerful hearing would have detected the girls breath or pounding heartbeats? And what about their sense of SMELL? We would expect this,too,to be equally evolved and surely the Crawler could have smelt the girls breath and body-odour (from a mile away,let alone just a few Inches!). Then,we have the 'night-vision'! As most people know,these superb devices gather the tiniest amounts of light,e.g. Starlight,or-on cloudy nights-even the almost indiscernible atmospheric light,and make It possible to 'see In the dark'. But,In a totally lightless,deep dark cave,there Is NO light whatsoever - night vision will not work at all In these conditions. Now,I know some people will think me petty-but for me,a horror or science-based movie has to be correct In such matters. It's those details which make the subject believable,makes you think 'Wow,this really could happen',and when the movie-makers don't bother to think these things through It spoils the whole film. All they need do Is bring In a couple of Science advisers,specialists In the particular fields of the Movies' subject matter,and such errors won't occur. My final 'complaint' - why oh why does It have to be a bunch of female teens who absolutely don't fit the bill of skilled cavers? Couldn't they have added just one thirty-something, professional woman?After all,had they done so,'killing her off' early In the film could have been the catalyst for the girls getting Into that whole load of trouble! It can't have been easy to film In all those confined spaces and I give credit for that,and the script Is quite good. If you like a movie that has the girls hiding behind a cushion,pillow or couch - then yes,It's worth a watch. But It could have been made better with a little extra thought."
"jacklmauro","4","1","4","12 December 2012"," Bats
","What bothered me the most here - aside from the darkness which, if 'realistic', annoyingly confuses the action - is that there's no momentum beyond the body count thing. This is due to the regrettable fact that, the lead woman excepted a little, the women are interchangeable and have no defining characters at all. So - when 3 gets in trouble, it may as well be 2. Back to the darkness, now: please. We get the idea, really, but we would still like to have some sense of what the hell is going on in which tunnel, and to whom. If only to also identify characters. I realize that a film like this certainly shouldn't hand us cliché characters for the sake of stamping them as individuals, but a little good writing early on would've done the job, and we would then care. As for the tech elements, no go. The creatures were strangely toothless and nailless for hunting beasts that take down large prey all the time. It's also hard to believe a spelunking expert would lead 5 (6?) others into an unknown cave for the thrill of it. Lastly, I truly don't get the Carrie ending at all. Seems like they felt that a shock was essential, set the girl in the front seat, and figured the audience can supply the...meaning."
"timaenot","2","1","4","2 October 2011"," Bad disappointment
","There were so many good reviews so I decided to watch this movie - and got completely disappointed. Do not expect too much of it. The director never can decide whether he wants to make a drama or a horror movie, and the film suffers extremely as a result. The outcome is full of pathos and unintentionally ridiculous at very many points. Neither the story of the relations between the female friends is consistent and well-told nor the horror part of the film is scary in any way because it is completely predictable. You can see at any moment when the ""horror"" is about to start. The film has no suspense, no really moving story (only some pretensions at drama which do not, as I said, get fulfilled), and it does not induce fear. The ending is nice, but does a nice ending excuse a boring and pretentious movie?"
"CaptainStrange","7","1","4","25 October 2010"," Juno is a tool
","The whole mess could've been at least partially avoided if she hadn't lied to her friends about what cave they were going to and had bothered to tell someone on the surface where they'd be and when to expect them back. Not to mention that she/they didn't have nearly enough batteries or back-up lights. Every real caver in the world has enough sense to do that so Juno's combo of egotistical fails earns her the title ""spelunker"". Not a compliment. I'm sure some of them would've still died while waiting for a rescue team to come in since those can take awhile, but they probably wouldn't have been as panicked since they would've known help was on the way.<br/><br/>I have to critique their caving styles here. Holly goes flying down the rope way too fast, on purpose, and that's just flat out unsafe. Sarah manages to get stuck in the ""tight crawl""--my arse. She had plenty of room around her to maneuver. Then there was the running. Don't get me started on the running. I don't care what's chasing you, if you take off running it's like pinning a giant ""hey cave, beat the crap out of me!"" sign on your back. I'm still not clear on why they had a pick-axe. Were they planning on doing some digging without a permit or landowner permission? Did Juno even bother to find out who owned the cave? I'm thinking no. Were they trying to create enough bad air to strangle themselves with the flares?<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed the movie until the crawlers showed up and things got really ridiculous. If they were just a hallucination they'd be tolerable but judging by the sequel, they're supposed to be real. Give me a break. At least make ""the enemy"" something that could really be down there. I try to watch this movie before every caving trip I go on because 1) it reminds of what NOT to do and 2) it's freaking hilarious and fun to watch."

As far as story is concerned, one would not find any clue why all the mess is happening and who are these creatures.

","While this movie started with promise (seriously, the first fatalities were not expected, at least not in that manner, and caused a fair few laughs amongst the group), the level of stupidity displayed by the portrayed characters was on the level of a sub-B movie. There was good development for the lead character, but the supporting characters were could only be taken at face value - interactions between characters were spelt out (and needed to be as, apart from the opening scenes, there was no in depth mention of what had happened in the past), but never in enough detail to get a good grasp on the group dynamics and the reasons why trust was already tenuous. Once the action starts, you just end up asking ""Why? Why are you being so stupid?"" The 'monsters' may as well have come straight from Weta and been called Gollum, and showed more character than most of the actors (it was easy enough to understand their motives, at least). The (uk) ending was a redeeming factor (that even though you might wish/imagine it were otherwise, reality always comes through), but the funniest and most memorable moment will always be the first fatalities of the movie... If only they had stopped there."
"cat-that-goes-by-himself","5","1","4","16 December 2007"," Not bad, but nothing worth turning your brains upside down
","What decided me to add my 2 cents to the 900+ reviews is the wave of comments of the mystical kind on this flick.<br/><br/>I guess quite a lot among us got the bit about the story being a metaphor for the main character's inner turmoil/angst/self-destructive grief/whatever. Is this a reason to worship this movie? To scrape the bottom of the barrel looking for oh-so subtle and clever clues sown by the genius director among out of focus background objects? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The psycho babble around this flick reminds me of the M. Night Shyamalan's hordes of zealots trying to enlighten the rest of the world about obsessive compulsive disorder seen as God's own secret weapon against hydrophobic aliens.<br/><br/>Come on, the gals in this movie are awfully two-dimensional, and their psychology looks more like variations on a guy's idealization of the fighting girl archetype. They are hardly anything but pretty cannon fodder (assuming G.I. Jane is your style). Frankly the director himself said that replacing the half dozen chicks with so many dudes would not have dramatically altered the plot.<br/><br/>But hey, that's just what you'd expect from a decent B movie. And, taken as such, The Descent is more than watchable. The actresses do a pretty good job portraying individuals torn between civilized habits and animal survival instinct. The big budget is not put to waste, although IMHO a cheaper production would not have hurt the movie much (and maybe allowed to shoot a couple more for the same price!). The old tricks are all out of the exploitation bag for our greatest pleasure.<br/><br/>What else could have we asked for? A bit of originality perhaps? No? That'll be only 5 stars for you, then.<br/><br/>My advice: relax and enjoy your primal claustrophobia. And find another cause to boil your brain over :)."

","I resisted giving this film a 1, because the creepy crawler were kind of scary, but the writing and acting in this film were SO BAD, I wanted to ""punch a baby"". The creepy crawlers were kind of scary at first, but totally laughable after the first couple attacks. The actresses made me WRETCH. Total freakin disaster. Embarrassed that I watched it. I could see that they were trying to say that the chick was just in her own personal hell because her kid died, but the narrative was incredibly sloppy. It was like a junior high school film project. Really budget. And what about her husband? We don't care that HE died? Then why even put him in the car. I got the feeling that there were huge pieces left out of the original story. At the end, the film almost redeemed itself when I thought that Sarah was going to get run over by an 18-wheeler,...but after 100 excruciating minutes, no pay off. BOOOO!"

","This film is one of my bigger film disappointments in recent memory. All logic thrown out the window, and replaced with fast cuts and cheap thrills. If you've seen a couple of good horror films you'll be seeing this heap of dung for what it is. <br/><br/>What sticks with me are the lines uttered by one of the heroines after momentarily spotting one of the monsters some miles down in the cave; ""I think I saw a man down here. Maybe he can help us out."" Yeah. Must have been a man. Miles down in an unaccessible cave. In pitch black darkness. Hiding from them. Making strange inhuman noises.<br/><br/>That's about the level of the dialog. Couple that with a few ""shocks"" like a bat swarm flying by, and fight scenes where you can't see what's going on, and you have an idea what this movie offers. I won't go into the logic of blind white humanoids miles down in a cave that hunt outdoors, as that's already been covered by other reviewers. However, if you do value logic in films, this one will surely disappoint. <br/><br/>3/10 (for a few moments of tension)"

","So far the 2 best horror movies of the new millennium are made by the Brits. 28 Days Later and now The Descent. I put my DVD in expected a lot after reading many reviews and wanting to see it for ages (sadly none of my friends are horror fans and I hate going to the cinema by myself) and I must say I did enjoy it. I did not expect a lot of things to happen, and although I had read many reviews, I strayed away from spoilers. The storyline, creatures and main characters may not be the most original, but dammit the made a fine movie out of it.<br/><br/>Okay so think about it; 6 girls stuck in a cave being attacked by unknown creatures. Sound original? Neh. I don't know why this film was so good. I was extremely surprised to see how much you actually see of the creatures and how often. That actually let me down a bit, I enjoy creature films more when you rarely see them. But once you see that first 'crawler' they pop up everywhere. The characters aren't exactly exciting, and I think I'm one of the few people who really disliked the sub-plot, although I thought the final scene with the birthday cake was very smart. The protagonist Sarah has the most background of the 6 girls of course, but I hoped that there would be no major character; that all 6 girls were equal in the eyes of the viewer. Sadly not. Luckily this doesn't let the film down and leads to probably the one part that scared me the most. The gore was great. Hands down. Halfway through I was thinking ""Why is this rated MA15+?"", and by the end of the movie I knew why. Not only the ending being extremely dark (UK version), the violence is very brutal when it comes. And you Brits seem to have something with eye gouging, because I've seen 3 British horrors involving some eye pushing!<br/><br/>No lengthy review here. Just to sum this up: If you like; Horror Gore UK Women Gollum from LOTR Or dark places See this dark British film. Unless your a cave explorer yourself. Then stay far, far away. 7/10."

One time I got so scared that I gave like a weird sound of me (simular to a low pitched scream hehe). This completely surprised me as I never show any emotions to movies. I re-winded the parts that scared me in hopes that it would harden me up a bit but that didn't really work.

I mean most horror films are about sex,sex,sex and a lot of bad acting, bad directing, almost bad everything. Yet this film has some very good and convincing actors for a horror movie. The descent portarys to be a film of equal adrenaline rush, thriller and horror. This film makes most adrenaline rush action films look like a joke and the suspense is like a factor of your worst nightmare. The gore and screams are just right. The fight for survival is excellent. Neil marshall is an excellent working director. I kinda think this film should'a get a golden globe for best director. It sounds strange but honestly. This film is worth the time and thrill."

","My 16 year old daughter and I just finished watching this movie and we're both still a little shaken. I know she won't' sleep well tonight! This movie was developed around a terrific idea of cave exploring. The initial cave scenes alone had my anxiety meter up really high and I'm not claustrophobic! The rest, as one reviewer eluded to, is a roller coaster of thrills, terror, hope and praying for the characters. The acting is top notch, the setting is awesome and the pace of the movie was very good. You never felt bored. Mostly you feel suspense until the terror begins. This is not a bad ""slash and gore"" movie as I typically dislike those. It does have some gore but it's just enough to scare the daylights out of you! I only gave it an 8 because the ending was a bit lame. Some may say it was a good twist but I wouldn't agree. Anyway, I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good suspense, thriller, terror movie. See it in the dark (no lights!!!). See it with a date because you'll both want someone to hold onto!"

","This movie had a great potential to be a really scary movie, I mean, I suppose it's one of the darkest movies I ever seen! Darkness suggests fear, anxiety, expectancy, tension, the strange feeling of not knowing what is right there in front of us; and I think that in a scary movie a dark ambiance is a great way to create suspense to the viewer. So, this film had it, the dark ambiance but did it create suspense? No, not at all! At least for me, it didn't. In fact, I must say that the scene which scared me the most was right there in the beginning, with an intense daylight (!) Yes, it was the car crash! Absolutely unexpected, it provoked me a felling of ""wooohhh! What was that?! Three minutes of film and we see a car crash like that! Damn!"" That really was a big surprise; the only one of the movie, the rest was very predictable. And those little creatures that were supposed to scare us I must agree with another user's comment which says ""they escaped from ""X-files""!<br/><br/>The good points of the movie are the great ambiance of the cave, really dark, claustrophobic; the tension created between the girls (the feeling of disloyalty between them, that could have been increased to make more tension to movie); and finally the gore scenes, that were not ""strong bloody horror"" as the DVD edition says, but were reasonably fine for an horror movie. I only think it was a pity that these ""nice bloody scenes"" were made by those silly ""X-files"" creatures <br/><br/>So, to sum up, it had a nice potential but got lost with some old ""horror movie's clichés""!"

When we finally settled on regular speed I could not help but muse that all their monsterness notwithstanding, most of the terrors still maintained somewhat male characteristics. Was there a subliminal message there?<br/><br/>Possibly I was trying to read too much into it. This was EC comics pure and simple, only without that scattering of voluptuous T & A interspersed in order to appeal to the puberty driven young males such as myself who bought those comics before they were banned by an act of Congress.

"Hick_N_Hixville","9","1","4","24 November 2006"," Well Done ""Butch"" Female Homage to ""Deliverance""
","This time the explorers in trouble really do have ""purdy mouths."" This movie is about what happens when a group of six (not four) thrill seeking (but inexperienced and unprepared) upper middle class professional women (not men) find out rather bluntly what happens when they ""git in there"" in those Appalachian Mountains, USA, they don't respect properly, and then ""cain't git out."" As much as I wanted to say this movie is derivative, I ""cain't."" It's well done despite having its influences show, at times, very deliberately and overtly. Before I ""git"" to the big cinematic homage this movie makes, a few words about the uncredited literary inspiration for it: the novel ""The Descent,"" by Jeff Long. The screenwriter adapted this book just obliquely enough to avoid any successful copy write or unfair usage lawsuits (assuming Long was not paid anything), but if you have read the novel (I did four years ago), you know this movie likely would not exist in its actual realized form if that nook had not been published. Long's work is more epic in scope and globe-trotting in its setting than this movie, and the book's plot details are different, including a bizarre scene where female cave mutants surface, waylay and sexually ravage a pubescent boy, then rip off the hapless kid's penis during a frenzied effort to ""revive"" him once he is ""exhausted."" The reason I mention that little, almost seemly incidental item from Long's thick book is that this movie is completely devoid of anything like that. The movie's horror elements are raw, direct, and not in the least campy. Changing Jeff Long's plot around by making it into a powerful re-imagining of James Dickey's ""Deliverance,"" and then avoiding the most obvious homage it could pay to it (a homage that was a central, not incidental part of Dickey's masculine work, but would destroy ""The Descent"") is what makes this movie work so well.<br/><br/>There is an opening sequence of the women rafting down a whitewater river somewhere in Britain (right hand driving shown), not in canoes, but in big ""tourist guide"" style rubber rafts. This establishes an immediate and direct link to its predecessor, without any lengthy exposition to bog down the plot. The women are obviously weekend thrill seekers (whitewater) but not overly skilled at what they do (rubber rafts). Tragedy follows thrills when one woman's family is killed in a nasty car accident after they have picked her up at the river take out point. Flash quickly to the following year when the sextet meet again for their annual adventure, this time somewhere in ""Appalachian Mountains, USA."" More specifically, according to a highway road sign, in the fictional ""Chattooga National Park (hummm)."" There is a brief flurry of bad jokes among the women about hoedowns and some nondescript banjo music on the radio in one of the two SUVs (as in ""Deliverance"" there are two vehicles) while the group wends its way deeper into the mountainous forest. One of the women, the leader, jokes about not having been lost in her life.<br/><br/>Instead of rafting, the danger device here is spelunking. The leader conveniently and deliberately chooses to leave the cave guidebook behind in the glove compartment just as leader Burt refused directions to the river thirty-four years ago. To do anything else would defeat the point of it all, right? There is no need to take the book anyway, because the cave they are going in isn't even in it. Needless to say, once underground, the women do get ""lost"" in many ways, and encounter serious troubles brought on both by their arrogance and lack of caving experience. One woman has a serious accident that results in a nasty surface leg break, complete with protruding bone (sound familiar?), and they of course encounter rather disgusting ""locals"" down there. Inbred these cave dwellers no doubt are, but they are more like Jeff Long's more extreme example of parallel hominid evolution than James Dickey's sociopathic rednecks. There is a sequence where one of the women falls down a pit into a pool of water and ""embraces"" a prone cave dweller, but with a nicely different result than in the similar incident with John Voight and the toothless man at the base of Tallulah Gorge.<br/><br/>""Deliverance"" is everywhere in this movie, except refreshingly in the one place where it indeed should not be. You just knew, going in, that at least one of those women would have to be, uh, ""violated,"" by these cave critters right? Nine out of ten Hollywood based American hack screenwriters and directors would have played it that way of course, and the movie would have fallen apart. It doesn't happen here, and that could be due to yet another parallel to ""Deliverance."" Both movies were made by British directors, John Boorman in the original case, Neil Marshall of ""Dog Soldiers"" notoriety doing this movie.<br/><br/>""Deliverance"" was filmed on location in Appalachia. ""The Descent"" was not. It was filmed as a UK original release movie in Scotland and England. I am not sure exactly where in Scotland (if anyone knows, email me the specifics) the ""Appalachia"" sequences were filmed, but for a production company restricted to Britain (I am assuming because of budget) they did very well in picking their shooting locales. They avoided the usual treeless highland moors that wouldn't pass for the Blue Ridge or Cumberland Plateau. The fall landscape that did use (oak and maple leaves on the ground in thickly wooded karsty terrain) sort of does look like the Southeastern Mountains of the USA, yet not exactly (too many evergreens along the roadway). In this lushly wooded part of Scotland substituting for Southern Appalachia, the surreal misty intro is yet even more evocative of its inspiration.<br/><br/>Go see it. If you like adventure movies, or horror movies that build on their inspiration without being a simple rehash of old tricks and clichés, you won't be disappointed."
"mnavarra","5","1","4","6 September 2006"," Ordinary horror movie with shallow ending
","I am really astonished by the positive comments this movie received. In fact, the Descent is not as bad as other horror flicks I've seen recently, but the plot is quite banal, the story - as well as the horror scenes - are definitely shallow and boring. One of the girls is painted as an adventurous bitch who lies about the site they are exploring, so as to discover unexplored caves lost in the middle of nowhere, putting all her friends' lives in danger. Eventually she is left behind by the only surviving girl; I think this could have been better explained and portrayed, since the ""social"" dynamics in a suffocating and claustrophobic environment (as a cave actually is) would have provided the movie with a nice and fresh touch I have not seen in it. Not a horrible movie after all, but nothing special."
"Jimkowal","5","1","4","29 August 2006"," Disappointing plot and storyline
","A disappointing movie. The cinematography and acting were fine, and the special effects were OK, but the plot line was strange: the whole opening sequence involving one character's family and the automobile accident seemed out of place and unnecessary for the remainder of the film (though it was one of the more horrifying scenes of the movie). Similarly, the ending involving the last two characters was completely out of the blue (and out of character) and sad, in a way. There was not enough character development to understand this ending, and the little there was made the ending perplexing.<br/><br/>Rather disappointing overall to me because the reviews implied a better movie."
"Wldkarrde8","5","1","4","20 August 2006"," Lost In The Dark
","What I liked about this film was its simplicity. The claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the cave had me scared...even more so than the porn level dialogue (the scenes between the women before going into the cave felt as if it were written by someone who'd either never met a woman, or real human for that matter ) that preceded it.<br/><br/>Getting stuck in the cave was almost all you needed to make this into an exciting film...then came the albino bat people. It's not like there was no fun to be mined by their introduction, the problem was simply that the fun was over with ten minutes into it as Marshall's script relied more on the audiences good will than character or film-making prowess (both of which were seemingly on better display in DOG SOLDIERS).<br/><br/>The character of Juno accidentally kills one of her friends, the key here is accidentally...we SEE the accident...we KNOW it was an accident. She didn't do much to try and haul her friend's corpse through the narrow caves to the surface was her only crime, and frankly I could empathize. Yet this was the driving force for the rest of the film...Juno was turned into the bad guy, similar to the Paul Reiser character from Alien's...just without any of the real bad guy motivation.<br/><br/>This alone kind of gave the ending of the film a flat tire that it never recovered from. We were supposed to route for our lead character of Sarah to kill Juno as retribution...but it felt more like a cold-blooded murder. Sarah had lost her husband and daughter at the start of the film...this element has NOTHING to do with the rest of the film save some residual pity she receives the first half of the film. Juno apologizes for not sticking around long after that accident - but what was she to do then? Move in with Sarah? Now that WOULD BE a horror...the overly empathic friend who wouldn't leave.<br/><br/>The film isn't without merits...it just doesn't merit $10.75 at the theater door. It's more of a good late night cable offeringor a discount DVD rental."

","OK, i was thoroughly angry at the end of this debauchery. first of all, the ending made no sense, they just stopped the movie when it could've actually gotten good. second of all, the first 30-45 minutes of the film have practically no relevance to the rest of it. at the outset (after the first 15 minutes), i expected a real neat story with some surreal twists and turns and some profound meaning/ outcome. sadly, what i found out after an excruciating and repetitive 2 hours was that the first 45 minutes of the movie in no way effected the remainder of it. it seemed to be random filler (although it had good potential if it had some better writing). and another thing, the ""crawlers"" seemed to have no trouble taking down a full-grown moose or bear, but for some reason couldn't quite handle the physical force of a 95-pound Asian woman. after about 8 times, i got sick of the same method of killing them with a pick-axe through the skull. and lastly, the special effects and digital imagery were blatantly half-assed. so basically, i left the theater disappointed whole-heartedly. what should have been an edge-of-your-seat horror by the looks of the trailers and beginning of the movie, yielded nothing more than a few cheap laughs between me and my buddies regarding the film's credits and how morgan freeman could have made it a decent movie with no more than a simple cameo. i mean, the least they could've done was add a simple topless scene. i mean, the whole cast consisted of like 6 women; throw a bone to the guys in the audience who wasted 8 dollars to see the thing, or worse $16 if they had a date. don't see this movie. anyone who says otherwise is a moron."

","The good-- plenty of gore, good creature effects, the instensity, the claustrophobia, some shocking, surprising, and outstanding death scenes; apparently there's some story twists here and there. The bad-- no full-frontal female nudity; unattractive cast; excessive loud sound effects; indistinguishable characters, even though some folks have pointed out that the lighting is supposed to help us identify the characters, not even that works; no male characters; the telling of the story is hindered by the annoying English accent that is undeciphrable, unless you're used to it, you're going to feel like Sledgehammer listening to the Scottland Yard guy; unrealistic premise, are we supposed to believe that these women hike and climb into caves without guidance, communication, or male companions. Yeah right. The ugly-- anti-male sexism. When the director said that this movie was to be a horror movie for women he immediately made it clear that he doesn't care for his male audience, that is, the the people who make up 98% of horror movie fandom. I was offended by that. Luckily, as the dismal box office for this movie shows, female movies goers are normal and healthy and don't fall for this nonsense- they happen to want to see strong male characters. This is the second movie this year, after Silent Hill, that makes the point of not having males in it. What the hell is the matter with these people? For decades now Hollywood has been trying to work toward a global matriarchy by making males the buffoons and the butts of all jokes, while the women are the wise, smart, witty, strong, aggressive characters. So that's their BS political agenda of girl power and helping the supposedly once oppressed. Fine, I'm getting used to that since it's so transparent and it's part of the self-hatred of psychotic Hollywood homosexual males. But that European directors, Cristoph Gans and now this Marshall guy are taking sick ideologies of hatred to the max by making movies sans males is incomprehensible and reproachable. I was planning on not seeing this movie as male fan of horror but after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews I decided to see it, knowing full well that I would be exposed to this sexism. This movie, just like Dog Soldiers, is overrated. They are good, but not THAT good. I suspect that most of the glowing positive reviews are by Hollywood/media psychopaths who fully support the extermination of men from the media."

","The Descent is a highly predictable summer horror movie, at best. Sure, there is always the initial shocking event that serves as the backdrop for one or more characters as they face baddies throughout the movie. But this movie serves up the loss of a family in a way that is trite and seems to say, ""and this is why she will be the obvious survivor at the end"". As for the actual sequence of events in the caves, anyone who has ever seen a horror movie can tell by the cinematography what is about to happen. For instance, when an actress's face fills the entire screen with a look of relief after killing some monster you can bet the farm that when the camera zooms out a little we will be ""shocked"" to see yet another baddie sneaking in behind her. Perhaps most disappointingly though is the fact that the single most predictable BUT very scary thing that could have happened didn't...the spelunkers among you know...loss of light!! Yes, these women were going to what they thought was a ""tourist"" cave and brought what appeared to be a year's supply of artificial light sources...battery-powered headlamps and flashlights, cyalume sticks and flares, oh my!! I thought this film could take some tips from ""Pitch Black"" and use the dark as it's most menacing and terrible element but instead even when the character on screen had no light source there was still ample light to film by...two miles underground!"

The movie was predictable and I could easily guess when something was about to jump out of the shadows and really be a harmless friend of the people.

What I found really irritating was that for half the movie it made sense: friends and fellow spelunkers carry out plan of indulging in favorite sport, while comforting bereaved friend; very economical of them. Then instead of following the established plot line, right about in the middle of the film, it turns 180 degrees in believability and becomes a monster movie. The monsters were scary, I'm not arguing they weren't, but I thought the introduction of hungry night vision monsters unnecessary.

How do they kill wolves when they have insurmountable difficulties killing or even perceiving 50kg women with no combat experience whatsoever is beyond me. Of course these creatures pop out of nowhere on screen with lots of noise when a 5-year old might think everything is okay. It was actually quite stupefying to see so many horror-clichés one after the other after another. <br/><br/>A movie that had started out very promising had me yawning and waiting it to be over during the last 50 minutes."

","What we have here is a feminist horror movie, a girl-powered festival of monsters. That idea has some originality, some possibilities for innovation, and you're going to see that in the movie: it isn't just another movie about monsters who live in caves.<br/><br/>My gripe with it was the same as many other horror movies: why do the characters have to do the dumbest possible things? Maybe that was intentional on the part of the screenwriter and director. They argue with each other, have emotional crisis, take out their frustrations on each other. I would hate to be caught in a cave full of monsters with this bunch.<br/><br/>As in many horror movies, in any situation you can rely on the characters to make exactly the wrong decision, to your eternal frustration. I tried screaming at the TV but they didn't seem to hear me, and continued blundering around the cave being eaten.<br/><br/>The girls aren't all experienced cavers, either, which strikes me as horrendously stupid. You're going to take a bunch of non-experienced people on a major exploration? Someone needs to question their judgement on that. It must have sounded like a good plot device on paper.<br/><br/>And hey, it's a horror movie, where is the schlock? I was hoping for some hot lesbians, some mud wrestling, maybe even a scene where the monsters discover girls are good for more than just dinner. Male chauvinist horndogs beware: the sleaze factor is non-existent.<br/><br/>For something similar, with a better plot and smarter characters, see Creep."

","I wanted to watch this movie because the synopsis looked interesting. I knew that it was strictly a female cast of main characters but that didn't really bother me much. The movie moves very slowly and nothing about, 'being trapped in a cave pursued by strange predators' happens until the last 30 minutes or so. My father got up after the first half an hour. My older brother, fifteen minutes later. I suffered for another fifteen minutes but decided to skim through the ending because I could not justify wasting any more time on such a poor excuse for an 'adventure movie'. If the whole movie had been in the style of the last 30 minutes, I would have rather this higher. Too little too late, I'm afraid. Very disappointed."

I watched this with my girlfriend and she could only remember one characters name. There was too much build up and not enough action, all the back story ruined it. Was a good idea but the plot but the characters wasn't really up to par to what i would've expected. You also couldn't see anything to what was happening in the film, it was basically ""lets go into this cave - whats what! - oh no - urgh! - Run Forrest RUN!""). The soundtrack i also found off putting as it was very similar to the theme of The Thing.

","While the idea of being trapped in a cave IS terrifying, that's about the only thing this movie got right. Honestly, there's too many horror movies where the characters are dumb as rocks, and that's why they got themselves in a horrible situation in the first place. This is no different. Not only that, I don't understand why Sarah betrayed Juno in the end. Was she mad about Beth? Or something that happened in the past? What Juno did to Beth was obviously an accident. And how did Sarah come to the conclusion that Juno did it on purpose from the flipping necklace? That ending confused the hell out of me. I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit throughout this film. I don't know why it got such a high rating. Also, what was with all those cheap jump scares? That's how you know the rest of the movie is total bullshit."

","I just saw it for the first time, and ten minutes later, I'm still in disbelief. How does this have a 7.2 rating on this site? In my opinion, this movie could have been so much better. <br/><br/>I feel like the entire premise falls short. The underlying story that moves this film along just kinda sags. I didn't feel much sympathy for the characters because there wasn't much to them. I thought the part where Sarah (yeah, spoilers) stabbed Juno in the leg was stupid. I mean come on, at least get out first and then talk about that. Sure she was hysteric, but from a survival standpoint, it doubles her chances of getting out alive if they work together. The only reason she left Beth was because there was nothing she could do. It was obvious she wasn't gonna make it. It was an accident! Geez luis. Ya know it's bad when the movie tried to be smart but ended up looking stupider for it.<br/><br/>The Descent tries to set up this emotional framework by that sudden, tragic car crash in the beginning, but it just didn't connect for me. I didn't like Sarah! She kept doing stupid things like wandering off alone and giving snarky comments instead of being helpful. Somehow she turns into a cave assassin, defeating any monster that gets in her way. Instead of pity, I felt annoyed, especially at the film's wonky wishy-washy ending. It felt forced. Another attempt at trying to look smart. I feel like that birthday cake theme (i.e. Sarah's dead child) was undeveloped, and to leave the viewer on that note didn't work for me. What about her husband? No cake for him?<br/><br/>Time for the antagonists (excluding dumb Sarah). The monsters were unexplained, generic Gollum-ites. Jump scares abound in this spelunking misadventure. I felt more sickened than scared, honestly, especially when Juno accidentally killed Beth (that was the grossest part). I thought Holly's leg injury was unrealistic. Bone poking out of your leg?! You'd be in way more pain than that! Not to mention her running off recklessly was remarkably inane. <br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't for me. Stacked up, the convenient coincidences were (cave in, no book, new cave system, lost gear, running blindly into a hole, completely unexplained monsters, killing your friend, then same friend tells Sarah stupid stuff, then because of faint backstory and reasons Sarah effectively kills Juno...........etc. etc.).<br/><br/>tldr; I didn't like it. Mostly Sarah. THE END."
"xara-59700","4","1","5","26 March 2017"," Nice claustrophobia- feel, horrible dialogue
","Semi- original idea with a claustrophobic anguish successfully construed. The dialogue is horribly poor- unfortunately so much so that the actors seem like amateurs. However, the dialogue is as good as can be if written for female characters by a man who has never experienced women outside of ""sex and the city""- which was also written for men by men. If the movie was written by a professional (aka a person who can cover these aspects needed to be covered in the story) it would make a hell of a difference. One could then even forgive the lack of muscle power in these cliffhanger's arms as well as the fact that they seem to have orgasms while hooking the ceiling to rope.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","5","8 December 2007"," This is Alien underground; and even then, it's all a bit silly.
","The Descent seems to be a film that has tricked people; it has tricked people into thinking that what it is they are seeing is new, original and fresh yet at the same time: scary, unpredictable and violent. I would argue back that The Descent is nothing more than a going through of the motions that made films like Alien and the original Dawn of the Dead the successes they are. I remember seeing Dog Soldiers, director Neil Marshall's first film, and being impressed with how he got across an atmosphere of no-hope; how he set the situation up with the soldiers and how he actually had the intelligence to at least acknowledge what sources he was getting his ideas from: in that case, it was Zulu as stated by one of the characters as they held up inside an old country house  I liked the twist ending more in that film, also.<br/><br/>Here, instead of trained soldiers who you would think are up to the task of defeating whatever beasts lie ahead; we are given half a dozen of your everyday British girls who are into boyfriends, clubbing, driving dangerously, hard drinking and..........climbing and cave dwelling. Here, you could say there is an excuse for the stupidity since they aren't going to be prepared for what awaits them unlike the soldiers were but then again, half way through The Descent; the women are strong enough and hard bodied enough to actually fight back against these cave monsters: and there's me thinking it would just be lambs to the slaughter but it turns out they're up for the scrap much like the soldiers were in Dog Soldiers. But wait a minute  hard bodied, trained soldiers going up against beasts of some kind in a last stand scenario? That was Dog Soldiers; it would seem Marshall has made the exact same film only replace 'soldiers' with 'women' and delete 'trained' altogether out of the last sentence.<br/><br/>Yes, there is no originality here in fact Marshall has just remade his last film. The characters don't need to be women in fact they are written as male characters BY an actual male  Marshall probably just thought he'd be clever by changing the gender at the last minute; Queer theory fanatics will no doubt have a field day in deciphering what that all means, the result of which will probably culminate in them thinking the writer doesn't or hasn't known many women in the past. The Descent is Alien in a cave; but unlike Dog Soldiers, no girl ever comes up with the line: ""It's just like that film: Alien!"" The film begins in a tragic and eerie way and follows on with one character, as they walk through the woods before they get to the cave entrance, exclaiming some sort of warning: Watch out for hallucinations; paranoia; schizophrenia; etc. is her advice  one question: why would she say all this and does she know something we don't? ""Watch out for film clones"" would be my advice to any one about to sit through this film. The girl also carries around a hand-held camera, filming her expedition which is something I remember Tarantino announcing that he hated in an interview once: but the POV shot from the DV camera is more a spoof of Aliens than that of a cliché.<br/><br/>Once we are at the entrance and in; the girls do their very best to find the smallest and tightest crevice they can in order to trap themselves into. They do a good job since one such scene involves a girl who it would appear is, (wait for it), actually afraid of small spaces that gets stuck in a tiny, tiny tunnel as the ceiling begins to move down on top of them. Then the first of, well, two twists: it appears that no one actually brought a map but that isn't the twist because one such character has some dark reasons: at this point you'd probably want to bang your head on the cave's rocky wall but then you remember you're not actually in the film since you've seen it all before anyway and haven't been absorbed at this point. Following on from this, The Descent for the next forty or so minutes turns into a series of obligatory jumps: I am amazed at how many people like this film  it can't be the star power selling it and it isn't the level of gore so what is it that's so good about it? The jumps, for the record consist of: Bats flying out into a characters face; someone looking down a narrow gap only to turn around and have a buddy in their face and of course: ""Let's show the monster piece by piece in fast flash-bys."" Ridley Scott should sue.<br/><br/>I admit that The Descent had me entertained and thinking what would happen at certain times. This was when the team got split up and had to fend for themselves and the final thirty minutes reminded me of Apocalypto; a film that hadn't been made yet. The film's crucible is also much better than Aliens' (Cameron's 'attempt') since it engages us and doesn't resort to cheesy one-liners and mindless gun toting action. Instead, it references Apocalypse Now and Predator in two immediate compositions (coming out of the swamp/avoiding detection of beast) but also gives us a deadly game of cat and mouse between the girls and the monsters  often chase, often 'how do I get out of this situation'. The Descent wasn't a film I liked and can't say was great but it quenches the cheap thrills thirst although I was expecting a little more."

The characters could have used some more depth.<br/><br/>The characters weren't the only flaw in the movie. Actually, things meant well for the first half, and then turned into an unnecessary gorefest in the latter half. I had some problem with this. The premise of the story turned on its head... there was no explanation or anything in the story to suggest the direction that the story took in the latter half. Not only was it stupid, it served no other function but to provide creepy crawlers to scare the characters (and the audience) until the end. That's all. The tension and fear in cave climbing took a backseat and suddenly we have an incredibly bloody night of the dead inside a cave. This deterioration, for me, was unforgivable. And that is why I rated this movie a 3. It reminded me too much of Freddie vs Michael, another mindless gorefest."

There is good gore and good scares to be had. The movie works great once the girls move underground. At that point, the girls don't really have to be distinctive to be good. That is one of the minor problems of the movie. The girls are not unique enough. The movie should have started with the two most important personalities Sarah and Juno.

"MaximumMadness","5","1","6","15 December 2013"," A Minority Opinion: ""The Descent"" just isn't the masterpiece of modern horror that it's made out to be... In fact, it's quite basic, bland and left a sour taste in my mouth.
","Back in 2006, there was a major burst of hype surrounding the British horror film ""The Descent."" Boasting strong critical acclaim and a great word-of-mouth, many were even so bold as to claim it was one of the greatest horror films since ""The Exorcist."" The hype was inescapable for a horror fan like myself, and I eagerly anticipated this supposed modern masterpiece of terror and psychological horror.<br/><br/>Finally it was opening day here in the states. My best friend and I trekked the two-mile walk to our local theater, bought our tickets and plopped down in our seats. Utterly prepared to be thrilled, chilled and left in awe after all that we had heard.<br/><br/>Two hours later, stumbling from the theater, we didn't say a word for a few minutes. Then my friend quietly interjected a thought: ""I didn't like it."" I nodded, finally bursting out what I had been thinking since the credits began to role: ""Yeah... it wasn't anywhere near as good as everyone was saying."" The next half-hour, as we strolled back to my house, we analyzed the film, discussing its uneven use of violence, its reliance on clichés, its messy metaphors... We just couldn't find the quality needed to justify the near-constant praise we had heard sung for so many months before its release.<br/><br/>And it really was a disappointment. I was a fan of director Neil Marshall's excellent ""Dog Soldiers"", and for what its worth, the film does deliver some exquisitely well-done set-pieces and gives us some decently developed characters. But it wasn't enough. And to be honest... it wasn't any deeper, more developed or more unique than any other create-feature film I had seen in recent history. Heck, I'd go so far as to say it was one of the more bland and basic creature-features I've ever seen, since it really isn't dark or oppressive enough to be memorable, nor is it fun enough to warrant multiple viewings. It just sort of... ""exists"" as ""just another horror flick.""<br/><br/>We follow a group of six women who travel overseas to go on a spelunking adventure in North Carolina. Our main focus is Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), a woman left scarred from the tragic (and brutally violent) death of her husband and daughter in a car accident sometime earlier. However, the trip takes a dark turn when the group becomes desperately lost in an unknown cave system following a cave-in. Adding to the tension, they also realize the dark, twisted caverns are home to a group of humanoid, cave-dwelling creatures who soon begin to attack them.<br/><br/>The cast is actually very good, in particularly Macdonald, who brings a lot of emotion, pathos and strength to her role. And to the credit of director Marshall's script, each of the women is generally well- developed and defined as a character. Although perhaps not quite as much as I'd like. Especially as in retrospect, it's hard to remember anything about most of the characters.<br/><br/>The direction is also fairly solid. Particularly during earlier sequences in the cave system (before the introduction of the creatures, called ""crawlers""), which are fantastic, claustrophobic and very well- executed sequences. However, everything before and after does suffer for me. An opening sequence pertaining to the death of Sarah's family feels overly exploitive in its cruel and borderline mean-spirited depiction of a woman's loss (including some schlock-tastic gore during the car-accident that felt unneeded and there just to force home how awful it really is), and once the creatures are introduced, the direction does begin to feel a little too basic and even bland.<br/><br/>I also take issue with how much the film does rely on clichés, tropes and conventions of not only horror, but film in general. It wasn't all that daring an effort. And it was the biggest problem I had, since you could pretty much guess what was going to happen at every twist and turn during the story. <br/><br/>To be honest, I just don't get the hype. The film at times felt like a halfway-decent ""Aliens"" knock-off, and at others just sort-of felt like a bigger budget version of an old SyFy channel original movie. It did nothing for me to justify its massive hype, nor did it feel original in any way. It was just an average horror film than felt basic and bland as a result of it being not all that notable. I honestly do think the hype that was built up in the US was because it was a foreign horror film, and they are generally given more lenient coverage by American critics than American horror films, simply because they are made outside of the Hollywood studio system. Because I guarantee if this was made by an American director with an American cast, it would not have achieved nearly as high a score as this film did.<br/><br/>I give ""The Descent"" a mediocre 5 out of 10. Give it a shot, since many people seem to enjoy it. But I wouldn't be surprised if more people start to see it from my perspective over time."
"automorphism","2","1","6","6 June 2010"," Pointless and Not Scary
","The two stars are for the few good points in this movie. There are worse movies out there, but I haven't seen many of those.<br/><br/>To start I'm a casual horror fan. It's not my main genre but I love to be scared once in a while. Unfortunately nothing in this movie is scary.<br/><br/>I won't go over much of the plot. Basically a group of women explore a cave. They don't know that there are strange creatures inside the cave.<br/><br/>The first problem is that there is so much shrill screaming from the all-female cast. A few screams here and there are fine, but you'd think half the script called for screaming. After twenty minutes this became unbearable for me. Nevertheless I continued watching the movie.<br/><br/>The encounters with the creatures are bland and not scary. Part way through the movie I checked to see how much time there was left, and I usually never do that. Although being stuck in a cave seems like it could add to the horror, I never felt a sense of claustrophobia like there could have been, and most of the time the characters acted like they were on a movie set rather than a real cave.<br/><br/>The creatures to me didn't seem that dangerous, and I could probably have killed twenty while eating dinner.<br/><br/>There was a bit of tension between the characters but it was mostly high-school type drama. Definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, and my expectations are usually quite low."

I've even seen people suggest that this movie has strong characterisation, may I suggest they need to watch more varied kinds of movies!!

","As a horror movie fan, i thought why not write my first review about a film from my favourite genre? I saw The Descent at the cinema last night. I went to see it because not only is it a horror film, it's made by the same guy who gave us the fantastic Dog Soldiers. Unfortunately i didn't find it to be anywhere near as good as Dog Soldiers is. One of the main problems is the characters. The acting is fine but i didn't like any of the characters and the main one, Sarah, really wore on my nerves. I spent the entire film hoping she would get killed off. The first half of the film until the monsters show up did get slightly boring and when the monsters did make their appearance, they weren't really that scary. They were well done but reminded me of Gollum from the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. In fact the film isn't really that scary at all. There are the usual fake scares- bats flying out of a cave, a character turning around to find another character right behind them etc and its all things we've seen before. Having said that there are a couple of very good moments involving an infrared camcorder and a case of mistaken identity between two of the characters which brought the film up in my estimation. There is some gore which is well done. One thing that is extremely effective is the setting. Being claustrophobic i felt uncomfortable on more than one occasion watching the girls crawl through tiny tunnels that could collapse at any moment and on leaving the cinema i genuinely felt as if i had been down in the caves with these characters. However despite the great setting, good effects and a couple of decent moments, i still found this movie to be a disappointment. I can't really say exactly why and i wouldn't discourage others from seeing it as you may get far more out of it than i did. I don't think its a bad film, i just didn't find it to be that great. A case where i liked the trailer more than the film."

This accusation is complete and utter bull****! Sure Juno kills Beth, however Beth should NOT have come up behind Juno so abruptly, as Juno was obviously in the midst of defending herself against the crawlers. And Beth KNOWS its was an accident, yet she plays it off as if Juno did this on purpose later on when Sarah finds Beth dying.<br/><br/>And so it's after this point that the entire film demonizes Juno because she slept with Sarah's husband. Surely Juno is in the wrong here yes, however Sarah proves herself to be a completely irredeemable piece of garbage, as she not only uses Juno to fight off the crawlers at the end, but she quite literally stabs Juno in the back (or leg rather) and leaves Juno for dead! NOT a proportionate response. Oh, and Juno refuses to leave without Sarah, a sentiment which Sarah obviously does not reciprocate.<br/><br/>The film ends as if to make Sarah out to be the good guy, but this entire tone is off, as Sarah is clearly in the wrong here.

I read about it in a newspaper and it said it was directed by the same man who directed Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall, so I thought it had to be good. I knew it wouldn't be the same as Dog Soldiers, but it had a lot of similarities, such as the team of close friends going on an expedition, they're trapped and attacked by a pack of creatures. My friend jumped at most of the scenes but it was due to the loud noises that jumped out when one of the creatures attacked. I thought that the creatures could have been a little better designed seeing as in Marshall's Dog Soldiers a lot of work was put into the werewolves, and the Crawlers looked a lot like a cross between Gollum from LOTR and the Ubervamps in Buffy. Aside from having a different story and different characters and such, this film felt a lot like 28 Days Later. My overall rating would be 6 out of 10. I wouldn't see it at the cinema twice, but I'd buy it on DVD to watch every so often. As I said, it's not a bad film."

They seemingly kill for no reason - and I make that claim based on the huge number of animal bones from game which must have provided them with many large meals.<br/><br/>The girls in this are quite ridiculous - all that screaming and rushing around (resulting in accidents). Half the time you can't even understand what they're saying. What was the point of the car accident at the beginning? It doesn't make the main character any stronger.

","In Director Neil Marshall's (DOG SOLDIERS) THE DESCENT, a sudden tragedy leads Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) into a period of recovery, culminating in a caving trip w/ her friends. Things quickly get out of hand, as the group finds itself not only up against the forces of nature, but things quite unnatural and deadly. True to the title, the rest is a journey deep into the Earth, the bonds of friendship, and the human soul. Visceral, jarring, and terrifying, this film uses darkness, tight spaces, and labyrinthine tunnels to create a suffocating atmosphere of creeping dread and doom. The all-female cast delivers a collectively convincing performance. However, the growing tension between Sarah and the headstrong Juno (Natalie Mendoza) takes center stage. While the horror around them grows, and the death toll mounts, secrets are revealed from which there is no turning back. Marshall takes full advantage of his tangibly claustrophobic sets, causing us to tighten up and squirm along w/ the characters. The aptly named ""crawlers"" are original and well-realized. They're also scary as hell! Gruesome, primal, and frenzied, this movie still manages to have perfect moments of poignancy. A masterpiece of its genre... P.S.- Of the two different endings -the more hopeful theatrical release or the utterly hopeless, original director's cut version- I personally prefer the latter, as it ties in w/ several foreshadowing sequences..."

","5 August 2006. Warning: Spoilers. A nice idea, but one that descends into something indistinguishable from other horror/action/thrillers. What begins uneven with a oddly, unnatural hospital scene where bystanders seemingly ignore this poor woman in agony, continues with a new idea of having sex somewhat strong female personalities with some abilities at typical male sports - rafting and cave exploration, and introduce a somewhat different dark, cavernous action thriller, with somewhat monster-type things thrown in. We have the typical stereotypical characters - the young brash funky kid, the macho-adventure seeker, the more humble hurt female, and the rest of the women bound for possible slaughter. There is an eerie resemblance with Silence of the Lambs with one of our strong woman running through the woods towards the beginning of the film. There is the Alien scene of water dripping and the face pointed upwards. There is a fascinating contrast to classic The Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) with the underground, claustrophobic shots done with excellent effect in both movies. There is even the Alien scene in the director's cut with Dallas wanting to die at the end of the movie. Finally there are similarities to The Blair Witch Project (1999) with camera, photographic technique in places.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this movie, the intelligent, qualitatively superior female potential of this movie descending to the typical (unfortnately perhaps realistic) scene reminiscent from Aliens when the soldiers get trapped underground and almost seemingly go from crack soldier to blind idiots. Unlike the classic Alien and Ripley, the heroine, who is able to project both strength but presence of mind and humanity, this movie entertains the typical descent into hell and The Predator - the kill or be killed mentality - no questions asked. The movie tries, with good intention, but ends up somewhat manipulative, somewhat artificial.<br/><br/>This is a watchable, but not more scary movie than any other. What is has going for it is its new, fresh, taking an old idea and making it better. Except, for example, the worn out ending shot. Six out of Ten Stars."

I don't have a problem with movies that have a slower pace, but this one didn't need it as much as others. It wasn't as if it was long for the purpose of telling a story, but it was long just because it took them a long time to climb. My joke was that the first half of the movie is just them breathing, but its actually somewhat true. If there was more background about the characters, their relationship and the tragedy we see at the beginning, it would make us care more about them. However, there is only a brief scene at the beginning showing what happened. Before the cave crawlers show up, there is a lot of silence, breathing and squeezing through holes. After they show up, its a constant frenzy, although it does have an added element of tension that was hinted at in the first half. I feel like if the movie had maintained a balance of tension, story and background about the characters, it would have been better off. For what it is, it definitely does have some parts that are somewhat emotionally resonant and some parts that are very disturbing, but there is not enough story for how long this movie was."

","This movie had potential to be great. I thought the premise was very intruiging: a group of women get lost while spelunking and come to discover they're being hunted by humanoid monsters. The problem is the director/writer had no idea how to create tension so the most important aspect of this movie, the horror, is left up to jump scares, and not effective ones at that. Not surprisingly, the creatures don't even show up until the halfway point, because the creator clearly couldn't come up with more than 40 minutes of being hunted by monsters. As it is, it gets repetitive after 5 minutes. On top of that, it has the most unlikeable protagonist, Sarah, I've seen in quite awhile. Her character is subject to the worst of horror movie cliches, by making idiotic decisions no real person would make, all for the sake of setting up an obvious scare. What's even more suprising, is that the secondary character, Juno, was far more interesting, and was by far the stand out of the movie. If you want to see a good psychological thriller about a group of women exploring the unknown, go watch Annihilation. If you want to see a tense horror movie about blind creatures that hunt by sound, go see A Quiet Place. Either of those movies has far more to offer in terms of unsettling horror, well executed jump scares when logical, and superior characters with understandable motivations.

"shannen-l-c","7","0","2","16 March 2018"," Claustrophobic horror with tonnes of potential
","Being a huge horror fan, 'The Descent' is a film that comes up again and again on ""best of horror"" lists on all sites across the internet. Whilst I do understand why, I think that 'The Descent' is generally overrated and accredited far too much within the horror genre. In this review I'll attempt to give a balanced analysis that covers all bases without revealing any major spoilers (although there will be minor ones that are in-keeping with what can be learned from reading summaries and watching trailers). <br/><br/>'The Descent' has a lot of promise, that much is true. The cave setting makes for a very claustrophobic and apprehensive mood which is definitely one of the strong points of the movie. There are definitely some very tense scenes that are incredibly boxed in and create a sense of panic that would not be as keenly felt in a different setting. The setting also allows for some interesting lighting, which further adds to the atmosphere whilst not relating too heavily on night-vision cameras (which is a trait of horror movies I dislike). <br/><br/>The movie is held together by a rather strong cast of female leads - Shauna Macdonald (Sarah), Natalie Mendoza (Juno), Alex Reid (Beth), Saskia Mulder (Rebecca), MyAnna Buring (Sam) and Nora-Jane Noone (Holly) - who don't over-act and play the characters reactions and behaviours convincingly. Although, the characters are completely lacking in any real substance or backstory (with the exception being Sarah and Juno who have a small amount of story invested in them), they're a pretty bog-standard set of characters for a horror movie. All of the characters do seem to suffer from the typical horror cliche of having complete lapses in logic or reason whereby they make ill-advised decisions that will have you screaming at your screen, but often these kind of silly decisions are necessary to put the characters in the kind of life or death situation the movie relies on. The relationships between the main characters are average, but more time could have been invested to creating more established friendships and interesting dynamics which would've raised the stakes and made me feel more invested. <br/><br/>Whilst the setting and cast are adequate, the plot itself is weak. The writers seem to over-invest in Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) trauma which takes place at the beginning of the movie and her strained relationship with Juno, when ultimately this sub-plot and attempt at character development adds nothing to the overall story and seems totally out of place. It feels that it's been thrown in there so that it isn't JUST about the cave monsters, when in reality, it is just about the cave monsters. By investing much more time and attention to the character's development and relationships with each other, it could have been a lot more interesting and there could've been a real story that people could get on-board with. <br/><br/>There are certainly scary moments in there or rather jump-scare moments, but the build-up is lacking. For the first 40-45 minutes not much of anything happens at all, but the mood is set and the apprehension is built. Unfortunately, any build-up is very abruptly ended and after that there doesn't seem to be any sense of pacing. It's erratic and frantic, and seems to throw those over-used jump-scares in there at any given opportunity. For those that are seeking a genuinely scary movie, this doesn't deliver on that. I can imagine it would be much more effective in the cinema when it was first released since the emotion of physically being there would have been stronger and the noises would have been louder, but for home viewing, not so much. <br/><br/>What lets this movie down the most is definitely the addition of the cave creatures. Some would ask how I can possibly say that when the entire premise of the movie is built upon the creatures, but it's this that makes the movie feel cheap and unsatisfying. Whilst the idea that there are cave dwelling creatures that lurk in caves where no human has ever been is chilling and a possible reality, the execution is poor. For starters, whilst the audience know from the get-go there's creatures in the caves based on the synopsis, the appearance of them is incredibly sudden and destroys any sense of mystery almost immediately. Secondly, the appearance and general functioning of the monsters is completely inconsistent. Whilst the characters establish rather quickly they hunt by sound and are completely blind, apparently that means that the creatures can't hear heavy breathing and gasping less than a foot away. Unlike other reviewers, I do think the creatures are scary looking, but the writers did lack in imagination when designing them and are as others have described, they're essentially bad Gollum lookalikes. Furthermore, the attempt to villanise the creatures falls short because what exactly have they done wrong? They're primal cannibal creatures that hunt prey that has wandered into their habitat. If the women had wandered into a jungle full of tigers, the result would be exactly the same. Why exactly should we root for these women to survive or kill these creatures besides the fact that the women happen to be human? The stakes just aren't there for people to invest in or root for the characters to survive over the creatures. Also, towards the end of the movie there is too much reliance on the creatures and unnecessary violence and gore ensues which really does nothing to scare or interest viewers. In fact, it's at that point that the movie begins to lose me. <br/><br/>I saw a suggestion that this movie would have been much better if the creatures had been removed and the plot of the movie had instead been solely focused on the six women and their relationships with each other, becoming a psychological horror of sorts where the women are killed one by one and it is one of them that is doing it and it is the audience's task to guess who and why. I agree that this would have made for a much more interesting story. Not only would it have made the characters themselves more intriguing, but it would've vamped up the confusion, anxiety and fear ten fold whilst also giving the audience a mystery they can invest in that would keep them on their toes. It would have also provided an opportunity to develop a rich backstory for the characters that provides an interesting motive for the killer. <br/><br/>Overall, 'The Descent' has a lot to offer and the potential to be a great horror, but unfortunately, the lack of plot and inclusion of cave dwelling creatures that results in pointless gore and violence, means it falls short and fails to deliver a memorable viewing experience or leave the viewer feeling anything other than relieved it's over."

For a mid millenia flick of the times it's missing the the most minimal of much needed SFX. But with all the ridiculous plot curves, twists & turns who'd care anyway. Such predictability coming from some overacting actresses that simply aren't ready for the majors yet and better stick in school.

","First off, good horror needs likable and believable characters. No one cares what happens to a character who is a shallow cardboard cutout. If characters are annoying, you start hoping they disappear, which defeats the purpose of good horror. The Descent fails here.<br/><br/>I never got lost in the story. The whole time I felt like I was watching a bad movie. I laughed at several parts that were not meant to be funny. The jump scare tactics are totally predictable.<br/><br/>There is a totally unbelievable shift in the main character's behavior from fragile and scared to stereotypical uber-confident hero, with no reason behind it.<br/><br/>The filming is good, the acting good, the sets are great, and the visual effects very convincing. They're all wasted on a terrible script."

","First, too much of the film is low-light. I found myself squinting at times. Next, I checked IMDB's parental guide and saw 50+ profanities, so I muted the film often (on Netflix). A good movie should be believable, for example, Inception. This movie stretches belief. How is it that no one has ever gotten a glimpse of these large creatures? How do these naked creatures manage severe temps?
Doesn't the stench of urine, feces, rotting flesh, and the excessive bacteria pose a problem? 
The Descent goes too low. If you can tolerate lots of offensive words, lots of dark scenes, and illogic, see this movie. Ugh."

"jarth_5","8","0","1","11 June 2016"," Neil Marshall's flawed opus
","I remember this movie quite well; partially, i remember it because myself and 2 others dropped ecstasy before going into the cinema (sidenote: unless you want to laugh your tits off watching an otherwise scary movie, i don't recommend that course of action. It's fun, but the rest of the audience will hate you). <br/><br/>The preliminary setup to the horrifying predicament that the characters find themselves in is formulaic. It's one of those setups that frustrates the audience with face-palm moments and sets up one of the ensemble as the unlikable outsider. It introduces the central character with an event that should be horrific in itself (albeit, as i was off my face, it was slightly startling, transitioning to comical:'that'll teach her to distract the driver!' said one of my friends). The human failure that leads to the horror will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has ever watched more than one standard horror film or read more than one horror novel. It isn't ineffective, it's just one of those moments that makes you think: 'oh, here we go...'<br/><br/>For me the problem was that the entire cast (coincidentally all female) ranged from indifferent to grating. You're clearly supposed to care about the consequences of the tragic opening sequence, as well as the conflict that results within the group from said tragedy; personally however, i found it relatively uninteresting and uninspired. Even as the horror began to unfold (and it is genuinely horrifying) i never felt truly invested in any of the characters. Clearly, Marshall's intention was to present a strong female character in the same vein as Siguerney Weavers Ellen Ripley, while at the same time exploring a new perspective to his movies by using a female ensemble, after having presented an almost all male ensemble in 'dog soldiers'. His cast in 'the descent' are intended to be shaped in very much the same mould, ergo they are strong, capable and confident until presented with a situation which they are completely unprepared for. The problem with 'dog soldiers' was that the cast were cartoonish stereotypes lifted from a 12 year old's fantasy, who managed, thanks to competent acting, to breathe life into the characters and overcome the insulting cliché (besides demonstrating absolutely appalling soldiery and breaking nearly every rule in the book); by comparison, the cast of 'the descent' do not look like stereotypes (albeit this could be the result of a lack of female ensemble casts in heroic roles); they seem very credible as can-do adventure athletes and adrenaline-junkies. They come across as relatively well constructed and considered characters and even their obvious character flaws add strength to their believability (something the 'dog soldiers'patently lacked in my opinion). Unfortunately i never found myself emotionally invested in any of them. <br/><br/>Marshall is genuinely capable of generating an effective, primal sense of horror, primarily through his use of the environment; this is possibly the best example of his skill. From almost the outset, darkness and claustrophobia produce a palpable sense of tension and dread that imposes on the audience even before the interaction with the actual horror element. Personally, i found the monstrosities of 'the descent' far more ominous than those of 'dog soldiers'. I mean, there is only so much believability to bipedal canines; evolved troglodytes however seem so much more disturbing conceptually, if only because they are unfamiliar to us and seem just a tiny bit more plausible. Crucially, the sense of horror is magnified by the sense of futility and inescapable doom, something that the situational environment enhances very well in this case. A good comparison is 'the cave', a Hollywood film with a much larger budget and better known cast, and which was released the same year. That film squandered what genuine opportunities it had generate authentic tension and horror and wasted its considerable resources to create an epic borefest. It was an example of essentially the same idea executed with 'all the gear, and no idea'.<br/><br/>Marshall is a self-confessed cinema geek, and this movie illustrates that trait better than possibly any of his portfolio before or since. The film presents a series of subtle references to other movies which, amazingly, work well both to stimulate the observant and relieve the tension. The references are subtle and well executed, and add a level of charm to the film as a whole. They are also largely unexpected in this sort of film, and although fan-service is much more standardised in mainstream cinema as of this point in time, it feels quite original when remembering that this film was released in '05. <br/><br/>The climax to this film is something i feel ambivalent about, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I personally don't ascribe the presumption of a dutiful, crowd-pleasing conclusion to a horror film, although some execute it better than others. Gut-punch endings in horror films can be both effective and satisfying (those who have seen darabonts 'the mist' know what i am talking about). This movie doesn't really come down in either camp. The ending feels inconclusive, which is possibly intentional; however, it doesn't entirely feel satisfying either. This is slightly galling because it seems to lead towards a conclusive closure and then leaves you with what feels like a strange species of cliff-hanger. Not quite the gut-punch, but not quite the rose garden either.<br/><br/>This movie is genuinely horrifying in a way that few are. It is telling to me that neil Marshall has floundered in trying to replicate the effectiveness of this film in his later outtings. It is not perfect, but as a pure horror film it is possibly the closest that Marshall will ever come and a lot closer than many better known director have ever or will ever come."

","I had heard and seen bits of Descent (2005) earlier and I was really intrigued. I was waiting to watch it again, properly this time and got the opportunity today. Descent is cave exploration gone horribly wrong but its more than that. Its about 6 friends and how humans in general react when there is danger and pandemonium – some of us become extremely selfish and just think of ourselves and some of us show the stronger side of our personality by supporting people we are with. The movie shows how bonds between friends are broken and how they are formed. It shows levels to which one can reach to survive.<br/><br/>Descent is a British movie mainly about 2 women – Sarah and Juno. Sarah goes through unimaginable trauma at the start of the movie and after a year goes to explore the beautiful Appalachian mountain range caves in North Carolina, USA. The movie's locations and tone from the get go show a gloomy and brooding side and sucks you in. It isn't long before the 6 go into the cave and get trapped as a part of the cave collapses. They realize that Juno and another friend got them to a cave that is not on the system and panic sets in. And while they are trying to figure out the way out, out come the creatures – the humanoids.<br/><br/>These nasty beings look like humans but are some kind of mutated beings who have adapted themselves to the pitch dark and the intertwined cave system. They feed on anything that moves – they are blind as a bat but have a keen sense of sound. The rest of the movie is about how the hunting begins and how the 6 women react to the brutal killings. This is when Sarah finds out about Juno cheating with her husband and is devastated and you see a different side of the kind, gentle person she is.<br/><br/>Descent is gory, violent, claustrophobic and almost unsee-able as the lighting used is extremely low but that's the beauty of it – its riveting and as a viewer you are looking at all corners of the screen to see where the attack might come from. The performances are great and the personalities come out really nicely. The movie doesn't waste anytime in getting to the horror of what the 6 friends endure and is set at a good pace. The music is great too.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was that it was nothing new. Maybe because I saw it this late, I was reminded of many such movies – The hills have eyes, Jeepers creepers and many such ones. I give it a B+."

Then they discover they aren't alone and it goes downhill as they are chased by what basically looks like the hand me down costumes of Orcs from Lord of the Rings. It's one of those times that once you see the 'creatures' it stops being scary and look stupid instead.

I must say the opening had me hooked when the husband and child were killed. I thought it was going to be like a final destination rip-off at the point but I guess I was wrong. I thought the idea of having them all be female character was new and creative. It also sparked my interest because I don't recall a horror film where all of the characters were female. It also has a lot more suspense this way because you wouldn't think a female character is able to fend for herself in most horror movies the girls only scream and run around. Here though it is completely different and they have a good run fighting the creatures. I didn't understand why they made Juno out to be a villain in the end I mean she was the coolest one I thought.

"Val111","6","0","4","15 April 2015"," A Sexist Cautionary Tale
","A group of adventurous housewives bunch together in a cabin in the woods to prepare for the next day's adventure in a cave. They are so nice to each other it gets awfully boring. The ""It meant a lot to me"", ""I'm so proud of you"" and so on so forth kind of dialogues are everywhere. None of them women has any distinguishable character except for the male- ish/lesbian-ish one. And none of them is hot/beautiful enough to keep your attention. They're all just plain, boring, flat adventurous housewives.<br/><br/>By the way, I have to call out this movie for being sexist and racist. Not a single male character is present, and all the housewives are snow white.<br/><br/>So they finally get to this cave they are supposed to explore. Turns out the cave is set to a harder difficulty than they originally thought. With monsters added for fun.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the symbols in this movie. If the cave represents the womb or whatever.<br/><br/>Maybe the monsters represent rapists or the fear of being raped. But if so these uglies are the most ineffective rapists ever.<br/><br/>At first they are presented as very sneaky and deadly. One minute later, after they make their first victim, there is a noticeable and sudden nerf on their traits. They are no longer deadly or sneaky, and they move about making noise so the girls can hide and sneak up on them, even though it is established right away that these guys are 1) hunters/predators and 2) perfectly adapted to the dark environment they live in.<br/><br/>I understand that the monsters shouldn't be made so powerful so as to make it easier to believe when the housewives start killing them off one by one. Nevertheless it is a jarring transition.<br/><br/>For one thing, this movie deserves some praise on how they make use of the camcorder's night vision.<br/><br/>In the end, I think this movie is a decent cautionary tale about housewives straying too far from the household. If they want to venture into the outside world like real men they should make the complete transition and grow a pair first instead of being just man-wannabe- girls. So, girls! Stay home. That's the movie not me.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you're like me and enjoy seeing a bunch of housewives being eaten alive while joyfully screaming in pain then this movie is just for you.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 6/10 though because no male or black characters makes it a racist/sexist flick."
"marfcord","8","0","1","21 April 2014"," Simple and enjoyable
","This film is very simple and straightforward in many aspects: there is almost no backstory, the character development is very sketchy and there are no moments dedicated to give explanations. Even the scenarios are simple, as almost everything takes place inside a dark cave. Interestingly, this is what I enjoyed the most about it. It's what I would call a casual horror film.<br/><br/>The direction is very good, the acting is very convincing and the ambiance is very claustrophobic. Thereupon, even though the film doesn't give reasons to fall in love with the characters, it's hard not to feel somehow evolved in their struggle for survival. The tension is very well built and some moments are very intense. Overall, this film delivers a good amount of tension and gory action, resulting in a very enjoyable experience for those who are into this kind of thing.<br/><br/>My advice: don't expect an intricate script full of revelations and overturns or it may not work for you. It's all about some women stuck in a cave with some monsters who want to eat them. Simple as that. So open a beer, take a seat, watch it, and most importantly, have fun."

","The Descent (2005) - The Good, the Bad and the Claustrophobic <br/><br/>Synopsis: After the death of her daughter and husband, Sarah reluctantly joins her thrill-seeking girlfriends on a cave diving expedition in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. After being tricked into entering an uncharted cave, the girls find that they are very lost and not alone.<br/><br/>The Good: This is one of my favorite horror movies of the last ten years. Director Neil Marshall gets just about everything right. I've seen a bazillion horror movies and rarely do I find them scary, but this movie hits the heart of my fears. Isolation, abandonment, fear of the dark, claustrophobia, being completely lost in a hopeless situation... and that's all before they are attacked by mutant, cave-dwelling hominids. Marshall gives just enough time for strong character development, so that you care about what happens to the women, yet doesn't make you wait too long before things start going horribly wrong. He also paints a compelling back-story between the girls that makes for some intriguing and tense moments near the end of the movie. Several other cave-diving/spelunking movies have tried to do what The Descent did and didn't come close, so it's not just the suspenseful environment that carries the movie. It's really the strong character development and the cinematography that lift it above and beyond many other same-genre films.<br/><br/>The Bad: I'm not big on nitpicking. Most movies are going to be less than perfect. The Descent is no different. There really aren't any major problems with this movie, but if I had to pick one, it would be the ending. With the spoiler tag firmly attached, the ending of the movie goes through a dream sequence where you see the protagonist escape as the sole survivor... to the point where she gets in her car and drives away. The fact is that, yes, you realize it's all a dream and she wakes up, still in the cave. It's assumed by the ending that she dies there in the cave, but it's never really shown. Me personally, I hate dream sequences. It's an easy cop-out to show a lot of cool things and then renege on the consequences. Here, it's done a little bit backwards (i.e. instead of showing the consequence first then reneging), but it's still misleading for really no purpose that I can think of. You are meant to think she succeeded in escaping, alone, only to have that ripped away from you and realize the last 15 minutes of the movie never really happened. Not sure why Marshall elects to take that path. It doesn't really do anything but infuriate the viewer. Strange artistic choice, but if that's my worst beef with this film, I can still live with giving it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>The Claustrophobic: There is one scene in this movie that affects me more than any scene in any horror movie. The girls are still of the assumption that this is a lower class cave and that the paths have been well-traveled and reasonably safe. The cave, however, gets more and more narrow. Sarah, having been through significant recent trauma with the loss of her family, is a bit of an emotional wreck already. Finally, the cave comes to a small tunnel, barely big enough to squeeze and maneuver through. She is the last one through. She gets stuck and begins to panic. I get goosebumps simply writing about it. As her friend tries to coax her through, the rocks shift and the tunnel gets tighter. Immediately, her friend's demeanor turns from gentle coaxing to panic. ""Move! Move! Sarah, you've got to move NOW!"" Wow... that scene is just exhilarating. The thought of being trapped in complete darkness where you can't move forward or backward hundreds of feet below the surface of the planet does it for me."

","There have been a lot of comparisons to ""Alien"", but ""Descent"" is more like ""Jaws"" in a cave. The makers understands that it's what you don't see that's scary. And in a cave, it's easy to not see. You thought you were afraid to go in the water? You may never go spelunking again. Of course, unless you're already a cave-diver, it might be a bit hard to relate to these characters. I mean, really, what are you doing in that cave to begin with?<br/><br/>Above all else, I appreciate what ""The Descent"" is attempting to do. It's not one of those obvious slasher films that plague the multiplexes when Hollywood's out of ideas. There are plenty of false scares (mostly the old dream sequence trick), but also plenty of real ones. ""The Descent"" may not be a classic, but it's likely to remain with you for a while."

At the commencement of this film they are whitewater rafting, and Sara has brought along her husband and young daughter.<br/><br/>Don't bother setting up that IMDb character page for hubbie Paul and little Jessica just yet...<br/><br/>A tragedy befalls the family, and next year it is agreed that they will meet up again in the United States to explore a caving system with three other similar minded lasses. Sara is obviously still coming back from the depths of depression caused by the untimely incident on last year's journey, and Beth, Juno and the other women take great pains at incorporating her into everything and making sure everyone feels comfortable and welcome.<br/><br/>The three new Dora the Explorers include sisters Sam and Rebecca, and Juno's younger ""X-treme"" protégé Holly, who is cocky, brash, and annoying after the first 40 seconds.<br/><br/>The team are not due to embark until the next morning, so they spend the night drinking and talking, meaning we as the audience get to know most of them quite well. I won't go into too much detail of who does what, suffice to say there are more passive and more dominating/controlling figures, one woman is often unintelligible (I used subtitles for one viewing just to see what she actually said a few times)... and Juno is hot. Unbelievably hot. <br/><br/>The early going has more about meeting the characters and building the plot, so there are not many opportunities to insert genuine scares, so Neil Marshall does what I normally hate and includes a couple of cheap ""BOO"" shocks that rely more on a lack of expectation and a loud noise. While my standard response is to cite laziness on behalf of the director here both early scares work extremely well - so I am forced to give Marshall a pass.<br/><br/>After the first bonding night the girls head off to the caving system to get their spelunking on. As they proceed deeper and deeper through the narrow passages and cracks it is evident that this is not a cave designed for fatties, even the experienced cavers are puffing and squirming through the crevices, with only their headlamps to light the way. Claustrophobics *raising hand* need a warning that this section of the film manages to get the heartrate ticking a lot quicker, I for one always am glad when they move through the early stages.<br/><br/>A few hours in disaster strikes, a cave-in behind the women means that the planned exit is no longer available. Juno then reluctantly admits that she has lead them to a different system to the one planned, as she felt the original plan was too baby-ish. Unfortunately as the emergency notification and plan was lodged for the wrong system no-one knows where they are even if they recognise they are missing... and with no known exit in this unexplored system the team are running out of both options and patience.<br/><br/>After calm is restored the women move forward deeper into the cave in search of another exit - and the final third of the film starts.<br/><br/>As much of their climbing and caving equipment was lost in the cave-in the women make do with what they have, leading to some particularly hairy climbs and crosses and a few mishaps, some minor, one it's fair to say more major in outcome. As they progress there is evidence of others passing through the caves - this is deemed a major plus because if others were here then there must be a way out.<br/><br/>You would think...<br/><br/>A great reveal heightens the peril that the women find themselves in, and it is immediately evident that they are indeed not alone. The final half hour is sweaty and blood soaked, as tends to happen in horror films the women split up into ones and twos, some lose composure and others react with unexpected efficiency and determination - not always a good thing mind you.<br/><br/>In among the gore and blood emerges a new wrinkle that altered the fragile dynamic of the group even more, something that was again utilised in the unfairly canned sequel which was really only guilty of mimicking an all time classic.<br/><br/>The acting is great and goes far beyond the usual shrieking and screaming - though there is some here, but totally warranted - the women each have their own personalities and strengths and they remain true to them for the main part, and each of them is far more than merely oblivious fodder.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall started his career well with the cult hit Dog Soldiers, a film that took a ridiculous premise and made it fun, then came The Descent and I immediately signed up as a card carrying fanboy. Doomsday basically sucked, seemingly favouring style over substance and Centurion once again was a couple of cool scenes let down by the other 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 9.5 / 10. I remain ever hopeful that he has another film of the calibre of The Descent - even if it doesn't eventuate Neil Marshall has managed one film that will forever remain in my rotation and near the top of multiple personal All Time lists.<br/><br/>(When I initially watched The Descent it had zero press and I really had no idea what I was in for. That would be the ideal set up to truly enjoy this film but I recognise that this is nigh impossible with all the hype (duh look up) and fanboy-ness. That being said this film remains awesome even if you've seen it half a dozen times... I think I'm up around 8 and still love it.)"

","There are three types of horror. There's smart horror. There's fun horror. And then there's just bad horror. The Descent falls into the fun horror category. It's the story of a group of women who go spelunking in a cave in Chatanooga. They are supposed to be going a very well known cave of the area but the group leader, Juno, leads them to a completely different cave for fear that the other cave will be a tourist trap. In this new unnamed cave things begin to go horribly wrong. First they get trapped when a tunnel collapses. Then the become prey to a new breed of predator lurking in the cave. From here a disgusting yet exciting gorefest ensues as the girls try to escape from this underground nightmare.<br/><br/>The Descent hones in on our fears of darkness, claustrophobia, and the unknown, then throws in flesh eating monsters just to spice it up. The Descent builds a lot of suspense for the first half of the film in some great scenes of quiet focused tension. Then it really switches gears in the last half when the monsters are introduced and they start picking people off. There isn't anything inherently wrong with this and honestly the last half of the movie is awesome. It is so graphic and so chaotic that you can't help but be entertained. The first half of the film keeps you enthralled with suspense while the second half keeps it up with grotesque thrill after thrill.<br/><br/>You could say that the structure of this film is actually quite intelligent and works as a really impressive feat of horror. The entire first half is spent building suspense with no mention of monsters and very slight and very subtle hints that there is something else in the cave with these girls. The first half is quiet and tense, only to explode in the second half when the monsters are introduced. The same can be said for the camera-work. The direction of the first half of the film is excellent. The way all of the tight crawlspaces and bottomless pits are shot is incredible. You really feel like you are trapped with these girls and it honestly does bother you. Then the monsters are introduced and the direction changes its focus to pure action thriller. This really makes the film intense and exciting and the only problem is that there are many times where you can't really tell what is going on. The camera cuts and shakes too fast and the setting is too dark at times. This might be in order to cover up bad effects or poor makeup, but it really didn't bother me nearly as much as it does in other films.<br/><br/>The Descent is undeniably missing some things like well developed characters and a sharp script. The script isn't terrible but I can safely say that dialouge is not where the film shines. There are plenty of lines that could have been worked out better and some that should have been left out entirely. It's like when a character throws a rock down a dark pit to see how far down it is. We all know why she did this but as soon as the rock hits the bottom another character says to her, ""Thanks. Now I know how deep it is."" It's little things like this that get in the way of the suspense being built here, but only temporarily. You can get around them pretty easily.<br/><br/>And then there's the second half of the film where you can just see the perverse giddiness of the writers coming through. They have so much fun with the gory action of this film. I can literally see them coming up with this at the table with somebody saying, ""So she's running from a bunch of monsters and their all screaming at her. Then she falls into a pool of water and there's a monster in there too!"" Or, ""So she's crossing a pit and just as she reaches the other side there's a monster hanging from the ceiling and she stabs it in the head just as it slits her throat!"" I also imagine the phrase ""blood sprays here"" was tossed around quite a bit.<br/><br/>But I digress. The Descent is an awesome film that manges to be suspenseful, scary, and a lot of fun. It's not for the squeamish or faint of heart, and especially not for those with claustrophobia, but luckily I am none of those three. Well, I take that back. After watching this film I honestly think I might be a little bit claustrophobic as there were some scenes in here where I almost had to sit up just to bring myself back into reality. Few films bother me like this, so kudos to The Descent for really freaking me out. This movie isn't much more than an fun gorefest, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do. Plus there are some great visuals the whole way through and the film actually scares you. I can easily and faithfully recommend this film to horror fans everywhere."

I imagine that seeing this on a larger screen would have made this much more interesting and having surround sound would have made all the difference, but on a small screen, it seemed lost and out of place.<br/><br/>There are times when the story just drags and seems too slow for a horror movie and then there are times when it's too fast, but overall, it's not bad, but there could have been more tension and a better sound track.<br/><br/>Seeing this with the second one to follow, and without interruptions would probably be much more entertaining.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, but still a little slow, and not truly scary."
"Supachewy","7","0","4","14 November 2010"," One of the Best Horror Films of the Past Decade That Will Make You Never Want To Go in a Cave Again
","The horror film The Descent is written and directed by Neil Marshall and stars Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Jackson Mendoza, and Alex Reid. The film takes place in modern day and mostly in a cavern.<br/><br/>Sarah's (Macdonald) husband and daughter died tragically in a car accident on the way home from a river kayaking trip with some other friends. A year later when Sarah is more stable her group of friends decide to go on an adventure like they used to so she could feel better and pretend things are back to normal. The group decides to go on a caving decision and Juno (Mendoza) does not tell anyone that the cave that they are going to had never been explored. Juno did this so that they can name the cave after Sarah. While exploring the cave it begins to fall in and the group becomes trapped inside. If that isn't scary enough they are being tracked by murderous monsters...<br/><br/>Neil Marshall's screenplay is solid even though I have a few problems with it. What makes most horror movies great is the characterization in them. In this though all the characters are one dimensional, even Sarah. All I really know about Sarah is that her family was killed in a car accident and that makes her sad. But that is more than I know about the other characters. I did like though the idea of being isolated in a cave, that can be a horror movie on its own. But to be followed by monsters who try to kill you? That is just another layer of horror. The end of this film is brilliant as well and Neil Marshall should be proud of writing one of the best horror films of the past decade. Make sure if you watch this you watch the original uncut version though not the American one.<br/><br/>The direction of this film by Neil Marshall was perfect for a horror film as well. Those shots in the cave where Holly was squeezing through the walls were just perfect to let the viewer know just how isolated they were. Marshall I guess got good performances out of his actors even though I never really knew them. The scares in the film were all basically jump scares nothing to keep you unable to sleep that night, even though there is a lot of psychological things you could be scared of during this film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was mediocre, nothing to write home about. It wasn't really that any of the actors gave bad performances it was just that there was not enough character for them to act off of. No one was by any means bad and everyone was believable when they were scared it was just no sense of character, so I cannot really judge it.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 7/10 because it is a very effective horror film. If there was thirty minutes of the girls all in the cabin talking so the audience could get more of a sense of who they are I would probably have given this an 8/10. But my major complaint with this film is the lack of characterization so that is why I give it what I give it. If you like horror films you should definitely see this, especially ones when people are trapped in dark places with monsters lurching around all over the place."
"dancer-91","9","0","2","23 May 2010"," Perfect horror
","The Descent is a perfect horror flick for anyone who is a fan of well made movies.<br/><br/>The basic story line is that a group of women enter a cave and get stuck there and soon they find out they are not alone.<br/><br/>The story isn't that magical, but it's still like a breath of fresh air. for one, the group is all women and as a woman, I respect that. and for two the suspense in the movie and the finale is just great. Neil Marshall builds the tension with simple and small choices, like deciding to place the women in the dark, literally. The amount of light in the shots is very little and it really sets the mood for the film.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty basic, there's no great roles or characters in the film, but that's not the point. The point is the fight for their survival and the monsters that hide in the darkness. The women are scared but they fight like hell and that's good, because you would too.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not all about the monsters, which are kind of awesome, but it's also about the dynamics between the women. there's some tension from the beginning, since one of the women has had an affair with the main character's late husband. and when the situation get ugly, so do the characters. the change in them is great. you have the girl who doesn't care about safety and rushes into things and gets killed for that. Then you have the little sister, the sweet blond girl, who turns out to be a kick ass girl! and the ending? it's great. it really leaves you to think, if you want to. you can accept the ending as it is or you can start to question all that's happened. how much of it all was all in Sarah's head? are the monsters real or are they just Sarah's own demons? Neil Marshall has really created a horror masterpiece. I first saw this film when it was released and thought it was okay, a lot scarier than Saw but nothing special. and then I watched it again a year ago and was blown away. The Descent is a great film, but it might demand an eye for some technical stuff in film. but anyway, this is the best horror film I have seen."

","This movie was surprisingly nice. Almost right from the very beginning it captivates you and keeps a firm grip on you, and doesn't let go before the movie is over.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent and all do a good job at bringing their characters to life.<br/><br/>What really made this movie interesting for me was the surroundings and the scenery. That was amazing, and it really added a lot to the sense of thrill and being helpless. This is one of those movies that you just have to see to know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>As for the subterranean humanoid creatures, well... Nothing bad to be said about these. They were terrifying, deadly and very interesting. Their role in this movie was creepy and there was always a sense of dread and fear in the movie, and the way these creatures moved, looked, and behaved heightened the experience immensely.<br/><br/>Don't do like I did and base your first impression on the DVD cover alone, because you are missing out on a great movie if you let this one slip you by. At first, based on the DVD cover alone, I thought this could only be another mass-produced mediocre scare flick with no substance and no quality. But I was wrong, dead wrong! This is one of the more intense and thrilling movies I have seen in this category.<br/><br/>So immerse yourself into the depths and let the darkness swallow you up, this is one thrill ride you should not miss..."
"gavintaylor50","9","0","1","11 March 2010"," One of my favourite horrors.
","The descent is about a group of adventurous women who decide to take a caving exploration into a cave they THINK has already been explored but hasn't as Juno (Natalie Mendoza) knows and was hoping they would be the first to discover it. The main character through the movie is Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) who is very unstable after the death of her husband and child and agrees on the trip to take her mind of things. I personally really enjoyed the movie, it made me jump on occasions and made feel very chrostophobic. The movie has twists and makes you feel like you know the characters good or bad. It also has a girl power effect which even as a guy i like because i expected them to just run the whole movie screaming. If i had to fault the movie it'd be the ending, it's not terrible but is disappointing compared to the rest of the movie but i wont give it away :)."

","Fresh off the heels of his first Feature (Dog Soldiers). Horror enthusiast Neil Marshall shines with his claustrophobic nightmare. The British Film maker brings out the big guns for his second outing in the Directors chair. We follow a group of ""adrenaline junkies"" cave diving in America (how fun) – but don't be put off just yet. Everything takes a turn for the worse- when they quickly find out they are not alone in the dark. At centre stage is the recently widowed Sarah (MacDonald) who is haunted by the loss of her family.

The horror it top notch, up there with the likes of ""28 days later"". But nothing is taken lightly. There are no mindless jump points, everything has a reason.

","This movie is a classic example of how to make the real roller coaster ride. Neil Marshall has clearly done his homework. This movie is so inspired and so full of it's genre that it can nothing but hold and stand against the clichés it could very easily fall upon. But this one does not fall, not in my opinion. It slowly descents into darkness, you can almost hear Neil Marshall breathe, taking you with him into his story. And so it goes, we meet a group of young women, adventuresses, ""love each day"" kind of people. Each with their own story and reason to be where we find them in the beginning. Dare I say the name,, well here goes, the James Cameron pace sets the scene and mood. And the looks of the movie is outstanding, very professionally executed, and a cracker jack cast! Shauna is at times a bit forced to act, she is that pretty girl gone horror movie- I mean ""look at me i've got blood in my hair and now i'm gonna swing it like in a commercial""-, but generally she too is watchable,, and sexy as hell! I enjoy showing this movie to people who knows nothing what so ever of it. I love to see their faces and go thru the horrors once again,, but is that not kinda the point!!

","The first thing that comes to mind when I think about this movie is how unpleasant the makers of it made it to be. This is everything that cabin fever hyped itself to be and was the exact opposite of. You get attached to the characters, suspense builds, all hell breaks loose - all expected... But something else sits within this movie that keeps it from being your typical gore-fest horror movie. The pace, moving faster as the movie goes on, doesn't interfere with keeping you interested. Normally when horror movies do that, you get bored to death by it and the end is no better than the beginning - not with this movie. This movie is a descent into madness as much as it is anything else. If you take movies into your mind and leave them there for awhile, you might never want to watch this as it might leave a scar."

It leaves you with a question - So do they all die or does she get away? The Crawlers (thats the monsters in the cave) aren't really that scary but overall: it's a pretty good movie.

"MrRazorz","9","0","3","9 July 2009"," More than it seems to be
","What to say about The Descent? At first glance, it's all too easy to write it off as a run-of-the-mill horror flick, albeit one with a pretty cool premise. Six young women head into the Appalachians on a caving expedition, get trapped in an uncharted cave system, find themselves facing a horde of cannibalistic troglodytes, and are picked off and slaughtered one by one. Given that most of the promos I originally saw for the film were cheesy American TV spots (promoting it as one of those SHOCKING and TERRIFYING movies that had people FLEEING THE THEATRES because of all the GORE and TERROR) I barely gave it much thought when it first came out. It was only later on, when it arrived on DVD, that I decided to give it a look. Whereupon I discovered two important details.<br/><br/>One: it's a British film. A British horror film, mind you, in the vein of 28 Days Later and The Hole. This automatically elevates it above the usual Hollywood pap. Protest all you like, my American friends, it won't make it any less true.<br/><br/>Two: it was written and directed by Neil Marshall, who also wrote and directed Dog Soldiers - one of the coolest and most satisfying werewolf films of all time. If Neil Marshall made a film, you can guarantee it's going to be awesome. (Well... except for Doomsday, obviously.) So with that in mind, I donned my helmet and pickaxe and dove into the movie. And watched it twice, back to back. And of course I've watched it many times since, because this is one of those films that's so much more than it seems to be.<br/><br/>First of all, it avoids all the clichés. The core group are entirely female, and (with a couple of possible exceptions) none of them are stereotypes. In fact your two pivotal characters - Sarah and Juno - are about as multi-layered as movie characters can probably get. It takes almost half the film for the monsters to turn up, but you're so engrossed in what's going on that you hardly notice this. The claustrophobic feel of being trapped a mile underground is always there, helped along by the cinematography and the fact that (with a couple of exceptions) the only light sources used in the film are the torches, flares and flashlights carried by the actors. There's jumpy moments and death and gore aplenty, but there's also character development and plot twists and moments of genuine balls-out (or should that be tits-out?) human tragedy. The scary bits are genuinely scary. The fight scenes are messy and frantic and disturbingly brutal. The sad bits are honest-to-god heartbreaking. And although the flick is chock full of monsters, it's the underlying conflict between the humans that becomes the real threat when the dung hits the fan. A big part of all this comes from David Julyan's soundtrack, which goes from slithery and creepy to soaring and powerful, and everything in between. And finally, there's all those clever little homages - Deliverance, The Shining, The Howling, The Silence of the Lambs, and even Full Metal Jacket all get a little nod from Marshall in this flick, along with others I've probably forgotten to mention.<br/><br/>Flaws? Well, there's a couple. As I said, two of the characters are a bit on the stereotypical side (Holly the Reckless Adrenaline Junkie and Beth the Supportive Friend). There are also a couple of characters who could genuinely be referred to as Redshirts - they contribute while they're there, but not in a unique way, and they do seem to be there just as extra monster fodder.<br/><br/>But the thing that makes this film really stand out is the ending. There are two versions - the film was re-cut for American audiences, who like a bit more closure to their movies. The original (UK) ending is not only darker (literally) but also a lot more ambiguous. In fact Marshall states on the DVD commentary that everyone has their own interpretation of the ending - he has his, but he's keeping it to himself and he loves hearing other theories. Now that, folks, is a storyteller.<br/><br/>Final thought - there's a sequel coming out this year, starring two of the original cast. It's not directed by Marshall, although he was involved, and director Jon Harris worked on the original film as an editor. And the trailer looks pretty solid. So here's hoping."
"Samiam3","7","0","1","26 May 2009"," A decent descent
","The Descent uses an old horror formula, but with a few twists, a little artistic creativity, and some clever directing, the movie succeeds where other horror films have failed. The tension is well orchestrated, and highly subjective, bringing a real sense of claustrophobia to the viewer. Some effort has been put forward to building a realistic, scary setting rather than an artificial fantasy world like that in 'The Cave', and with a lot of hand-held camera-work and minimalist lighting, The illusion is real enough to get the audience hooked. <br/><br/>In the Appalachian mountains, six girls go on a cave exploration trip, deep under the earth. Soon the fun adventure ends, and a real one begins when they get lost, and find themselves stocked by strange creatures who are fast agile climbers, and vicious carnivores.<br/><br/>The funny thing about The Descent is how the scares are quite predictable, but they make you jump anyway. Sometimes you know when something is going to happen, but you don't know what. Other times you know what is going to happen, but you don't know when. When the ending comes, It's quite obvious that there is going to be one last surprise, but it comes in a way that is not only surprising, but provides a clever bookending to the protagonist's journey, the journey into madness.<br/><br/>If this is your kind of thing, I can assure you that you wont be bored. From the moment the characters make their descent into the inevitable, we the viewers descend with them."

","Before I saw this movie, I had heard that it was really good. So I went in expecting a good movie. And although not what I expected, it was still really good.<br/><br/>It's almost like I got to see two movies for the price of one. The first half, is like watching the movie Catacombs. It relies on claustrophobia and darkness to frighten us. Which is good, I like that. I'm not very claustrophobic, but I can feel for the characters. The second half, is more like what I was expecting. With the monsters and more jump scenes. But I liked that too, because the jump scenes weren't overused, and the creatures were crazy looking without going overboard and becoming unrealistic. Giving us more of a unrealistic scenario while keeping it within the realm of possibility.<br/><br/>The plot was really well done, and although not very complicated, it makes for a good story. The characters were also well done, they sounded and acted pretty realistically. And you started to feel for most of them. I did think that some of them didn't really get enough screen time, and at some points it felt like the director expected us to. Using them as plot devices like we knew them really well.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the duel identities this movie wields is what made me like it a lot more than most movies in the genre. Because it didn't run out of ideas or overuse any. It was able to keep things fresh for most of the film, and although not necessarily unpredictable, it didn't scream what was gonna happen next either.<br/><br/>However, although the movie was good, there were a couple of things that bugged me. Most of all, the ending... I don't want to spoil anything, but anyone who has seen it will know what I mean when I say, there just isn't any justice. Ending aside I thought it was a great film.

","Neil Marshall's sophomore effort, The Descent, is a savage work that rattles your nerves. Most blood and guts movies today are made essentially for the indiscriminate teen devotees. This is an effective vision of the horror genre. It follows a caving expedition upon which a group of perfectly fit women embark, but it's also a metaphorical plunge into the deep hole where deep fears and true terror are brought to fruition, a descent into primitive anarchy and insanity.<br/><br/>The squirm-inducingly snug canals and hollow cracks within the earth, occasionally given light by pinkish flares, make these characters drain the capacity of their bodies, their relationships, and their basic beliefs about themselves.<br/><br/>Yes, there's a main character, who has undergone a horrible tragedy and needs to be revitalized if she's ever going to survive her depression. The American friend in the close group of adventurous friends is Juno, the daring, fly-by-night instigator of this trip into cavernous Appalachia. There's a little more character development for the first thirty, forty minutes, but really it is just the movie winding up. I have a hard time getting into it at the start; because Marshall does not have an urge to tell the story of these women as individuals but as a collective social circle, I find it difficult to tell them apart. But where the movie comes alive is in the murky, claustrophobic world beneath the scenic facade of the mountains, where the women soon discover there's no way out of this cave but through ithopefully.<br/><br/>Marshall has a way with darkness, too. It can be burdensome, crushing, as when the majority of the screen is black, surrounding a small hole depicting a rock tunnel, and thus we realize that we are the ones who desperately want to see the characters reach daylight again. Even when their flashlights illuminate a good portion of their dominant, overwhelming surroundings, there is a terrorizing barrenness, a space to be satisfied because of the natural restlessness and paranoia brought on by the situation, fulfilled by dangers and trouble, both real and conjured up. These quick-witted visual compositions create an atmosphere of tension and dread that you can cut with a pairing knife."

A nice little descent as it were. Not sure what caught my eye (I like caves I guess) but I kept watching and this movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>In contemporary horror films so much originality has been lost to the usual man in a mask wielding some sort of weapon, a mass murder in a haunted house or something of that sort but not here. This is a truly original horror in an unsuspecting beginning that starts as an adventure-thriller with some hairy caving scenes that gain your intrigue straight out. In fact this movie develops into a horror rather late but the buildup to the introduction of horror happens shortly after the halfway point in the movie.<br/><br/>Then this movie starts into an unrelenting finish full of twists and turns. The movie climaxes the entire way to the end.<br/><br/>If you have to go to the bathroom go beforehand because you won't want to move watching this original horror.

Just the concept alone was disturbing enough to keep my attention  a few 20-something young women out for adventure - taking calculated risks by exploring a cave to help spice up their lives  has a certain feeling of dangerous vulnerability to it. There's something about the dangers associated with getting stuck underground that genuinely gives me nightmares. Perhaps because I had recently read the story of that poor guy in 1925 from Kentucky Floyd Collins getting trapped in a narrow cave and dying after a couple of weeks was still lingering in my nightmares. Perhaps it's my inability to understand how people continue to explore and die in caves  but ""The Descent"" struck a nerve and ignited my imagination. The movie started a bit slow but I felt it was necessary to introduce and develop the characters. Still, slow or not, the mountainous scenery is wonderful  the music hauntingly beautiful, and the cinematography spectacular. The movie takes off once the girls enter the cave. After a bit of way-cool spelunking, one of the them (no one saw this coming) gets stuck in a narrow connecting tunnel, and  myself being very claustrophobic, I literally couldn't watch as my thoughts went back to the real-life disaster of poor Floyd. Again I wondered why anyone could consider risking the same fate as desirable. Nor do I understand a person who thinks squeezing through narrow tunnels deep underground is fun. Anyway, she barely makes it through when they experience a cave-in blocking the path they'd just come through. After some intense arguing the adventure planner and thus leader, called Juno, admits she didn't have a map or even if there was another way out. She also admitted it was a new cave system previously unexplored or at least undocumented  talk about a buzz kill. Having no choice they press on. Eventually they encounter blind mutant people living in the caves who are hell bent on killing and eating the girls. The movie quickly turns into a truly gory horror movie which I wasn't expecting basically making this two movies in one. A surprise ending  well developed characters  frightening scenarios  and good acting - the result is a great movie well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Michael"
"alexx668","7","0","1","24 September 2008"," The Descent
","Ostensibly, ""The Descent"" is a fairly formulaic horror film where the entire cast gets slaughtered one-by-one by a group of killers. The visions and premonitions of protagonist Sarah are basic horror fodder as well, though they provide us with a brilliant ending-sequence where the vision of her daughter and the reality of her being trapped in the cave mesh in a stylish way. Nevertheless, this standard horror film works well because of the twisted psychological framework that exists in the background.<br/><br/>By descending into the cave, symbolically the group of heroines descends into the subconscious, to find mankind's menacing prehistory lingering in the shadows. As the group of primitive cavemen attacks them, the facade of civilization and friendship dissolves, and symbolically these two conditions (conscious and subconscious, prehistory and present) mesh and interweave, to the point where the killer creatures are distorted mirror-images of the main cast.<br/><br/>There's plenty of garish horror and gore, but director Neil Marshall has a few visual aces up his sleeve with the threatening night-vision shots (acting as glimpses into the subconscious) amidst piles of bones and with the creatures lurking in the background."

"something_named_blank","9","0","1","2 August 2008"," The Descent into greatness!
","After having seen this film for about the fifth time i thought it fit to finally comment on how great i think this film is! Not only did it manage to scare the living crap out of me but it also gave me hope that there is a future for horror films after all. For me this is taking horror to a whole new level almost reinventing the genre all together! Thats a bit of an overstatement but what strikes me the most about this film was the very fact that the horror itself didn't lie within the savage creatures which where eating our lovely ladies one by one but the internal horrors themselves.<br/><br/>These creatures are just merely a metaphor for something much more deeper in this film. They are symbols of the internal horrors which lay within each of the three main characters which all share a secret which has the ability to tear them apart for good. At the very start of the film we witness the horrific death of Sarahs husband and child and this then sets up the rest of the film. I say this because the death of her family is a far more horrific horror then the creatures in the cave. For Sarahs character defeating these creatures is a right of passage which was created by these deaths. In order for her to even survive for as long as what she did (and its not because she is the main character and that she HAS to survive) she had to deal with the death of her family. Surviving these creatures has given her the strength to survive and move on. This deep character development and growth is hardly present in horror films these days and if it is it tries to hard. This is clearly depicted when she bursts her way through to the surface clearly indicating that she has been reborn and has dealt with the death of her family. Here lies the reason why i found this film so good. Its ability to deliver the subplot without getting lost in the gore and guts.<br/><br/>Another factor which makes this film so terrifying is the claustrophobic feel of the entire film. Straight from the first shot of the woman crawling into the squashed and tight holes which these crazy girls climb through. It sends chills down your spin knowing that there is no where for these girls to turn when they begin to squirm there way to the exit of the tunnel. Why someone would actually do this i would have no idea but it makes for a good scare. The feeling of not being able to defend or escape such a inescapable situation is so dense and thick in this film it makes it so hard at times you actually have to look away. Also the only lighting source used in this film was the lights which are located on there helmets only added more panic and dread to the film knowing that you could never actually look behind you and see everything and that there is a chance as soon as you move your lighting that something could take its place in the darkness. Hearing the distress in the female voices sends chills down your spins as the panic in the air begins to thicken as you start to think what would happen if that was me??...<br/><br/>Something else which i found a little terrifying was that maybe a sequel is on the way..."

","I liked most of ""The Descent"". It's a good horror film to pick up!<br/><br/>The all-female cast was refreshing. Although they could have chosen more distinctive looking actresses, the three blondes kept on confusing me for most of the first half. The performances were decent.<br/><br/>The build-up was something too. Like ""Wolf Creek"" or ""Rogue"" this movie takes its time, which is a nice departure from the standard horror formula.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed with the creatures. When they didn't instantly attack, I hoped, they would make them not just the killing evil. Well they were. And not too good at it. While I certainly welcome non-invincible antagonists unlike the Leatherfaces, Vorheeses and Krugers of the genre, it was kinda stupid how they died in packs.<br/><br/>And the beginning was stupid too.

","I didn't like The Descent very much. First of all, the story is very good. It just wasn't executed very well. Half of the time, I couldn't see what was happening very well, so I didn't really know what was going on. It seemed like I had to rely on my hearing to figure out what was going on. There were a few intense battling scenes that were interesting, but that's really the only thing that caught my attention besides the story. The monsters are very weird, and I kind of wanted to know where they came from and what they were, but that didn't bother me too much. It just seemed kind of boring, as in the parts where the monster would be looking for them just weren't very scary. I also didn't like the ending very much, but it wasn't too bad. 4/10, not very good"

When I saw a brief preview(s) the creatures looked lame but the execution ended up being well done, including some of the successful death combat with them.

It's a Hollywood style horror but without the cheese (well without some of the cheese anyway).

"MartianOctocretr5","6","0","1","20 April 2008"," Awkwardly constructed; some good scares though
","The greatest weakness of this film is the direction. The director concentrates too much on some irrelevant material, and occasionally fails to utilize the most exciting elements of the story being told to their utmost potential.<br/><br/>Still, it's an exciting ride. Several women, all friends for several years, and adept at many athletic thrill-seeking pursuits, reunite after one of their number loses her husband in a tragedy. They decide to be spelunkers this time out, finding some mysterious, deep, and unexplored cave. There's excellent interaction between the characters, and the suspenseful scenes with difficult to see creatures menacing the team. Close hand to hand combat and claustrophobia are the order of this adventure, which rarely lets down. The director wastes about a half hour with unnecessary back stories, and nearly puts you to sleep, but if you make it to the chapter when they enter the cave, you will be rewarded. The acting is superb, the monsters appropriately yecchy and creepy for their grisly purpose.<br/><br/>This could have been a better production with another director more masterful at the horror genre; however, the movie is still very chilling in places, and a worth while way to spend a couple of hours."

","After the wild Army guys-vs.-werewolves ride that was DOG SOLDIERS, I was hoping that British director Neil Marshall would top himself with his next outing, and boy, was I NOT disappointed! I can guarantee that lovers of tough-chicks-kicking-ass-extravaganzas like ALIENS, the TERMINATOR films and even THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT will not be sorry they invested the time in making THE DESCENT. Even non-distaff-oriented horror fans won't see this one coming...or expect to enjoy it as much as I believe they will. But be forewarned: only a claustrophobic who has masochistic tendencies will be able to tough out some of the scenes in this movie. I'm not afflicted with this particular phobia, and there were moments when even I could feel my throat closing up....<br/><br/>THE DESCENT is the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) a free-spirited, adventurous gal whose world is completely shattered while on an outing with friends, when she survives a freak car collision that leaves her the sole survivor, taking the lives of her husband and child. (As many car accidents as I've seen in movies, this one still ranks as one of the most brutally horrific.) <br/><br/>A year later, Sarah's best gal pal, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) reunites Sarah and all the girls for one mother of an adventure, to renew their bonds and to help Sarah heal from the tragedy. The objective: a spelunking expedition through an uncharted series of passages, in a well-traveled section of the Appalachians. Well, that's what the group believes, anyway. What they don't know is that the egotistic and headstrong Juno has a few ""surprises"" in store for the ladies. <br/><br/>And what none of them know is that the caves are holding their own nasty and terrifying surprises in store...<br/><br/>Marshall is in top form here, and he proves that he can make a great film chock-a-block with female heroines as well as anything James Cameron or Ridley Scott has ever made. Though the cast is virtually made up of unknowns, they are engaging and compelling, each with her own personality and coping mechanisms to deal with situations that only get more and more harrowing by the minute. And though it is pretty much a horror film, it also has elements of a relationship drama, with a startling twist that will elicit as many gasps from the audience as some of the more brutal scenes that take place when the girls go deep into the caves and find...<br/><br/>But I'm not going to tell you about THAT. You want spoilers? Go read the other reviews. The less you know about this movie going in, the better. <br/><br/>Although there's not a serial killer in sight, I have to thank Mr. Marshall for THE DESCENT. As bitterly disappointed as I was with the potential promise of a movie like HIGH TENSION, he shows those filmmakers - and us - how it's really supposed to be done."

However it'll probably put you off going into any caves for a loooong time :) It can play with your mind, at one point while i was watching it i was starting to wonder how painful some of those things must have been like for example *SPOILER* when one of the girls fell and broke her leg, you watch that while cringing, it made me feel physically sick *END SPOILER* but i guess that's what you want from a horror movie sometimes.

I wasn't expecting much of the Descent, but boy was I wrong. from the minute the film started I felt like I was watching the work of a completely different filmmaker. I was knocked out at the difference in storytelling and overall confidence in this film compared to the last one. I thought it made brilliant use of the caving location and didn't miss one trick to ramp up the action. I thought that when the story changes direction and they have to deal with what's down there that it made what could have been a silly plot into something believable and scary. Wish I could see more thrillers like this."

"doctorsmoothlove","7","0","1","12 March 2008"," Disappointing but still Neil Marshall's film, so it isn't bad.
","Everyone has a setback I suppose. I was hoping that Neil Marshall wouldn't for quite sometime, however. I throughly enjoyed his directing debut Dog Soldiers, and I had read many positive reviews of this film. It even won Saturn's award for the best horror film of 2006. While not horrible, The Descent is still an above average horror film that is occasionally horrifying. It lacked several of the factors that were present in Dog Soldiers, which is why I didn't enjoy it as much. I'm not trying to complain and say that I disliked it because it wasn't Dog Soldiers. Moreover, Dog Soldiers had several elements that are present in any great horror film.<br/><br/>Well, several of Marshall's auteur traits are showing their development in this film. Like Dog Soldiers, the film opens with a frightening death sequence, but this one is completely unrelated to the monsters. In the opening of Dog Soldiers, we are shown the werewolves killing some campers which frightens us and makes us anticipate their arrival. In The Descent, Sarah's husband's death was tangential to both the monsters and her ""development"" (or lack thereof) as a character. It barely made a difference other than the stereotypical depression it gave her. In the beginning of both films we see a dead animal and, fortunately, it does act to the tension in the both of them. Dog Soldiers' animal scene was more amusing, though. Additionally, Marshall delays the complete visibility of both monsters until about halfway in the films. This manifests a striking difference between the two films. In Dog Soldiers, we are aware of the carnage the werewolves commit and this makes us antsy. In The Descent, little evidence (save the dead animal) is shown of the creature's brutality nor do we have a preconceived notion of how threatening they are (since they are not based on actual mythical beasts). Therefore, the first half of The Descent is not nearly as entertaining as the first half of Dog Soldiers. One aspect that The Descent does better than Dog Soldiers is its ability to scare us without violence and bloodshed. There are several good frightening scenes which involve skillful framing and camera placement. There are also times where a character walks alone in the dark and doesn't die. This will scare you, just like Annie's walk to the washroom in the original Halloween (well sort of, she doesn't die immediately). This shows how knowledgeable Marshall is about the horror genre and his skill as a director. The Descent is also much darker (physically darker) than Dog Soldiers which does add the creepiness, but at the same time, makes it difficult to see the victims as they are attacked. When the first person was attacked (the fact that I cannot recall her name even with IMDb's help should tell you something) I was not surprised because I couldn't tell what was happening. I had to reverse the DVD for a few times to see it. Finally, we come to the most critical reason why The Descent is inferior to Dog Soldiers. The answer is characterization. When I first viewed Dog Soldiers, I was startled by how well the characters were developed and the questions I had about their personalities. I won't delve into that here (See my Dog Soldiers review for more information). In The Descent, we are shown the tragic death of Sarah's husband and little else. The other characters are periphery. While even Dog Soldiers had a few bit characters, The Descent had too many. The other characters besides Sarah and Juno were nothing more than plot instruments. Their only purpose was to be killed. I found this very disappointing. I wasn't expecting a complete character cast, but jeez, give me more than cute British girls and guts. The endings were another startling difference between the two. While Dog Soldiers' ending brought closure, Sarah's flashback was completely out of place. If more explanation of how her daughter's death had affect her, then it would have been acceptable but not preferred. The uncut ending where Sarah escapes to the car is much better than the theatrical ending. I'm sure that you'll know this but Marshall owes Peter Jackson a thank-you card. The creatures from this film were animated to appear the same as Gollum in LOTR.<br/><br/>So, don't think I didn't enjoy The Descent. I did but only a little. I was too disappointed to get the full benefit from this film. I would recommend that anyone who enjoys the genre see it. It's one of the best horror films to be released since Dog Soldiers itself. Those who aren't critics will probably enjoy it, hence the high rating on the IMDb. I, however, was disappointed but only because of its failure to build upon Dog Soldiers'. This film also elevates Neil Marshall to the throne of modern horror directors. With American horror stuck in sub-par remakes of Japanese films and 80's slasher films, he created two original and entertaining films. Both of which were not based on a novel, adding to his creativity as a writer. Unfortunately, both are being followed by American sequels which are bound to be vastly inferior (except The Descent II since Neil will be part of the project). Let's hope Doomsday can repair the mistakes this film has and return to the prominence of Dog Soldiers."

First because I am a generation or more older than most viewers that did and recall real suspense and terror in Alien. This flick wasn't on another planet, but had non-human terror makers, and a bunch of cheesy acting women who I could not root for the way I did for the female heroin, in Alien.<br/><br/>Dumb and much too drawn out build up to the real terror parts of this flick, which really are too much special effects and lighting snafus to be sacry.

But, this is of course my psychological training and a subjective impression.<br/><br/>I was baffled by some of the ending scenes which seemed to make no sense.<br/><br/>A grade A flick this isn't, but might make good light entertainment.

","Sometimes I feel like I'm a couple of years behind everyone else. I had read the reviews from my online ""friends"", but for whatever reason, I had a hard time believing what they were writing about The Descent. I thought there was no way it could be that good! Well, they were right and I was wrong because The Descent is surely one of the best horror films this century has thus far produced. I've been watching horror for 35 or so years and it takes a lot to frighten me. I mention this not as a boast, but to put some credence behind my statement that The Descent is one of the scarier movies I've ever seen. It's frightening because it works on several different levels. There's the fear of closed spaces. There's the fear of the dark. There's the fear of the unfamiliar. And there is the fear of some unknown creature. Director Neil Marshall masterfully plays with each one of these types of fear. I was literally on the edge of my seat. In addition, most everything else about The Descent is first rate  acting, special effects (nice to see so much non-CGI on display), sound, editing, lighting, cinematography, etc. It's a very nice job indeed! <br/><br/>Another thing that Marshall did that I really like was he kept it ""real"". What I mean is that everything worked within the framework of reality as the audience knows it (well that is if you accept the notion of the underground creatures). The women were real and most of their reactions to the situations they found themselves in were real. The cave felt real even though it wasn't. The cave lighting was real and justified given the equipment the women were carrying. Even the albino mutants seemed to operate and function in a manner I would expect from such creatures. It's this realism that Marshall put into The Descent that goes a long way to making it as frightening as it is.<br/><br/>As good as The Descent is and as much as I enjoyed the experience, it's not a perfect movie. There are a couple of areas where I thought Marshall should have done something differently. First, did there have to be a final showdown between two of the women? I realize it was necessary for the subplot of Sarah taking control of her life, but did it have to be so clichéd? Second, some of the foreshadowing all but slaps you in the face with its obviousness. Yeah, she left the map in her car  do you have to beat me over the head with it? I realize these are very minor quibbles and hardly take anything away from the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I can't wait to see what Neil Marshall comes up with next. He is truly one of the most promising directors working in horror today."

","Watching The Descent scared the hell out of me. But more than that it stayed in my head for several days afterward and became something of an intellectual/fearful exercise. For a seemingly straight-ahead horror fest this flick has got some real depth (apart from the milieu)-so much so that none of it needs to have actually, physically happened to the characters for the film to hit its mark. Though it is never plainly stated, you can conclude (if you want) that it was all a product of the grief-stricken mother's imagination...a death vision in the same vein as Jacob's Ladder, though much more coherent than Jacob's... In any case, this claustrophobic, unrelenting film is slated for timelessness in my book. Because like so many great films (especially in the horror and sci-fi realms) The Descent is as much an emotional trip inward to the dark parts of ourselves as it is a physical journey."

","A cut above the usual formulaic horror yarn, but not that far removed from its plot. This film failed to fascinate through hackneyed ""psychological"" tension between catty PMS'ing rock chicks who seem to be wearing an ""easy kill"" sign on their heads from the moment a line is dropped into the cave. 'The Descent' also failed to deliver seriously scary moments, even though it threw quite a few number of cheap false scare moments into the mix. This is mostly a ""girls night out fright date"" film, the ""let's stay up and bake muffins, and watch Descent! Yay! kinda film"".<br/><br/>'The Descent' also begs the question, if you had a ""beef"" with a cheating friend and both of you were fleeing flesh eating, cave dwelling humanoids, and your chances of survival were hanging in the balance, would you stop to have it out, or would you help each other to escape, then have it out? Apparently the female mind rules the day here. It's not wonder the film, therefore, has no happy ending.<br/><br/>On the plus side, credit goes to the creature's creators, set design and other technical merits (probably all created by males). 'The Descent' isn't total garbage, there's some things to like about it, including the Filipina chic playing tough-girl ""Juno"", but it's fairly forgettable."

","Not bad. But the lack of character development and too many unanswered questions left me a bit frustrated with this one. I wouldn't say this is a horror movie so much as it is a thriller. It does a very good job keeping up the tension in this dark, damp, subterranean, hell. The characters, all British women with diet ad bodies and beer commercial attitudes, enter what they believe is a previously unexplored cavern in rural Applachia. The fun begins the moment they realize that not only has the cavern been explored in the past but that they are not alone. A race of carnivorous, nocturnal, humanoids which evolution forgot, begin stalking them as their next meal. From here it's matter of fight rather than flight as the only entrance they know have has been sealed by a cave in. One by one they are picked off as they desperately try to fight their way back to the surface using only primal instinct and cryptic clues left behind by previous explorers. By now we know why they were never heard from again.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is nicely presented. Although at times a bit too dark to make out the action due to some very staccato editing; a technique bordering on the annoying. The relationships between these women, all friends on a bonding trip, is fairly well scoped out and maintained. The fulcrum of the plot surrounding Sam and Sharon is built up in the film's beginning yet never fully developed. We know know only of some sort of previous tension between these two which festers throughout the film to it's ultimate pinnacle, yet never are we let in on what exactly that was about, which was odd. We are also given little information about the creatures other than rudimentary speculation by one of the women that they may be ""cave men who never left the cave"". It would have been much more interesting to learn more about them, however that's just my personal choice. It really wasn't required for the purposes of scaring the hell out of you.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the film was different and it was interesting. The creepy subterranean environment really draws you in as frankly most of us have never been in underground caverns. The action sequences, editing aside, are still quite good and quite gory. Most of all I really enjoyed the way it ended, which I won't give away. It actually fooled me, and it may fool you too.<br/><br/>A decent effort, flawed, yet entertaining. Definitely recommend this one."

","I had no expectation before watch this movie, but impressive enough to kept me guessing the end. Horror genres got so 'not-so-scary', since horror genre became b-grade Tarantino' style - just epitome of visual virtuosity but no suspenses.

The script was original as 'cube'. If you are a horror movie fan, you wouldn't be disappointed. Assume that human fear most is physical vulnerability than psychological as mind can be stronger in situation but there is certain limitation in physics.<br/><br/>The sublime in the plot is cleverly done as you might guess in the end that she is in living hell, also the message in the movie 'love each day' is a clever paradoxical use of metaphor in the movie.

","In ""The Descent"" six girlfriend gather for their yearly caving adventure - only this time, one of the girls has discovered some caves which do not appear on any map - pity for them, as their fun adventure turns into a terrifying fight for their lives as they encounter some deadly sub-human creatures.<br/><br/>So what is so fantastic about ""The Descent"" then? Well, the acting for a start. All six young women are talented actresses who bring their respective characters to life. Shauna MacDonald plays the troubled Sarah, Natalie Mendoza is the over-achieving Juno, Alex Reid portrays the comely Beth, Saskia Mulder is the lovely Rebecca, and MyAnna Buring plays her sensitive sister, while Nora-Jane No one rounds out the cast as newcomer Holly.<br/><br/>Secondly, the wait. You know something is going to happen, but the film does take a little while for the action and tension to begin. But it does have a sense of morbidness right from the beginning. ""The Descent"", like many horror films, uses a back story, in this case a tragic event that happened one year earlier to Sarah, which plays an important part throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, what's most memorable about ""The Descent"" though is the terror that quite literally surrounds the cast when they are in these mysterious new caverns. And it's not just the mysterious sub-human like creatures - but the caverns themselves which prove to be dangerous for the trapped girls. People with claustrophobia should be cautioned before watching this film! The gore is brutal - there's no doubt about that, and as most of the girls, particularly Juno and Sarah, put up great fights against the creatures, the gore - blood, guts, everything - is plentiful - but without being distasteful. Particularly disturbing scenes include when Sarah falls into the pit of blood, the death scene where - I won't name her - is still alive and watching as the creatures begin to eat her, and a climatic and deadly encounter between two of the girls.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" combines the best parts of horror films and wraps them all into one tightly produced masterpiece - if the creatures don't get you, the caves certainly will."

","I was positively impressed by this very keenly made film that is concomitantly a complete horror,a gruesome and extremely brutal adventure movie,and a grim,startling suspense film.It stands alone in the more recent horror output.The fearful twists are indeed creepy and efficient.I saw newly two recent horrors, Silent Hill (2006) and The Descent (2005);the superiority of The Descent (2005) is obvious.It is very thrilling,suspenseful,and fortunately centered on adventure only,without much psychology,etc..The pace is absolutely wonderful.The story is logical,satisfactory but at the same time unpredictable.It is devoid of puerility,and very fine crafted;it has a neatness,a certain elegance that makes it so enjoyable.I would suggest to resume the comparison:while ""S. Hill"" is organized by several frightful,chilling visions,and the narration is an arabesque,The Descent (2005)is organized from within by a well paced and breathtaking adventure,and it develops within the order of the adventures,videlicet on this level. Directed and also written by Neil Marshall,The Descent (2005)is the second horror of this director.<br/><br/>A band of sporting young women descend into a cave.There they meet dangers they were totally unaware of.Their adventures are so astonishing,the movie seems too short.The cast numbers Natalie Jackson Mendoza,Shauna Macdonald,Saskia Mulder,Nora-Jane No one as a tough girl, Alex Reid.The Descent (2005)is concise and economic."

","The Descent<br/><br/>Now here's an interesting movie. It's interesting because it starts so bad yet becomes so good. The first 50% is nothing else but girls doing girls stuff. I find girl stuff boring. Thinking for a moment that this is just another coed chick-flick in bra's getting butchered in a shower. When half of the movie is done the real thing starts: creepy stuff going on in the caves. Sounds...<br/><br/>I won't tell the rest of the story but those (initially boring) girls need to fight their nuts (...) off to save their lives and they do it well! I really love a fighting spirit. In life and in movies. Please do rent it.<br/><br/>=== PLOT ===<br/><br/>A group of coeds decide to descend into a cave to explore it for sports. When one of the girls gets stuck somewhere in the cave, monsters attack the girls. It's easy to see they want to eat the girls. Though the ladies are off course scared, they put up a good fight.<br/><br/>=== GOOD STUFF ===<br/><br/>The fighting is actually realistic. When brute muscle power is needed, for example, you can clearly see by the face that effort is taken. The scenery is dark, but it has enough (smart) lighting to see what's going on and what the monsters look like. This adds well to the tension in the movie.<br/><br/>Sound is not top of the bill, but when needed it does the job. As opposed to many movies where sound tries to scare people, sound is this particular movie has only a supporting role. It works out nicely.<br/><br/>Acting. Acting is OK. I realize it's perhaps not the best acting ever, but it fits nicely into the movie - in an enjoyable way.<br/><br/>=== BAD STUFF ===<br/><br/>Not much bad stuff to tell actually. The first half of the movie is just plain boring. It attempts to do some character building but they fail, as the true nature (spirit) of the girls is to be seen when in peril.<br/><br/>=== VERDICT ===<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Although half of the movie is about nothing, the other half demonstrates the very thing I value: effort. The girls demonstrate a fighting spirit in a realistic way. Mentally and physically. Also, the monsters look hideous enough.<br/><br/>But most importantly, it's rare to find movies where girls or women fight real good and seeing such a movie is refreshing to me. That's why I gave it 80% though I only enjoyed half of the movie."

","This film has polarised opinion quite sharply, and has inevitably been compared and contrasted with ""The Cave"", released at a similar time and with broadly similar themes. For me Neil Marshall has created an above average tale, which, whilst paying homage to the genre steers away from cliché.<br/><br/>The pretty much all female cast toys with the viewers stereo types. A girly, simpering whimpering band they are not. Dramatic tension between the characters is well developed ,and heroic deeds are just that, without the ""macho"" bravado that can bloat a Stallone style performance.<br/><br/>Stylistically, those familiar with ""Dog Soldiers"" will not be disappointed or surprised. The ""b list"" cast pull together in true egalitarian style to play their parts without trying to steal the show - sometimes less is more, and understated horror is often the best.<br/><br/>The transition from ""cavers lost in a cave"" to ""cavers terrorised by strange things"" is a bit ""clunky"". But it is a tribute to the film that it would have worked as a straight caving accident drama.<br/><br/>At 99 minutes it just stays within its welcome - and has run its course.

Clearly the intention was that they had become as horrific as the creature/blind gollum/monsters they were trying to escape , but for a grief-ridden widow/mother to suddenly turn into a monstrously murderous vengeful horror happy to linger around and try to kill off her former friend instead of trying to get out of the cave is too much beyond belief for me.

","OK, I have seen this movie with high hopes based on some positive reviews from this site. I find that the movie has some qualities and it was an interesting watch but overall it is a pretty bad effort.<br/><br/>I have some serious problems with the logic of the movie regarding the creatures such as:<br/><br/>1. The creatures do not use tools of any kind. There is no way they would survive if they have to rely on their hands and teeth to kill deer etc. Even chimpanzees use ""tools"" such as branches or stones. There is LOT of stone in the caves and yet not even one creature uses it to fight with. <br/><br/><ul><li>How exactly do they hunt anything large enough to sustain the ""tribe""? How can they overpower large prey at all without heavy casualties, especially on the surface?</li></ul><br/><br/>2. Lot of controversy regarding their senses. - The creatures cant notice a grown person who is 15-30 cm away?! Not even by smell or touch (in one scene)? They do not even notice the body warmth? They apparently cant see anything (like red camera eye 5 cm from their face)... <br/><br/><ul><li>... yet in fight scenes they know where their opponents are. Echolocation is not that fast or precise (remember, bats hunt insects and do not actually have to fight their prey), besides in the fights they don't even use it. </li></ul><br/><br/>3. Near the end of the movie, 2 women fight and kill 3 male hunters. It is pretty clear from a previous scene that grown male creatures can overpower a woman in 1-on-1 combat (which is logical). <br/><br/><ul><li>Of course, if the creatures are blind, cant smell, don't have very sensitive skin to the touch or temperature, don't have good enough hearing to compensate and don't use weapons of any kind then there is a good chance they would lose the fight :)</li></ul>"

","Six thrill seeking friends explore an uncharted cave system in the Appalachian Mountains only to find themselves trapped without a map in ""The Descent"". As the all-female cast traverse into the bowels of the wilderness, or the metaphoric equivalent of Mother Nature's womb, disaster begins to strike at every turn. The film builds with a well-plotted tension rarely seen in modern horror, but unfortunately it falls apart in the latter half regardless of how deliberately orgasmic the young women's screams sound. There is a fine line between satisfying the audience for the audience's sake and by virtue of spinning a worthwhile tale. The early strengths of ""The Descent"" are squandered by uninvited guests, so to speak. No matter how much the filmmakers might believe otherwise, the heightened dangers discovered in the second half actually detract from the frightening, claustrophobic, man (or woman) versus nature realism it sets up with such skill."

While these elements can be part of a good horror movie, in my opinion they shouldn't be the backbone of one. Personally I want an atmospheric, clever movie where hope and dread slowly circle each other; one which has interesting turns and shifts ; which slowly reveals knowledge that is both awesome and terrible. Movies that just go for a lot of running and screaming don't often fall into that category. Maybe the problem for me is that I wish Horror had sub categories: Weird, Gore, Poe-Ish, etc. But since it doesn't seem to, I have to rate all these in one category.

","Well, I watched ""The Descent"" with high hopes and, for the first thirty minutes, the film wasn't bad. However, once the movie got to the point where ""the enemy"" arrived, it was down hill from there. The problem with the film is simple: Considering that the actresses are virtual unknowns and they are wearing indistinguishable clothes, it would have been nice if the viewer could tell them apart from each other. Since they weren't and since the action sequences were all quick cutaways and close ups of various body movements, it was nearly impossible to distinguish what was occurring and to whom it was occurring too. Also, I thought ""the enemy"" was going to be something unique. Instead they are just odd looking humanoids, albeit flesh eaters, who cannot see. Frankly, their appearance and the sounds they made, reminded me of a character from the second to last season of ""Angel."" He too lived underground and made a clicking sound. I wonder if the writers of the movie saw the couple of episodes of ""Angel"" and ran with the idea? In summary, ""The Descent"" had a decent premise but went wrong pretty quickly. And, about the ending, it made no sense. I cannot favor a movie which makes no sense when it ends."

","This is an uncharacteristically engaging horror flick, though the most interesting sequences have nothing to do with the carnivorous, mutant humanoids the adventurous women encounter in the depths of the cave they explore. The hazards the women face as spelunkers navigating the labyrinthine caverns are actually more engaging than the terror sequences involving the monsters.<br/><br/>Then there is the subplot of the apparent affair one friend had with another's husband. Like many other horror flicks, an story strand that could have made for an intriguing plot element is never developed, and apparently tidily resolved by one woman's death at the hands of another.<br/><br/>The film certainly serves up a fair share of scares, as was its intent, but the flaws hold it back from being the true classic it could have been, the mishandled subplot being one of those flaws. And the makers of this film would have you believe that creatures that have evolved to hunt and survive in darkness would lose all of their senses except for their hearing--finding prey by echo location. While the blindness is perfectly logical, any suspension of disbelief is shattered when one creature crawls over top of two women huddled in the dark and doesn't know they're there. Preposterous. I suppose a subterranean existence in a 52-degree habitat of darkness wrecked the creatures' sense of smell and touch. Another creature crouches with its hand planted on the head of another woman and doesn't realize it. Yes, the warm skull of a human can apparently be easily mistaken for a rock.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film as being better than the average horror flick, but, honestly, that's really not saying much these days. If you like this sort of thing and can look past plot flaws and elements that just don't follow logic, this is a scary pulse-pounder."
"ingres77","7","0","1","20 January 2007"," An overdone film that should've been better
","As a rule, I tend to avoid horror movies. It's been my experience that those who make them spend too much time either trying to recycle previous successes, or don't know that, most often, the unseen is far more terrifying than the seen. Horror films don't seem to draw the most creative minds in the industry.<br/><br/>This film is better than the average horror flick, but that still doesn't make it a spectacular movie. Too much time is spent, in the beginning, showing that these women are ""overall"" fairly happy. Shots of them all sitting around a cabin smiling, laughing, and telling stories. None of the actors were good enough to make the stilted banter anything but awkward. I didn't believe these women were friends - in spite of the obvious ""fun"" they were having. Besides, do we really need to be told that these women lead relatively happy lives (other than one)? Isn't it an accepted fact that the events about to play out are going to be a nasty surprise to the characters? Don't try to build suspense by doing exactly what every other horror movie has done. It's hard to be in suspense when you know exactly what's going to happen (their idyllic adventure is going to go horribly wrong).<br/><br/>But the second act improves greatly. The women go down into a cave (which, inexplicably, is the wrong one - though only one of the women knows this), an unexplored labyrinth which emotes danger like nothing else. Of course, you've got the reckless woman of the group (who you know is going to cause trouble down the road), who is annoying, but she isn't given much screen time.<br/><br/>From here, the film is patiently structured to heighten the tension, and the darkness gives a nice sense of foreboding that terrorizes deliciously. This film is oppressive in the middle section, and you can't help but be claustrophobic. You know something bad is lurking just out of the range of the meager flashlights the women have, but you have no idea what it is, or when it'll make it's appearance.<br/><br/>And this is why the film is scary. Not because people are killed in gruesome ways (though they eventually are), and not because of the horrific countenance of the monsters (who resemble men in costumes, imagine that), but because the dark is frightening, and it's used to great effect.<br/><br/>Sadly, the latter third of the film is nothing more than a blood-fest, and the creatures are displayed in all their naked man glory. When you first see one of the creatures, off in the distance, briefly illuminated, you'll start to shake with the unbridled horror of it's ""alienness"". The unnerving sound it makes, and the unexpectedness of it's appearance will shake you to the core. Brief flashes of it over the next half-hour will make you question why you ever decided to watch this movie in the first place. Like the characters, you yearn for light again, and want to scream with what you imagine lies just beyond your sight.<br/><br/>But the feeling doesn't last. And that's why I give this movie a '7'. Instead of drawing the suspense out, and keeping the creatures hidden, writer/director Neil Marshall chose to reveal the monsters and then try to gross everyone out with blood and cannibalism. For this viewer, the effect was disappointing and broke the dark magic he'd created.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, this film is an improvement on typical horror dreck, and was a nice breath of fresh air from the Saw series and it's derivatives (Hostel). I recommend it, but don't look for this film to be the greatest thing since Ringu."

","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked like the most terrifying movie I would ever see...but I also thought that it would be more of a psychological thriller than it was. I know that I am selective when it comes to horror films. I'm not into pure blood and gore, and I don't like zombie movies. This movie has elements of both which I find disappointing. The movie has a premise which is terrifying in and of itself--a group of friends trapped in a cave. Why bother with the creatures? The most frightening parts of the movie occurred in the first half, with the single most terrifying being the scene in which one woman gets stuck crawling through the tunnel. I had to remind myself to breathe during that scene. After the intense claustrophobia scene, the standard gory creature-flick feel of the rest is a letdown.<br/><br/>I will give credit where credit is due, however, and this is why I have decided to bump the rating up to a 7. The characters of the movie are more well-developed than I am used to seeing in most American-made horror flicks. The subplots are subtle; no wasted time or energy, nor insults to the audience's intelligence with overly-dramatic scenes that pose as character development. The evolution of the character of ""Sarah"" is intriguing, and the end of the movie was both shocking and intelligent (for all my ""fellow American"" fans, I am referring to the original director's cut, not the American release).<br/><br/>I am sure that many horror fans will enjoy this movie immensely.

","Reading my previous comments you can assume I am playing a tough and demanding piece of audience. But it is out of right point. The descent got me!What a trap, what a cave! The atmosphere of movie is awesome. Narrow paths reflecting the light jumbled up is unique in this case. Good place! A healthy screenplay delighted me. No crap, i must admit. It was as close to the very originality as close to the plot pieces of horror movies. There are many scenes which kick a breath out of you, count on it. I counted on it and it still functioned. I checked my pulse several times and yes, it could break any polygraph. Although some sudden freaking started being a little predictable, it was not boring at all. The good part was the input of sort of unconscious imagination, which usefully confused me or returned me back to the despair of Sarah. The freaks living in the cave were scary, for me they were. Their color really fits the cave furniture. I partly did not consume the parts where girls record stuff by camera, Blair witching is barely to be overcome, but it was fine. Believe me, I would never ever visit such a cave, crawling in narrow corridors. And one more thing- watch that film in cinema to get proper sound and image. And then you better go for a bier to abreact. Otherwise....achtung baby..."
"jax713","3","0","2","11 January 2007"," Disappointing
","Neil Marshall certainly knows how to scare us but The Descent is a disappointing encore from the creative mind that gave us Dog Soldiers. While Dog Soldiers was smart, funny, suspenseful and as realistic as a horror movie can be, The Descent is simply a gore fest strewn with contrivances to make us jump in our seats. Are you afraid of the dark? Are you afraid of heights? Are you afraid of being trapped with no way out? Are you claustrophobic? Does a woman stand a chance against a wild beast? Are you afraid of fear? On and on it goes, a continuous sophomoric thread of various frights choreographed to jolt the audience, like a Halloween house of horror built by high school students. There is no real suspense, just the edginess from wondering when the next Thing will jump out of the shadows.<br/><br/>Marshall does a fine job getting the most from his cast and the pacing of the film is just right. He also gives us the originality of 6 very strong female characters without painting them as caricatures or as social aberrations and this deserves high praise. There are many indications of Marshall's talent for bringing fresh ideas to the big screen and his ingenuity as a filmmaker. However, the bottom line is that the weak plot and lack of character development pretty much dead-ends any emotional involvement in this story. What we're left with is an amusement park ride that lasts for about 90 minutes and, sadly, this alone will sell movie tickets and DVD rentals. Marshall has far more potential than this and I hope he can stay hungry enough to develop it."

","This is a movie by the same guy,Neil Marshall, that gave us ""Dog Soldiers"",a great werewolf movie.While ""The Descent"" isn't quite as good, the guy without a doubt knows how to make a movie.This movie is an England product and in fact it is a bit bothersome that the best of the modern horror movies seems to come from overseas these days.Maybe the US has enough horror these days without having to make movies,huh? Oh well as long as someone keeps making good horror movies....<br/><br/>Anyway six women go into an uncharted cave in Appalachia and soon discover that they are not alone.They find themselves 2 miles underground with their original route no longer accessible.They battle with each other and the cave dwellers to try and find a way to the surface.What would live 2 miles underground in total darkness? It can't be anything good.<br/><br/>This movie is well paced and well written and the acting is decent,although at times some of the actresses were emoting a bit too much.The gore is plentiful and the special effects are very well done.This movie will make you jump a few times.And I like that.<br/><br/>The only downside to the movie I found was the darkness.Taking place in a cave there was a lot of darkness ,of course, and for me a dark movie has always been hard to follow even on a big screen in a theater.This movie was a bit hard to keep up with at times due to the lack of light,especially some of the fast paced fight scenes.I tweaked the brightness a bit on my TV and that helped some.Also some of the women have a bit of an accent that was hard to follow at times with the cave echo and the screaming.Even with six women there was no skin in this movie but the movie was so well done I didn't miss it much.<br/><br/>This is a fairly original movie that will keep your attention throughout.For me a great a movie is one I'll rate an 8 or higher.I gave this a 7 because of the constant battle to see what was happening in the dark setting.While it may not be a great movie it is a cut way above most of the dreck that is called ""horror"" these days."

","A year after one woman loses her husband and daughter in a freak car accident, she joins up with five of her friends to go spelunking in a big cave. But a fun afternoon turns tragic, and the women are not alone... can they survive the dark, tight spaces, and the unknown? This movie is by no means original. Other movies take place in caves and other horror movies take place in caves and other movies, horror and others, have people encountering similar problems in caves. For example, ""The Cave"" (see the review for this elsewhere). But this is not to say it's a bad film... all movies have predecessors, and this might set the new standard for cave movies.<br/><br/>Also, I should highlight Neil Marshall, a ""rising star"" on the horror scene and a member of the nonsensically sorted group known as the ""Splat Pack"". This is his second horror film, following ""Dog Soldiers"". Many in the horror world and in the media have praised ""The Descent""... but the real praise should be for ""Dog Soldiers"", which is by far the better movie in terms of plot, editing and gore.<br/><br/>""The Descent""'s biggest flaw was, for me, the editing and pacing. I watched the DVD timer and the entire first hour consisted of simple talking about random things with no plot relevance (I'm glad they have a good girl's weekend, but why does this matter?). The action arrives in the last twenty minutes. The action is gory and fast-paced, but hardly makes up for the first hour. Could we have extended the second half and lost the first half? Or maybe just condensed this to an hour long film? I realize theaters won't carry shorter movies, but the fact of the matter is there was not enough of a story to tell here.<br/><br/>I also think the number of characters could be reduced. I cannot tell you the names of the women for the most part, and they had little back story. Cutting the number down to four or five and making them more three dimensional would have helped tons. I think there was a lesbian relationship in there somewhere, but it was not made clear. And the thick Scottish and Irish accents made the women more dense... far too dense to throw that many people in without developing them.<br/><br/>One small complaint: the women in this film were supposed to be about twenty-five from what I could gather. I found them to be in their mid-thirties. This made the film not only misleading (why do you look so old?) but denied the viewer a horror staple: young women. The iconic blood bath scene was hot, but would have been even hotter with a younger woman. (I suppose you could argue the woman with the child needed to look older, but I don't think so. A 25-year old woman could easily have a 6-year old daughter, especially after seeing ""Amityville Horror"" where a young Melissa George somehow has a 12-year old daughter.) <br/><br/>If you have the option, watch this film on DVD, because I honestly think the best part was the outtakes. Showing the green screen was hilarious... a nice surprise after such a snoozer of a film. I'm also disappointed in the special effects... notably the fake bats. Marshall proved in ""Dog Soldiers"" he's a fake gore and puppetry master -- why all the computerized blood and bats and morlocks? <br/><br/>Despite all my nitpickery and bashing, the movie is still worth seeing and really sets a pace for other films of its kind. Neil Marshall has made a name for himself with this one and I hope he is able to ride that wave with ""Doomsday"" and future projects. I know what he's capable of and I want nothing more than for him to give fans the very best."

","The first 20 minutes may seem lame for a lot of people, but pay of later, as the establishment of the characters and their relations will help you to get a bit more involved. Once it starts, it does not stop. What comes, is a thrill-ride, so refined and totally claustrophobic, you simply could not push the tension any further. The movie keeps you under permanent stress, gradually increasing the intensity as the expanding frustration and desperateness takes over. The fact that they are scaring you to death like every 1-2 minutes helps too. Thank god, no one really cared about ""giving the audience a break now"". This is really intense, no kiddin. 8/10 - Most scares and one of the best horror flicks."

","Neil Marshall is perhaps not as prolific as fellow members of the so-called ""Splat Pack,"" (Alexandre Aja, Darren Lynn Bousman, Greg McLean, Eli Roth, James Wan, Leigh Whannell & Rob Zombie) but in my opinion, his two full-length films (""Dog Soldiers"" & ""The Descent"") have already put him at the top of that list. Marshall treats the genre with more maturity, I think, than most of the above directors, and his strong background in drama pays off. While I understand this genre is not big in character development, Marshall brings just enough to add dramatic tension between the characters and make us care about their fates (as with Sarah & Juno in this film).<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent, the splatter is not crazily over the top, and the editing is smooth. It also looks like Marshall did some serious research in spelunking for this film, and cinematographer Sam McCurdy did an awesome job with the low lighting in the caves and conveying a sense of claustrophobia. I wish I could comment more about how he handles the subject, but I can't do it without spoilers.<br/><br/>This is the first film of this genre (including ""Saw 2,"" ""Hostel,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""The Devil's Rejects"" and others by fellow Splat Packers) that I have given a rating above 7 (7.2).<br/><br/>Without giving away too much, there are Cherokee legends and other Native American stories that do support the concept in this film..."

","One of the good things about The Descent is that it takes a little time to set up the relationships between the characters. A few small interactions and you know who these people are, are comfortable with them, and can get on with the story. What's best, however, is that this movie doesn't simply rely on creature-feature horror and gore to get you through the majority of the movie. In fact, this film relies on some of the horrors we can find in real life to create a lot of the tension in the first portion of the movie, before upping the ante by introducing creatures that are out for your tasty-tasty body.<br/><br/>It makes the absolute best of the setting; for the majority of the movie it's easy to believe that the only light that was filmed by were the sources of light that you get to see on-screen (headlamps, torches, flares, and glow sticks), similarly the camera angles and sound design do their best to recreate the dark, claustrophobic, and dangerous art of caving. It could be easy to forget that this horror move is meant to have creepy creatures in it, because the predicament the characters are in is bad enough.<br/><br/>Possibly trapped underground, injured, and with limited renewable light sources is the situation these girls find themselves when they encounter their first full-on Gollum/Orc love-child. (I'm being serious here; that is so exactly what they look like that it was uncanny.) This is where the movie gave up and became a little silly. The creatures were not particularly scary, the action was a bit mundane, and the only thing that lifted it from here on out were the moments where their original predicament (strange caves! trapped! injured! scared!) came back and made itself known. I enjoyed the ending and on the whole thought this movie lifted the genre. Certainly better than some of the other fare on offer out there.<br/><br/>Also, no acting prizes; the setting wins the award, here.<br/><br/>If you're looking at seeing this movie because you liked Dog Soldiers, be aware that this is a different beast altogether. There is much less humour, and more emotion. Possibly something to do with an almost all-male cast in Dog Soldiers, and an almost all-female one here?"

","I saw this at a film fest, so I feel fortunate at having the opportunity to see it in wide screen, with the original ending, with a live audience. It is, for starters, grim The entire movie happens underground, and the exceptional set direction lends the feeling of utter despair. It's not unlike a sort of Aliens 3, set beneath the surface of the earth, and with an inevitably rising body count. <br/><br/>The Descent falls into the same category as the director's previous film, Dog Soldiers - in which a British paramilitary force has to confront werewolves in a bleak forest. That's to say, The Descent is a genre film that takes its genre very seriously. True, not much here is new, and the film may seem overlong given the long underground sequences. But it's undeniably moody - and classy. With a more wit and a sharper plot, who knows how great this might have turned out?"

","The maker of DOG SOLDIERS is back with THE DESCENT, about a group of 20-something gals who go spelunking only to run into bloodthirsty cave creatures. Sound familiar? It should. The same plot was used for THE CAVE, although that group was coed. And like THE CAVE, THE DESCENT is only partially successful. The spelunking sequences are tense and scary, but once the monsters appear, all the tension and scariness blow out the window. The monsters can actually be seen as interfering with the plot, as the group has become trapped far underground and must find its way back to the surface. Furthermore, once glimpsed, the monsters are just plain silly. However, I will give the filmmakers kudos for the gore level, which quickly escalates once the monsters appear. There's also a ""rebirthing"" scene involving the lead character that was virtually duplicated in the more recent APOCALYPTO (THE DESCENT is a 2005 production, so it is anyone's guess why the delay in getting it to the U.S.). See THE DESCENT (and THE CAVE, for that matter) for the spelunking scenes. Skip the rest. Even the ""surprise"" ending is boring, although it may be a bit jarring for the unintiated."

","Visceral horror movie delves deep into atmospheric terror as six female adventurers set off on their annual group expedition, this years trip being centered around the lovely cave expedition one member has planned. With a finely implemented pace, The Descent moves along with a stylistic and palpable urgency usually not found in the horror genre, especially in what devolved into a more generic one. What, for at least half the film, felt like an anxious buildup of suspense carried impressively by the claustrophobic design, sadly reared off course into a less gripping scenario of stalker-based antics, followed by your surefire balls-out showdown providing fans with their much needed and satisfactorily delivered gore fix. The atmosphere intensive and psychologically compelling buildup far outweighed the more generic follow through to me, however that is not to say that these later action scenes, though edited beyond some recognition, are not executed with the same artistic integrity shown throughout the impressive shoot. For many of the inevitable generic trappings the nemesis can be compared with, credit must given to Neil Marshall for imagining this particularly arresting set design in order to let his mechanisms convincingly thrive. The all female cast make the journey a little more unique, bringing some interesting, albeit underdeveloped characters with intriguing though undercooked subplots to the table, but it is surely the setting itself that wins the attention of most.. an outstanding horror backdrop, to play out some less outstanding actual horror."

","I am completely on the fence about this one. On one hand, I watched it and the time passed quickly (usually if a movie is terrible you find yourself looking at your watch only to discover that you are only 30 minutes in hand still have well over an hour left) However, with this film I never felt the need to roll back my sleeve and peek at my watch, and by the time it was over I was stunned to find that I had been sitting in the cinema for almost 2 hours. That is a good thing. However, having said that, there are many movies that pass the time, but there are only a handful, in my opinion, that pass the time and leave you wanting more. That is something this movie didn't do. I had read some reviews of this film before I saw it, and all of them were very positive - describing its 'freshness' in a world full of clichéd horror flicks; mentioning its 'originality' when compared to the eons of other scream-fests that pollute the screens these days. So I went in expecting something out of the ordinary, and was not delivered anything remotely like that. I actually found that this movie employed all the old tricks - to such a degree that my cynical friend and I were muttering to each other at moments of 'high suspense' words to the effect of ""oh, no...don't go around the corner, there will be a monster there...oh, look - she went around the corner and there was a monster there..."" etc. And lets not mention just how similar this movie is to ""THE CAVE"" - but thank GOD they didn't have a plot-line whereby if you are bitten by one of the creatures you slowly turn into one. There were some pretty decent scares in it, though - and the suspense in parts was built up very well. The sound design was top-notch, as was the lighting. The make-up, too, deserves a mention as I found the 'creatures' to be quite well done, and the 'blood-n-guts'elements were very believable and achieved what they were there for (the gross out the audience). Some of the set construction was great, but there were points where it looked so much like a set that the suspension of disbelief was suspended no more. The story structure was nothing special - again, it relied on a very familiar formula that you can predict if you have seen a 30 second teaser for the film - a group of women go for a fun time in a cave, they get trapped and have to find a way out, as they do so they encounter creatures who dwell within the cave and they will all likely die as they try to escape... The acting...well, it wasn't great. The lead gave a fairly plausible performance. I believed her in all her scenes, though I did question the likelihood of some of the choices her character made during the film but that is more of a scrip failing than the actresses! But the rest of the cast were not quite as good. You can tell with most of them that they are quite new to the 'acting' thing. But none of them were terrible - lets just say that they were the next level above 'spanish language Soap actors'. Music was okay...perhaps at time it was a little too over-scored for what was needed. If I had been scoring it I would have done something a lot less orchestral. I would have stripped it right back which would, i think, have achieved a far creepier atmosphere for the film. I would definitely say that I don't feel I wasted my time watching this movie...and I would guess that (come a rainy day) I would probably watch it again if I had absolutely nothing else to do. But it wasn't exactly the genius I was expecting."

In fact the only other British horror film I had watched before this was The Creep and that was an unpleasant experience best not discussed!<br/><br/>However I picked this up on Friday night at Morrisons and after reading the plot outline decided it was worth the £5.99 price tag. 40 minutes after pressing play I was thinking I had made a huge mistake, with the exception of a sudden impalement of a child passenger there had been virtually no horror content whatsoever!<br/><br/>The movie does improve however, the tension it creates is very effective and the eerie setting of the caves is an instant horror success! The enemies are stunningly vicious and imaginative although after their introduction there is little in the way of terror from these mutilated monsters just bloody violence.<br/><br/>This movie has two major flaws in my opinion.<br/><br/>Firstly the characters are given little in the way of character development. Although certainly likable, with the exception of Sarah, the main character and Juno we are never given any real insight into their personality and they become little more than a mass of people to be killed throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly I found it rather shocking and disappointing that Sarah injured and then left Juno to die at the hands of the monsters. It is true that she accidentally killed and then left Beth to die but the cold murder after the two had fought together was a major let down at the end. This is explained however by the ending.<br/><br/>The ending is a little confusing to be honest it was only afterwards I realised what it meant. Basically the birthday scenes throughout the movie indicate that Sarah is going mad, at the end she has completed her descent into madness. Considering this I guess whether or not she got out is pretty irrelevant but I would assume that she is supposed to have died in there. So not a happy ending but come on this is horror!<br/><br/>Overall this movie is pretty good and well worth a watch, it is certainly not on my list of favourites but a fun horror movie."

Sometimes the camera work got a little crazy in a Oliver Stone kind of way and the creatures, well let's just say that zombies and bat people don't really do it for me. But it will work for October and getting in the mood for a creepy movie."

","One of the better, more realistic horror offerings this summer. A screening of it was held at the San Diego Comic Con this summer (2006). This was a clever play on the title as it covered both spelunking and cave exploration - with much more detail than most films involving the same subject - as well as the human psyche, as in descent into madness. The title and story work - for the most part - although the film does have some shortcomings that caused some audience groans.<br/><br/>A quick synopsis of this film (hint - there isn't a quick synopsis): Happy family and friends rock climbing expedition followed by emotionally charged accident, then a ""Sex In The City"" gathering and a possible lesbian liaison continuance, melding into an fame-charged cave exploration, followed by a stalking by beasties in the dark, to be continued by onset of madness, and an eventual end that may or may not lead to a sequel. Now, I should mention - as I just found out - that the film we got to see was the Americanized version. There is apparently a British version ending which is different. From what I know of both, I'm not thrilled with either one.<br/><br/>In some aspects, when viewing the film straight through, the story loses touch in places with what it wants to be about. The film starts off innocently enough about a group of climbers on their exalted rush to cover mountainside ground somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains. There is a definite flavoring of ""Deliverance"" all over this part. On the trip home, an accident takes place which takes the lives of the main character's husband and child. Actually, it never makes their connection clear in the film, but we are to assume that that was the family connection. A year following the hospital stay and wake, the group reconvenes in what is supposed to be a memorial to the victims. Instead, it becomes apparent that this is an ego- fueled rush to test virgin ground in an uncharted underground cave. The group of women are off on a new adventure, but foolishly so as guided by a seasoned professional who cares more about fame than safety. At some points, there are hints - though not concrete - about dalliances of infidelity along with esteem issues between the girls. There is also an unusual lack of any men in the film after the beginning. But no, for you hopeful guys, there are no ""side action"" scenes to be had.<br/><br/>I will give this film kudos for giving a rather extended view into the sport of spelunking (cave climbing), and although necessary for effect, I felt that the spelunking scenes tended to get endless and redundant. As the women descend further, there are some moments of shock and claustrophobia which seem real enough. Finally the clincher to the movie happens as we see that the women are not alone. Although there were hints earlier to other people having been in the cave, the proof shows itself in the form of frightening creatures who hunt and kill anything that lives - human included (apparently a special favorite of theirs). But, living underground takes away some of the creature's senses, giving our women the advantage - if only for a while, and only after a few losses.<br/><br/>The film rather louses up after the encounter with the albino creatures as it becomes increasingly difficult to tell one female character apart from the other. With enough blood and low lighting, every woman becomes a featureless mess with dark hair. It becomes a fear- factor hodgepodge where mayhem and screaming and death abound. It finally comes down to the end which is where the difference in the U.S. and U.K. versions differ. It is a ""did she or didn't she,"" almost typical ending either way, opening doors for a sequel, or a heated discussion at the least. What ruined it for me was the final few seconds in the U.S. ending that we saw. Quite disappointing I would say as without it, the story would have at least made some more sense. And as it was, what is going on in the main character's (Sara) mind can only work if it is tied in with the beginning of the film. As it is, when chatting briefly with director Neil Marshall, he didn't seem to remember the bothersome detail from the beginning of the film either. ""The Descent"" could be a fantastic film, if a few other editing details were to be fixed. As it sits now, it becomes typical. The rather underrated ""The Cave,"" was a stronger film that made much more sense. Although one might expect ""The Descent"" to be a potential rip-off, production was supposedly begun before ""The Cave."" My opinion would be to see both and make the decision yourself. ""The Descent"" works, and is a good horror film, but definitely has its flaws."

","This movie was pretty enjoyable. Took a while to get going but with good reason , builds up nicely with a bit of back story , before the bloodbath unfolds. It was pretty predictable stuff , we all knew that Gerry Halliwell (Sarah?) was going to be the hero , and we all knew that sporty spice (the one that looked like a man) was gonna die first , cos she is unlikeable and was a one dimensional character. So , yeah this movie was pretty good , blood, scares , and some stupid moments. This best bit for me was when the posh spice character gets an icepick in the leg from Gerri and left for dead near the end of the movie. Overall its a daft enjoyable romp in caves.

","This movie... I thought was just OK, it made me laugh. GRANTED I am a very morbid person to begin with, but I just did not find this movie frightening. Although it was well acted, it had depth to the plot, and the characters weren't just silly girls running around and freaking out like in other movies I've seen. When they've got the camera on night vision and look around and see that thing standing right there, my first thought was to ask my friend if he thought it looked stoned too. Just the way it was standing and the expression of the actor, it looked funny. I found the plot entertaining, you know the tragic event early in the movie with Sarah's family, but after finding out about Juno's affair with the husband I couldn't help but wonder if that was why Juno changed the subject when relationships came up. This movie was almost reminiscent of The Cave of last summer to me, except there were no men and the victims couldn't be turned INTO crawlers. And of course the final ending shock in THIS movie involved something sneaking up on Sarah in the car, I thought it was going to be one of the crawlers. At times the movie to both myself and my friend was all too predictable, though. Whenever something jumped down from above them I always though that the ceiling would've been the first place I'd check. I personally would've packed a shot gun because you never really know what kinds of rabid animals have found their way into a cave. But all in all, OK movie."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Neil Marshall has had some success in Great Britain, but he doesn't seem to have a feel yet for a mass audience. The set-up of the film is actually very good with a violent life-altering event and some subtle insight into our characters' personalities. Even the initial descent into the cavern is tense and kinda fun.<br/><br/>The film really falls apart once the cave dwelling blind albino cannibals leap fast motion into the story. The critters dominate the second half of the film and really leave us feeling cheated out of a nice female update of ""Deliverance"". You will even see a touch of ""Carrie"" in a couple of scenes, but I should be flogged for even mentioning those far superior films in this comment. The script, acting and direction here are not even close to that level.<br/><br/>The best performances come from Shauna Macdonald, Natalie-Jane No one as Holly (she was great in ""The Magdalene Sisters"") and Natalie Jackson Mendoza as Juno (a direct rip off of Lucy Liu).<br/><br/>On top of all these negatives comes an ending that is just plain horrible. It leaves us feeling empty and cheated. Thrillers just can't let the audience down at the end ... especially after ruining a nice first 30 minutes."

","I originally thought this would be better than ""Saw"", and other gory flicks. I also thought this was similar to ""Aliens"" since that's what I read on many review sites. In reality, the movie was interesting, because the cast was largely unknown to me, and was creepy, because the script kept me wondering: what's going to happen next? Yet, once you saw the ""monsters"" (which I affectionately refer to as: Cannabalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers (C.H.U.D)....Hello! Already been done!!) the appeal and ""reality"" of the movie became far-fetched. After the movie, my movie companion and I had many questions about the plot, etc. Usually it is easy for me to suspend belief, if the acting etc. is in place. In this movie, I became disillusioned and disappointed. Still, if you like movies like ""Blair Witch"" and Sci-Fi thrillers, than this movie is right up your alley."

","I will say this about the movie ... the makeup effects for the 'creatures' was really pretty good. other than that though ... I have to say 'bleh'. I was not convinced about the extreme sport girls, their half assed attitude and the fact that NO ONE seemed to notice that they husband had something going on seemed even more far fetched than the creatures. The fact that they never explained where the creatures came from, and what the deal was with them, was just poor writing. The movie had a few moments of good acting, jump out of your seat scares, and lots of blood. yes there is blood, but calling it a ""gore fest"" is kind of over stating it a little ... gore is one thing ... blood is another ... and just pouring buckets of both over this movie ... would not make it any better."
"gus120970","7","0","1","18 August 2006"," Has its ups and downs
","Down is the appropriate direction with respect to the ambitions of British cinema since the heady days of 4 weddings and a funeral, when it seemed that combined commercial and critical success was within the grasp of UK film production. The followed the days of lottery funding and a slough of boring dramas and horror movies with poor production standards and less imagination. The Descent represents the recovery position for any non-Potter/Grant/Dench film - a tight original concept on a low budget. The originality is represented in the setup of an all-female potholing movie, where the characters use the physical risks and challenges to offset the barely disguised emotional tensions between them. The makes for a tense and delicious first hour as the girls struggle into the depths of an undiscovered cave space. The cinematography explores a range of phobic territory - from the claustrophobia of a crawlspace to the dark unknown of a cavern entrance, and succeeds in generating a great empathy with the immediate predicament of the characters. Developing any kind of emotional attachment is not so easy, as most of the women are outwardly brittle, stoic and engimatic - a bit like men really. half way in it seems The Descent is going to be a rather special thriller, with the natural environment providing the menace. Then, rather abruptly, the film introduces a horde of cannibalistic troglodytes, who set out to devour each of the party in turn a la Jason/Freddy - fill in your favourite monster movie. It's not that the grand guignol is that bad - and there is the ultimate gore moment in terms of a bath of blood - and there is some message about primality being made. It just seems a prosaic way of releasing the tension built up exquisitely in the first half by turning it into a haunted house movie. As you would expect there is an unexpected ending, but the film had gone off the boil for me about 20 minutes before its inevitable shock."

","I think this movie overall was entertaining for those out there that enjoy the gore. Although I think it was a bit much when they included the part where Sarah was in the ""blood chamber"" and she had to stay still while one of the crawlers was right above her puking or salivating over her. I say puke because that's what it looked like. I think the next step for grossness is to have had the crawler defecate on her face but we probably won't be seeing anything like that in mainstream films anytime soon.<br/><br/>My best friend and I were laughing about this and probably would've laughed harder than we did when we saw this scene if defecation was involved."

The movie was really quite awful. The acting was pretty good, but the plot and the way things were explained just did not work for me. I mean the birthday cake scenes were kind of random, I myself did not understand why they were in the movie until I had asked my friend next to me. But that might just be me. I expected really everything that happened and did not jump even once through the film. I myself like blood, gore, guts and all that good stuff, but putting those into a bad movie just doesn't cut it. Having those does not make a movie any better, because there really is more to a movie then that. And the ending was awful, really the worst ending I've seen since The Village, which was the worse movie I've seen, but now I can say this is close to it.

","I had some positive expectations for 'The Descent' but few were fulfilled.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the movie was hard to get through. The characters were not very interesting and I never found myself favoring any of them. The 'enemy element', lets call it, was pretty mediocre. However, I do realize that it's hard to be highly original in this area and that this is not a high-budget film - so it's not bad.<br/><br/>The quality of the picture during daylight was a bit bad and gave me the feel of poor film resolution rather than a dark tone or ambiance.<br/><br/>Another problem I had was plausibility. I had problems with the plausibility aspect of the 'enemy element'. Usually I tend to overlook these things, but there were some strong feasibility issues here (I won't list them so as to spoil anything). Even 'The Cave' did much better job in this area.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was simply a collection of surprise camera shots rather than mounting tension with the characters (like 'Alien'). Because I didn't really care for the characters, it was hard for me to feel any fear.<br/><br/>As for what I did like - well, those surprise shots I refer to above are pretty good and unexpected (even for those who've seen a lot of these kinds of movies), so they work well. In fact, I could hear some audience members gasping / reacting to many of these moments. Also, some of the underground scenes were pretty good at setting up a claustrophobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>Overall, there are definitely a few scares/surprises in this movie, but more was needed for me to consider it 'good'."
"mhswresler","6","0","2","13 August 2006"," Mediocre at best.
","This movie was hyped up to be one of the best horror films of this decade. I'm sorry but I have to disagree with this thought. The suspense was there, I will say that. This movie made me jump on a few occasions. But the plot was, to say the least, very typical. First off, I don't know about you, but it seemed as if the group of girls were being hunted by a pack of Golems. While it seemed intense at times, it became very predictable later in the movie. Move close to the camera...show an open space behind you...and BAM there is another Golem ready to pounce on the unexpectant victim. It became very reduntant. Cookie cutter if you will. Another bad point about the movie, well, I had no remorse for those who were killed. I mean, there was no character development whatsoever, other than the woman losing her daughter. I had little remorse for those that died. And lastly, was the typical ""I don't need this item so I'll leave it behind"" line. Cmon, I don't care how egotistic you are, you don't leave behind a cave map. That is just sheer stupidity. Now, for the positives, I would say the cinematography was pretty good, and the sound was excellent. But these elements could not make up for a movie, what I thought, was a typical ""run from the stalker"" type film. The plot was average at best. It could have included more depth, other than a few girls who go out spelunking because they wanna have some fun and end up getting chased by underground Golem's. Sorry about my reference to LOTR but they seemed so similar to Golem. 6/10."

","Let me start out by saying that hardcore horror fans who are looking for a somewhat scary movie will love this film. But I, personally, did not like it, but I'll try to explain the film enough so you will know whether it's for you or not.<br/><br/>I am a fan of most horror movies, whether they scare me or not. Even when I enjoy most recent horror movies, I'm disappointed that I was not truly scared by it, yet I enjoyed the story enough to watch it again. To me, the story, acting, directing, and effects are more important than actual scares.<br/><br/>""The Descent"" was getting pretty good reviews and it did look scary, so I decided to go see it. The results were mixed and it took several days of thinking afterwards to come to an opinion.<br/><br/>I thought this movie did have some really scary moments. The movie does a great job of setting up a moody atmosphere and creating a sense of dread, well before the women enter the cave. The acting is pretty decent as well. The creatures, which I think the director named Crawlers in an interview, are scary as hell. In most films, it's scarier when the monsters are not really seen but in this movie they remain scary even when we get a good glimpse of them. In one scene, in which a woman gets stuck in a tunnel, I was truly freaked out just because I know I would be panicking in that situation as well.<br/><br/>However, I did not like the movie as far as the story goes. There's not too much too it at all: a group of women go in a cave, get lost, and are killed off by a meat-hungry species. I thought this was more suited to an episode of ""The X-Files"" rather than a movie that was as long as this, and it took way too long for them to get into the cave. The characters are also all unlikable except for Juno, so I did not feel pity for any of them as they were killed off.<br/><br/>So this is why I rate it five stars. It really was the scariest movie I've seen in years - although it was not terrifying by any means - and it was not scared to show gore. However, I was left feeling unsatisfied and I did not like the characters, and I have no desire to ever see this movie again, but I would recommend it to most hardcore movie fans, like I already stated."

I didn't like what happened to Juno. What she did was an accident and she didn't deserve to be disabled just before the end of the tunnel. I also thought that a lot of the sets were very primitive and looked like cardboard boxes with paper mache. In addition when one of the girls is stuck in a tight place you can see the rock above her head giving with her movements indicating it was made of foam. At one time in the movie one of the girls remarks that they are two miles underground. Completely impossible. If I remember correctly, the Carlbad Caverns elevator at the end is billed at 300 feet underground or possibly the tallest room was , either way two miles would be almost 6000 feet.

It was suggested to me, to re-watch the film and not the scenes in which both crawlers, Sarah, and other group members together.

Maybe it was, in fact, not the crawlers that killed the others, but Sarah, in her mentally unbalanced state, after the death of her husband and child.

They can only hear the people, yet at numerous parts throughout the movie a character will be standing perfectly still and wont make a sound yet the monsters can see them? I thought they were blind? The characters are poorly developed and the actors that play them are even worse. The only decent actor in this movie was the mom, all the others were annoying and some of them just plain stupid. This movie delivers on the scares, but how its at 83% at rotten tomatoes is beyond me seeing as the movie itself was terrible.

"samseescinema","6","0","2","4 August 2006"," when you can anticipate every scare in a scary movie, it stops being scary
","The Descent reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 2 out of 4<br/><br/>The Descent is a film about the things that go bump in the night. Only, in a cave it's always night and the things that go bump also slither, crawl, leap, tear, and munch on your very intestines. It's a well-trodden formula and one with great potential. But in my history with the oft-attempted premise there hasn't yet been a film that does it justice. The Descent looked promising though, coming straight out of the U.K. after having garnered $5 million and a strong following on DVD release. The preview had grit under its fingernails and blood in its mouth, not to mention that the trailer was scarier than hell. But that's just it: the scene that scared us in the preview is the scariest stunt The Descent manages to pull. Too bad. But don't blame the marketing guys for the film's failure. Writer/Director Neil Marshall opens up the throttle much too wide much too early and leaves little to scare us with after his initial big reveal. The monsters are unveiled without tact and wasted on the paces of a by-the-books creature feature that fails to find its way beneath our skin.<br/><br/>The story's no surprise, following a group of spelunkers who are struck by coincidental disaster and forced to find an alternate route out of the cave they've burrowed into. Our spelunkers (heh, I've always loved that word) are a flock of English women venturing into the Appalachian Mountains. The opening sequence tells of a brutal tragedy that befell our main spelunker, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald,) setting up a theme that is continually haunting throughout the film. Juno (Natalie Mendoza), the group's leader, wants the girls' trip to the Appalachians to be her gift to Sarah, attempting to bring her back to their old days of adventuring, before Sarah lost her family. But the gift turns to a curse when Sarah starts hearing the mellifluous giggles of her dead daughter's laugh behind the dark corners of the cave. She thinks she sees something out there in the darkness, something moving. But, of course, no one believes her, and it's only when she captures footage of the thing on camera (the scene revealed in the trailer) that Sarah's fellow spelunkers start taking her seriously. There is something down in the deep, and it wants to eat them.<br/><br/>Too bad the creatures, the deadly flesh-eating monsters, look like the lovechild of Gollum and the Orcs from Lord of the Rings. The likeness is simply uncanny. And similarities like these are too distracting to miss and when caught, too difficult to shake. But in truth, the creatures are supposed to be an evolved form of regular old human, created from generations of life in the deep dark. The story tells of a group of spelunkers from hundreds of years ago trapped in the same cave as our ladies. They apparently managed to survive and reproduce, growing traits fit for cave life and avoiding discovery until Juno and her group of spelunkers tumbled in. For me, this tale of the original spelunkers from hundreds of years back, their rapid evolution and inhuman adaptation would be a more interesting story weave than the tired junk Neil Marshall throws at us. <br/><br/>His film plays its cards too early. Instead of pulling us along on whispers from the shadows and footsteps in the deep, he throws the lights on first chance he gets and takes the next exit to Slasher-ville. The cave setting all but begs for psychological head games where unseen creatures are more terrifying than those that look like the bastard child of Gollum. But Marshall quickly resorts to a big reveal and falls back into the ruts grinded already by a dozen creature features and slasher films before it. The scares were already written for him. You know, when the character checks the dark corner and finds its safe, only to turn back and face the ugly mug and fangs of the monster. Or when the heroes sneak down the hallway as quietly as their booted feet can muster and as they pass by camera it's revealed that the creature's hanging above them on the ceiling. Or how about this: the nice, innocent character finds the primal instinct within her and turns into Ms. Rambo-ette, killing machine. These would all be spoilers if dozens of other horror films hadn't already given them away for you. And when you can anticipate every scare in a scary movie, it stops being scary."
"Soujiro","7","0","1","6 August 2006"," Two big flaws, otherwise a nice little feminist horror movie that makes you think
","I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The movie is gory, but the gore never seems gratuitous. Most importantly, it's a lot of fun to debate to what extent this can be considered a feminist allegory. There are the tried and true baptism and rebirth scenes, and lots and lots of penetrations and narrow tunnels, but besides all the cheesy overdone stuff, there is an underlying message about violence against females and the difficulty women have surviving in a male dominated world that tries its best to consume them or pit them against each other.<br/><br/>The two huge flaws in the movie come pretty early on. In the first, two of the women accomplish a physical feat that requires superhuman strength. I won't spoil it, but it involves hanging by one arm from a rock (try doing it from a plastic ring for a while if you doubt this is difficult) while simultaneously setting climbing gear into the ceiling. It is not utterly impossible (almost, but not quite), but the nonchalant way in which it is accomplished by such obviously weak women destroys the credibility of the movie early on. I just assumed it was a dark fairy tale, and enjoyed the rest of the movie as an allegory.<br/><br/>The second flaw is the reliance on the old cheap scare tactics of lesser horror films (the CG bats are laughable). The first four or five jump-in-your-seat scares are so by-the-books that everyone in the audience knows: A - exactly when they will happen, and B - that they will turn out not to be the creatures. Once the creatures show up, these silly telegraphed moments go away for the most part.<br/><br/>Besides these two flaws, the film is entertaining, well-directed, and genuinely scary. Many viewers will comment on the lack of character development. It's not really an issue. You know all you need to know about the two main characters in the movie. There are two major plot twists which are very violent, the second hurts the feminist vibe of the movie a bit, but it also gives the film a little bit of a moral center to discuss in addition to the feminist angle.<br/><br/>There are many ignorant male theater patrons (female as well I suppose) who complain that the stars are not ""hot"" and that there are no breast flaunting, hip-waggling, pelvis grinding moments. This is actually a good thing, but if you're going in hopes of some brainless T and A action, stay at home los lonely boys. Thankfully, the movie never stoops to flashing skin, at least not nubile female skin... there's plenty of pale cave-dweller skin.<br/><br/>There are a slew of negative reviews lately that seem to be some kind of backlash against the critical praise that this movie has received. Make no mistake, this movie is not ""the next Alien"" or the greatest horror film of the decade, but it is worth watching on the big screen. The ending was altered significantly from the European version which is disappointing, but the movie retains most of its value even with its slight Hollywoodish sugar-coating. If you want some thrills in a dark fairy tale, if you like watching women kick ass instead of screaming and tripping over their miniskirts, and if you don't mind thinking a little after a movie (to what extent is it a feminist film?), Descent is well worth the price of a ticket."

Winner of The British Independent Film Award for Best Director (Neil Marshall) and Best Technical Achievement for the film's editing at The British Independent Film Awards and The Empire Award for Best Horror Film at The Empire Awards. The Descent has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good makeup. The Descent is a film from the United Kingdom and thankfully it was bought by a North American distributor and released here. The film is very tense and has lots of grimy, claustrophobic and scenes that will make anyone a little tense who is scared of heights or tight places. The film is very atmospheric with dripping walls and good cinematography and a good music score to go along with the film's mood and further enhance the tenseness of the film. I liked how these women were well written and they were smart and believable characters unlike most of the dumb and cliché characters we find in most horror movies. And these characters do their best to survive and they don't do the typical horror movie thing by making stupid moves and regret them later by losing their life. These characters you actually feel for and you can feel and relate to their fear and quest for survival. The film is set in a cave for the entire movie, but not once does it get boring or tedious. Once this film grabs you it takes you on a ride and won't let go easily. The writing here is very sharp with well written characters and an unpredictable and suspenseful film that really does keep you thrilled the entire length of the movie. The film also looks great and because of it's atmosphere and look it makes the settings all the more real and because a lot of the film is in the dark it adds to the mystery and suspense of the film. I was very entertained by this movie and it also did it's job of keeping me on the edge of my seat and pretty tense throughout the whole 99 minute running time. This film is vastly superior to almost all of the recent horror movies (with a few exceptions such as The Devil's Rejects), but this film is very special because it doesn't rely on a big budget to scare you and it doesn't go overboard with it's music or gore. These are real people in terrifying situations and because of how real and claustrophobic director/writer Neil Marshall makes the scenes we feel pretty much what the characters feel which is a feeling of dread. This film was very powerful and one of the best horror films in a long time. This film will be looked back upon in years to come as a great addition to the horror genre and in several years it will become a classic that will be rented numerous times for Halloween get parties and just times when you and your friends want to watch a scary movie that delivers the goods. The Descent works on all levels that a great horror film should work on and I'm glad to say that I really liked this film and it is one of the best films of the year and one of the best horror films in a long time. Also, I would like to thank the distributor for picking up this film and releasing it in North America and the marketing for this movie was great and thankfully gives away virtually nothing from this movie, so all the suspense is for you to experience when you see this for the first time which I hope you the reader will do."

","After seeing the reviews on Rotton Tomatoes for The Descent, I was pretty excited to check it out. After all, any movie touted as the best horror/suspense movie since Alien will definitely get my attention. I can't remember the last time I was so excited for a horror movie.<br/><br/>So was it that good? Well it wasn't bad, but I was a little disappointed. The first hour relies on typical, cookie-cutter formulas to extract jumps out of the audience. The character development, however, was pretty good. Once in the cave, things got better, but still, what was all the hype about? The action sequences were edited too quickly, but the feeling of claustrophobia was superb. It was hard to tell who was attacking who at times. That alone was the biggest disappointment on The Descent. If the camera kept a little more still on the sequence at hand, it may have faired better in my eyes. The actresses were pretty good, especially for unknowns, but was I scared? No, not really. And the ending left a lot to be desired. I hear the original British ending was better. I guess I need to wait until the DVD to see that. Not a bad movie by any sense of the word, but an excellent horror/suspense movie? Well....."

","I went to go watch this movie on a night that it was dark and rainy (which is really odd, for I live in a desert).<br/><br/>The movie started off a little slow, but it did an excellent job at introducing us to the characters and the bonds between them. I'm sure if they didn't do this, I wouldn't have cared what happened to them.<br/><br/>Being claustrophobic and acrophobic (fear of tight spaces and heights) everything in the cave had me pulling at the neck of my shirt trying to breath. <br/><br/>Then the horror started. It was bloody, but unlike some movies, it didn't seem to be overly gratuitous. No one got naked (which is too common in Americacn films)<br/><br/>The only two things I would say would've made it better are : If I didn't go with a friend who grabbed me so tight in the movie that I lost Circulation in my arms ( I may re-rate it after I see it again without the grabber) If it had the original UK ending.

","I saw this movie last night at the last minute and I couldn't be happier. Sure hearing a couple of my girl friends scream and jump from their seats was worth the price of admission alone but the movie was surprisingly good. The movie looked mediocre when I saw the trailer and I didn't think much of it even as a huge horror fan. Honestly I didn't know what to expect when I went but as the movie progressed I became more interested. The cave really became an additional character, the element of fear instilled by being trapped somewhere underground and finding out there are creatures down there with you and needing to find a way out before they find you added a strong amount of suspense.The fact that it is an all female cast is interesting and does not take away from the film at all, so don't let that stop you. Sure I could tell when something was going to pop up ""out of no where"" but regardless the movie had its fair share of surprises. An eerie feeling was present throughout the entire film, which kept you on the edge of your seat. The ending as well as the entire film is open for interpretation and as someone who has seen both endings I can say that both are satisfying in their own way. All in all The Descent is worth seeing in the theatre for an awesome atmosphere (if you can't I would advise seeing it late at night in total darkness by yourself). Go with some girl friends who scare easily and watch them jump. The Descent contains action, suspense, jumps, and even some laughs but once it gets going it doesn't stop."
"jan-nebendahl","6","0","1","5 August 2006"," Once again - see less, fear more
","I saw this movie a few weeks ago on DVD. In the beginning it is a rather unusual horror movie. The atmosphere, when all is dark and the women crawl through the cave, is excellent and you get a very very claustrophobic feeling, created by the darkness and the excellent sound that is muffled and very tight. It is something different, it is new and exciting and fun.<br/><br/>But then, there come the Gollums. It's not one horrible monster it's hundreds, and they are shown in plain detail only 5 minutes after their first appearance making them so much less frightening. The cuts are way to fast, in the fights sometimes you just don't see anything except some blurry, gory moves. Then you see the Gollums in plain detail, and you see them a lot. You just start to think: Oh, another Gollum. And they don't stop their noises by which they find their way through darkness, which is realistic but doesn't help much with excitement and fear.<br/><br/>Maybe I just don't get the point of the movie, but it had been so much better, if there weren't these creatures around all the time. Why not hear them first, see them briefly. Then pick the girls away one by one, or sudden attacks without seeing the monsters ? So that you are afraid of the next time when they strike, seeing them only briefly in their distorted form, making you think ""What the hell is that"" ? No, they constantly make noise, they just don't go away. Take that and the rather confusing end, and what starts of as a brilliant horror movie becomes average at best.<br/><br/>Horror fans will enjoy it, and I have to admit, I was frightened a lot in the movie.<br/><br/>But not sticking to the ""What you can't see, you fear""-rule makes this movie so much worse than it could have been. Similar to ""Wrong Turn"".<br/><br/>So first act is a 9, the rest is a 4 to 5, that makes a 6 overall."
"jdesando","Null","0","1","4 August 2006"," No equal
","''Hey, there's something down here.'' <br/><br/>There is no equal is to this horror film within the last few years. It's better than the terror of 2005's WolfCreek, and while not having the epic quality of 2003's 28 Days Later,it scares you with class and restraint a bit like Open Water but inside the earth. It is a distaff Deliverance (1972), every bit as macho, every bit as scary in its suggestion of human and inhuman depravity.<br/><br/>Six British ladies go spelunking in our Appalachians. Besides the discovery that these caves have never been charted is the terrible recognition that they are not alone two miles into the adventure. As if getting lost and stuck were not horrible, the girls face a humanoid clan that finds flesh a happy meal for what must be limited cuisine at the center of the earth.<br/><br/>Although the crew faces some pretty disastrous events before seeing the light, director Neil Marshall never allows them to degenerate into the usually ranting females of other slasher films. These are competent women (one is a med student) whom we saw in the title sequence negotiating at least a class 6 rafting river. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) lost a daughter and husband in an auto accident after that rafting trip and faces her late husband's affair with Juno (Natalie Mendoza), so writer Marshall has built in emotional tension to complement the physical horror.<br/><br/>The camera work is agile and the lighting realistic enough to allow the head lamps and flares to do their job yet not deprive us of creepy monster images and scary false turns. The gore is about as vivid as any I have seen recently in the slasher mode, and the monsters, while not as horrific as Alien's, are memorable for their reasonably thought-out physiognomy with useless eyes and bat-like instincts. Where these monsters came from is perhaps a story for another time, for this cave-in is story enough."

","I had expectations on THE DESCENT being a really scary horror film with lots of gore, and tons of disgusting and super-scary jumps and stuff. But it wasn't.<br/><br/>There are two things that are really bad with this film. First, it doesn't start until one hour into the movie. Somehow, the creators of this movie thought that it was a good thing to do a boring one hour, before the stuff kicks loose. I guess they wanted to present all characters and set everything up - however, that's where error number two is: we don't get to know the characters, and we don't get to understand or know any set ups.<br/><br/>All people, including the leads, are totally nameless and faceless women, and when they're in the cave, it's so difficult to tell them apart that you just simply don't care. And yes, that's even though the director tried to use some clever color-tricks to save that problem. Which it doesn't.<br/><br/>A movie with a bunch of people that you don't care about or care for, or even know who they are, is quite frankly a bit boring.<br/><br/>The last half hour, though, and the ending, is nice. It feels like a totally different movie! It's action, it's suspense, it's a bit scary... and it's gory, violent and have some really nice scenes.<br/><br/>Fast forward one hour into the movie - you won't miss anything important anyway!<br/><br/>Set up as a normal film, and done in a proper manner, this movie could have been really really good.

"Syrchek","7","0","1","21 June 2006"," A definite improvement compared to directors previous work. Could have been even scarier, but I'm glad it wasn't.
","Sounds kind of familiar: a group of cave explorers goes on a cave trip in which they find out that they are the first people to ever walk through it. Then comes the line: 'I think I saw something' and we are off to a suspenseful, chasing blood fest. The directors previous film had a practically exact same plot, where a group of soldiers was hunted by a pack of hungry were-wolfs. The one thing I really 'hate' about horror films is when they're full of sudden scary scenes. This one is full of them.<br/><br/>The film has a really good premise where there's a woman named Sarah that's full of grief for her lost family, especially her daughter. Her tragic loss resonates through her life and pushes her in extremely horrifying resurrections of that fatal event. This is the scariest part of the film. Now the director isn't really good in making the beasts in his films that scary. This time he merely succeeds in making it so, though it doesn't come close to the psy-terror of Sarah's odd syndromes.<br/><br/>This time the boys are girls and they act like super-girls which is kind of a let down and looks like another Alien series recycle. I thought the film's plot would spin around Sarah's fears and make the rest of the team get swallowed in an endless series of devastating hallucinations. That would have been too much for my achy heart that doesn't handle horror all that good. So I'm glad that the creators choose a more empirical enemy. For horror fans: highly recommended.<br/><br/>....... - 4/5 ......."
"chunkyman","9","0","1","14 June 2006"," The Descent - Very Good
","I saw this film on a Friday night after meeting Steven (he played the crawler). A dark snap shot of what can be underneath the crust of the earth. The heart-racing visceral horror comes thick and fast. This time, though, the all-female ensemble cast and complex group dynamics add emotional texture and psychological depth. Plunging the six female friends into claustrophobic darkness. Trapped by a rock fall, they are attacked by slimy humanoid predators. Despite their translucent skin and sightless eyes, these creatures are highly evolved, using their heightened senses of smell and hearing to stalk their prey. Forced to dredge up their primal instinct for survival, the women tool-up with ice-picks or whatever else comes to hand, clambering over carpets of bones, plunging into pools of offal or hiding in crevices as the 'crawlers' try to sniff them out. As the women fight for their lives, the fault lines within the group are exposed: betrayals surface, tensions explode and loyalties disintegrate. They're not just battling the snarling humanoids, but also each another. For Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) in particular  still fragile after the death of her husband and daughter in a road accident  this nightmarish mix of suspicion and fear threatens a slide into madness. Even more might have been made of this fractured group dynamic had the individual characters been better delineated, their relationships more sharply defined, their unspoken antagonisms more effectively explored. That said, one barely has time to register this shortcoming, as the adrenalised action drives relentlessly forward. Thanks to its skillful director, well-cast actors and talented technical team, this fiercely entertaining British horror movie has blood, guts and brains."

","This movie is quite up to the standard of fast moving original horror flicks made after 2000! Also the fans who don't like suspense there is enough gore to keep you entertained. The story (only female leads) is quite gripping. Even for the most experienced horror fan this film contains twists you cannot expect.<br/><br/>The only real problem I have is that the female characters are not very likable. I didn't have much sympathy for them. Some of the actions of these characters are very questionable and seemed to be aimed to shock rather than compel. You just don't care that something will happen to them. I also had trouble relating to their hobby. What possesses people to go adventuring deep into caves they know nothing about. Especially if the rest of the world is unaware of this. Surely you take some precautions in case things go badly. None of that here. How often don't you read about incidents where people get lost or killed because of an adventure go wrong or where others have to risk their lives to save these imbeciles. It is hard to evoke sympathy for people who disregard safety like this but at the same time expect to be rescued when things go wrong.<br/><br/>That being said however there are some very good old school horror elements that make up for most of the flaws. The setting, the darkness and the sound are very effective. You can imagine the terror the characters must be experiencing. How would you carry yourself in a similar situation? Another solid entry coming from Neil Marshall. It's been a while he has made a movie but here is hoping he will come back with a vengeance."

","I'm not the type of person who scares easily. My girlfriend doesn't like horror movies so I don't get to watch them often. However, when she goes out for a night and I'm sitting all alone in the house I like to turn out all the lights, get a big bag of crisps, crack open two or three beers and rent the latest horror movie. I think it's important to maintain a certain level of disbelief when you're watching this type of movie, the first time I saw the Exorcist was at midnight on Halloween when it was re-released and the screening was ruined by Neanderthals who thought they were hard for laughing at the slightly dated special effects. I quickly realised that any need to suspend my disbelief during The Descent evaporated as the claustrophobic setting of this movie was unveiled. As if this wasn't enough, the characters eventually came upon the more supernatural terrors of the caves which were presented in fleeting moments of light, in the depths of the caverns. I don't want to say anything else because I want you to get the full benefit of the emotions for which this movie was created. It absolutely scared the crap out of me! When it was finished I actually felt physically affected as if I was stepping off a roller-coaster. Perhaps it caught me at a vulnerable moment, but I'm feeling fine at the moment and the thought of it still raises my heart beat."

The movie itself is simple, and there are moments where what you would like the most, is to turn your head away. <br/><br/>My suggestion would be to watch this with your girl/boy-friend, if you need someone to hold closely.

","Horror movies are a difficult genre. A brief look at the latest 100 will discover no more than 10 good ones. Even action movies have a higher quality rate. Maybe the reason is that horror movies can be boring very quickly. You may prefer the subtle creepy psycho approach or the bloody slasher style, you may go for some absurd over-the-top excitement or the dead serious close-up mess. Either way, you will agree that a good horror movie must be scary. Anything else is comedy, satire, trash - or a bad horror movie.<br/><br/>In The Descent, six sporty spice girlfriends meet for some exciting caving adventure, only to encounter weired opponents in a bloody fight for survival. The choice of claustrophobic dark grottoes and tunnels may help, but the big screen is merciless when it comes to clumsy lights and plastered rock. Harder screaming or faster editing can't save it. In ""The Descent"", however, production design, sound department and direction succeed in transforming a big bunch of very similar studio takes into a credible outdoor expedition. It looks like the real thing and that's a big achievement. You are also treated to a fair amount of gore, decent acting and there are references to film history classics like Deliverance, Alien, Predator or Apocalypse Now. On top of that, there is an intelligent twist to Sarah's descent into madness.<br/><br/>It's a pity that Neil Marshall was not able to build some more interesting conflict development between the main characters. Some inventive problem solving skills or fighting sequences would have been nice as well but it is all quiet on this front . There is nothing really interesting about the crawlers either and the weak explanation of their existence is quite stupid. But then again  logic sucks, there was just no gear to go MacGyver and who has time for psychological drama when you got some ugly flesh eating demons on your back.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall sticks to pumping the dark and sinister setting iron to the very end and that is an acceptable decision. So you can invite yourself for a well made, good looking horror movie with a scary tone and a good sound. Not easy to find, these days."

The ""horror of the deep"" is not something entirely new, the same things could already be seen in various other movies. The movie is scary though, and probably you'll sit cramped on your seat for some time. The end is created rather for effect than anything else, you won't find very much sense in it. Nevertheless, it'll keep you on edge.<br/><br/>Looking back the movie leaves a quite shallow feeling... The characters just weren't interesting enough, the story is loose-ended without leaving a mystery feeling (the words ""thought provoking"" would be far fetched) and all in all it just does't make any sense.<br/><br/>If you wan't nothing more than quite a few scares, you'll enjoy it.

","This film was just utter rubbish it really was, the creatures looked like Reapers from Blade II, I couldn't quite understand the bit of exposition at the beginning between her soon to die husband and the Chinese/American girl either. The actual concept for the film is really cool with an all girl ensemble and pot holing subject but I thought when it came to the creatures it was just silly andpoorly executed. The claustrophobia was scary enough to carry the film alone and if they had to throw monsters in then I think they could've designed something better. And what was all that rubbish about one of the girls being able to explain what the creatures were?. She went from being scared to a flippin scientist. I suppose that was just for our benefit? Well I ain't buying it. Dog Soldiers was a far better executed film even though the idea was derivative of Night of the Living Dead being trapped in a farmhouse an all but if this pile of rubbish is all Neil Marshall has to offer then god help us when he makes Outpost, his supposed return to horror form by tackling the zombie genre!

Basically Descent is just a by-the-numbers horror movie: starts off with a tragedy, then introduces us the 6 key characters who all have different personalities so that it's more like a small society (a la Alien). They try to get their minds off past things but become prey for something evil... and as thing move on we learn that their unprocessed history, the evil WITHIN, might pose an even worse threat... etc. etc. The structure is an umpteenth variation of that used in the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", ""Hills have eyes"", ""I know what you did last summer"" and so on, but whereas the usual clones and remakes usually fail to get anything new out of this old mold, ""Descent"" succeeds. Most importantly: the scares work. Oh yeah :) The scariest movie of the year, no competition. (Can't compare to ""Saw 2"" since it's a thriller). Second: I don't know how this one guy wrote that dialog for all six WOMEN, but it's just perfect. Also the actresses do a fine job- but only because they were directed well! Score, photography, editing... two thumbs up. I also liked the pale, ""autumnly"" look of the film. Great choice, adds a helluva lot to the mood! This may come as a surprise, but yea, there was also a lot, and I mean A LOT, of blood. Violence factor is right up there with ""From dusk till dawn"": we got heads smashed until they literally crack open, we got the good ol' ""thumbs through the eyes"", slit throats, you name it. But this surplus of gore doesn't add to the film. Either the makers sort of ""got cold feet"" :( or then they just didn't want to sacrifice any of their sick ideas :) Usually it's the lack of gore I complain about but this time... a minor complain. Slap on the wrist. Still to sum things up a small winner all around! DEFINITELY going to buy the DVD. Definitely."

","Many scenes are simply too dark to see what's happening. Sometimes that's obviously done for the storyline, but with a lot of females that look a lot the same in the dark, it's not viewer friendly! ;)<br/><br/>The characters are again not too original. One hurt, one rebellious, not a surprise on that part. The storyline contains a few surprises, but not that big that anyone would remember them years later... <br/><br/>But if you're afraid of heights and depths, dark and claustrophobic, this one gives you wet hands at some moments. It's clearly not a base jumping promotion or cave exploration promo video, on the contrary. Just give it a try if the top movies are rented out."

I was actually really disappointed as everyone I know who'd seen it said it was FANTASTIC...what did I miss?

","I really want to like this movie, a movie about a bunch of women go caving in the Appalachian mountain. What I don't understand is why would the director use an all girls cast instead of a co-ed cast. After watching this movie I feel as if there is no purpose for casting all women in this film, a cast of male and female actors will work just fine if not better in the movie. I don't know why the director would select an all women actors for the film as the novelty of it really didn't last long when the body count starts mounting not long after they entered the cave.<br/><br/>For the most part, once they entered the cave, the film becomes too dark in lighting for me to able to recognize which actor is doing the talking. At time I can't hardly tell what is going on while they are in the cave, but there is couple of good scenes where the girls get to kick some big time butts on the monsters, so much so that I wonder why isn't the monsters afraid of the girls rather than the other way around. There is another similar movie called The Cave released before this film and I find this movie to be more in substances as in the former movie."

","I really like the element of surprise in this film. To begin with - that you get to follow a gang of ordinary, tough, women, and then of course what these women encounter in the dark, dank, cave. But that's about it I'm afraid (pun intended). Sure, I was scared at times but then it all felt so...silly...and a bit disappointing. I can sort of see where I think writer/director Marshall is going with this film but the trouble is that he doesn't get there. He gives us a hint about conflicts among the women but doesn't tell us just what these conflicts are about. It's only hinted at and that makes it harder to believe these women would turn on each other. And, come to think of it, why have so many characters? Just so more of them could die? That's just the thing. Seeing as how this movie ends it all feels so pointless. In my opinion a good horror-flick should have a point, a reason to why you should watch it, if so only to see how the bad guy is finally defeated. But this movie has absolutely no point and that's a shame. Don't get me wrong - it's not a waste of time and at times it's nice and gory, just don't expect anything more from it."

","The Descent has to be the scariest film i have watched this year. In fact i could go as far as to say its the scariest film i have seen since The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is its setting (a cave system), as in all truth most people will have a fear of being lost, being confined to extremely small spaces or being surrounded by nothing but darkness, and in this movie, all of these things are in play.<br/><br/>The use of an all female expedition party, is also a master stroke, as it adds to the feeling that everyone is truly coming to an end down there.<br/><br/>The one thing that has stopped me giving this film a 10 is because it is quite slow moving at the start, but in fairness this adds to the appeal as it builds up the tension, thats if you have the patience and attention span. But it also had a very good twist at the end, which i wont spoil for anyone.<br/><br/>In fairness if you give this movie the chance it deserves you will not be disappointed. Try watching it alone in a dark room with a good surround sound system, IF YOU DARE!!

I got watching it and started to find my concentration slipping away after the first 45 minutes. Most horror films I've seen this year have been action packed basically from the start, but this was different.<br/><br/>I almost thought I was watching an ITV drama. I suppose the story was interesting enough and the acting is OK. But after 45 minutes of no action I was getting pretty bored. Then the first glimpses of the 'Things' appeared on my screen and I became interested again till the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Even with the slow start the action after the 45 minute mark was good and kept me interested till the end, but for my liking the plot didn't advance fast enough and the whole thing felt a bit rushed.

It's one of those movies u are so glad you came by! It has no cheesy special effects, even though it's budget was probably rather limited. And it really is scary, unlike most so called horror movies.

I expect women to like this as a horror offering since all the characters besides the monster aspect are female.<br/><br/>There should have been more development of the monsters- that was a failure of the script, to leave the darkness to fill in the gaps that the writer's imagination couldn't create. <br/><br/>If you are claustrophobic at all, some of the beginning scenes will make your skin crawl and that's even before they find the monsters.

","This movie did have a lot of good points, it used every horror movie tool which made for a very entertaining experience. The atmosphere was definitely set from the beginning, very jumpy and fast paced. Some of the scare tactics were exactly where you didn't expect them and the moments between where tense. Overall I enjoyed watching the movie but a couple of things threw me off. First off the friendships weren't exactly affected which was kind of misleading as this was mentioned in a few reviews I had looked at, even the back of the box said they slowly suspect each other which in my opinion happened once briefly I really expected more conflict in such an enclosed and claustrophobic atmosphere. The ending was such a disappointment, it didn't conclude anything, just left the whole thing open for a possible sequel. It felt like the movie ended with no direction, just giving you the main plot throughout and then stopped, absolutely no questions being really answered. Don't expect any bubbling queries to get closure what you learn in the first 40 minutes is all you'll learn!!!"

","Done read this before watching it!!!<br/><br/>There are pro's and cons to this movie. Watching it once through I thought it fantastic, a definite 8 out of 10, maybe a 9 and although there are negatives my advice is that you will see them, but don't let them put you off. Its a cracking watch and will scare the hell out of you. There's something for everyones heart rate here. Claustrophobia, fear of the dark, fear of getting trapped, getting stuck, not being able to breath, heights, blood, gore, ooh er mum!<br/><br/>And yet there are holes in the plot, not the least being Darwinism totally ignored.<br/><br/>OK, so we accept there are cave dwellers that are cannibalistic, that hunt on the surface at night and return to their caves. With me so far? Beasts that for thousands of years have adapted to live underground, to hunt anything they can to eat and I include in this wolves that are not renown for their weakness and willingness to just sit and be killed. So these natural killers whose bodies would surely be as tough as hell, get their arses kicked by a bunch of lasses! Sorry girls, I know we live in a world of political correctness and yes we are equal but there isn't a committee to use all kinds of laws and the like to make sure cannibalistic cave dwellers are signatories to the political correct lobby. These killers are faced by the 9-5 brigade who sure, might go to the gym regularly and do a few weekend white knuckle sports but developed fighters they ain't. OK, so their lives are at risk but after the first meeting of GI Jane and Alien, Alien gets a smacking and just might start getting a bit nastier. Why were the monsters relegated to the position of 10 year old Gollums?<br/><br/>Now what was that ending all about? Well, was it all in her head? Is she the killer? Has she gone crazy? If so then so did the plot! If madness was in her head, how come its form is transferred into the heads of the others and if she is the monster cave dweller, how can she turn into dozens then fight herself? Or was she kicking seven shades out of all her mates? Well what about when one of the monsters died? Did she get resurrected? The end just is far too ambiguous and looks to me to be rushed or just badly done? <br/><br/>Maybe the plot I describe is not how it is meant to be read. If so then fine, I've misread it. So what does happen in the end? I wanted another minute or two of movie to clear it up for me.<br/><br/>Ah well, still gets an 8, perhaps 9 from me."
"Danny_G13","7","0","1","9 November 2005"," Good film and better than the bog standard Hollywood fare we're used to
","Superior British horror movie sets tense claustrophia with old fashion suspense and comes out on top.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of less than impressive horror movies in recent years, particularly out of Hollywood. Cabin Fever is a prime example of such a sub-standard flick and there are many more. One distinct advantage British horror has is a true grittiness to it, a kind of 'realness' which makes the characters a lot easier to identify with.<br/><br/>In The Descent we follow the fortunes of an all female cave exploration team who are going on an adventure in a mountain range. The purpose of this expedition is to bring them all together after the hideous events of the previous year which are revealed at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not a particularly big name cast with perhaps Saskia Mulder as Rebecca who also appears in the BBC's Book Club the best known actress on display. Certainly the most recognisable. However, the strength of this movie isn't in its star acumen, but rather in its story telling and direction.<br/><br/>The Descent is claustrophia in abundance; tight cave systems barely give room to breath, and the overwhelming darkness compounds it ten fold. In this movie, light is at a premium.<br/><br/>As for the horror side of it, well let's just touch on the fact that there are rather unfriendly cave dwellers (Who it must be admitted look successfully hideous) who intend to make life difficult for our heroines. They also sound vile - a testament to the sound engineers and overall design of these characters.<br/><br/>Gore levels are impressive without being over the top, and what would a horror movie be without its gore? On that note although this could easily be classified as horror, I would also class it under suspense and claustrophobic dark thriller.<br/><br/>The direction is uniformly effective, but the insatiable darkness and occasional fast action do tend to make certain parts a bit confusing. It's a small price to pay for what is overall a very useful technique in terms of film making - although it should be added that it's quite unique as deployed here.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film and worth your attention. It's certainly one of the better horror films I've seen for sure. The ending clinched it for me for sure.<br/><br/>(Private message for IMDb - this review is being re-submitted under my proper id. I used the wrong one previously)"

","****CONTAINS SPOILERS**** What can you say about Mr Marshall second time at the cinema?... <br/><br/>Went to see the descent last night with my long suffering Mrs in tow. I'm not into horror movies as a rule, I'll watch them on DVD but never at the cinema, it's just not my genre. I sat down and snored my way through the bombardment of advertising we get on the big screen these days (which is the biggest gripe i have with the cinema today) raised an eye brow through the trailers (at some for films that look like having promise and others that clearly don't!) then the film began. <br/><br/>Off to a great start, straight into the character work and a brilliantly unexpected car crash (I knew there was a car crash in it and didn't see this one coming the way it did) then came the trauma, the recovery begins and then bang we're into act 2.<br/><br/>The group assembles for the adventure and forms it social dynamic, they head off into the cave and their in, no messing, great! I know on a few minutes I'm gonna see them ripped apart, flesh torn, blood everywhere etc and I CAN'T WAIT.<br/><br/>Then the story seemed to take a slight turn, I found myself in the middle of quite a complicated character piece, which is good, but as this was, at the beginning, a fast paced 'action/slasher' movie the intro/development work on these characters wasn't there to. One girl died and I actually didn't care because i didn't know enough about her to care. Still the film moved forward and then the fun really began!<br/><br/>The monsters appeared and I tell you what an entrance, this is where Marshall does the business, the first one is shown in possibly the most original piece of filming/scripting I've ever seen and the whole audience jumped eight feet in the air. I was sitting in front of 3 girls in their early twenties and one screamed, half stood up and politely kicked me in the back of the head (the seats were tiered), I didn't care though (I was too busy checking I hadn't just touched cloth to care!) <br/><br/>Then I got what i came for, the blood spilled, the flesh tore, the bones broke and everyone loved it. The scares came thick and fast, young 'kicky' behind me screamed several more times and her friends filled in for her when she left for ten minutes. <br/><br/>By the end I was exhausted but then came this whole character thing again, we get drawn in to this journey of emotion from the lead girl...I WANT MORE BLOOD i thought, alas the screams from behind stopped for a bit.<br/><br/>Then came the end and it was so worth it, rather than opting for a traditional horror ending (supposedly dead monster jumps at camera etc) Marshall has wisely chosen a 'think about it people!' ending. It scary as hell but not a cliché, which is too often the case in this genre. <br/><br/>Some on here say the ending was a let down, it wasn't. In fact it was very clever and here's why...<br/><br/>The character had been haunted by the memory of her dead daughter throughout the film, traumatised if you will. Imagining getting out only to see the ghost of her now dead friend was a sign that if she did survive she would be forever haunted by the memories of the friends that died that day, five times the trauma and who wants to live like that. Better to accept your fate, make peace with the daughter trauma (hense her appearance) and die with dignity than live without it.<br/><br/>So there you go all you 'i didn't get it' people. A fine horror movie, not the best but certainly worthy of a DVD purchase and a convo with your film friends. What does Mr Marshall have for us next, I don't know but i'll be going to see it."

","The Director Neil Marshall has done it again, after the excellent Dog Soldiers he has again shown the Americans how to make a great horror film. The Descent is a very clever film, it builds up the tension slowly then unleashes all hell on the viewer. It is a very jumpy film! and has a good storyline that will have you thinking long after you have left the cinema. It is probably the best horror film I have seen since .... well since Dog Soldiers! Marshall seems to have had a bigger budget to work with Descent and he puts it to very good use, the Crawlers are very well done without being too OTT. My one small complaint is although the darkness of the underground caves serves to up the tension in the film it is however hard to follow some of the action. I had a similar complaint about Alien V Predator but this film is far superior to that one. You may think thats not saying much but I think AVP was very harshly treated by the critics, but I do wonder what Marshall could do with an Alien film or a Predator movie. Has Stallone got a director for Rambo IV yet? This man could do the job! Is it better than Dog Soldiers? I'll call it a draw. Roll on the next one, a World War II movie? That would be great."

","I did like the film. I thought it was scary and in-depth and was on the edge of my seat or squeezing my partners hand for a lot of it . I liked it up the the very last 4 or 5 seconds. I liked the fact that we thought she had got out and survived but we find she is still in the cave. Then she starts hallucinating about her daughter again and has a psycho smile on her, like its the end and she knows it but she's with her daughter so its OK. The only thing that struck me as weird was when the camera zoomed out and we saw her in a random alcove in a massive cave face and then there's a random scream. This is all very ambiguous and theatrical. Films are usually finished with a definite question or ending but this felt random and not physically realistic when the rest of the film was. Didn't she fall down a hole to land where she was? How did she get there? It's a small thing to moan about but the ending can make so much difference to a film."

","A beautifully made film is always nice to see in my eyes. This is one of them. You don't get many and after seeing the ""Boogeyman"", this, THE DESCENT is welcomed with open arms.<br/><br/>So, I have just returned home from the cinema after watching this fine film. The storyline, characters, location, camera work, everything perfect up until the very end. It crumbles at the last with a ending that, too me could have three different meanings. It does not wreck the film in anyway but it leaves you thinking, what the hell happened then? Watch it and you will see...<br/><br/>The Movie has a lot of gore which works so well. Its not too much and it ain't over the top. The Cave added a lot of suspense and terror to the whole movie and you really felt like the Ladies were been hunted. Also, the horror and suspense was created by the Characters. Normally its a loud sound effect or strange noise but in this film, the close ups of the struggling women gave it the edge. Something many horror films never do often enough (Boogeyman). This is top notch survival horror.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a must see for Genre lovers. The film is excellent from the start adding little scary moments before the crawlers were even shown. Fantastic movie and Marshall must be praised for it! Well done Marshall - from ME!"

","Even though I was fully prepared for disappointment (I can't really remember the last horror/action film to really deliver on its promises - maybe Aliens?) this film lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Not since the head popped out of the boat in Jaws have I jumped so high. Neil Marshall is a genius - on several occasions, you know 'something' is coming - you know a scare is imminent, but still you jump.<br/><br/>The premise is novel even if the set pieces aren't - but that doesn't matter. The film gets you gripped and there is some (not much but enough) depth to actually care for the characters. Making this an all-woman affair was spot-on, it sooo wouldn't have worked with male leads.<br/><br/>Neil Marshall states that he would love to do Alien 5 - based on this, he was born for the job.<br/><br/>Just goes to show what a Brit can do with a small amount of money, a lust for horror and a feel for what the cinema going, popcorn munching, scare the pants of me public really want to see."

","As a fan of horror films, and one who's prepare to watch some of the lesser films in the genre, I went to see this not expecting an awful lot. As long as it gave me a few jumps and wasn't too clichéd, I'd be reasonably happy. I was pleasantly surprised to find instead a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. Although it couldn't be described as a desperately original script, it did avoid some of the clichés that have plagued recent films such as Wrong Turn. The women in question at least had a purpose to being in such a perilous situation. Also, Instead of being killed off one-by-one by an single, unseen, lurking menace, they were attacked en mass by a group of creatures who stayed mostly in sight afterwards. The characters were given enough of a background to provide some intrigue, but not so much as to slow the early scenes. But best of all, I enjoyed the way that the ending played with your expectations of horror movies. After a very enjoyable 90 minutes or so, the bog-standard 'one-person-escapes-and-someone-you-thought-was-dead-is-still-alive' ending really made my heart sink. So I was relieved when it cut back to the main character still in the caves, suffering a mental breakdown and facing certain death. It was refreshing to see such a downbeat ending in a low-budget horror film and one that made me think about it long after I left the cinema. Probably the most positive comment I can make about this film is that there was nothing really wrong with it. There were no plot twists or characterisations that felt unnecessary or inconsistent. It set out to create suspense, shock the audience and make them squirm. And that is exactly what it did for me and most of the people in the cinema with me. And for doing its job so well, I've given it 9 out of 10. Sure, it's no Citizen Kane, but it does exactly what it sets out to do. I've yet to see 'Dog Soldiers', which is by the same director, but definitely will now. If it's as refreshingly un-clichéd and as well-made as 'The Descent', then it should be a great night's entertainment."
"schtat","6","0","3","13 July 2005"," has reality evaporated into the further recesses of the cave?
","-Don't read this if you're intending to see the film-<br/><br/>Near the beginning of this film, just as the party are about to enter the cave, one of the women loudly declares that caving can result in hallucinations, claustrophobia etc. etc. I couldn't help but think that as they descend further and further into the cave with less and less chance of exiting, the thin air has them seeing things and they eventually wind up murdering each other. There were never any cave-dwelling creatures at all...<br/><br/>Enjoyable romp though - a poor girl in front of me ended up in tears outside the cinema. when's the last time a horror flick had an effect like that?? (ok, daddy daycare aside)"
"JamukLey","7","0","1","11 July 2005"," An effectively bleak horror
","I thoroughly expected this film to give me nightmares. Although not claustrophobic (and still remain blessedly free from such fears), the very nature of this film was enough to prompt me to have second thoughts about seeing it. I have been waiting for a decent subterranean horror story since I was a teenager, having read the thunderously disappointing Midnight's Lair by Richard Laymon. However, I knew nothing of this film until a week before it was released (I hadn't really been following the Marshall Chronicles except that I understood he had trouble getting financing for Outpost). Dog Soldiers was an enjoyable film and fulfilled its goal as a horror-comedy. The Descent however is horror. Nothing else.<br/><br/>While not an outstanding film, it certainly has been the most effective recent horror film of modern times. Marshall's masterstroke in this film is the build-up. Much in the same way as Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, the menace and dread in the air is apparent even in the pleasantly rustic log cabin the women all stay in before setting out. The camera is often detached at this moment, observing the greetings outside in the rapidly encroaching dark, seemingly impatient to get to their destination, as if it were a portent of things to come. One other particular shot stood out to me. It is when the women are hiking along the stream toward their goal and the camera pans and gently zooms away from them and toward the cave. The music rises in an incandescent hum as the camera glides silently forward. I was instantly reminded of the pivotal moment in Jaws where Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) stares out to sea after the attack on his young son, the moment when the familiar is left behind.<br/><br/>Once inside the caverns it becomes a master class in tension. I was surprised at how the pacing was considered and graceful (the pacing was very reminiscent of the leisurely pace of Alien), but obviously things start going wrong. The group get lost thanks to the misguided actions of Juno (Natalie Mendoza). Panic soon sets in and one of the party is injured. I genuinely chewed my fingernails as the medic sought to create a crude splint. Yet when the group stumble upon a grim tableau of bones and assorted skeletons, the creatures that walk shadows down there reveal themselves.<br/><br/>From then on Marshall keeps tightening the screw and I have to say he does gore very well. It may seem like the camera is pummelled in red, but it's the quick edits and masterful lighting (not to mention the sickening sound), that create the greater, implied horror (the sequence in the, literal, bloodbath notwithstanding). The 'crawlers' themselves are hugely effective in my opinion. The less imaginative amongst us may declaim them to be merely actors in body prosthetics, yet for me this is their strength. Of course they are people; they are devolved humans, utterly vicious, dangerously familiar and wholly aberrant. Their attacks are swift, shrieking and devastating. All I can say is the last shot will remain with me for some time.<br/><br/>Whether I will see it again is another matter. The situation is such a haunting one I will certainly be thinking about it for a long time."
"info-4857","6","0","3","8 July 2005"," Better than Dog Soldiers
","Better than Dog soldiers, which I thought was over the top, not scary and the wolves looked like Alsatians which have learned to walk. Descent is more disturbing in its portrayal of caving if you're claustrophobic it will unsettle you more than the monsters, which maybe where shown a little too much. I've always been a fan of less is more. Most of the scares are sudden jumps after an extended silence which kind of works in this film but is still a cheap scare and normally annoys the pants of me in horror films. An unconventional ending and some scary shots of the creatures watching the girls as they go buy makes this worth a look. Not as bad as you think it's going to be but hardly mind blowing either."
