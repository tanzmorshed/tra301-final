","Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first."

","This is a really good sequel. Taking characters from the first one and putting new ones in there as well, it never gets boring or seems to repetitive. And you don't even have to be Dory, I mean forgetful, for this to work for you. Yes it does make sense to watch the first one (Finding Nemo) then, although I reckon you could watch it and enjoy it as a standalone too.<br/><br/>The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Humans are being treated like extras and we wouldn't have the time to deal with them anyway. That is apart from one major voice - but it's being highlighted too as if one of the writers or Ellen herself might have a crush there. But you can't blame them for that. On the contrary you can congratulate everyone involved for a really good movie"
"AlsExGal","8","47","77","21 October 2016"," Another hit from Pixar that uses CGI to assist in telling a story...
","... rather than using a story to demonstrate dazzling CGI. This film was just as good as its predecessor, Finding Nemo. In this film (which takes place one year after 'Nemo'), Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss, makes it a mission to find her parents. She helped Marlon find Nemo in the first film and now she wants help locating her parents. She became separated from them when she was young and until now, has relied on others to help her find her way. She also gets by with her unique brand of impulsiveness and quick action. Throughout the film, Dory uses other ""people's"" (fishes'?) words and objects to trigger memories that assist her in finding her way. It was very clever how Pixar incorporated these triggers to help move the story along and flesh out Dory's background. I also liked how they treated short term memory loss with sensitivity and did not make it a joke. The marine center that Dory & co. end up at is based on the excellent Monterrey Bay Aquarium. The funniest new character added to the Nemo franchise is Hank the octopus (except he only has seven legs as Dory points out and refers to him as a ""septapus.""). Hank is cynical, but you know he's a softy deep inside. He can also camouflage himself into his settings which is quite comical. There are other funny characters like Becky the buzzard and Gerald the seal with a uni-brow.<br/><br/>It seems that Pixar thrives on adding emotional scenes to their films that pull at their audience's heartstrings. Finding Dory is no exception. There is a very dramatic scene near the end of the film where Dory is separated from her party and is lost in an unfamiliar, dark ocean, alone. She has to rely on herself to figure out how to find her way out and find her friends. This was a very heart wrenching scene. I won't lie, it made me tear up and I could hear other people sniffling in the theater. Another emotional scene is the beginning of the film showing a baby Dory with her parents. It's not as sad though as the beginning of Up, though.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this one."
"ApeLieUproar","1","167","312","17 July 2016"," Finding Dory Boring
","What can I say? Maybe I'm just becoming a curmudgeon but I just don't find the fact that Dory lost her parents as a child and has been looking for them ever since very (read: at all) interesting. The movie opens with Dory as a small child, who features in several flashbacks thereafter. The cuteness factor of young Dory has been dialed up to 11 in a rather obvious attempt to invest the audience in Dory's plight that much more. But, to me, it just came off as saccharine.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't very plausible either. Yes, I am fully aware this is a cartoon aimed at kids. But we're expected to believe Dory, having severe (and entirely plot-driven) memory loss somehow found her way as a small child from California all the way to Australia all by herself.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I'd been able to find the basic plot interesting, I might have forgiven the movie's list of other other implausibilities and errors but, as it is, they just come off as irritating, and in service of a dull story. Some example:<br/><br/><ul><li>An octopus (actually, a ""septapus"", as it's missing a tentacle; more on that later) that can not only stay out of water indefinitely and disguise itself as anything, but can also learn to drive a car within seconds and drive it blind with only Dory to guide him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A fish tank in the kiddie section of an aquarium, where the kids are allowed to grab the creatures within the tank. This, incidentally, is where the octopus lost a tentacle because a kid pulled it off. And the aquarium was totally okay with this and let the kids go on grabbing fish. GTFOOH Pixar.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The octopus finds himself back in the tank where kids can freely grab them. Conveniently, he forgets he can essentially become invisible, to force tension into the plot</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The octopus steers a stroller past milling throngs of people, none of whom think it very remarkable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Whale sharks are not whales and do not eat fish. This is the most egregious, or at least most irritating, error committed by this film. Did Pixar not do research or did they just not care? Honestly, I find this error shocking coming from Pixar.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Several fish-eating animals are seen throughout this movie that are only to happy to forget their dietary requirements: sea lions, loons, otters, it doesn't matter. The otters are even willing to risk their lives for this fish they don't know to help her do something about which they have no way of knowing anything. At least in the fIrst movie, there was some explanation given as to why pelicans and sharks would not eat fish. Here, it's just whatever serves the plot. It just feels lazy and cheap.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I have a feeling echolocation doesn't work anything like it's portrayed here, but I won't make too much of it. But, wow, did that ""whale speak"" get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.</li></ul><br/><br/>I have usually considered Pixar to feature strong characters, but after THE GOOD DINOSAUR and this movie, I'm disappointed in how dull and/or annoying the characters are. Dory was fine as a supporting player (and in a better movie) but as the star, she's simply insufferable. <br/><br/>Overall, I have always considered Pixar as synonymous with quality. But no longer. It will no longer be a given that a Pixar movie is going to be a winner."
"chaos-rampant","Null","25","40","10 March 2017"," No walls in the ocean
","I've never been into animation and my comments probably reflect it. Not for any silly quibbles about real cinema versus not, kiddie versus adult; it's simply that the real world that threads itself around us is too marvelous and fantastical, too full of myriad possible worlds to envision, to forego the opportunity. Okay, but this leaves me free to observe these few things here.<br/><br/>It really has taken a quantum leap the last decade in trying to replicate our world after that business with dead eyes was over. Is there anything more extraordinary than texture and light falling a certain way? An audience of Disney's time would have been baffled by what kind of reality this film shows.<br/><br/>The most fantastical quality of reality is that I can open the door and go wherever. The thinking mind will hold me back nine times out of ten, but the fact that our lives play out against the possibility is behind any life worth being lived. Spontaneity. It lies at the bottom of all the other structures we observe around us and at the bottom of almost every great film I know of.<br/><br/>Pixar's main structure in building world - and what sets them apart from previous studios - is finding a small corner of our own world to animate, say toys in the attic, we can then have the delight of secret lives right under our feet. The more ordinary and familiar this corner is, the more often we can imagine passing through it, the better. It's the difference between Toy Story and Cars. It lets them filter in the following way; the larger surrounding human world retains its quality of callous indifference as we think of it ourselves, our gaze is directed to the magical world-within where fragile beings have to struggle with predicaments like ours. <br/><br/>The primary thing to note in tandem with this is how the rest has been engineered around spontaneous expression. Pixar are something of a master in how things flow, how walls can be moved around to facilitate experience. It's all about turbulent motion that zig zags over barriers; through ocean streams, a bird flying us overhead, through tubes inside the marine park, hijacking a truck. Things magically work out, even when our heroes don't land in the right place, they do.<br/><br/>And you'll see this in the story about a narrator who continuously forgets, has no plan about how she's going to accomplish what she wants other than the urge to find her parents, but makes her way by rubbing against limits of where she finds herself, spontaneously opening ways."
"francyxave","1","132","251","11 July 2016"," Boring and disappointing
","Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed"
"eternities22","4","83","156","23 August 2016"," A big, hectic chunk of cinematic nonsense
","Finding Dory wins just one miserable star, for one reason: The animation throughout is astonishingly realistic.<br/><br/>However, almost everything else about the film is a train wreck of ocean-sized proportions. Take no notice of the reviews of the critics, who seem to be doing everything to try and defend this horribly misguided mess.<br/><br/>But how is it a mess? Here's why. The whole film just fails to give you a reason to want to sit through all of it again. It doesn't feel like a proper story, instead more like a series of antics and ideas thrown into an overflowing, ugly mix. It's chaotic, too long and so stupid at times that it has to be seen to be believed. This is easily one of Pixar's worst.<br/><br/>Finding Dory's most egregious flaw as its shockingly incompetent pacing. The film is frantic, mindless and over-concerned with shoving in jokes and sight gags. Scenes are so rushed and so needlessly silly that they just aren't believable. Introduced characters get little development and are just forgettable. Will anyone really remember or care about Hank the octopus, Destiny the whale shark or those argumentative sea-lions in the future?<br/><br/>The film's strict adherence to sequel clichés also seriously crosses the line. Returning plot elements, rehashed scenarios, character cameos and overblown action scenes are all here and are never justified. In fact, by the end of it, the entire film hasn't even justified its existence. Furthermore, the characters suffer so much bad luck that it eventually turns into ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" with fish. Everything starts going wrong. Detours are constantly taken. Death is cheated over and over. And yet, the characters constantly escape via methods so contrived and convenient that it's impossible to take seriously. Admittedly, it's kind of creative in places, but it's also as predictable as you can imagine.<br/><br/>The climax, however, is where the film finally crashes into the ground. It's astoundingly awful. Picture this - an octopus driving a lorry extremely poorly and not crashing into any oncoming cars. A large group of otters hugging each other in the middle of the road in order to stop these cars. And finally, the same lorry being driven over a hill and into the sea. This is the climax simplified - except that it's way, way worse than that. It can't even describe how bad it is. It's a horribly written climax and is jaw-droppingly nonsensical.<br/><br/>Why stop there? The film fails in so many other ways that you can play bingo with its flaws. There are way too many flashbacks to Dory's cutesy childhood. ""Emotional"" scenes are dull and stretched thin. Marlin and Nemo are in it, but mean little to the plot. A scene where a bunch of kids are touching some sea life, who are shown feeling the constant pain, is not at all funny but uncomfortable. Several scenes, like one with a talking clam, just feel shoved in for no reason. Many jokes fall flat. The dialogue is stale and charmless. I could go on and on.<br/><br/>The whole thing is an embarrassing atrocity. As much as I'd love to give more stars to this movie, I feel it deserves just one. Because the bad aspects of this movie are so bad, they essentially undo the good ones. Yes, it's well-animated. Yes, it has some very minor charming parts. Yes, it can be creative at times. But everything else about the film is brainless to a damning extreme. Finding Nemo worked because it was melancholic, tear-jerking and uplifting. It resonated with everyone. Its sequel has almost none of what made the original a masterpiece."
"Sweetigal85","10","14","21","28 May 2017"," Simply a delightful movie
","I have to admit that I was among many who rolled their eyes when a sequel to Finding Nemo was announced. I really didn't think there was anything else that could be done with that story. WRONG! It was honestly a million times better than I ever could have expected. I definitely loved it more than the original Finding Nemo. Dory was a fan favorite in the original film and the sequel delivers more of Ellen's whimsical portrayal of the forgetful little fish.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for backstory (main reason I love the Star Wars prequels) and I absolutely loved the direction they took this film in. Fun for the whole family. Laughs, lessons, tons of heart. Who could ask for more? The voice acting cast was tremendous, particularly Ellen, of course. They really know how to pull you into this undersea world. I really wouldn't have changed anything about it. A truly delightful movie."

","I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me. So, going into Finding Dory I had no real expectations.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.<br/><br/>Most importantly though is the story. Dory's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.<br/><br/>As an aside, I had avoided seeing this one until I had finally seen Finding Nemo and while I would recommend seeing Nemo, Finding Dory does stand alone as it's own film."

Now dory is older she begins to have flash backs of her parents and where she came from because she has never has known her real family. Some thoughts in her mind however make her realise she wants to find them. So dory decides to start on a sea adventure to try and find them with the help of her best friends marlin and Nemo the clown fish. Along the way dory has help from many other sea creatures in helping in trying to help find her parents. It is an exciting watching all the different situations that dory has to go through, whilst suffering from her short term memory loss, its funny yet sad and a little bit scary what happens to dory. Dory in the end actually remembers more than she actually knew. In the end dory finds here mum and dad because she remembered where she came from. This was a great adventure movie full of colourful sea creatures and a great ending for dory."
"philrealdeal","2","164","339","21 June 2016"," Disappointed
","I watched this movie with very high hopes. I was a kid when Finding Nemo came out and it defined kids movies at the time. Finding Dory was significantly less impressive. The good: The move was very cute and the characters were fun. Ed O'Neill as a cranky octopus was especially nice. <br/><br/>The bad: The whole movie feels as if Pixar was pressed to come out with a solid movie and just threw this one together really fast. It felt very rushed and therefore the story line, which had a little potential, was hard to really get into and appreciate. 3/4 of the way through, though it felt rushed, the movie became very redundant and predictable. I was pretty over it personally and could have stopped the movie then and been a happy camper. <br/><br/>One of Pixar's lazier films and it's disappointing considering the astounding work they have done before it. If you want to enjoy a movie like this, just watch Finding Nemo instead. If you want to see the sequel to they aforementioned and terrific film, your imagination of how the movie should play out is probably better than the real thing."

","Okay - Blackfish apparently caused a rewrite of the movies ending, presumably the species of the character Destiny. Okay... Pretty sure the writers had enough time to do some research and figure out that a whale-shark is not in fact a whale, and doesn't eat fish... Why not just feed the fish into the beluga's tank? Why not have the beluga 'speak whale' instead? We get it, it's a cartoon - but willful suspension of disbelief is lost when my 3 year old is calling out this sort of stuff (granted, he's been fortunate enough to go to the aquarium in Atlanta) There is no magic in Dory - in fact, it's greatest problem may be that there's too much Dory. In the first she acted as a great foil to Marlin - here... well... There's no foil for Dory.<br/><br/>Watch it again - as stated earlier, got a three year old so it might happen. Pay to watch it again? No. Do it by choice? No. Allow my kid to watch it again? Sure, there's worse, but then again, there's better too: frankly, ""A Turtle's Tale 2"" was better, with a fresher recycled soundtrack even with a remarkably similar plot line.<br/><br/>Currently Rotten Tomatoes is giving it a 'certified fresh' rating - I'm left wondering if there is an octopus writing their critical reviews."
"patfish1","3","87","179","26 June 2016"," ""Finding Dory""-boring, commercial, crass and totally unbelievable.
","Movies today are very commercial, we all know this. I've been going to animated type films with my granddaughter for many years and God bless, she always says she loves them all.<br/><br/>And so she did with Finding Dory but I was disgusted the entire movie.<br/><br/>First, we did see it in 3D, something I seldom do because I don't see the benefit of the extra money. But in the case of THIS movie, it is the one good thing I could say about it. This movie, under the sea, the marine life, the beautiful color, was gorgeous in 3D.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss the very, very stupid plot of this movie.<br/><br/>We begin by asserting that we do understand that giving animals human like traits is very common and I don't have a problem with this. It's part of the joy of watching, adds to the understanding, gives a depth to the plot.<br/><br/>But come on people, a fish with a short term memory problem? That's a rare thing even in humans for goodness sake, much less a fish with a brain smaller than a pea.<br/><br/>It's just too much to buy into is my complaint, that a fish manages to go through life forgetting everything is just learned because of this brain anomaly.<br/><br/>And the plot is very far-fetched, with fish hijacking trucks and flying with birds and translating fish water echoes into visual sights.<br/><br/>Seems Dory, the star of the movie and one of the fish who saved Elmo, an animate film from many years ago that was much more believable, lost her parents and the story is about Dory's determination to find them.<br/><br/>And Dory, come on, she's the only fish in the movie with buck teeth and why is this? Because Ellen DeGeneres, the voice of Dory, has teeth exactly like the cartoon fish and this was just so obvious. I like Ellen DeGeneres and consider she was a perfect voice for Dory, but DeGeneres has never met a promotional opportunity that she'd let pass by. Including having a fish with her voice look like her.<br/><br/>The story has a bunch of fish helping Dory find her parents and we've got seashell trails and forgetful Dory and a silly plot that looked as if a bunch of people threw a bunch of idea confetti on the table and an absurd story was somehow concocted.<br/><br/>Of course we have Dory stuff at McDonald's and Pixar, AKA Disney, will make money on this fluff thrown together with little care save for the merchandise and revenue.<br/><br/>Come on producers and directors out there! You got to have a little pride when crafting an animated movie. The color and 3D of ""Finding Dory"" ain't going to cut it.<br/><br/>This movie is best for someone five years old or less, someone who won't laugh at the silly concept of a forgetful fish."
"SusanJL","2","111","233","17 June 2016"," Nowhere nearly as good as Finding Nemo!
","I was super disappointed in this film, given that it was rated 4.5 stars. It had way too much of Dory. I wish I had a nickel for every time she mentioned she has memory problems; I'd be stinking rich. Trust me, the bad memory shtick gets very old after a short time.<br/><br/>If you love Dory, yes you will like the movie. But if Dory all the time is a bit much for you, you will get bored by this fast. The new whale characters just were not very interesting either. The 2 grand-kids liked Finding Dory OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. This is not the first time I've been disappointed in a highly-rated kids film, 5 stars just doesn't mean the quality it did in the past."
"ishuprakash","1","145","318","18 June 2016"," The worst of Pixar
","For a studio that has a brilliant track record, with incredible movies like Wall-e, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Cars, and others, Finding Dory is a complete embarrassment. It is, in fact, too bad to be considered with its prequel. There were a few scenes that did touch the heart, but overall it was more of a joke. The original film brought several new ideas that all of us liked, this one doesn't bring anything substantially new. The same Dory which was cute in the first part is too annoying in this one. Sometimes, she is just unbearable. The dialogues are mostly boring. I rarely feel like sleeping while watching a movie, this one did make me fall asleep two times very briefly. I loved the first part and I was so excited with this one too. As the movie started, I tried to make myself believe that it is not bad, but by the interval time, I felt like leaving before finishing it! I will always agree that some scenes were really good, but they were acutely insufficient to save this movie. For me, a movie that had Pixar with its name was automatically considered as a must-watch, but now, you've destroyed your name Pixar."
"originalfreda","1","98","211","2 July 2016"," Boring
","This had to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Both my wife and I fell asleep. There was almost no humor. It was just a ridiculous ""adventure"" (if you could call it that), and it seemed to go on and on. If you are going to make an animated movie, there should be some humor in it for the adults. After all, adults are the ones PAYING for the movie.<br/><br/>My nap was the best part of the movie. While I was awake, I had to suffer though the annoying voice of Ellen DeGeneres. The Dory character was okay in the first movie as a secondary character, but they should have never made a movie around this obnoxious character.<br/><br/>The only good think I can say is that my 6 year old thought it was okay."

","I am still a kid at heart and never miss out on a Disney or Pixar film, ever. But this one establishes two problems for children who have been adopted or are in foster care. <br/><br/>First - Dory is, as we all know, forgetful, and that is why she was separated from her parents, thus - it is HER FAULT. <br/><br/>Second - Dory has loving, friendly parents who are emotionally and mentally stable and have been actively looking for her for years, therefor perpetuating most adopted / fostered children's fantasies regarding their birth parents, but is most often NOT the case. This is grossly unfair to any child not anticipating this theme in the film, did Pixar forget how literal children are? <br/><br/>So be thoughtful and take the time to see this insensitive film before taking your children. Even birth children need to have a talk with their parents about NOT making adoptive friends / classmates feel that this could be the outcome if they are adopted. Our adopted daughter years for a relationship with her birth mother, and we are actively looking for her and praying for a good end result. Many times birth parents want nothing to do with their birth children. <br/><br/>Again, Pixar really dropped the ball on this one, for all the screaming this industry does to be sensitive to most groups of people, I guess they didn't bother to give a second thought to this particular group."
"Rendanlovell","5","54","112","17 June 2016"," Why Pixar??
","Well it's been thirteen years but we finally have the movie that no one asked for, 'Finding Dory'. Following the huge success of 'Finding Nemo' it's hard to imagine that this film wasn't going to happen. Even if we all got down and begged Pixar not to, they still probably would have made this movie. So this time around, Dory is our main character. Yes, Pixar has completely made up a story to give to the side character that everyone loved so much. With in the first ten minutes Dory magically remembers that she has a family and goes on the hunt for them. Sound like the first the film? Well it is.<br/><br/>It's exactly like the first one. Only the difference is that this one is really stupid. 'Finding Nemo' happened because Nemo was taken away from his father. Him and his father were the only survivors after some fished killed their whole family. So it made sense that Nemos dad would trek across the whole ocean to find him. <br/><br/>The problem here is that you don't really care about what is going on at all. The story the film builds around it's characters is absolute nonsense. You mean to tell me that in the entire year that Dory was living with these guys no one bothered to ask her about her family? And that all those phrases that triggered her memory she was hearing for the first time in her life?<br/><br/>I don't think so Pixar. As I watched this film it was apparent that this film was farted into existence. The film makers clearly just used this characters handicap to make up a pointless story. I mean they seriously could not think of any better way to tell the story then to just have her flash back like one hundred times?<br/><br/>Not only is this incredibly lazy but it made the whole movie feel incredibly convenient. The films story is only taking place because of something that was completely random and ridiculous. Not only that, but they seriously could not have come up with anything better than just rehashing the same story? It's exactly the same story as the first just, the characters are playing slightly different roles.<br/><br/>How on earth do the film makers think that one can be invested in this film if the first one was not only the same, but better? The first had real, relatable emotions and experiences going on. It was easy to connect with the characters and sympathize with their voyage. But this film doesn't do any of that. It just expects you to be blinded by nostalgia and love everything that is happening simply because you remember those characters.<br/><br/>Which it does nothing new with either. There was really only one new character in the whole film that had any kind of personality. Aside from that every new thing we are introduced to is only just as a plot device. Other than that, their main purpose was to be comedy relief. Which was mainly pointed at making fun of other handicapped animals. If this film isn't subtly telling your children that you should make fun of handicapped people I don't know what is.<br/><br/>While I certainly did not enjoy this film it isn't without its few saving graces. For starters, the voice acting is once again great. Ellen as Dory is closest thing to perfect casting I have seen. Her and the other actors involved really seemed to commit to their performances. And while the story as a whole isn't good there are a couple of great scenes in there. <br/><br/>The scene in the kid zone is particular great. Seeing how these fish view these kids poking them and grabbing them is pretty ingenious. As a whole it is also very well paced. There was very few dull moments here. That being said, this film should not have happened. Not only is it a symbol of how far Pixar has fallen but how much they actually care about their audience. No longer do they desire to make quality pictures, no, it's all about the money now. This is very apparent thanks to how little thought was put into this movie. If you have kids, they might enjoy it. But if not, this one really is not worth your time."

","I don't care whether critics say it is nice or not. It may look great visually, but truth be told, there isn't much more to it than that. The lines get too repetitive, too redundant. The plot is too thin, and the characters pretty annoying. The forgetfulness that was cute in finding Nemo got to a point where it is plainly dumb and irritating here. The trick gets old, it loses its value. It is just like ""minions"". The small yellow guys were cute in despicable me, but they should not have gotten their own movies. Same here. Dory is uninteresting, and while some scenes make people feel with her, i spent most of the movie wondering when it was going to end. It is one of Pixar's worst movies."
"tchrjudith","4","40","81","20 July 2016"," Can't match up to Finding Nemo
","I have always liked watching children's film, animated or live- action since most of the time they are fun or well-written or both. I have no problems suspending disbelief when it comes to movies since I know that cinema is a different art form and it can be just pure entertainment and escapist fun (that has to use some unbelievable action sequences or scenes). A good film, for me, does not need to please the critics all the time or be too realistic and philosophical. I can enjoy almost all movies as long they are not pretentious and just want to tell a good story, whether in a profound way or in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>However, I had to suspend my disbelief too many times while watching Finding Dory and the story is not compelling enough for me. I also find Dory so annoying here though I liked the octopus very much.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected too much since I enjoyed Finding Nemo even though I also had to suspend my disbelief when watching it, but the suspension of disbelief did not make me question the plot too much. I also thought that Finding Dory would be a good sequel since I enjoyed the sequels of famous animated films like Toy Story 2, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda 2. Well I thought wrong!!!!"

","i used to be a be pixar fan, and loved classic films like Nemo and Monster. However, since Steve Jobs sold Pixar to Disney, the creativity and imagination have died with the trade. Dory is no exception, feels like a recycled Nemo but with much worse plot, worse cgi, worse pretty much everything. It is pretty hard to believe, 15 years since the original Nemo, the quality of the animation actually has become worse.<br/><br/>The only bright spot of the movie, was the 5 minute mini movie Piper.

","I thought that this movie would be boring since I got older and it's a kid's movie. I was very surprised and I found it better than finding Nemo. I could relate so much to Dory, I'm always forgetting things, I'm always lost and I cried so many times in this movie because I could relate. She is just like me and when other fishes got mad at her, I felt the same way she did. It was a very deep and emotional movie, I absolutely loved it (even though I don't remember everything). If you are constantly lost in your own world and have a fish memory, I guarantee that you will cry watching the movie."
"Troy_Campbell","7","33","66","19 June 2016"," Charming and amusing.
","Everyone's favourite forgetful fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), is back on the big screen a whopping 13 years after joining Marlin (Albert Brooks) on a quest to find his missing clownfish son. This time, however, Dory takes centre stage. Shifting the focus from Nemo to Dory for this belated follow-up is a no-brainer; it allows Pixar to concoct a new ocean-spanning adventure without feeling too repetitive, whilst cleverly bringing the broader plot full-circle by having the child now looking for the parents. Even with the huge gap between movies, there are still obstacles to be circumvented in order to avoid sequelitis. Most of these are handled with the intelligence and elegance we have come to expect from Pixar, though some hurdles prove to be too big. The story goes to very different places from both a narrative and location perspective, but the messages behind the film – don't judge a book by its cover, spontaneity can be liberating, you can do anything if you try hard enough, etc – are all too familiar. With glorious cutting-edge animation, a string of creative sequences and a barrel-full of laughs, there won't be a single audience member, regardless of age, that'll be bored; yet there's also a lack of truly memorable moments that stop this from being a classic like its predecessor. It goes without saying that Dory is the star of the show, although the range of hilarious supporting characters is impressive. Ed O'Neill's cantankerous, camouflaging octopus Hank and Ty Burrell's self-doubting beluga whale Bailey shine brightest. It might not be in the top echelon of Pixar outings, but Finding Dory is a charming, amusing and thoughtful family flick worth visiting the cinema for."
"steerpike_2002","3","31","62","15 August 2016"," Dull and unnecessary repetition of original
","I'll come out and admit up front that ""Finding Nemo"" is not one of my favourite Pixar movies. When it was released I found it quite easily the least funny Pixar movie to date and, having followed ""Monsters Inc."", I worried that Pixar were shifting their focus to the kids in the audience without delivering so many of the clever references and gags that are the core of their appeal to adults. Happily ""The Incredibles"" followed the subsequent year, still the best movie the studio has produced.<br/><br/>Critical reception for ""Finding Dory"" convinced me to give it a go, but I wish I had listened to my instincts to avoid this one. Much like its predecessor, the film is generally lacking in humour and barely raised a chuckle from me throughout. Not much thought seems to have gone into making clever gags, exemplified by the oft-mentioned use of Sigourney Weaver as voice talent. It's like someone at Pixar said ""Hey, wasn't it funny when we had Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the ship's computer in ""WALL-E""? Well, yes, it was - because that was a clever reference to the film ""Alien"". Here, no such reference exists, so it's just unfunny name-dropping.<br/><br/>The lack of humour compounds upon a really weak story line that is soul-drainingly repetitive. It is no spoiler to say that the vast majority of this movie consists of the three main characters being split up on their way somewhere, managing to get back together again and then immediately being split up again. It happened over and over again until I was internally screaming at the film to come to a merciful end. The film's emotional core is a simple rehash of the original and never rises above the bargain-basement ""Family is good"" and ""You can do it if you try"" tropes of a million other kids films. It's a far cry from the subtlety exhibited by last year's ""Inside Out"".<br/><br/>Possibly most damning of all is the fact that this movie doesn't even push the visual boundaries of the original. Considering that it's been 13 years I was expecting to be wowed by some great underwater visuals, but this film doesn't look any better than its predecessor. Disappointing to say the least.<br/><br/>Overall this is definitely one to skip unless its to keep young children occupied for 90 minutes. Given that next year we have an unwanted 3rd ""Cars"" movie, we'll have to hope that original IP ""Coco"" can demonstrate the qualities that we've come to expect from Pixar - they're in short supply here."
"mark_derry","1","55","118","15 August 2016"," Finding entertainment
","Sorry but this just didn't work.. the story line was tired to say the least. Whilst there were a few subtle pastiches to keep parents interested there weren't enough. and even my four year old got down from their seat and came over to ask me ""Is it finishing soon ? I'm bored."" My nine year old managed to keep awake throughout which is his usual way of showing his view on a film so maybe it's not all bad. But with the current cost of Cinema (movie house) tickets (£30 $40) in London I did feel somewhat disappointed. This was a Disney Pixar production was we had our anticipation set by their previous material, but this was a low point on their output. From Finding Nemo a sequel was obviously going to make an appearance. This admittedly didn't give the writers much scope for a story. But they needed to have included more comical asides within the main story and increased the pace of the second quarter."
"RemusGrey","4","34","69","9 July 2016"," Finding Dory is supposed to be a worthy sequel, but it isn't.
","I am a very big Pixar fan. I grew up watching all the Pixar classics when I was a kid. Toy Story, The Incredibles, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo are some examples of my favorite Pixar movies of all time. When the Finding Dory teaser played before The Force Awakens, that effing piano at the beginning gave me goosebumps. The highly anticipated sequel to our favorite classic is here! I was very excited as I entered the theater. I wasn't surprised that 40% of the theater was occupied by children (although the most surprising thing here is that elders were dominant). It was supposed to be a great day to spend Father's Day last month. But as I exit the theater, I don't know exactly what was wrong with me. I felt kind of underwhelmed and disappointed at the same time. Is this the most disappointing Pixar film yet?<br/><br/>First, I'll list the only good stuff in the movie.<br/><br/>1. Voice acting. The old cast in this sequel still have the same energy they had back in 2003. The new cast such as Idris Elba, Diane Lane, Eugene Levy, and Ed O'Neill shined in their roles. <br/><br/>2. Humor. Although the humor is aimed at kids, there were also jokes made to fly over their heads. Sigourney Weaver's scene and Dory considering her as her friend as an example. It's a remarkable scene.<br/><br/>Now here are all the flaws in the film:<br/><br/>1. Story. Not only did I notice the storyline is rushed, but even others did. Are they low on budget? I don't know.<br/><br/>2. Plot. This is a problem most people have with the film. The plot is basically a rehash of the first Finding Nemo! I didn't have any expectation of wishing for something original since this is the first time Pixar rehashed a classic. Add some exaggerating and unbelievable moments in the film.<br/><br/>3. Lack of heart. Another big problem with the film is that it lacked heart. When I heard that there are no teary eyed moments, my excitement lowered a bit. However, when my friends said they did cry, I went to the theater also expecting to cry. But there wasn't any time for teary eyed moments. Take Inside Out, Toy Story 3, Up, and Finding Nemo as examples. They broke our hearts so much that you can't resist crying. The story is ""so human"". In Finding Dory, they were replaced with laughs instead. <br/><br/>4. The Tank Gang's appearance. Why were they at the after end credits scene? They could've been in the actual movie instead of letting only a small amount of people getting to see them again. Really disappointing.<br/><br/>5. Exaggerating moments. The new character named Hank was a really likable character, until he was ruined in the third act. He actually drives a truck on the road! Would you also like to see fishes hijack a truck? What about a whale shark escaping from its tank? You'll find those here. What a move, Pixar.<br/><br/>6. Music. Thomas Newman is a great movie composer. But he's not so great here. His music sounds so uninspired and he didn't bring the original Finding Nemo theme (excluding one scene). Dory's theme is too similar to the theme of Finding Nemo. And at times, his music gave me a Dreamworks feel.<br/><br/>7. Theme song. I literally hated Unforgettable. It sounds more of a James Bond theme (kinda sounds like Writing's on the Wall from SPECTRE) than a Finding Dory theme song. Sia wasn't even a good choice to sing the theme song. Is Hollywood hiring famous singers to sing theme songs for every single movie? The terrible Ghostbusters remake has Fall Out Boy performing the theme. Bad idea. What's next? Justin Bieber singing a new theme for Rogue One?<br/><br/>8. Children are treated like devils. This isn't really an issue in Toy Story 3, but they did it again here. It's like saying Pixar thinks children are devils.<br/><br/>As you can see, I am very disappointed with Finding Dory. I was ready to give this a 10, but after seeing the movie, I am very disappointed. This is supposed to be a worthy sequel, but it isn't. Instead, we were given another mediocre sequel from Pixar (in my ratings Cars 2 is rated higher than this because at least the characters are not exaggerating and we had a really good theme, but it's still a disappointing Pixar movie). It's not as good as Finding Nemo either. This won't be in my Pixar collection. This is the second Pixar movie not to be present there. I refuse to believe this exists. Hopefully The Incredibles 2 won't be as mediocre as this.<br/><br/>4/10."
"LittleLotti","5","46","97","23 June 2016"," I had high hopes
","As someone who adores Finding Nemo and has waited YEARS for a sequel, I must say I am disappointed. Finding Dory definitely has a sequel feel to it. This didn't feel like a story that is worth a thirteen year wait. There are certainly cute and funny moments, but nothing solid enough to become a favorite. I've seen Finding Nemo so many times, but Dory is one I'll probably never watch again unless it's with my nephew or something. I didn't feel like this was a Pixar movie for all ages; it seemed more appropriate for younger audiences (I'm 24). As much as I hate admitting it, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Near the last quarter or so of the movie it just got redundant and all I could think was, ""Ok, this can be over any time now."" I enjoyed seeing characters from Nemo make appearances, and a couple new characters were charming, but overall it's not enough to make Dory an instant classic like Nemo. Pixar outdid themselves with the animation but you can tell this is a sequel for the sake of a sequel, not because they came up with a great storyline."
"mother_of_popcorn","4","50","107","3 July 2016"," Doesn't Compare To Finding Nemo
","Sometimes there are films that are untouchable and I think something like Finding Nemo was one of them. Whilst Dory was a beloved character in the film, I believe it was a stretch having her become the star of her own film in Finding Dory.<br/><br/>The other problem with creating spin-off films (or sequels and remakes for that matter), is that you find yourself consistently comparing them to the original. This can be detrimental if the original was close to perfection. I found that the things I loved about Finding Nemo were missing from Finding Dory. One of the great things about the first movie was that the adventure was never-ending. We started with the loss of Nemo and we followed his father Marlon and his sidekick Dory on a quest to find him. Along the way, we met various characters and encountered differing scenarios that kept us on our toes. The gnarly surfer dude sea turtles, the immense field of jellyfish, the creepy creature that lured the two protagonists with a distracting shiny light dangling from the tip of his head and the group of wannabe vegetarian sharks (lead by the intimidating but friendly Bruce). Not to mention what Nemo was going through and the friends and foes he was encountering at a dental surgery in Sydney.<br/><br/>Finding Dory didn't really have any of that. Whilst Dory did meet a few quirky friends along the way, I felt like the flow of the film was missing. Either the interactions were brief (like when she met a couple of fish who were trying to help Dory but couldn't figure her out because of her condition), or they were long and laboured (like when she met Hank the octopus and subsequently Bailey and Destiny at the Marine Life Institute). For me, it seemed like Dory was quick to move from point A to point B (from Australia to the United States) but then lingered on point B for a very long time.<br/><br/>Visually, as was expected, the film was faultless and despite all of the above, there were still some delightful moments that made you laugh and made you cry. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to keep me interested and instead of wanting Dory to find herself, I found myself looking at my watch and waiting for the end credits to begin rolling.<br/><br/>motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"
"smrawat","1","47","100","4 August 2016"," High expectations to low expectations
","Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed"

","I love Finding Nemo so for me, this movie was a disappointment. The plot was weak and it seemed like they couldn't think of a proper way to end it. The graphics wasn't as good as last time and Dory seemed to have lost her charm. They played on her forgetting to bring forced humour. In Finding Nemo the characters were all lovable and unique but in this one they were all similar and uninteresting. After all the buildup of Dory trying to find her family, when she finally did it wasn't powerful enough. I had to roll my eyes when Dory was driving the truck with the octopus because it was so cliché. The only scenes that were good were Dory's memories of when she was a baby, she was adorable! Overall, a good movie but nowhere near Pixars' normal standards."
"mickyrest","3","37","78","20 June 2016"," A bland sequel - as to be expected by Pixar as of late
","Pixar has not had the best track record as of late releasing mediocre films such as ""The Good Dinosaur"", ""Brave"" and lifeless sequels such as ""Monsters University"" and to an extent ""Toy Story 3"", so going into this one I did not have high expectations. While somewhat more enjoyable than the previous films mentioned, ""Finding Dory"" just does not have much going for it, which is to be expected considering how unnecessary this sequel is. Finding Nemo was a great film on its own and it seems that Pixar is cashing in this time by attempting to ""expand"" the side character of Dory, and the result was not great.<br/><br/>In the first 10-20 mins Dory is excruciatingly annoying, having all the conversations revolve around her, the short-term memory condition gets painful really fast, especially in the attempt to make brainless, lazy ""jokes"". This just goes to show that Dory's character was never intended to be front and center, but rather as comic relief, and similar to ""Cars 2"" with Mater, while it works in the first one it is simply tiring in the sequel. Pixar knew this well, and tried to fix it by having the movie spend wasted time with Marlin and Nemo with little attempt to expand their characters.<br/><br/>Although, rather than expanding Dory's character, they just rehash her arc from the first one, and instead give her an uninspired backstory relying purely on Dory being ""cute"". What ensues is another typical, generic Pixar ""adventure"", plagued with unnecessary flashbacks that only serve to interrupt the flow of the movie.<br/><br/>I will say however that the most enjoyable part of the film were the various humorous parts of the movies such as the Seals and also Octopus, a character that endured more growth throughout the movie than the lead. On the other hand, there were also the film's fair share of brainless jokes, such as the Sigourney Weaver announcement that was repeated so many times that it had a numbing effect, alongside the rehashed jokes from the first one including the whale calling and ""just keep swimming"" song that only remind the audience just how far Pixar have fallen.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Finding Dory"" is by no means awful, it is however an extremely mediocre, average and forgettable film, adding yet another blemish on what used to be Pixar's quality track record. The future for the studio is not looking bright with 3 out of the 4 movies in production being more sequels, but let's hope that they have the capacity to try something different or at least slightly straying from the norm."

","Attention: This review is about the premise of the story and the reoccurring themes throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>A huge portion of this movie is Dory freaking out about memory loss.

Dory's short term memory loss is the ""villain"". It separates her from her loving parents and plagues her throughout the movie with a gnawing sense that she's not where she's suppose to be. It causes her to trust strangers, some who are natural predators - one who does not have her best interest but eventually gives into her plight. The message: Even predators will help you if your persistently cute and innocent.

","Took my two children ages 5 and 9 to watch. The opening Pixar Piper was awesome!They can really convey a story with no dialog and be totally entertaining. However, Dory with all the dialog just fell flat. I think many would agree that there are many movies that don't need a sequel, no matter how much money they made with the first.Some movies, like Nemo, already complete an original story and tie up the ends nicely. Pixar really hit the underwater CGI at 100% with Nemo. I believe that, combined with lovable characters, good main plot, and very cleaver idea interactions (sharks, crabs, gulls, dentist office and aquarium scenes, all the mini-struggles along the way, and the development of the character arcs like Marlin/Nemo, Marlin/Dory, etc) made Nemo an innovative cartoon movie for all ages, hence the immense success. Sure, writers can contrive any number of plot lines into a sequel, but form without substance renders a somewhat lackluster sequel=Dory. The movie is highly colorful and continues Pixars excellent water CGI but can't top what was already done to perfection in Nemo. The story re-acquaints the old characters with some as-expected new characters, with a brief turtle Crush cameo. The sea lions were cute, the octopus made for a few laughs, but the whole ""I can't remember.."" Dory character was so overused that it overshadowed the movie with a somber melodrama. I could hear many kids groaning in the theater as the movie dragged on, my two barely stayed awake. The Dory character in Nemo had a purpose, was used skillfully and moved the movie along with some slapstick lines by DeGeneres almost like Robin Williams' Aladdin. But to make that a core plot and centerpiece is not enough to carry a movie. I guess it makes sense to Hollywood to take a move like Nemo, that cost $94mil and grossed probably a billion with marketing and toys, is enough reason to stretch for a sequel. Did it work for Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Chipmunks, Happy Feet, Shrek, Toy Story, Despicable Me, Madagascar, How to Train Dragon? Admittedly sometimes yes, but not this time."

"estreet-eva","4","9","15","21 February 2017"," Why supporting characters are supporting characters
","As we learned from Cars 2, bringing a supporting cast member - in that case, Mater - to lead a sequel often essentially makes the side the entree. Watching 2 hours - and wow, is this thing too long - of Dory doing cutesy stuff and forgetting stuff becomes grindingly tedious. The miracle of ""Finding Nemo"" grew out of the animators finding a way for small fish, who are essentially prisoners of the vast and largely featureless water, to have often land-based adventures without unduly straining credulity. ""Finding Dory"" lacks the inventiveness when it comes to working around the limitations of the aquatic by employing an octopus who luckily doesn't need to be kept wet, who breathes are, can drive a truck, can match any background he squishes against, and who happens to have fine motor skills. Sure real octopi can open a jar to get a fish out but riding a stroller like a wheelchair comes across as a wincey bit unrealistic. The underwater seascapes drawn by the animators are amazingly realistic and if you just turn down the sound of the humorless and dull dialog, the movie is on whole beautiful to look at. There's just too much of it to look at with a runtime that features way too much swimming of small fish through pipes or underwater paths or sunken freighters. In short, Pixar needed to spend more resources on the script and less on the animation."

","13 years (yes, it's been that long) since 'Finding Nemo' the talented folks at Pixar again decide to break their 'no sequel' rule and bring us 'Finding Dory'.<br/><br/>'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' had their moments but weren't great, so I was going into this film with low expectations.<br/><br/>However, despite there being quite a few similarities between the plots of both films 'Finding Dory' is entertaining enough, with lots of charm and humour.<br/><br/>I did find it a bit repetitive at times though. We lost Dory, we find Dory, then something else happens to Dory. It almost seemed as though they were padding the story out.<br/><br/>Is 'Finding Dory' set to be a classic? No. Could you just watch 'Finding Nemo' and forget this sequel was made? Yes. But for a better than average film then this is a good one to watch."

","The movie itself was in my opinion disappointing. Maybe it's just me being grown up (which I doubt) but the movie was just lacking so much. Didn't laugh or even smile once throughout the movie. It was just meh i didn't feel like there was any humor in the movie and there wasn't any exciting parts either. After more than 10 years from finding Nemo to this it's just disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying it's not as good as expected. There wasn't any part where i felt danger or where i felt that dory getting lost was actually important at all Music didn't make me feel anything through the whole movie. Animation could've been better as well. Could probably still be a good movie for kids but for people who already watched finding Nemo and who watches lots of movies its just not worth the money"
"lvf-49023","2","14","27","20 January 2017"," Proof that not every successful film automatically needs a sequel
","I went to watch this with my man and his employee and it was disappointing. I have Finding Nemo on DVD and like it very much. My only merits for this film are for the noble intentions of Nemo and his father, besides that, this is almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back, this film drags on so much that by the first hour I felt like I'd spent a full day watching it and on top of that I still had very little connection to the characters and their story hadn't even started. Second hour hit, still nothing, I was almost asleep. hahahaaha an octopus that is missing tentacles, not really. I might as well have been asleep, the story was still stagnant. As a sequel, it's like watching paint dry, it just doesn't get going. If you have the time to spare and have nothing better to do or watch then by all means, watch this film, but if you have something better do with your time then please, avoid this film. The length of the film doesn't justify the lack of story or the cinematic prowess, this could very easily have been a half hour short film. I can say none of us enjoyed much about this film. My bf thought it was empty and his employee thought it was strictly for children whereas the prequel was for children and adults. On the bright side we went home afterwards and had good satisfying sex until midnight so it was a good day."

","If 20th Century Fox's Ice Age: Collision Course valiantly attempted to keep up with the series by throwing as many ideas into the mix, you would think an animated studio steeped in success as Pixar is would be more than capable of stepping up to the plate and besting themselves with a sequel.<br/><br/>I'd say not after seeing Finding Dory, which is essentially the script of Finding Nemo (2003) re-hashed for a generation who either missed that film the first time around or the passage of time has led them to forget it.<br/><br/>Some smart new characters make their debut here but the few-and-far-between ingenuity that is usually the hallmark of Pixar is overdone in a film as barren as the Dead Sea."
"jadepietro","8","21","44","18 June 2016"," The Film Works Swimmingly Well
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A fish-out-of-water tale that celebrates family, friendship, and disabilities. <br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Little Dory goes on a search for her parents and overcomes many hardships along her journey.<br/><br/>The search is on yet again in Disney / Pixar's sequel to its 2003 hit, Finding Nemo. Only this time it's not Marlin hunting for his son, but his lovable and forgetful sidekick on the road to find out. Things go swimmingly in this latest chapter. Finding Dory takes the same initial premise and repackages it into a family-friendly always entertaining computer-generated fantasy.<br/><br/>￼The same love and care is on display in this finely crafted animated feature as before. The sequel may not be as original as its predecessor, (it isn't), but it is still packed with enough emotion, insightful dialog, and visual awe. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, Finding Dory finds the right course in telling its tale of a little fish with short term memory loss overcoming the odds in search for her family.<br/><br/>￼Visually, the film remarkably creates its under the sea universe. The reflections, rich color palette, and lighting effects are rendered with expert details. There is so much to take in with the background photo realism, plus the character animation has subtle textures and expressions that provide an inner story to each character.<br/><br/>￼Yet, the deeper message in this children's film is its celebration of disabilities. Weaknesses become strengths in overcoming adversity and we moviegoers cheer our characters onward. Their quest eventually takes them to a marine research institute and, once the trio hits dry land, the sense of underwater wonder dries up a bit too. At this point, the script loses its way and starts to take an all too familiar route, introducing new adorable characters (and possible tie-ins at toy stores), leading to another zany far-fetched climactic chase scene and eventual reunion. Still, the predictability of the formula works yet again and tugs at our emotional core.<br/><br/>￼Behind the microphones are a talented cast of celebrities voicing these lovable characters. Taking center stage is Ellen DeGeneres' Dory. The comedian gives her character a wonderful sweetness and breathless wonderment as Dory encounters new experiences along the way...but then, everything is new to our absent-minded heroine. Albert Brooks returns again as Marlin, and Hayden Rolence takes over as Dory's sidekick, Nemo, and they make a delightful tag team. Providing vocal support are Idris Elba, Dominic West, Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, with Ed O'Neill stealing every scene as crotchety Hank, the seven-armed camouflaged octopus.<br/><br/>Not in the same league as the aforementioned 2003 film, Finding Dory essentially tells a familiar (and overly cute) story, although it relies a bit too much on its original source. The film still visually enchants and allows the moviegoer to sit back and enjoy the humorous adventure as one little fish conquers its own disability to find inner strength and happiness. Perfect family fare and beguiling in its under-the-sea eye-popping technicolor beauty, Finding Dory is not a top-tiered Disney / Pixar classic, in the lines of Toy Story, Up, or Ratatouille, but it is a very fine addition to the studio's cinematic resume.<br/><br/>NOTE: Showing with this film is an animated short called Piper. The film is charming and a shoo-in as an Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Short Film. Wordless and gorgeous in its splendid details and textures, the film tells a story of a little sandpiper gaining courage against the forces of nature. Delightful.<br/><br/>￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","This movie is about a fish 'child' with short term memory loss. Why would Pixar make a movie about a fish with short term memory loss you ask? Because it is the politically correct venue of the day. It's not meant to entertain children but to ""teach them a lesson"" of how they should treat other children whom they happen to meet that have short term memory loss, which, in any person's life time, the odds of meeting anyone with this disability is almost nil. I'm really old and have never met any. But YOU have become so brain washed by political correctness that you don't even notice when it's being thrust upon you. I say YOU because I am too old to buy into this freedom stealing bull crap. This movie doesn't deserve to be given even a 1(one) but I can't give it anything lower. Watch this and know you are losing a portion of your life that you can't get back and that you are being fed propaganda.

","While this much-anticipated sequel provides a few instances of comic relief and introduces a handful of new characters, there is only so much you can do with a story-line where the same obstacle presents itself for each situation; Dory can't remember, but she's trying her best.<br/><br/>The protagonist manages to just keep swimming her way through all sorts of unexpected twists and turns, hindered by her disability but with the help of all sorts of friends and family. There were a couple of scenes which intersected quite well with events from the ""Finding Nemo"" time-line in a nearly Tarantino-esque fashion. I found this to be an impressive attempt to maintain story integrity where most modern-day CGI flicks would have just cut to a singing and dancing animal.<br/><br/>Overall, the story-line was lacking. The CGI seemed shoddy at times, the score was uninspired, and the original sense of adventure that came with ""Finding Nemo"" was replaced mostly with varying degrees of caution and stories about modern day values; 1) Don't belittle the disabled. 2) Have faith in family and friends. 3) Be sure to watch the next three CGI movies featuring singing and dancing farm animals with no discernible plot. <br/><br/>I awarded a reasonable 5/10 rating.

It's making the company a fortune, so what do I know? Evidently not much. All that matters is that the children love it, right? Who cares if it pickles their imaginations by conjuring up a non-world, something that could only exist in the swarming collective brain of a gigantic corporation?<br/><br/>I recommend running early Pixar or classic Disney for your young ones. They've stood the test of time, which FINDING DORY will inevitably fail on account of its unacceptably high sugar content."

Worse case scenario for me was this movie would be bad because it was a repeating the story-line of Nemo, but I was not expecting it would be because Disney Pixar took this movie to a sad and upsetting place.<br/><br/>The movie started with story-line based around a young fish Dory with a memory loss illness, loosing her parents (a young kids worst nightmare). All of the characters had a scary odd feel around them, even the ones who were supposed to be Dory's friends and helping her, came across terrifying. This movie had no laughter, no fun, no cuteness, it was one hideous scary ride from one moment of peril to the next with no let-up. Touching on some real adult themes such as losing parents, illness and death... It was all too much for the children, and for me.<br/><br/>If someone had told me before I went to see the movie that Finding Dory would be scary and unsuitable for children I would have said they were being overly sensitive, or ridiculous, but sadly it's true."
"bexlewis","5","16","35","2 July 2016"," Not Bad Just Underwheming
","Maybe I'm biased because, Finding Nemo used to be my favorite Pixar movie when I was a kid so my hopes were very high going into this. Not bad or terrible just below expectations and an overall meh. Its a pretty harmless kids movie that they will probably enjoy but for an amazing followup to Finding Nemo it might not meet every expectation. <br/><br/>**Full Review and Spoilers** Dory works better as a side character definitely. This reminded me of Cars 2 where Pixar thought it was a good idea to make Mater the main character but he just wouldn't stop talking and came off as annoying. The same pretty much applies for Dory. I like Dory as a character but What made Dory likable is that the writers knew when to use her and when to have her be quiet. She was able to be loud and exuberant but still likable because they used her in certain amounts. In this movie she is just constantly talking on and on. There was one scene where Dory and this Octopus are sneaking down a hallway and Dory is irrelevantly babbling the whole time and all I could think was ""If she wasn't talking right now this scene would be exactly the same but better"". Its just a typical case of putting a good side character in a main character spot and it being unsuccessful.<br/><br/>I think Nemo's character could have been stronger they definitely missed an opportunity there. His only trait in this movie was ""I believe in Dory"" which is nice but they could've done something more with him. Maybe it should have been just Nemo without Marlin trying to find Dory that way Nemo could have matured or developed some character like his dad did in the first movie.<br/><br/>The references got a bit annoying. I love a good callback but these weren't clever just blatant and repetitive. There times where the characters were literally just reciting the plot of the first movie. All this did was remind me that I could be watching a better movie. I think they did this to bring up a feeling of nostalgia but I think they would have been more successful at doing that if the callbacks were subtle.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty wonky as well. There were several times I think the movie could have ended. The pacing just felt very off and rushed, some parts could've been slown down or cut like the octopus driving a friggin truck. Instead they could've cut that scene and maybe put in a slower scene that helped show the development of Dory and the Octopus' friendship or something. (That relationship was one of many things that felt rushed as well).<br/><br/>I wish that since this was a sequel to a movie that was made thirteen years ago that they could've put more material for older audiences to enjoy. Just because a movie is targeted at kids doesn't mean there can't be stuff and elements in there for adults to enjoy as well. Pixar normally does well at making movies that kids and older people can enjoy and relate to. I just thought this movie in particular was very shallow and pandering toward kids, but I have a higher expectation for Pixar with this kinda thing as I previously mentioned so this could just be me.<br/><br/>But as I said this movie isn't all bad. Pixar is very good at electing emotions and this movie had some emotional moments. Like Dory actually Finding her parents or when she thought they were dead. That first person scene when the truck with Marlin and Nemo in it was pretty exciting, sad, and cool. I think they did a pretty good job with showing the struggle associated with short term memory loss (even though the amount of flashbacks she kept having kind of made it seem like she didn't have memory loss).<br/><br/>Overall this movie is not terrible just bland. Its just a typical cute clean Pixar movie that kids will like enough. I couldn't recommend it to older audiences though."

"leosmith-11166","8","18","41","28 June 2016"," Quite possibly the best Pixar sequel ever ( just hear me out )
","Hold on, my fellow film fanatics, critics and viewers. I've heard all of the bad reviews of this film. I am not oblivious to the fact this is a big budget Hollywood animation sequel, and I know that when some of you hear the word sequel, big budget, or even Hollywood, you automatically dismiss it as a trashy entertainment cash grab. But Finding Dory is more than a cash grabbing Hollywood sequel. It is the passing of the torch between generations. The older generations gift to the young generation, a chance for the young to experience the laughter, emotion and nostalgia of Pixar, and in particular, these characters of the finding Nemo universe.<br/><br/>Is it better then Finding Nemo? Of course not. It's an unwritten law that the sequel can't be better. But is it unnecessary( as some of my fellow reviewers claim)? Well, it is just as unnecessary as Finding Nemo, or any other film for that matter of fact. In other words, it's not. When I was walking home from the cinema, I too questioned the necessity of this film. I thought for a while and came to the conclusion that this film does what any film does ( and what most sequels don't do). It tells a story, it grips us with adventure,comedy and emotion, it expands the characters and adds new lovable ones. What is unnecessary about that? Isn't that why we got to the cinema- to be entertained and to be moved? <br/><br/>One reason why I believe this film has received negative reception amongst the older generation( I am too aware that there are many lovers of this film too, maybe more so than haters) is that they thought this film was made just for them. They thought that this will be the nostalgic hit made specifically for them. But that is not what films ( and especially Hollywood and animated films) do. They speak to everyone from everywhere. They communicate messages and emotions that all ages from all countries can understand ( provided that the correct subtitles are in place!) I saw posts on Facebook saying ""Parents: please don't take your kids to this film. I want to enjoy it. They won't understand the meaning of it!"" And I agreed to this, especially when I was sitting in a cinema half full of 18-25 years old and the other half full of little kids. But it wasn't until I heard the laughter of the children during the film and the smiles on their faces afterwards that I truly understood the purpose of this film. It was Pixars way of allowing the young people of this generation to enjoy what the last generation of young people enjoyed. And that's the magic of a Pixar film, and as I said before, it was a way of connecting the generations to help both generations understand each other's love for this ""universe"". To understand and feel the magic, laughter and hopefully, one day a shared nostalgia and love for this great animation company and its characters."
"nickpolsinelli","5","15","33","7 July 2016"," Very Underwhelming
","Finding Nemo is my one of my favorite movies of all time, so you can bet I was excited when I found out they were making a sequel. I was slightly skeptical, but once I found out Andrew Stanton was directing, I knew this would be more ""Toy Story 2"" rather than ""Cars 2"". I was expecting something amazing, something new. This was what I got.<br/><br/>The film is predictable at every turn. It's hard not to be predictable, but really? Also, plot conveniences are abundant. How is it that Dory just so happens to stumble across the aquarium she grew up in? Also, it takes two minutes, give or take, to get all the way from Australia to California? Finding Nemo took almost an entire movie to get from the Great Barrier Reef to Sydney. At least spend a few more minutes on the travel there.<br/><br/>Hank is a great character, but he is used unrealistically, even in Pixar terms. He drives a truck off the road! Pixar spent so much time animating him, yet they couldn't use him realistically. Also, Dory's memory problems get old very fast. In Finding Nemo, they added to her character, and actually added something to the plot. Here, it is used mainly for comedic purpose.<br/><br/>And that's another part of the film: it tries to be more of a comedy. Yes, Finding Nemo is a comedy, but it's controlled. Finding Dory is just...cheesy, to be honest. <br/><br/>I felt that we didn't need a sequel to Finding Nemo. In fact, I wish Pixar would stop making unnecessary sequels. I know they won't, because of the billions of dollars they receive every year from merchandising, but Pixar was built on quality animated movies. I'm disappointed they're making Toy Story 4, and...Cars 3. No one asked for those movies. But I am thoroughly excited for Incredibles 2, since the first movie left us on a cliffhanger back in 2004.<br/><br/>All in all, Finding Dory was unnecessary. It was cheesy, predictable, unrealistic, and didn't offer anything new. The only reason I'm giving it 5/10 stars is because of the animation. My god, is it beautiful. I hope they implement this level of animation on a better film. <br/><br/>5/10 - Recommended for children, and adults that aren't looking for a new ""Finding Nemo""<br/><br/>By the way, the short film before this one was awesome. The animation was spectacular. They need to make another ""Piper"" short film, because I want to see more of that bird."
"anonicalkiwi","2","6","11","5 February 2017"," Too unrealistic for my taste.
","The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky because I like birds. Saying it's a kids' movie doesn't cut it since adults watch the movie, too. And yes, they're talking fish, but against everything else, you might as well have put a rabbit in the water and gave it underwater-breathing powers with the way this film is structured. <br/><br/>Why would a solitary clownfish in the Great Barrier Reef know what California was, let alone where? How did he find the migrating turtles again and so easily? Why did they bring Nemo on the adventure? Not to mention, within the coast of California is a pocket of cold water that brings in sweet spawning fish but threatening temperatures to the tropical fish friends. Toxins and pH levels are a big thing for fish, and Marlin and Dory are no exceptions, so why California of all places? Wouldn't it have made sense to just create a fake aquarium in Australia and have the gang go there?<br/><br/>Octopi do have the ability to camouflage and stay out of water for periods of time, but the speed at which Hank moves is disturbing and too quick for a real octopus. At that point, we'd have lots of land-dwelling, rock-hopping octopi on our beaches, would't we? And there really was no point of Hank wanting to live his life out peacefully in a tank if he was going to die in a couple of years if he was lucky. Octopi sadly don't live very long despite their high intelligence. <br/><br/>Speaking of intelligence, how did Dory learn to read? Who taught her? If it was her parents, who taught them? Were there--pardon me--schools of fish to teach the English language? Dory also speaks whale, but Destiny is not a whale; she is a shark, a fish. she's also a fish that can leap completely out of an enclosure which doesn't make sense because she doesn't have the capability of swimming fast enough to gain enough velocity to propel her enormous weight out of said water. <br/><br/>I also feel bad because when it said Dory was part of the open ocean exhibit and I see all these fish bunched up in a tall column of water, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all of the sunfish, sharks, tuna, and turtles that obviously weren't crammed in the appropriate exhibit name. You couldn't even get the name of the exhibit right. Open ocean means open ocean, not claustrophobic tropical reef pipe. <br/><br/>Bailey's echolocation is over-powered. Echolocation doesn't work the same out of water as it does in the water. How did the sound travel so far and span out across a 360-degree area and feed into his brain fast enough for him to process the spatial awareness around him? <br/><br/>The water-hopping with Marlin and Nemo wasn't great, either. They went from cold California-hardened seawater to freshwater to mop water and then to fresh/seawater again. In the case that the changes in water didn't kill them, they would be very very sick. Also how is Nemo still a kid? It's been a year. ""He"" should have reached sexual maturity by now, and he should've matured into a she with the current (ha) conditions. <br/><br/>Why are Dory's parents still alive? Blue tangs need warm water to survive. How did they live in the cold California Pacific for that long? What about in winter when the temperatures and currents change? Pixar, your studio is a hop and a skip away to the ocean. What happened to consulting marine biologists on this? <br/><br/>Do people genuinely find it funny when an octopus and blue tang hijack a van with hundreds of fishy lives and pile it through busy traffic, potentially killing and harming dozens of innocent people? I'd hope not, but that's what I got from this movie. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, everyone followed them all the way back to the Great Barrier Reef. Beluga whales live in cold waters where their proper food spawn. Doesn't that put stress on Bailey? What if I threw the writers of this film into the Antarctic to join their penguin friends without proper equipment and told them to find food and shelter without any knowledge of the area? Is that heartwarming and entertaining? No.<br/><br/>The movie itself, was really bland. I almost envisioned the whole thing as a high-budget movie-based video game with smooth graphics. The areas are divided specifically like dungeons with obstacles and stealth sequences. However, nothing in the movie stood out to me in memory. I don't remember any dialogue being spoken from the characters, I had little care for the fish. <br/><br/>This movie didn't even feel like a movie. It's like they got middle-school writers to write a G-rated fan-fiction ""Finding Nemo"" adventure for their 4-year old sibling who wanted a story about Dory finding her parents because of a single exchange of dialogue uttered in the film. I think it was deliberately made because someone wanted to make another movie just because? I'm not sure, so don't take it seriously, but if that was the case, then it clearly shows. <br/><br/>The kids might like this film. Disney-blind consumers and Pixar enthusiasts might like it, but not me. I felt like I spent the course of 2 hours verbally criticizing this garbage with my family, and that, coupled with Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky's cameo, were the only forms of entertainment I got out of it all. Not the story, not the characters, and definitely not the writing or logic. Oh gosh, it was bad."
"AustinOswald","9","21","54","14 June 2016"," Unforgettable
","Finding Dory was truly unforgettable. The movie was absolutely incredible and one of Pixar's best. I honestly think that this was just as good or better than the original. The character development was absolutely incredible and Pixar reminded us of that periodically throughout the movie. The story was inspiring, funny, and very thoughtful. Following almost every single sentimental moment was a moment of pure joy and positivity. The scenes were filled with absolute breathtaking and blissful renderings. The characters seemed to move almost flawlessly and gracefully through the water. The animation was exceptional. Thomas Newman's score was obviously stunning. He reprised the score so well. Andrew Stanton definitely directed a beautiful movie and I'm sure fans of the Finding Nemo franchise will be immensely proud and grateful for it. This was definitely Pixar's best sequel and by far, one of the best Pixar movies ever created."

Dory is looking for her parents. If she were human, she would need constant supervision because her memory situation. She is supposedly capable of livings her life, but has no coping skills. I know this is an animated feature, but the very idea of finding her parents is so far-fetched, even to stretch the limits of this medium. Things are so contrived, including the whole business of quarantine and shipping fish to Cleveland and that octopus and so on, that I lost interest. Unlike the original movie, there was almost nothing funny here. Apparently Dory got older and bigger but Nemo is still a child and still the same size he was before. Has anyone asked about this? Visually, some of the movie was striking, but, when it was over, I didn't feel any emotion. There are so many superior animated features out there and Pixar didn't follow through on this one."

I honestly could not like this movie. The inconsistencies between, not only this movie and the first movie, but based upon just this movie... It was too much."

","Finding Nemo was a big hit with kids and adults alike and led to a surge of interest in clown-fish.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is set a year after the events of the first film, as the forgetful Dory, a blue tang fish gets flashbacks to her early fish years in Morro Beach, California and strives to find her parents.<br/><br/>Marlon and Nemo assist her but they soon become separated and a lot of the action is set in an Aquarium with narration by Sigourney Weaver. There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest.<br/><br/>It is clear to see how much the CGI animation has improved since Finding Nemo, but this sequel is less charming and also has less originality. Too many scenes are contrived so you see familiar faces or have Dory getting flashbacks with her parents. The finale with a truck chase sequence is just far fetched.<br/><br/>My kids enjoyed the movie and found parts of it emotional as well. Interest in clown-fish will still be around for a few more years."
"captisblue","2","5","9","23 December 2016"," (SPOILERS duh. . .) My review of Finding Dory
","I think it is blatantly obvious that this movie was hyped beyond belief. And, being one of the children who vastly adored Finding Nemo. I couldn't help but feel an immeasurable jolt of pure child-like excitement when the famous tune (spouted from our favorite tang's mouth every so often) ran through my head for the first time in years. And after viewing the movie with my cousin, close friend, and sister, I soon contemplated about what score I would give the movie out of ten. And, after deep thought, after trudging through every scene of the movie, finally, it hit me, this was actually one of Pixar's weakest films. It's just the original, but it's centered around the comic relief (which almost NEVER turns out well in most movies. . .) Ultimately, it was a bland, carbon copy of the first movie, with a cookie-cutter cast, an unoriginal plot that continuously loops due to Dory's talent. . . The ability to repeatedly lose track, have no idea where you are going, and then somehow be discovered by other characters. . . And, she isn't the only character that continuously milks this process, every character of the main trio is repeatedly lost and reunited with Dory. It became monotonous when the cycle was continued in the first film, so making a carbon copy, with a story based around the comedic relief, that repeats the same cycle of being lost and found will only make the dynamic of these movies more tedious and stretched.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo itself was sort of weak in certain aspects. It was overall a great movie, but there was no real way of creating a solid sequel. And creating a story revolving around the character who almost always forgets every thought a short while after registering them suddenly remembering something important after such a long time since the event transpired is kind of asinine. . .<br/><br/>The characters aren't really that special either. The most interesting one is an octopus. The rest are either annoying, or way too cookie cutter. . .<br/><br/>Dory somehow ascends to a new level of infuriating stupidity, while Marlin goes from the ""disturbed father character who's on edge due to the loss of a family member"" to ""and egocentric dickhead who repeatedly shames Dory over a condition that she has no control of."" Hell, the only character that still remained likable was the main character from the first film, Nemo, yes. . . Nemo. . . The annoying little clown fish whom we all secretly wished wasn't saved from the dentist's office, he is the most likable character of the main trio.<br/><br/>Something really ticks me off about how much attention this film was given, despite the sheer lack of any effort in the story telling department. Sure, the animation was stunning, but, when it comes to movies, visuals can't really make up for an awful story. Let's face it, if you skip to the movies for visuals alone, then you are probably not the most suitable person to judge quality. . .<br/><br/>This movie kind of sucked, and it felt like a waste of time. Though the animation and acting was great, that is all it had going for it, 2 out of 10 stars. . ."

","Those who loved ""Finding Nemo"" will anticipate some adventures under the water, which ""Finding Dory"" caters. Just like the previous film, which has gained a cult status, the animation and sequences are pretty marvelous. I guess it would be much more a lavish experience if you watch it on a big screen. It takes you to the world inside the water under the seas, pipes, aquariums, and buckets. Through the superb animation and a fast pace, it holds you and entertains you for its entire length. Though there is a lot of happenings in the film, it is not an improvement over ""Finding Nemo,"" in terms of story or characters. Dory lacks the charm spelled by Nemo; and it kinda drops to unbelievable clichés in the end. In comparison, ""Finding Nemo"" is still preferable.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 stars out of 4"

","Finding Dory had me in tears, and not just me, but several others in the theatres as well. Dory is a character that steals your heart without meaning to. In the first Finding Nemo, she is purely comic relief, but in Finding Dory, you really get to know her story. From her innocent upbringing with her family, to her separation from them, and her persistence in finding them. Dory isn't perfect, yes she is extremely naive, yes she is happy go lucky, and as one other reviewer describes, ""bumbles along,"" but she faces fears and anxiety just like everyone else. Does she like her predicament? No. Does it frustrate her? Yes. You see this time and time again in the movie. <br/><br/>But there is hope, and this is where the tearjerkers happen. Despite all the struggle, there is hope. Dory has friends, and somewhere out there she has family. It's a fun adventure from beginning to end, and it's fun for all ages. You also don't necessarily need to see Finding Nemo first to watch Finding Dory, although it does help, as there are some references to the first movie and some plot holes from the first movie that get filled in this one. <br/><br/>Loved Finding Dory. One of my all time favourite Disney films. 10/10."

","Finding Nemo was ground breaking. Not only was it considered one of the best animated films ever made, but it was universally loved by kids and adults alike. For years people begged and begged for a sequel, and now, here it is. Finding Dory. *sigh* I want to be able to tell you that this move hit the high expectation I held for it. I want to be able to tell you that this is a worthy successor to Finding Nemo, but it just isn't. What Finding Dory is, is an over-hyped mess. Granted, there are some pretty funny moments, and Ellen As Dory holds her own as the main actor of the film. But it really feels like Pixar didn't really care about making a good movie. I feel like, because this was such a long awaited film, Pixar knew whatever the outcome of the film, they were still going to make the cash. And at the end of the day, that's what it's really about. The characters are fine, and decently voiced. The story is okay, but drags after a while. the animation is definitely one of the better aspects of the film, but to wrap this up, overall Finding Dory is an average family film. It doesn't carry any of the magic that the first film had. There is nothing here to make me recommend this film, and I'm sad that this movie is getting such high praise when it truly isn't that great of a film."

","""Finding Dory"" has some stellar, heartfelt moments. I don't think the story is as interesting as Finding Nemo, but the movie is still great.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies ever, and I never thought it needed a sequel. After watching Finding Dory, I still don't think it needs to exist.<br/><br/>The beginning of the story is an easy example. The first several scenes of the movie re-live some of the major and minor moments of Finding Nemo. Every one of those scenes I like better in their Finding Nemo versions. The story gets more interesting after these initial boring scenes, and I thankfully had a huge investment in the story over the course of the film.<br/><br/>I liked the characters of this movie and didn't have a problem with them. But a friend reminded me of the profound impact the minor characters of Finding Nemo have on the story, themes, and humor. The characters in this movie are great, but against the unforgettable cast of Finding Nemo, they can't compete. So many scenes in Finding Nemo are brief, yet set up important lessons that drive home the theme of the movie. After watching Finding Dory once (not enough to give a final judgment), I can't say the same.<br/><br/>Crush the sea turtle and Nigel the pelican in Finding Nemo are better than their closest competitors in Finding Dory. Same for the major characters like the tank fish in Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The visual beauty didn't seem to be there. In Finding Nemo the first instrumental on the soundtrack is called ""Wow"". There's hardly any Wow in Finding Dory. The story doesn't facilitate much beauty with the locations it's set in. Part of this is my bias. Early on, some fish are in a kelp forest. I prefer a colorful coral reef instead of a dark green kelp forest submerged in dark green water.<br/><br/>Maybe awesome visuals don't need to be in this movie. Finding Nemo still exists, and Pixar just made The Good Dinosaur. But what should fill in that gap is still lacking. Story, characters, theme, etc.."

","It's not as good as the first one, but it's a nice follow up. This isn't one of Pixar's film that will become a classic. But it's a movie that kids will have a lot of fun with and is watchable for adults. It isn't a Pixar movie with a lot of depth, deep meaning and messages when it comes to the story. But it's a simple and yet creative movie about Dory who has short-term memory trying to find her parents. With the help of her friends and acquaintances. Sure it can get tedious at times and it isn't a movie I would watch over and over again. But what makes this simple movie work is it's creativity and the situations the fishes and other sea animals gets into. And creative ways they go about it when trying to get out of danger and finding their way to certain locations. This isn't a sequel that I felt was necessary but it doesn't take anything away either.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

The story is paper thin weak: Dory suddenly remembers that she had parents and misses them, goes to meet them, finds her old house in like 5 minutes, even though ""it's on the other side of the ocean"", and then the movie spends all its time with the characters missing each other in this big aquarium facility while I was checking my watch.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","8","19","2 August 2016"," A worthy sequel to a great film
","'Finding Nemo' to me has always been one of Pixar's best, colourful, imaginative, hilarious and poignant with great characters (who cannot love Bruce the shark, plus Dory speaking whale is one of Pixar's funniest moments).<br/><br/>Pixar have been hit and miss since 'Up', with some great films like 'Toy Story 3' and 'Inside Out' (which are two of my favourites from the studio) and some disappointments like 'Cars 2' and 'The Good Dinosaur' (don't hate them as much as many others do though, also didn't think 'Brave' was that bad, though it was not the best animated film that year, and liked 'Monsters University'). While it is not as good as 'Finding Nemo', 'Finding Dory' is a worthy sequel and one of their better efforts since 'Up'.<br/><br/>The film does meander in places with occasional draggy pacing and a couple of rather too convenient plot devices, and Dory's memory loss shtick does get repetitive quickly that it does grate too early on. However, the animation is wonderful with an even richer colour palette perhaps than 'Finding Nemo' and matches that film in meticulous detail and visual imagination. The music score is rousing, whimsical and nuanced.<br/><br/>Where Pixar has always excelled at its best is the balance and execution of humour and pathos. Humour and pathos are balanced deftly in 'Finding Dory', with the humour hilarious and in abundance and the pathos bringing genuine tears and emotional power. The story is flawed and doesn't have the imagination or originality of 'Finding Nemo', but the energy, humour and emotion shine through more than brightly and one does relate to Dory in her quest, one that anybody can relate to if in her situation.<br/><br/>Good characters always help and actually are crucial in making a film work. 'Finding Dory' has them, not just Dory, who has lost none of her comic timing but moves the viewer as well, or Marlin and Nemo who bring sweetness and poignancy to the story, but also the scene stealing seals and gleefully entertaining Hank who provides many great moments. One does miss Bruce though. The voice acting is terrific, with Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neill being particularly spot on.<br/><br/>To conclude, 'Finding Nemo' is a great film, this reviewer found 'Finding Dory' to be a worthy sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"koopmanleah","10","3","5","25 February 2017"," Finding Dory
","The well-known character from Disney's Finding Nemo has now finally gotten her own spotlight. Dory, the funniest fish in the ocean thanks to her voice actress Ellen DeGeneres, is able to take on another adventure. The movie also features all the other past characters that everyone fell in love with from the start. This film is amazing because of how well the voice actors portray the characters, the emotions it brings to the audience, and its animation.<br/><br/>The voice actors in Finding Dory do more than an excellent job with making the animated characters come alive. The hilarious Ellen DeGeneres has once again impressed her audience in creating the amazing character that Dory is. While there are many characters that are familiar from Finding Nemo, there are new and unfamiliar ones that are great additions to the movie as well. There are many flashbacks in the film that refer back to Dory as a young girl. This adorable little fish was voice-acted by Sloane Murray, who does an exquisite job of making the audience fall in love with little Dory. Co-stars from the hit TV show Modern Family, Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill make the voices of new characters Bailey and Hank. Aside from Bailey, another whale that is unknown is Destiny, voiced by Kaitlyn Olson. All of these amazing and hilarious voice actors are crucial to making Finding Dory a great film.<br/><br/>There are many emotional, happy, and funny moments throughout the entire film that help make it a great story. Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane made sure to always make Dory's disability of short-term memory loss apparent from beginning to end of the movie, which sparks emotion for the audience. Finding Dory is a great especially for the younger audience in the fact that it teaches friendship, teamwork, and that your family is one of the most important things in life. It teaches that just because you have a disability doesn't mean that you can't do anything you set your mind to and you can still achieve many things in life. It also encourages risk- taking and not to be afraid of doing something just because you wouldn't normally do it. Watching this movie gives you the idea to not just sit around and do nothing for the rest of your life and to make the best of it. Reminiscing on Dory's past life makes Finding Dory that much better. Knowing what she had to go through and remembering things to help her through her journey are heart-warming and good life lessons to teach the audience. <br/><br/>The animation in this film was indescribable. Its vibrant colors makes the film look very clear. Pixar never disappoints and they do an amazing job with modernizing cartoon's and fictional characters to make them more fun to watch. The beauty of the ocean's creatures and the beautiful colors that they use bring the movie to life moves Pixar to the next level. Even though prior to the sequel in the movie Finding Nemo, which was released in 2003, the characters still look and sound exactly the same. This is something that many movies and television shows lack as time goes on. It brings back the memory of Finding Nemo and the amazing characters that everyone knows and loves but adds in some hilarious ones to the mix that makes this movie different yet unforgettable.<br/><br/>All in all, the film Finding Dory is a must-see. It is very hard to find negative things about it and Pixar has exceeded itself once again. It is hard not to fall in love with the beautifully animated characters and the amazing voice-actors that we all love. Great movie."
"CinemaClown","Null","9","23","26 June 2016"," Did We Really Need A Sequel To Finding Nemo? No. Am I Glad That It Exists? Yes.
","Finding Nemo was love at first sight. It was a breathtaking, bewitching & beautifully balanced underwater adventure that didn't just dazzle viewers around the globe with its emotionally rich tale about parenting, friendship, trust & determination but also cemented Pixar's position as a pioneer of quality cinema and a powerhouse of originality, creativity, imagination & groundbreaking computer animation. Add to that, it is still counted amongst the greatest achievements of animation filmmaking.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I never wanted a sequel to Finding Nemo. That classic is perfect in every way, and I believed its sequel to be an unnecessary risk that would end up denting the legacy of the original. And yet, a part of me is pleased that it exists because Andrew Stanton has crafted this follow-up chapter with same passion, heart & dedication with which he crafted the first one. By all means, Finding Dory is no match to the original but then it also is no cash-grab sequel like Cars 2 was. There's a sense of déjà-vu in this tale but it also brims with just enough freshness to qualify as a welcome successor to a beloved masterpiece.<br/><br/>Set one year after the events of the first film, the story of Finding Dory follows Dory, the regal blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss who starts having fragmented dreams & flashbacks of her life before she met Marlin & Nemo, and ultimately decides to find her family. Heading to the place where she vaguely remembers having seen her parents last, Dory is caught by volunteers of a Marine Life Institute and is put into the quarantine section where she meets a seven-legged red octopus named Hank, who agrees to take her to her loved ones in exchange for something. Meanwhile, Marlin & Nemo try to get into the institute in an attempt to rescue Dory.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton (best known for Finding Nemo & WALLE), Finding Dory opens with a flashback segment that introduces us to our titular character as an infant, covers her separation from her family, and then follows her journey over the years until she finally meets Marlin for the first time. And this opening sequence wonderfully sets the stage for the rest of the picture as Stanton sensibly addresses the themes of family, separation & identity, returns to Dory's childhood whenever possible, and although it results in some sort of fractured narrative, it also influences the next set of events that unfold afterwards, thus working in favour of the story.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliantly penned down as well, for it retains the heart, soul & wit of the original, while adding more emotional weight & depth to our forgetful fish. While it is more melancholic than its predecessor, that element isn't overused and the story remains a fun-filled entertainer throughout its runtime. The oceanic life is revisited only briefly since majority of its plot unfolds in a marine institute, and yet the fauna beneath the sea is gorgeously rendered & meticulously detailed. It also adds an ample amount of new characters with Dory promoted to lead role while both Marlin & Nemo settle for a seat behind a couple of fresh arrivals amongst whom Hank leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Jaw-dropping 3D animation has always been Pixar's default setting from the start and this aspect remains unchanged with Finding Dory as the animators have done a terrific job once again, whether it's the underwater backgrounds, character designs or overall rendering of even the most minute details. Camera is splendidly utilised, images make use of all the vivid colours available in the palette, while pixel-perfect lighting gives it a more vibrant appearance. Editing skilfully interweaves Dory's past & present into an easily accessible storyline although the trimming of a few slow patches in the middle would have resulted in a more rigid narrative structure as well as improved pacing.<br/><br/>As always the case with Pixar films, the voice cast for new characters is wisely chosen while the reprising cast exhibits no trouble in immersing themselves into their given roles. Ellen DeGeneres was easily the standout in Finding Nemo and she is easily the standout in Finding Dory, for her character gets to play with deeper emotions this time without discarding her good-hearted, optimistic & delightfully charming persona. Rest of the supporting characters, both reprising & new play their part convincingly, And last but not the least, Thomas Newman contributes with a calm, touching & emotionally resonant score that stays within the realm of the original.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Finding Dory is undoubtedly an accomplished sequel despite falling short of matching the greatness of its predecessor. Stanton's decision to go for a fresh & organic storyline instead of rehashing the same stuff is commendable and although not every attempt at humour works out in its favour, it remains a joyful ride from start to finish that will amuse both kids & adults alike. Did we really need a sequel to Finding Nemo? No. Is its existence justified? Somewhat. Am I glad that it exists? Yes. It doesn't take away anything from the original but it strengthens Pixar's position by a great deal, while simultaneously conveying to us that it is still capable of churning out sequels that are more than mere cash-grabs. Nostalgic, poignant & hilarious in rhythmic doses, Finding Dory marks yet another win for Pixar Animation Studios on critical, commercial & emotional scale. Highly recommended."

","""Finding Dory"" is more of the same...which will no doubt thrill children and audiences of the original, ""Finding Nemo"". But, for folks like me who are NOT big fans of sequels, there also is more of the same.<br/><br/>The film is set before, during and mostly after the adventures that Nemo and his father went through in the previous film. Oddly, while Dory has no attention span and not real memory, she inexplicably kinda remembers her early life and goes off in search of her parents. Nemo and Dad go along to help and a bunch of new friends help Dory to achieve her dream.<br/><br/>The film is a lazy product...a sequel which is enjoyable but introduces nothing substantially new. There's nothing offensive about it at all but I cannot understand folks being excited about it because the film is mostly by the numbers and takes few chances.

"johnkindall1","8","8","20","2 July 2016"," Worth the Ticket
","Historically, Pixar Animation Studios isn't known for its sequels. The Toy Story films aside, the California based production company has almost always found more critical success with an fresh, original idea than with second or third iterations. Films like Monsters University and Cars 2 feel as if they miss a certain spark that make their predecessors so iconic. While Finding Dory faces a few of these same problems, it is for the most part, a fun and enjoyable return to the reef. <br/><br/>Set one year after the events of Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory begins by telling the childhood tale of the titular blue tang and her parents, as well as their subsequent separation. Done in such a way that makes very clear that this is indeed Dory's story, the opening minutes are very reminiscent of Up: they set the emotional tone of the entire work. As the adventure to reunite Dory and her parents begins to unfold, flashbacks return the viewer to wide-eyed baby Dory and her childhood experiences. The flashbacks feel needed, and they rarely intrude or interrupt. They add an emotional backbone, one that explores feelings and sentiments that the first film did not. <br/><br/>Despite being released thirteen years after Finding Nemo, the characters in Finding Dory feel fresh as ever. All of the returning characters look and sound the same (even if, as it was in Nemo's case, the voice actor has changed) and they act and react the same as they would in any scene from the first film. Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role to a tee, as do all of the returning voices. It's an achievement that should not be overlooked; recreating characters to the near perfect degree that Pixar has done in this film is a feat for the sequel business. The fact that it was done more than a decade after the original is equally impressive.<br/><br/>While all the characters return in stunning form, I often found myself wondering if some needed to return at all. While I did enjoy their scenes, the sections featuring Mr. Ray or Crash felt a bit too much like a nostalgic merchandise move to be ignored. These scenes are sparse however, and I suspect it only feels like a problem because the new cast of characters shine so brightly. While Ed O'Neil's Hank and Kaitlin Olson's Destiny (an octopus and whale shark respectively) are standouts, every new creature the clown-fish/tang trio comes across adds their own degree of character and wit to the film. <br/><br/>This is where Finding Dory shines its brightest. When it's allowed to forge new ideas and a fresh story, the narrative soars and the jokes land. The ""annoyed teenager"" dynamic between Marlin and Nemo is particularly well done. But, while the film does have its fair share of emotional moments, there is a certain sentimental attachment that is missing. As I watched Finding Nemo I cared, deeply and truly, about whether or not the father and son were reunited. I anxiously awaited that moment when it would finally happen. As I watched Finding Dory, the only thing I found myself waiting for was the next joke. And, while they did indeed make me grin and chortle, hilarity can only carry Finding Dory so far. All too similar to Pixar's other sequels, that all important spark is missing. The lamp light doesn't shine quite as bright. <br/><br/>The animation work and sound design is top notch, and I was once again reminded why Pixar is the best in the business. The uncanny ability to add human-like emotion to the face of a clown-fish or octopus is still outstanding thirteen years later. The swirls of fish alongside new locales and marine life make Finding Dory a delightful underwater feast for the eyes. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is definitely worth the watch. In typical Pixar fashion, viewers of different ages will walk away with different favorite moments. It's funny, it's immersive, and, despite missing an emotional resonance of the first film, it's genuine. And, while five years from now it will more than likely still be the original that you pull down from the shelf, this sequel should not be missed."
"chiehyinkuo","3","4","8","4 December 2016"," Okay film
","This movie does not deserve 94% on rotten tomatoes nor does it deserved a 7.6 on IMDb. It should be more like a 6. I was deeply disappointed in this movie because the movie was boring. I was expecting a movie like Toy story 2 and 3, where you feel like you grew up with the movie or have a strong connection with the main characters. Like how I felt when watching Finding Nemo, I had a strong connection with Nemo's dad and emphasize with him when he was trying to find Nemo. Every conflict that Nemo's dad faced was totally unexpected. However, finding dory I pretty much expect a lot of thing that was going to happen. I really didn't have any attachment to any of the character. There were some emotionally scene but it really didn't moved me at all. Overall, the movie is very average where you watch and then forget about it. <br/><br/>The movie is not a memorable so that is it's geared mostly toward elementary kids .My five-year-old brother really like it and maybe that was because there was a lot of actions that made him excited."

","I was seven years old when 'Finding Nemo' came out, and now I am twenty... Wow does time go by fast. <br/><br/>I used to watch this film nearly every day and never get sick of it. The sea has always been a fascination with me, and so I naturally loved the film because of it; with it's breath- taking animation, details to every underwater creature, laugh out loud moments mixed in with the perfect amount of emotion felt throughout. It was just another amazing Pixar film, but my personal favorite.<br/><br/>When I found out about the sequel years later, I was excited, but skeptical. Dory is of course my favorite character, so I liked the idea of her being the main character this time around. <br/><br/>Pixar in general doesn't fail to impress people with their surprisingly good sequels. 'Toy Story' 2 and 3 somehow surpassing the first, 'Monsters University' wasn't as great as the first, but it definitely had the familiar Pixar charm to it, and I really enjoyed it, but...there was one that fans were not pleased with: 'cars 2.' Though to be fair, I didn't really care for the first film either. <br/><br/>Anyway, this film is definitely in-between the 'Toy Story' sequels and 'Monsters University', where it is an amazing film and sequel with even better animation, likable new characters, some very heart-felt scenes, but of course not as amazing as the first movie, but I already figured that.<br/><br/>Like I said, the animation was somehow even more improved in this movie from the first (which looked beautiful in 3D). The park itself surprisingly looked quite real.<br/><br/>The characters old and new were memorable, funny, and each had their moments. And to me, Dory being the main character actually worked well unlike Mator in 'Cars 2.' You cared about her journey...and who doesn't like Dory? <br/><br/>The emotion? Oh jeez, don't get me started on that. As if tearing up from nostalgia wasn't enough, the movie can make you cry a river at times...or 'ocean' if you will. Luckily I brought tissues. I especially love how it carries another message about family like the first film. That to me is where the heart is.<br/><br/>The humour was also fun. Some miss, but mostly hits! <br/><br/>Overall, this film luckily did not disappoint. Me, my mom, aunt, and cousin all loved it. No it's not as great as the first, but it's pretty hard to compete with the wonders of 'Finding Nemo.' It's still a spectacular kid's film, Pixar film, and sequel. I highly recommend it! <br/><br/>Overall: 9.5/10"

While the movie has plenty of funny parts, and the animation is amazing, it doesn't seem all that memorable or like they really covered new ground from the first film.<br/><br/>And it is not just because it is a sequel. Some would argue that ""Toy Story 3"" was the best in that series. I doubt anyone could argue that ""Dory"" was anywhere near as good as ""Nemo"". If it weren't for some interesting new supporting character, it would have been quite a rehash. Dory, the protagonist, is not really all that interesting."

There are times where I feel this film falls on some weak and simple plot movements--but that is why it likely fared poorly during awards season. This is a good film, Nemo was a great film.

","Finding Dory had the potential to be annoying, and for a certain amount of time, it feels almost laborious due to Dory's memory loss being played for effect numerous times before her long term memory kicks into gear. Once it does, the movie takes off. Dory pulls Marlin and Nemo along with her to meet another batch of interesting and funny sea creatures, as she learns where she came from, how she got lost, and where her parents got off to. It's a terrific kids movie, and has enough emotional depth to stay interesting for the adults, especially those who were kids when Finding Nemo was out in 2003, and felt the fear and apprehension of Marlin as he and Dory hunted for his lost son.<br/><br/>There will probably not be another one of these movies, but that's fine. The story is superb, the characters are diverse and fun, and there's plenty of bright colors and beautiful visuals to go around. It's heart is, undeniably, in the right place, with new, amazing side characters that has become expected from Pixar. It just never achieves the highest emotional impact on me, like I felt many previous Pixar films have had. Pixar is great at making animated movies that have more to them than just simple kids stuff, and they've proved that over and over. It's no accident that this movie is the highest grossing animated film of all time. ---From Yidioo"

","Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first."

"Animated_Antic","10","2","3","10 April 2017"," The best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3.
","After ""Toy Story 3"" was released back in 2010, Pixar has started to put out more and more follow ups to their previous critically acclaimed films this decade. I loved the aforementioned ""Toy Story 3"", loathed ""Cars 2"" and thought ""Monsters University"" was pretty good, but not as great as the first film. So, I really didn't know what to expect with ""Finding Dory"", the sequel to one of my favorite animated movies ""Finding Nemo."" I was nervous thinking it was just going to be a film that was going to be on par with Pixar's previous film ""The Good Dinosaur"", but at the same time I was excited hoping it would be as fun and clever as ""Inside Out"". And luckily enough, it was another winning movie from Pixar. ""Finding Dory"" is a great sequel that keeps up the excitement, makes you guess where the film is going to go, and is just straight up fun and funny.<br/><br/>One year has passed from the previous film, and out favorite short-term memory loss fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), finally remembers something, her family. With the location being at ""the Jewel of Morro Bay, California"", she set outs with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (now played by Hayden Rolence) to go find her parents. When they arrive off the coast in California, Dory is captured by marine biologists and taken to a marine life institute. While she's in quarantine, she meets a very grumpy octopus, no wait a minute, septapus as he has lost a tentacle, named Hank (Ed O'Neill). She asks him to help her find her family in the institute in exchange for a tag the biologists have placed on her which would take her to an aquarium in Cleveland. Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo are trying to figure out how to get inside the institute to find Dory through any crazy means possible.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Finding Dory"", like most Pixar movies is the story. It's crazy fun. It's exciting, funny, emotional, suspenseful, and keeps you guessing the whole way through which is what I really expect for a movie. The animation is also a great part of the film. Just like the first movie, it's beautiful. The colors are eye popping, the underwater world is mysterious, and the institute looks like a very nice place to visit. The characters once again are to many to count. Ellen DeGeneres is great as usual, Albert Brooks is pretty great, and I especially love Ed O'Neill as Hank. This octopus can blend into almost everything, which leads to some real funny comedy. Oh yeah, speaking of the comedy, this movie is hilarious. I think I was bawling my eyes out from laughing hard at this movie and I nearly got hiccups laughing too hard. The emotion is also where it needs to be. Some scenes in this movie can be tear jerker. Even though I didn't cry watching movies, I was very close to doing so watching this film.<br/><br/>Personally, ""Finding Dory"" is the best Pixar sequel since ""Toy Story 3"". No doubt in my mind. It could be as good if not even better than ""Finding Nemo"". I am dead serious. I really love this film. It's great. I can probably go on forever praising this movie, but I probably shouldn't. All I can say is go check it out. Trust me. It really is worth your time."
"TheFirstExecutioner","7","8","21","18 June 2016"," A Fun Pixar Sequel
","Finding Dory is the long awaited sequel and takes place a year after the amazing Finding Nemo. This time, Dory is the protagonist and she's pretty enjoyable to watch. The story follows Dory trying to find her estranged family and parents with the help of a ton of new characters like Hank the octopus and 2 whales named Destiny and Bailey. <br/><br/>This movie is a ton of fun and extremely funny throughout. The humor is funny for both adults and kids. The new characters bring a fresh breath of air to this franchise. However, the story really has no reason for including Marlin and Nemo for as long as they were in the film. They were both pretty much following Dory on her adventures the entire time. Also, the pacing and tone aren't grounded at all and it constantly switches between humor and serious drama. My last criticism is that the movie is not as emotional as it wants to be when watching it. The movie wants you to shed a tear but because of the inconsistent tone, you can't. Nonetheless, this is a fun sequel to Finding Nemo with a solid story, fun characters, and great humor.<br/><br/>Overall, Finding Dory is an enjoyable film for adults and kids to watch and it has a lot of great things in it. I don't think it's even close to as good as its predecessor but it is a generally entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Finding Dory gets a B+."

The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.<br/><br/>Most importantly though is the story. Dory's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.<br/><br/>As an aside, I had avoided seeing this one until I had finally seen Finding Nemo and while I would recommend seeing Nemo, Finding Dory does stand alone as it's own film."

"nmholland","7","9","25","18 June 2016"," A Slight Let Down, But Good As A Whole
","Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and is Pixar's latest sequel, following up to 2003's Finding Nemo. In this film, Dory begins to envision flashbacks of her childhood, including her parents and activities she would do with them. She remembers where she used to live, and, along with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (Hayden Rolence), swim across the ocean once again to find her long lost family.<br/><br/>After 13 years of waiting, I was pretty pumped for Finding Dory, despite the underwhelming trailers. However, from the trailers, there were a few things to look forward to, such as the, once again, amazing voice acting, bright, vivid animation, and intriguing quest to find Dory's parents. Although I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help leaving the theater somewhat disappointed. There were more than a few elements that I felt could've been done better, despite the film being good as a whole.<br/><br/>The best thing about Finding Dory has got to be the voice acting, specifically the lines delivered by the voice of Dory herself - Ellen DeGeneres. If anyone were to ask me what I would consider as a perfect blend between voice actor and character, I wouldn't hesitate to give them my answer, that being Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, from both Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016). DeGeneres brings a hilariousness, as well as a sincerity, to the character of Dory, completely bringing this character to life.<br/><br/>Most of the other voice acting was pretty great too. Albert Brooks reprises his role of Marlin, the clown fish, and Hayden Rolence has taken over as Nemo on behalf of Alexander Gould, whose voice has changed since his turn as the character in '03. The film introduces a few new characters as well, such as Destiny, the near- sighted whale, voiced by Kaitlin Olson, and the beluga whale named Bailey, who can't echolocate due to a past injury, voiced by Ty Burrell. However, my favorite of all the supporting characters was that of the octopus escapee named Hank, voiced by Ed O'Neill, whose hidden care for Dory and her ultimate goals was expressed greatly through his brilliant character arc throughout the entire run time of the film.<br/><br/>The animation - need I say - is produced by Pixar, therefore it looks incredible. Each and every fish (that matters) pops out on the screen exactly as the animators want them to. Each time the audience is supposed to see something important, we see it, thanks to the fantastic animation team working on Finding Dory. All of the colors magnificently stand out from the overall bland backgrounds, and make the film look astounding.<br/><br/>My main complaint with the film is the pacing of timed events. Every once in awhile, the film finds itself standing still for a good few minutes, before it begins to pick up again. These stuck-in-the-mud moments are usually supposed to be emotional ones, which, I oddly didn't connect with too much, which is strange to say about a Pixar film (without ""Cars"" in the title, at least). The pacing wasn't the greatest, and seemed to drag the film down a bit, which was disappointing.<br/><br/>Another problem I found in Finding Dory was the elements it took from its predecessor, that being Finding Nemo (2003). Much like the 2010 film Toy Story 3, many elements depend on the nostalgia of the viewer. Being a child when Finding Nemo came out, I should've been struck with nostalgia when watching Finding Dory. However, I decided to take off my nostalgia goggles for this one, and was surprised by how much the film relies on the nostalgia of the audience. Although it isn't a huge issue, the similarities between this plot and Finding Nemo's stood out quite a bit.<br/><br/>The last complaint I have with the film, which is a small one, is the lack of characters from the first film showing up in this one. We get to see a bit of Crush (Andrew Stanton) and his son Squirt (Bennett Dammann), Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), and a glimpse of Gill (Willem Dafoe) and his friends, but no other original characters show up in Finding Dory. Personally, I would've liked to see Bruce and his shark friends, more of Gill, and even a bit more of Crush; his appearance was more of a cameo. The film spent too much time developing a multitude of new characters that it forgot to include the older ones, it seems.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy Finding Dory, it just wasn't as good as Finding Nemo, which is one of Pixar's best. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first film, because you will appreciate it."

","'FINDING DORY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The sequel to the blockbuster Pixar hit 'FINDING NEMO'. It once again stars the voice talents of Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks. It was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane; and it was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson and Victoria Strouse (Stanton also co-directed and co-wrote the original movie). The story, this time, revolves around the amnesiac Dory, as she goes on a quest to find her parents. I don't think it's as good a film as the original; or nearly as great as the best of Pixar. <br/><br/>The film picks up shortly after the events of the original movie. Nemo (Hayden Rolence) is now safely, and happily, living with his father, Marlin (Brooks). Dory (DeGeneres) still lives with them as well, but she also still longs to reunite with her parents. After a sudden flashback, Dory decides to go on a quest to find them. Nemo and Marlin go with her.<br/><br/>I think it's a little odd for the filmmakers to have made a sequel, to 'FINDING NEMO', that has such a little amount of Nemo in it. He's also voiced by a different actor (due to the fact that the original actor matured so much). Dory is an interesting, and entertaining, character though; and DeGeneres is the biggest star, of the original movie, to market the film as your lead with. So I understand Disney's (and Pixar's) financial motives. Even with these doubts, I still had high hopes. I was sadly disappointed. It is still a visually stunning, and funny, film though. But the story (and adventure of it) didn't intrigue me that much. I also was expecting a lot more heart.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_3w7EWxV5vg"

","We were both 50/50 on this movie. It could have very easily flopped. Good news is it never does that. While it is not perfection it definitely is a worthy sequel. All the voice cast return (excluding Alexander Gould, who would be too old to voice Nemo now.) Ellen Degeneres returns to do the voice of the annoying, but lovable Dory, Albert Brooks returns to voice Marlin. In this one, however, Marlin and Nemo are both supporting actors and just there to give Dory a helping hand whenever she loses her memory or is in trouble. Dory is the lead this time round.<br/><br/>We all know the plot...Dory trying to find her parents. The film does introduce us to brand new characters, including the self centered, cranky octopus by the name of Hank (voiced by Ed O Neil). Let's not forget about Dory's lovable, childhood whale friend. All of them get plenty of screen time and no one gets little screen time.<br/><br/>The film has loads of flashbacks to Dory's childhood and how he struggled to fit in with the crowd, but at the same time did not care about her short term memory loss problem and loved just being happy and had no plan and would just do whatever she wanted and whatever came her way.<br/><br/>We all knew it wasn't going to be the classic ""Finding Nemo."" However, it's a very worthy sequel. Funny, heart warming, and very charming. Take the kids and family to watch it, you'll have a great time. 4/5 stars. 8/10- Autistic Reviewers."
"thependragonscribe","Null","8","22","16 June 2016"," Spotlight is now on everybody's favorite forgetful fish in this lovable sequel to ""Finding Nemo""
","""Finding Nemo"" is really one of Pixar's best efforts. So a followup to the 2003 undersea adventure would really set a lot of standard. For that, I'm proud to say that its sequel, ""Finding Dory"", is not as bad as I expected it to be. In fact, it is actually great.<br/><br/>Well, part of the skepticism I had for this followup to ""Nemo"" is that it centers on the predecessor's instant scene stealer Dory. To admit, Ellen Degeneres truly made the lovable blue tang as an iconic character as she is now. And to turn the spotlight to a forgetful comic relief does show corporate cynicism for Pixar, as demonstrated by ""Cars 2"". At least that's my first reaction to a sequel to ""Nemo"" that centers on Dory. More than thankfully, Dory makes up for another compelling adventure, with Marlin (a game Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence), in search of her parents as she retrieves memory of them from her birthplace in a Morro Bay marine reserve. Kudos to Ellen for bringing heart to every funny, tearful and motivating moment.<br/><br/>There are new characters along the adventure, like Destiny (an enthusiastic Kaitlin Olson) and Bailey (a clumsy Ty Burrell). But the definite breakout is Hank the octopus or septopus (a gallant Ed O'Neill), who provides an undeniable presence of a scarred but redeemed character. Though his back story is kind of vague (an octopus who wants to stay in captivity), the mollusk is more than interesting, and a great companion to Ellen's beloved blue tang. Just the animation of its design and movements is something Pixar has always stepped up to create.<br/><br/>Always a Pixar standard is its quality animation as not only the ocean became the main attraction, but also the detail of the so-called ""jewel of Morro Bay, California"". Andrew Stanton and team are really aware of the environment they are in. Kind of reminds me of ""Jurassic World"" of how life size the attraction is. Also, watch out for sudden twists and turns, just a showcase of how unique the movie is.<br/><br/>Though this may not be as momentous as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Finding Dory"" is still a worthy continuation of the adventures of everybody's favorite clownfish and forgetful blue tang. Pixar finally gave us a fine sequel to their property. And I am sure to hold hopes for their next film""Cars 3"". Hmm.<br/><br/>Ellen, you deserve the movie you took years of campaigning."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","5","12","22 November 2016"," Superb Sequel
","I've always said that I'm a sucker for a good animated Disney film. Not so much the social commentary films but the out and out kid friendly movies. When FINDING NEMO came out I didn't see it in the theater thinking it wasn't my kind of movie. I've grown more accepting of the computer animated films from Disney and Pixar. When I finally did see it I was stunned at the clarity of picture, the vast array of colors and how involved I became in the story. I'm happy to say that the sequel, FINDING DORY, lives up to that first films high standards.<br/><br/>If you forgot who Dory was she was a blue fish with a problem of short term memory loss. She bumped into Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo's father, and ended up helping him rescue his son Nemo. The movie opens with us learning Dory's story, how she was a little girl and had a mother and father who loved her but who got lost from them. After searching for some time her path intersects with Marlin as we saw in the first film. It's now a year later and Dory lives with Marlin and Nemo and yes, still suffers from that short term memory loss. But something is happening.<br/><br/>Dory begins to have flashes of her life before Marlin and Nemo, memories of her parents. She wants to find them and longs to see them but they're miles away. With a little help from Nemo she finally convinces Marlin, the ever worrisome homebody, to help her get to California where she thinks they live.<br/><br/>Of course the usual happens with Marlin and Nemo getting separated from Dory once they arrive. Their stories run different paths with them nearly finding one another several times. The location that Dory recalls is a marine life park with various area to explore. Dory is caught up in the plastic loops of a six pack tossed in the sea and then rescued by workers from the park. She gets tagged to be shipped to Cleveland to their aquarium there and it seems all is lost.<br/><br/>But then she gets help from a grouchy octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill). He wants to leave the park and go on the truck to Cleveland and tells her to give him the tag she now has on her fin. She agrees if he will help her find her parents. Off the duo goes trying to find the right spot and Dory's folks. And it is the antics of not just Dory but of Hank who uses his ability to camouflage himself in some hilarious moments.<br/><br/>While Dory is off with Hank, Marlin and Nemo get help from a pair of sunbathing sea lions on a rock outside of the park. Their adventure sets off with a whacked out bird picking them up in a bucket of water and trying to get them to the quarantine area where Dory would have been taken, of course unaware that she is in the midst of leaving there. Will they ever find one another? And more importantly will they find Dory's parents? Once again the movie offers us some amazing rich visuals to look at. All of the underwater scenes in the ocean are breathtaking, even if computer generated. The flow of images is so flawless that you'll forget it's animated at times. It is a glowing sea of color and movement that makes you wonder where to look next. Computer animation has grown leaps and bounds over the past few decades.<br/><br/>But none of that would matter if there wasn't a story that was worth being interested in as well. The answer is yes, it does offer just such a story. The sense of loss, the fear of the unknown, the hope that Dory will find her parents still waiting for her has you cheering her on and rooting for her to overcome her short term memory loss enough to reach her home. Along the way you also begin to realize that while Dory may have her problems and a slight attention issue, she actually remembers more than she gives herself credit for.<br/><br/>If you were ever lost as a child in a department store or grocery store then you can relate to the emotions of Dory as she tries to find her parents. It is a story that all children can relate to and the child within each of us can relate to as well. This movie entertains, captures your imagination and delights the eye from start to finish. You can't ask much more of a movie with the name Disney attached to it."
"SquigglyCrunch","4","4","9","24 November 2016"," Hopelessly Generic, Forced, and Meaningless
","Finding Dory follows the events of 2003's Finding Nemo, where this time Dory goes on a journey in search of her lost parents, whom she forgot about until now. <br/><br/>The movie on occasion made me laugh. It was funny from time to time, but not funny enough to be considered much of a comedy. <br/><br/>I really hated how rushed this movie was. I thought the trailers seemed rushed with getting into the main plot, and I hoped the movie wouldn't be like that. And yet it was. Mere minutes into the movie Dory remembered her parents and was immediately swimming out after them. It was incredibly rushed, unlike it's predecessor, and came off incredibly forced. <br/><br/>The movie tries to be funny and connected to it's prequel by referencing it a lot. Sometimes the references were subtle and fun, but most of the time it's just Marlon saying ""I have bad memories with that"" instead of having actually well-thought out dialogue that directly connect the two movies. Marlon often came off forced because of this, like he existed for connection. <br/><br/>Speaking of Marlon, I wish he and Nemo weren't in this movie. Dory's story was vastly more interesting, Marlon and Nemo just kind of showed up to take the audience out of Dory's story to show a much less interesting (or fun) story. I didn't care for their characters at all, and it seemed like they only existed in the movie because they were in the previous one. <br/><br/>The movie, in terms of comedy presentation, became hopelessly forced more often than not. Finding Nemo never tread in totally serious waters, everything was fun. But there was a level of tension and seriousness to an otherwise lighthearted premise. Furthermore, it just tried to make everything flow together really naturally, and paced itself really well as a result. Finding Dory was filled with forced gimmicks and plot points that existed for the sake of a joke more than they did a part of the story. Nothing connected, and thus it became a very boring, unnatural mess where many jokes fell flat. <br/><br/>The story as a whole just lacks the realism that the prequel had. When the characters went out of water, it was s big deal. It created tension for the characters. In this movie, it's just how most of the movie is spent. The vast majority is spent above water, wandering around an aquarium. That's not realistic, nor does it make any sense at all. Again, it forces it so hard. There were way too many people in this movie, and it just didn't work in a movie about fish. <br/><br/>Also, this movie didn't need to happen. All loose ends were tied up nicely in Finding Nemo, so why did this need to exist? It's connection to the prequel is loose and unnatural, and it's just not nearly as engaging as a plot. It's a cash grab, and that's it. Disney was as into this movie as I was, it seems. <br/><br/>Overall Finding Dory isn't a good time at the movies. The comedy is forced, the plot is forced, the setting is forced, the characters are boring and so is the movie as a whole. There really isn't a lot going for the movie, but as a whole I didn't really hate it. I just didn't enjoy it. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie. Pretend it doesn't exist, and just watch Finding Nemo."
"zkonedog","7","3","6","24 February 2017"," Another Rollicking Undersea Adventure
","""Finding Nemo"" was a landmark, five-star Pixar film both in terms of visuals and locale (underwater world). ""Finding Dory"" takes that winning formula, tweaks it just a bit, and produces another rollicking (if slightly less groundbreaking) undersea adventure.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Finding Dory"" focuses on Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the forgetful little blue tang fish. Early on in the film, Dory--now part of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Nemo's (Hayden Rolence) family--remembers that she once had parents of her own, and thus the trio hitch a ride with Crush (Andrew Stanton) for the currents of California. Arriving at a Sea World-esque aquatic park, Dory is helped by a number of newcomers to the franchise, such as Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil), Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and Bailey the Beluga whale (Ty Burrell).<br/><br/>Basically, ""Finding Dory"" takes the same basic plot formula (rescue adventure) of ""Finding Nemo"" and just breathes some new life/characters into it. This approach doesn't really break much new ground, but perhaps such a formula doesn't need to be ""messed with"". I was chuckling at many jokes throughout (all the new characters fit in nicely), and found myself mostly caught up in the sense of adventure.<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting choice of the entire experience was Disney/Pixar's focus on Dory's ""disability"" (short-term memory loss). For the most part, that is where the emotion of the film comes from...seeing Dory overcome her weaknesses and even turn them into strengths. Whereas in the first film Dory was pretty much played as just the comic relief, this time her personal struggles comprise the main narrative structure of the entire flick.<br/><br/>Why not the full five stars? Simply put: because Toy Story 2 was better than Toy Story. Somehow, someway, Disney/Pixar managed to have that sequel transcend its spectacular original, and that didn't necessarily happen here. My final star ranking would be 4.5/5.0, if able.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I very much enjoyed the experience of watching ""Finding Dory"". It's an amazing experience to look around the theater and see people of all ages enjoying the same film. I give Disney/Pixar a lot of credit for that. If you were swept away by ""Finding Nemo"", you'll get the same kind of adventure/comedy in ""Finding Dory""."

Nevertheless, with the return of Ellen Degeneres as the titular blue tang and Albert Brooks as worried father Marlin, plus the introduction of Modern Family pair Ed O'Neill and Ty Burrell, all helmed by a team featuring the likes of Wall·E/A Bug's Life director Andrew Stanton, it seems hard to mess up. <br/><br/>The good news is they don't. A sequel - unless the tone is drastically different, like Cameron's 1986 Aliens to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien - is always going to feel like a retread of its predecessor, and if it suffers from the condition of sequelitis, then it will make everything bigger and less interesting. Finding Dory, however, like the Toy Story sequels, is not a shameless cash- in but rather an appropriate companion piece to Finding Nemo. Before the film begins there is a Pixar short as befits tradition, entitled Piper. This shares there oceanic themes of Dory, and is gorgeously animated, with some cute visuals, but it's certainly not one to remember. At its heart the story of Finding Dory is a deeply tragic one, with an introduction which showcases a heart-meltingly cute baby Dory losing her family in unexplained circumstances and traversing the ocean in a wretched, barely remembered state before her memory is finally jogged one year after after helping to rescue Nemo, and the team set off on an adventure to California to find her parents. <br/><br/>What unfolds is nothing less than classic Pixar. The humour is as good as it's ever been in a Pixar feature - the gags are perhaps better than in any other Pixar film, with the standouts Idris Elba as a delightfully lazy sea lion, O'Neill's grouchy octopus (well, septopus), Burrell's clueless beluga having trouble utilising his echolocation, and a silent bird named Becca. The extraordinary setting is a step up from dentist's office in Nemo, and the animation is the very definition of dazzling and flawless - especially during one of the best scenes, where a marine life centre touch pool is re-imagined as a terrifying slaughter ground which evokes the deadly playtime of Toy Story 3's Caterpillar Room. <br/><br/>So, technically jaw-dropping, check. Fantastic humour suitable for children and adults, check. Unexpected maturity and emotional intelligence, check. Impressive voice cast, check. Sounds like a classic Pixar film! On the subject of the voice cast, Degeneres truly excels. Her passion for the character is evident, and she expertly combines the naïve, innocent and cute humour of Nemo's Dory with her new tragic backstory. <br/><br/>As she pieces together her past from fragments of half-remembered memory, it almost begins to feel like Memento - a refreshingly different style amidst the rest of the film. Another refreshing thing is the lack of villain - like in Inside Out - which is a good recent trend in films that allows for a more character and plot based story that doesn't get bogged down in clichés. There third act is relatively a little weaker - with the notable exception of a few scenes - yet this does not stop Finding Dory from ranking amongst several of Pixar's greats. It is occasionally a little too similar to Nemo, especially during lost fish scenarios, so it's not quite amongst the very top tier of the likes of its predecessor, the Toy Story trilogy, Inside Out or The Incredibles, yet it's still a wonderful film and a must-watch for any Pixar fan (which honestly is any fan of film). 83/100."
"allthosepetals","6","7","20","18 June 2016"," not as i expected
","the story seems OK but the way it progresses seems difficult to digest at times, the animation is better than finding nemo. an octopus driving a truck is just too much to handle. the little Dory is adorable with her voice, it is quite an emotional ride for the tang fish. marlin and nemo did excellent work searching her but definitely less fun than first part. things seem difficult to connect at times between what Dory wants and whats actually happening on the screen. doesn't engage audience as in the first part, the intense emotional engagement is clearly missing from this movie.some scenes seem not required at all and could have done without them easily. overall don't expect to be thrilled as finding nemo. i give it 6/10"
"jsmn-kane","6","8","24","22 June 2016"," Fun but nothing close to original
","I knew to go into this film with realistic expectations. For starters, I loved the short as usual-pixar knows the right formula for these well. Piper was a perfect way to get the audience ready for the actual movie. The movie begins with the audience being introduced to Young Dory- who was very cute and it was nice to get some background on her character. Sadly though, none of the new characters seemed all that interesting. The plot was predictable and it did not hold the magic of the first one as well. Love Ellen Degeneres as always in this role, and overall it was a good movie for the summer, it will not go down as one of pixar's better movies though."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","5","13","9 August 2016"," A fun flick that's genuine and expertly crafted, but isn't too funny and has a pretty weak plot: it isn't as good as the first, but still worth your time.
","'Finding Dory' is the both long-awaited sequel to 'Finding Nemo', one of the most beloved animated films of all time, and the latest entry to Pixar's archive of (mostly) stellar movies. Their work has almost become its own genre, with many critics referring to something as 'Pixar-esque' as a high compliment, and has frequently set the bar in terms of quality. They have had a bit of a slump recently, even last year's 'The Good Dinosaur' fell short of the studio's own standard. Luckily, 'Finding Dory' is a competent and enjoyable picture with some fantastic animation and voice work. It doesn't come close the the quality of its predecessor, but it's still good and fun to watch throughout.<br/><br/>The plot initially seems like a rehash of the first, and becomes generic after a fairly compelling opening. The first act goes on like this, with all of the necessary story beats being hit in a conventional way. I wasn't exactly removed from the picture, but I felt a disconnect as I was painfully aware of the film itself whilst trying to be sucked into the world it created. Luckily, this doesn't last long as after the familiar first act the film kicks into gear with the second. After an out-of-place chase scene, the titular Blue Tang stumbles across a marine-life rescue centre; this is where the majority of the flick takes place, and also where it's at its most interesting. I found this act engaging, with the scenario making for some unique set-pieces and additional characters. By taking the action out of the ocean, the team at Pixar were able to mould a different experience from 'Finding Nemo'. It is when the movie differs from expectation that it is at its best, and I became invested in it to the point where the conventional plot-points weren't as noticeable. The final act is a little far-fetched, but features a lot of fast-paced action with slapstick peppered throughout. It is enjoyable but a little brash and seemingly at odds with the film before it. The main issue with the plot arises because of one of its key components. There is an inherent frustration present due to Dory's condition, a character trait which also means that there is a reliance on coincidence and repetition. For me, some of the 'fun' from the forgetting isn't there as I quickly found the joke tiring. But it is handled well on the whole, with sincere moments sprinkled throughout that help keep the film and its themes authentic.<br/><br/>The writing here is very good, Andrew Stanton and Victoria Strouse are great at making these talking fish relatable and likable. Every aquatic animal is anthropomorphised excellently, with small quirky interactions working best. There's snappy banter between couples on more than one occasion, and the smaller roles often provide some of the most memorable moments. It is refreshing to find a script that's consistently well-written, each role is treated with the same amount of care - no matter how small. The voice work is also exceptional. Each cast member gives a believable and natural performance, which - paired with the great writing and animation - makes every character feel rounded and real. Ellen DeGeneres is really good as the lead, giving an emotive and personal performance which adds a level of credibility. Albert Brookes, Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell and Kaitlin Olson are marvellous in supporting roles. O'Neill especially breathes life into an interesting character that frequently plays to his vocal strengths. Idris Elba, Dominic West, Eugine Levy and Diane Keaton all play smaller parts but their presences are all keenly felt.<br/><br/>Animation-wise, the movie is sublime. The ocean looks like the ocean, both from in its depth and above its surface. I can't emphasis how nice the water looks, it's realistic - in both its viscosity and the way it interacts with the environment - but still suits the cartoon- esque aesthetic. The lighting is really great too. The characters are very well realised, with the lip-syncing looking perfect and the movements complex. The twelve principles are clearly on display, with timing and exaggeration being especially prevalent. I like the design of all of the characters, the returning ones have never looked better. There are more people on display this time, and they are brought to life well; they're probably some of the best humans in a Pixar film, looking stylalised yet refined. In terms of the music, Thomas Newman delivers a welcome and ranged film-score that's unfortunately rather forgettable. It works in the moment, always complementing what's on screen, but sums up to some fairly nondescript music that doesn't rank very high among his prior work.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Finding Dory' is a well animated and voice acted film that's genuine; it has been expertly and lovingly crafted. Its plot takes a while to get going, is a little unbelievable and isn't too funny but this is still a worthy sequel to 'Finding Nemo' that is never quite as good but tries its best: 7/10"
"monstermayhem32","9","6","17","2 July 2016"," Dory and gang are back
","Despite being 13 years since finding nemo was released in 2003, the events of this film take place one year later. The lovable but forgetful dory starts to remember her past including the family she forgot about. What i loved about dory was how the flashback intertwined with something she was remembering in the present. Alexander Gould who portrayed nemo in the original is replaced by Hayden roylance due to outgrowing the role but he does have a cameo as a different character. While some may be divided over the film but those that grew up watching the original will feel nostalgic. I would say it was one of Disney better films and certainly worth the wait."
"skywalkerkim","7","6","17","2 July 2016"," Complicated and adventurous, however not as good as Finding Nemo
","***There are some spoiler territories in this review and I will give out a warning. Otherwise enjoy the review***<br/><br/>There are a lot of mixed reviews about Finding Dory. I just saw the movie from the theaters and I too have mixed feelings about the movie. I do have to say, as a kid's movie, and me having a significant age difference from the target audience, the movie was quite entertaining that's for sure. There were some parts where I felt the movie could've done better and some parts that I thought the movie did well. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is where Dory remembers a memory of her parents and decides to go out and find them along with Marlin and Nemo. She accidentally ends up at a Marine Life Institute instead and little by little she realizes her parents was at the institute. <br/><br/>To start off, the acting in this movie was pretty good. Albert Brooks as Marlin was quite good but nothing too flashy, while Hayden Rolence as Nemo delivers the role quite well. The acting was believable between the two and nothing of them got me out of the movie. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory was good. She delivered a vast image of emotions out the movie and her voice acting was believable. The supporting characters such as Ed O'Neil as Hank, Kaitlin Olsen as Destiny, and Ty Burrell as Bailey really helped constructing the movie. None of the supporting characters felt forced and the dialogue between Ty Burrell and Kaitlin Olsen was hilarious. The comedy of this movie however was more focused on the dialogue rather than visuals. Not that I have a problem with this, its just that younger audience members might not understand the comedy of this movie as much as the older audience members do. The movie really focuses on Dory's short term memory loss this time and sometimes uses this as an excuse for plot convenience. At times if felt too repetitive and really forced, and Dory's flashbacks really seemed more as a exposition story teller more than a actual visual relationship.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie was the reveal of Dory's parents, Dory finds her parents right outside the walls of the institution, which is just plain bulls*it because at at the first quarter of the movie, it was clearly shown that Dory, Marlin and Nemo was outside the walls of the institution themselves, and the fact that neither of them bumped into each other is just for the remainder of 1:15. And sure, hardcore movie fans can say that Jenny and Charlie could just be looking for shells and s*it but Dory was clearly yelling ""HELLO"" like a couple of times, which Dory's parents should've heard her screaming and shouting ""HELLO."" I also felt that the ending could've been more dramatic and heartfelt if Dory just imagined her parents being there, sort of like ghosts for that matter. I think if the movie actually do that then it can really show the audience the passion and love that Dory holds so dearly onto about her parents. <br/><br/>END OF SPOILER TALK<br/><br/>The message of this movie really was undemanding and wasn't clearly shown. Before I watched the movie, I felt that the movie goers were trying to show the audience the truth and the reality of aquariums and marine life institutions and how horrible it is from the fish's perspective but that really wasn't the case in the actual film, and if it was then it wasn't shown clearly. If the movie had gone to that approach more attentively than I might have more positive feelings about the film. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: 7.8/10 The movie was fun to watch but there some ups and downs here and there. Check it out for yourself if you haven't already. I recommend this movie to all audiences."
"chulwinik-62949","6","6","17","24 June 2016"," Good, but forgettable sequel
","Given how great Finding Nemo was, my expectations were really high for this film. When I saw Finding Nemo in the theaters, I was just blown away. While I originally walked out of the theater disappointed and thinking my hopes were simply too high, I realized at home that Pixar has delivered plenty of times in the past (i.e. Toy Story sequels). Finding Dory is just not as good as the original. It is a decent movie, but easily forgettable.<br/><br/>Early on in the movie, much of the story seems far too familiar. We see Nemo's coral reef, a journey with the turtle across the ocean, and a chase scene by a scary sea monster again. It is all stuff we have seen before, which made for a slow start. When the movie arrives at the aquarium, we finally see something new, but it is only mildly entertaining. At that point Dory's story-line really takes off, which I found to be really sad and overly serious. In the original movie, Dory was quirky, and full of heart and sweetness; she almost personified optimism. Her character does not change in this movie, but the directors' approach toward her mental affliction does. What was a silly but funny affliction in the first movie is now treated as a serious disability. We now see Dory and the characters around her sad, confused, lost, and really scared most of the time. I completely understand what they were going for in this film, especially for families dealing with special needs family members. At the same time, this movie never makes the strong emotional impacts of many other Pixar films. It's more of a downer than a tearjerker.<br/><br/>Finding Dory still has enough working in its favor to be entertaining. My kids walked out decently satisfied, but I did notice some fidgety behavior midway through the movie. Ultimately, the movie is okay, but it is not a Pixar classic."
"jackbanister16","7","6","17","21 June 2016"," Good, but not Finding Nemo good!
","This movie's marquee was that it was one of the few sequels that was, ""better than the original."" I loved it, but *spoiler alert* - it wasn't.<br/><br/>Finding Dory picks up a year after the original film and gets to the point quickly! Through a series of events, Dory remembers that she has a mom and a dad and that they live in Morrow Bay, CA. Marlin and Nemo decide to help her and voila, we have our premise.<br/><br/>The movie wastes no time as Marlin, Dory, and Nemo meet up with the turtles and ride the East Australian Current presumably west where they land in the murky, garbage and kelp filled Californian coast. I won't give any more spoilers, but I will say that the trio quickly meets up with a villain who is unfortunately not as interesting as Bruce the white shark.<br/><br/>Without giving the plot away, I will say that the new supporting characters introduced in Finding Dory are just not quite as lovable, memorable, or funny as Gil and the tank gang. The slapstick humor was there and there are absolutely some laugh out loud moments throughout the movie! My daughter and I were cracking up! <br/><br/>The reason ""Finding Nemo"" was so darn successful was because of how simple it was. A neurotic, scared of his own shadow type of fish (Marlin) is forced into crazy scenarios because of Dory's reckless abandon and because the love of his son keeps him going. You feel the emotional attachment from the first minute the movie starts. Unfortunately, ""Finding Dory,"" throws a ton of crazy scenarios at you without establishing a super strong emotional bond with the audience. While it makes for a good movie, it's not NEXT LEVEL good like ""Finding Nemo"" is. In short, Dory is a much more interesting supporting character than lead character (in my humble opinion). It's very hard to take her seriously with the whole short term memory loss thing!<br/><br/>Please don't mistake me for one of those guys who thinks the originals are always the best, I really don't think that way (Empire Strikes Back is the best!), but to me a superior sequel needs to both continue and improve upon the best aspects of the original which this movie did not do. Also, please don't view this as a negative review! I still loved this movie and will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD!!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","10","25 November 2016"," Good But A Real Step Down from the Original
","Finding Dory (2016) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Delightful sequel to FINDING NEMO has Dory remembering her childhood and the fact that she got lost from her parents. With the help of Marlin and Nemo she sets out to find them.<br/><br/>FINDING DORY isn't nearly as good as the first film but there are certainly enough cute moments to make it worth sitting through. I'm sure kids will be blown away and enjoy every minute but the adults might be feeling some deja va as we've basically got the same story as the first one and not nearly as many memorable characters. In fact, I'd say the weakest thing about this film is the story, which is just basically a rehash of the first and the adventure from start to finish isn't nearly as good.<br/><br/>With that being said, there's no doubt that Pixar has delivered another winner as once again a lot of credit has to go to the animators. It's really amazing to see how far the animation has grown since TOY STORY and it looks even more marvelous here. The graphics in the animation are just amazing to look at and the scenes in the ocean at the start really make you feel as if you're right there splashing around.<br/><br/>More credit has to go to the vocal talent as well as Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Hayden Rolence are all very good as Dory, Marlin and Nemo. You've also got a nice turn by Ed O'Neill as Hank and Diane Keaton as Jenny. There are some nice comic moments involving the sea lions but I must admit that I thought the film lost some steam once we hit the Marine Life Institute. Some of the adventure is lost here and it just can't compete with that in the original movie."
"prospectus_capricornium","9","7","22","18 June 2016"," Sentimental and Funny, at the same time. Charming!
","The real beauty in Pixar's FINDING DORY lies beneath the elaborate tapestry of immersive adventures, played in plethoraic array of comic efforts pulled off by what could be now one of the most sprightly animated characters to ever grace the big screen. Dory's adventures might singularly win hearts through laughs, but there's a bracing sentiment lurking at the depths of its story that can never be less of a heart-rending emotional gem.<br/><br/>Coming thirteen years after the critical and commercial success of its predecessor, 'Finding Nemo', 'Dory' displays a zealous effort to replicate a similar success by pulling off an essentially similar drama. Only this time, Dory (Ellen deGeneres), whose colossal allure generated much of the overall comic charm in 'Finding Nemo', is the one trying to find her way home. Her journey is depicted in equally vivid, albeit chaotic, adventures that don't only concern about her finding her way back to her family, but more thematically appropriate, about her attempt for self-discovery. In the opening sequence, the sentimental heft of her story is already gaining some volume, but what comes next, no matter how engagingly funny, provides an even more crippling notions of friendship, courage, trust, and family.<br/><br/>Much of the film's comic glamor rests on Dory's forgetfulness, itself, but the incredible charm from new and returning characters, can't be counted out, easily. The biggest surprise is Hank (Ed O'Neill), a cranky anti-social octopus, whose chameleon like ability, could actually be Dory's brightest chance in getting back to her family. Marlin (Albert Brooks), and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) are now mostly relegated to the sidelines, but other memorable characters are put in their places to deliver equally indispensible appeal.<br/><br/>In the end, what the film accomplishes could not be even close to what it aspires to be. There is a big part of its charm that doesn't quite satisfy its own ambitions, but what comes brimming beyond such effort can never be rudimentary. 'Finding is Dory' never able to deliver a piece of thematic complexity, but the depth it is able to dig, is utterly unforgettable."
"arturodv1996","8","5","14","11 August 2016"," My review for Finding Dory
","This movie was great - a nice story that's more nerve-wracking than the first one, with Dory trying to find her parents and her friends trying to find - and save - her.<br/><br/>The animation style is the same, but the graphics have improved and it looks really nice.<br/><br/>There were funny moments that were hilarious and also some moments of sadness for Dory. And to see these characters again was enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched the first film, do it before you watch this.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is great, just as good as the first, with some really tense, fun moments, and great humor."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","14","26 June 2016"," This fish-in-and-out of water tale is worth finding. It's quite the catch.
","The long-awaited sequel to Pixar's 2003 classic, 'Finding Nemo' has finally arrived. Did Finding Nemo really need a sequel? Probably not. But 'Finding Dory' deftly manages to breathe new life to a few recurring characters, while also introducing a school of lively newcomers as well. Directed by Andrew Stanton, once again. The film centers around, everyone's favorite forgetful blue tang, Dory (Voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) on her quest to find her parents. This film, in many ways, is about Dory trying to figure out who she is and restore her memory. So, the title does still fit in that finding her is the plot of the film, just not physically like the previous film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the first few sequences in the movie was a little bit boring, and somewhat repetitive. It really didn't get good, until Dory starts to recall memories of her long-lost family, being in the ""the jewel of Morro Bay, California"". It's here, where the movie become somewhat, funny, new and memorable, when the tone of the film, change from 'hero journey' ocean life edition, similar to 1995's 'Toy Story' to action pack, aquatic search and rescue, escape mission at a local aquarium, similar to 1999 & 2010's 'Toy Story 2 & 3"". I get how the movie was trying to say, with this. When the first movie was released, there was a spike in demand for tropical aquarium fish. This not only harmed wild populations, but many of the fish purchased died quickly due to improper care. This time around, Pixar may directly tell audiences that capturing wild fishes is wrong, and should, only be caught, if they require a lot of care, and they should be, released, as soon as they get better. In many ways, the filmmakers were following, the movement that 2013's documentary, 'Blackfish', set up for the care of aquatic life. The only problem with this plot, is how the fishes were going to get around. It's not, like they can jump from tank to tank. Plus, some of that water is not warm water or saltwater. It would literally, kill, the tropical fishes. Like the first movie, a number of unforgettable quirky side characters serves as tools or 'Ex Machina' to help them, on their way through some excessive obstacles. This includes, fun supporting characters, such as escape-artist, Hank the Octopus (Voiced by Ed O'Neill), Destiny the near-sighted, whale shark (Voiced by Kaitlin Olson), a bunch of laidback sea lions, Fluke & Rudder (Voiced by Idris Elba & Dominic West) and Bailey, the beluga whale (Voiced by Ty Burrell). This might be call, nitpicking, but, I surprise, how helpful, these creatures, are, to the fishes, they barely know. Wouldn't you think, that the seals, whales, and sharks would eat the fishes? Did they really had nothing else to do, than to help Dory get home? Also, like many octopi, Hank can survive for a short time outside of water, so long as he remains moist, but not for the extended periods shown in the film. That said, it's O'Neill's character who really steals the show. In a lot of ways, he fills for Albert Brooks's Marlin's role as the straight man, in service of Dory's comic. In many ways, I really didn't think, the original recurring characters of Nemo (Voiced by Hayden Rolence) and Marlin was even needed, as they really didn't add, much to the plot. Still, it was kinda cool to find out, that Alexander Gould (Nemo's original voice actor) provides the voice of the truck driver. Anyways, the new voice-actors here, really did their jobs, very well. As much, as I love them; my favorite has to be Sigourney Weaver, playing as herself. Whenever, you hear, her voice. It's like, hearing the voice of God. About the main lead, Ellen Degeneres, she's OK. However, her character comes across, a little more annoying, here than the original movie. Not only that, but her short-term memory loss in this film, is a little bit, too selection and random. I really don't believe, that's how anterograde amnesia, works, writers. It come across as fake and too unrealistic. It's like, Dory is being a huge malinger. Keep in mind, that all of those flashbacks, were a little distracting as well. As much, as I love Baby Dory, I really didn't like, how it cut back to the past, from the present, so much. It really disrupt the flow of the film and grew tedious as the movie went on. It also took away, so much of the mystery. In my opinion, I think the movie would had been, more emotional, if we didn't know, what happen to her parents. It might sound wrong, but I was really hoping, they were indeed gone like Marlin, said. It would be tragic, but sometimes, a message like that, need to be, said. Anyways, I though the whole car chase and reunited scene was a bit of a cop out, and little too over the top. Also, I did like the post-credit after scene. Still, this begs a Fridge Logic, though. How did they survive so long inside bags without food or a renewable source of oxygen? Despite that, of course, it goes without saying that Finding Dory is visually spectacular. Just when you thought the CGI couldn't look any better, Pixar's team went and raised the bar again with their latest offering. Plus, like the first movie, it has a great message about having to take chances and do something that we never thought we would be able to do. Also, just because someone has a disability doesn't mean they are a liability, and we should give them a chance and support them in their attempts to overcome their obstacles, not hold them back from doing so. In other words: keep on swimming. Overall: Finding Dory has big laughs and an even bigger heart. Very touching. A must watch. Highly recommended."
"ericstevenson","10","8","27","9 July 2016"," Even better than the first one
","In 2003, ""Finding Nemo"" became a legendary film as it would soon become the best selling DVD of all time! That would be a tough act to follow, right? Luckily, they made a sequel just as awesome. I am so glad that Pixar is more like ""Inside Out"" this time instead of ""The Good Dinosaur"". Interestingly enough, the movie isn't really about finding Dory, but about finding Dory's parents. It helps that this is probably the best animation that Pixar has ever given us. I was afraid that this movie was going to just be a reprise of the original. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it really did use all new stuff.<br/><br/>The best part is how I really felt for Dory in this. I wanted her to be happy! I wanted her to find her parents! We get a few other characters from the first movie, but only in cameos. It helps that there are tons of funny moments and great new characters. Even the credits build up to the rising of the surface. In the first movie, it seemed to show the humans as villains. I found this to be an improvement as it instead showed the humans as sincerely wanting to help the fish. It just wasn't quite in the right way. I'm really tired of PETA's influence. All the characters are lots of fun, but Dory herself truly steals the show, as expected. It was just a movie where you had to see what would happen next. You want it to go on as long as possible but not to the point where they would run out of ideas. And they don't! ****"

","After catching the delightful The Secret Life of Pets on DVD,I decided to take a look at what other animated titles were coming to disc over the Christmas season. Being impressed by Pixar's last few productions,I was thrilled to discover that there follow-up to Finding Nemo has just come out,which led to me diving in the ocean to find Dory.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Since childhood Dory has suffered from short-term memory loss.In childhood,Dory took a wrong turn in the sea and got separated from her parents,whose names and faces she can't remember. After helping him to find his son Nemo,Dory has become friends with his dad Marlin.During a school trip,Dory is hit by waves of childhood memories,which include the names and faces of her mum and dad.Seeing Dory swim halfway round the world to locate her family,Marlin and Nemo decide to go and find Dory.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Vocally campaigning for a sequel, Ellen DeGeneres gives a fantastic performance as Dory,whose child-like sense of awe DeGeneres expresses with a newly found (for Dory) emotional desire in her care-free life. Reuniting with DeGeneres, Albert Brooks gives a warm world-weary performance as Marlin,as Al Bundy himself Ed O'Neill gets his tentacles round every hilarious one liners as octopus Hank.<br/><br/>Meeting Dory and co again after nine years,the screenplay by co- writers/(along with Bob Peterson & Victoria Strouse) directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane masterfully build on everything that has made Finding Nemo a classic. Retaining a wicked comedic streak which glides as Dory's short term memory leads to Adventure movie leaps being taken in the wild blue yonder,the writers paint Dory's fins with an incredibly touching emotional depth,as brief flashbacks smartly give the viewer the chance to see the life Dory now wishes she had. <br/><br/>Creating a new world under the sea,directors Stanton and MacLane give each aspect of sea life its own incredibly distinctive appearance,from the ocean being filled with a van from Toy Story,to Dory's former home covering the screen in waves of lush,primary coloured fish. Unleashing a stunning tracking shoot that goes between the fishes,the directors keep up with Dory's search in expertly delivered wide crane shots,as Dory finds herself."

","What is wrong with people today? Do you understand anything about movies at all? If you gave, or about to give Finding Dory anything below 6 stars ( even 6 is too low ) then you should probably never see a movie again. I went to see this with my girlfriend today and we both absolutely adored every bit of it - it was cute, funny, touching and beautifully animated - the details were astonishing, interesting characters and breath holding environments. The story itself was excellent - although many people might not realise that there is much more to it than Marlin and Nemo finding Dory - It's about Dory finding Dory - finding who she truly is - finding her parents but also herself through memories and old friends. I can not begin to describe how much it frustrates me seeing people being so foolish and blind - I bet your children understand movies better than you.<br/><br/>I can not wait to own this on Blu-Ray and am giving it 10 truly deserved stars."

","Boy, Pixar sure needed this one. After mostly marginal efforts since 2010's Toy Story 3, they had to deliver something to raise our expectations back up. Something undeniable. <br/><br/>This sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo acts as an origins story for everyone's favorite absent- minded fish, Dory. It shows her as a cute little baby, stumbling over her words and innocently gazing into her parents' eyes. Then, one day, her short-term memory loss gets the best of her and she loses her family, unable to remember how.<br/><br/>While most animated films abandon the cute, young version of the main character early on in the film, Finding Dory finds a way to utilize it throughout the whole thing, in the form of of Dory's flashbacks.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily as phenomenal as its predecessor, but Finding Dory is definitely a fantastic movie! We get some new characters who are just as hilarious as the ones from the last-- including two British sea lions who won't allow Gerald to sit on their rock.<br/><br/>It's the funniest Pixar film since Toy Story 3. Some jokes had me laughing long after the credits rolled.<br/><br/>The one and only things that really bothers me are the one or two contrived plot devices. In a deus ex machina fashion, the film takes minor liberties with echolocation and features a ridiculous scene where an octopus drives a truck. But I guess, in Pixar's world, where even toys can talk, anything is possible. But the studio has always been good about walking the line between realistic and impossible--even amidst their own well-crafted impossible universes. But the octopus car sequence throws all that out the window. And it's kinda silly. Your kids will get a kick out of it though.<br/><br/>Still, Finding Dory is something to behold. It's so enjoyable and packed with unforced emotion and unique outlooks on mental handicaps, that we can shrug off even the largest of its minor pitfalls. You can only quibble so much before you realize that the pros far outweigh the cons. To the point where you just can't deny how good it is. it's undeniable.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 98"

","Everything about this movie was delightful and truly was a treat for the whole family. Just do your best to not suffer from short term memory loss and follow the sea shells or the roads (if you live above sea level) back home after it's over. I have noticed some overtones that might offend people in other recent Disney movies but I really don't think there was an offensive thing in this entire movie and it will tug at your heart strings as well. Pixar brings you back to the magical underwater world that Finding Nemo was lost in. Pixar usually knocks them out of the park and they definitely did a great job with this flick too! So go grab a friend or the entire family and come out and see Finding Dory!"
"abouhelier-r","9","5","15","29 June 2016"," Finding Dory Among Pixar's Magic
","The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is written and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, returning to Pixar after the live-action fiasco of John Carter. Pixar movies have been so consistently good for so long now that they carry the burden of infinite expectations. Anything less than a masterpiece is eventually a disappointment. That's why Finding Dory is fine. It's not Toy Story, The Incredible, Finding Nemo or even Inside Out. But it's a perfectly enjoyable family film, a little bit like what we got when I was younger – back in the 90s, Disney used to ship straight to DVD/VHS those Lion King spin-offs. Unfortunately, you also feel a sense of déjà vu. Dory's quest to be reunited with her parents is more or less the same exact fate that a little clown fish named Nemo.<br/><br/>Dory, that adorable, excited blue tang fish, suffers from short-term memory loss. The slightest distraction or break in concentration wipes her mind clean. The creators have done something better: they figured out how to take an already perfect character and deepen her in an exquisitely satisfying way. In a flash, a character with a singular funny trait comes at us in a whole new way. She's no longer a (daffy) amnesiac. She's a child fish with a serious disability.<br/><br/>There's real emotion. You feel every (ounce) of Dory's panic and her parents' desperation – something that any father or mother who's ever taken their eyes off of their children in a supermarket can identify with (I assume). On her own Dory grows up and matures into the impressible, caffeinated stammering of Ellen DeGeneres – who is the heart and soul of the movie. Like Robin Williams before her in Aladdin, Ellen DeGeneres has this gift as a comedian to keep the film moving and speeding along. Dory's glory is that her amnesia makes her completely responsive to life. This film eventually is about how the past, for her, isn't really so past. It's just the ability to remember life as we're living it, one moment at a time. <br/><br/>As surely as the death of Bambi's mother, the premises of this movie rips a small emotional hole in the audience's heart. One of this film most important messages is how resonant Dory will be for parents of children with disabilities. To them, life can feel like a lonely struggle where anxiety constantly affects their state of mind. If you are invested hard enough, the film's message to these parents is: you are not alone! Dory's failing memory may be a handicap, but it's also the key to her resilience. Finally, this movie like many before it invites you to dive in with your eyes, which is why these movies are submersive daydreams for children. Who needs 3D glasses? Even if you – like me – happen to see this film in 2D, just about every shot in it pops out at you with beauty.<br/><br/>Overall through her journey Dory learns to remember what life is all about. This film doesn't quite fit in the top drawer as it lacks that full-on audacity of imagination. Yet, it has so much soul and heart-of-the-ocean visual poetry that some of us will cherish it as a classic."

","A movie about a fish who has short-term memory loss. A sequel to an amazing movie. On paper it's a great idea. In reality, it's 97minutes of my life that I'm never going to get back. <br/><br/>The movies starts off with a little recap of what happened so far, so even if you haven't seen Nemo, you'll still understand. Sadly I think those might be the only people who might actually like this movie. For me it looked like ""Here's everything we did in Finding Nemo, we just put Dory where Nemo used to be"" change a few locations, and we're done. <br/><br/>sadly that's not the end of it, The same joke over and over. After 10 times it just isn't funny anymore. This movie is predictable and at moments downright boring. I expected more. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, don't. Just put on Finding Nemo and save yourself a lot of frustration. <br/><br/>I rated this movie 3* because of how good the original was. the movie itself is 1*, and that's kind. <br/><br/>Right now I wish I was Dory, then I would forget this in about 90 seconds.... Sadly, I have to live with the memory of a movie that is substandard."
"Imdbidia","7","2","4","13 May 2017"," Charming, funny with a great message
","Finding Dory is not only a gorgeous-looking animated film, but a really family fun adventure. It's cheeky, funny, cute, naughty, crazy and heart-warming. It is not specially simple or over the top, and settles in a happy medium that will please kids and a adults alike. Although this is a sequel to Finding Nemo, the story feels like a film on its own, and while some of the events and characters in the first film appear also here, Finding Dory would still be a great film even if the first movie had never been made.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is not a film about being lost, is a film a about finding who you are and finding home. It sends a message that your family is not always just your natural family, but those who include you in their family, help and love you when you don't have anybody else and you are most vulnerable.<br/><br/>The story also sends a very positive message to any kid who has a disability, learning problem, or is just different. Dory has a short memory span, yet that problem makes her take decisions rapidly and be fearless and resolute, lets her evaluate any situation rapidly and make the best of it; Dory needs of other people, but she is so devoted and caring, that anybody wants to help her when she's in need. The analogy for those kids who are different is wonderful -- those things that seem to be a shortcoming and make you different, might end being the source of your greatness, helping you develop great qualities, and make of you an unique lovable individual. <br/><br/>No animated movie can pass the adults' test without having great characters and great voices. This is the case here. The characters are varied, funny, have distinct personalities, and the actors lending their voices to them do a great job at infusing them with life and soul. I enjoyed Ellen being Dory. She did a great job at infusing Dory with that charm and soul the character needs. Besides, Ellen's natural voice has those things that are quintessential Dory: naughtiness, innocence, excitement and child-like tones. I found baby Dory absolutely adorable and wonderful. Once Dory becomes an adult and Ellen's voice is more fully there, I couldn't but hear Ellen, not always Dory. I would have liked her voice to be a bit more twinkled or morphed so as to allow Dory to take Ellen over, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>My main criticism to the film is perhaps the fact that the story becomes inorganic when we see an octopus driving a van and a fish reading signs and driving signs. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought that somewhat didn't glue well with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The film comes together with the short film Pipper, which I reviewed elsewhere, and adorable addition to a great combo.<br/><br/>Most enjoyable."
"crazyhannah-67353","8","2","4","25 February 2017"," There's something in the water at Pixar!
","There must be something in the water at Pixar! After their 2003 triumph Finding Nemo, Pixar continued the famous aquatic trios' adventure in the sequel, Finding Dory. Pixar uses their ability to create realistic animation mixed with the voices of many famous actors to hold their spot at the top of the cartoon universe. In this similar but different sequel, Nemo's heroine Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fun, lovable, but often forgetful fish has an adventure of her own. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, but she starts to have short flashbacks of where she came from. As she ventures to find her family, Dory is joined by Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Pixar's newest eight-legged hero, an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neil) who helps her in many tight spots along the journey. She is also reunited and helped by some of her old childhood friends along the way. As far as sequels go, the plot to Finding Dory is far too similar to Finding Nemo. Pixar follows almost the exact plot line, except for parents looking for their child, it is a child looking for their parents. There is no creativity in the plot set up for this movie, however the similarity is not a disappointment. It allows for Pixar to up the ante when it comes to the new animation technology, the script, and the actors, and they did just that. With the advancement in technology, and the ability to create animation increases in movies, adds to the wonder of this movie. Compared to the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, this film has many more intricate details regarding the animation. The primary background of the ocean water flows extremely fluidly. Also, way the fish maneuver throughout the water is remarkably life-like, one might think they are swimming with the fish. Not to mention the ray of colors within this film are as vibrant as ever. Pixar deserves an A+ with this one! Besides the amazing animation, the cast line up for this movie is also absolutely incredible. Day time talk show host and comedian, Ellen DeGeneres is flawless as Dory, while the hilarious Ed O'Neal and Ty Burrell (stars of ABC's Modern Family) are along with her throughout the adventure. Not to mention countless of other familiar voices such as: Kaitlin Olson, Albert Brooks, and Diane Keaton, help add to the light heartedness of the movie. The cast chosen for this movie are high quality actors as they add many raw emotions throughout movie, giving it the ability to appeal to the emotions of people of all ages. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie to watch alone, with friends, or even with family you can't go wrong with Finding Dory. If you missed the showings while it was in theaters do not worry as it is now out on DVD, and as of February 2017 it is up on Netflix making it accessible for everyone to watch and enjoy the ""tale"" of the fun, lovable, but forgetful fish, Dory."
"caa-87943","9","2","4","9 February 2017"," A great squeal
","Disney and Pixar have a tendency to create bad sequels. Finding Dory is not one of those movies. It follows Dory, Merlin's sidekick in the first movie. The Movie has some sadder parts to it, but these parts are few and never get to the levels of other classic Disney flicks. The Movie is mostly funny, I found myself laughing a lot. The comedy mainly surrounds the Character Dory and her chronic memory loss. The bit is done enough to get plenty of laughs, but not enough to get old. The movie brings back many of the characters from the first movie including, of course, Merlin and Nemo. A hand full of new characters are added and play well of Dory and the other characters. It's paced well and the plot has a few twists that keep it interesting. The climax is epic but you know everything is going to turn out fine, which does take a little away from the climax. I don't think is has to be said but the animation is stunning and the movie looks great, I mean what did you expect its Pixar.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is excellent, Its great for kids and its great for adults. It isn't the most epic movie of 2016 or the most thought- provoking, but it is one of the most entertaining. If you have the means check it out."

","Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter, Bob Peterson, Jeremy Lasky & Thomas Newton came back together after thirteen years to make Finding Nemo's ""sequel"", Finding Dory. The first set was great! Stanton did all the right things to drag us in, and want more. As for the rest of the story, it was slower paced because there was much more going on this time around. On the downside, I felt as if Stanton got a little lazy, and borrowed some content from the first film, so a few scenes just felt unbalanced. The major downfall I had with this movie, I can't have Dory as my main protagonist!!! She serves much better as a side character; her character is a close comparison to Mater, just not as annoying. It did the same thing Cars 2 did, and they both flopped.<br/><br/>I can truly appreciate the effort the team put in, into creating new and original characters, but some of them were hit and miss. The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson & new comer Victoria Strouse, didn't have as much charisma throughout, as the first one did, having pretty bad jokes throughout, and just lacked heart that the first movie spewed of.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Jeremy Lasky & Ian Megibben was even better than the first one. The lights and darks, the animations, the texture in everything to the fish, to the water, to the sunlight was just spectacular.<br/><br/>I usually stay away from mentioning the endings, unless they really mean something, but this ending made this movie plummet real fast. It was just too over the top, and tried to flesh out too much, because they realize they overstuffed the narrative to begin with.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie may not have been as fresh as the first, and took FOREVER to release, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other trash we got a few years ago."

","Right from the start, it is possible to notice the structural change implemented in Finding Dory: the film starts with a flashback, with the little fish dememorial beside his parents and learning to deal with his constant forgetfulness. In addition to historically situating the new protagonist, the opening also serves to correlate this sequence with the original film. That's when we know that the new adventure takes place exactly one year after Nemo's rescue.<br/><br/>The presence of flashbacks is very important in this new film: it is through them that Dory, little by little, receives clues about who they were and where their parents are. In addition to dealing with the past explicitly, Finding Dory reverses the proposal seen in the original film: if before an overprotective father left desperately in search of his son, now it is the daughter who is looking for her parents. In both cases, the need to have the family around is the main motivation - remember, Pixar is a Disney company, with all the merits and demerits it brings. However, if Finding Nemo shone with originality, its continuation is extremely dependent on the elements already known to the general public.<br/><br/>It is clear that issues with the whale and Dory's constant forgetfulness are present once again, as well as Marlin's always worried air, now relegated to the post of supporting (and sometimes forgotten in the story itself, along with Nemo). Well-known characters, such as the hippie-shaped turtle, appear in small spikes. As much as such ideas even yield some fun sequences, they always sound like something reheated. The same joke is insisted, changing only the context in which it is presented.<br/><br/>Such dependence is made even more explicit by the fact that the new characters do not stand out so much. If the Hank octopus even has an interesting side due to the dubiousness of posture, it is also wide open that his choice had a lot to do with the need for locomotion out of the water of Dory herself (in juggling that does not always convince, say in passing) . The itinerary is also concerned with instructing minors about marine fauna, as shown by biological curiosities scattered here and there and the presence of the beluga Bailey, with her powerful ""natural sonar"". In other words, there is a constant concern to have fun and also to transmit messages, whether emotional - connection with the family - or educational - the setting in the California aquarium is another example.<br/><br/>Originally, Finding Dory is in just two moments: in the brilliant sequence of the ""touching tank"", where reality is presented from the perspective of the beings who live there (an inversion of the point of view similar to the aquarium in the office, in Finding Nemo); and in the contrast formed by the shark Destiny and the aforementioned Bailey, involving questions of vision. In addition, they are the same situations already known, presented by an impressive quality of animation - note the difference in brightness at the bottom of the sea, depending on how deep the characters are.<br/><br/>I liked this criticism of AdoroCinema<br/><br/>Film reviewed on June 14, 2020."

","Perhaps it's because I'm a soulless husk of a man and dead inside, but the Pixar formula just isn't cutting it for me anymore. You'll find no argument here that the animation studio's heroic run from 1995's Toy Story through Up in 2009 was all but unprecedented in its consistently enchanting assembly of wondrous new worlds. (So great, in fact, that we'll let them take a mulligan on Cars. Even Babe Ruth struck out sometimes.) But Finding Dory arrives in theatres not long after Monsters University, and you might be a bit unnerved to learn that The Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4 and Cars 3 are all already on the way.<br/><br/>Pixar settling down into a sequel factory is, I suppose, the way of all things Disney these days and maybe wouldn't be as troubling if even their original films weren't starting to feel like sequels, too. This particular heartless bastard shed no tears during last summer's Inside Out, which transplanted the final segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex into yet another Pixar movie about two mismatched characters separated from their group and learning to love one another during endless contraption-like chase sequences. A widely circulated internet meme adroitly pointed out that once toys, bugs, monsters, fish, cars, rats and robots all have feelings, the only logical follow-up was for feelings to have feelings. (Also, Bing Bong was annoying and I'm glad he's dead.) Finding Dory inverts Pixar's beloved 2003 Finding Nemo by replacing a father's search for his son with a daughter trying to find her parents. Dory, the absent-minded blue sidekick (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) takes center stage for the sequel after a bump on the head triggers a flashback to her long-lost mom and dad. Presented as comic relief in the first film, Dory's daily struggle with short term memory loss is fairly harrowing here, and certain scenes should probably come with a trigger warning for parents of special needs children.<br/><br/>It's no easy feat building a story around a character who can't remember anything that just happened, with the screenplay constantly required to cheat its own premise (this isn't Memento) and work around the fact that a little of this character goes an awfully long way.<br/><br/>Undeterred by her disability, Dory sets out trying to find her folks at a massive California marine preserve, once again travelling with worrywart old clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his plucky son Nemo (newcomer Hayden Rolance, because I assume the original kid's voice changed sometime over the past thirteen years.) The first thing you'll notice about Finding Dory is that the ocean sure got a heckuva lot smaller between films, and now can be traversed in mere minutes of screen time instead of an entire feature. That speeded-up quality is emblematic of the sequel, in every way bigger, louder and more action-packed than its predecessor, which isn't necessarily for the best.<br/><br/>Quickly split-off from Marlin and Nemo –both could probably have been excised from the story without much fuss– Dory soon finds herself navigating the confines of an eco-friendly aquarium in the company of the film's finest creation; a curmudgeonly seven-armed octopus named Hank, voiced by Al Bundy himself, Ed O'Neill. (The missing limb makes Hank technically a ""septopus,"" which Dory keeps reminding him as if for the first time.) It's a smart move giving us a crotchety audience surrogate who's allowed to get as exasperated with our heroine as we do, even if that means this becomes yet another Pixar movie about two mismatched characters separated from their group and learning to love one another during endless contraption-like chase sequences.<br/><br/>I honestly zoned out during a lot of the action and found myself focusing on the miraculously detailed background animation. Whether we're talking about the slight residue of gunk on these fish tanks or the shimmering reflections of light upon water and glass, Finding Dory is a technological astonishment. I got more out of contemplating each magnificently rendered grain of wet sand than I did trying to figure how these small aquatic creatures have suddenly become capable of performing such outlandish stunts. The best parts of the film are the too few occasions when it pauses for long enough to let us drink in the majesty of what we're being shown.<br/><br/>Pretty sure I checked out for good when the octopus started driving a truck. You may have more patience than I."

During a school field trip with Nemo to watch the stingray migration, Dory is cautioned about the strong ""undertow"" - and the word triggers memories about a similar warning from her parents, Jenny (Diane Keaton) and Charlie (Eugene Levy). Determined to remember more and locate her mother and father, Dory heads to California, with Marlin and Nemo in tow. Once there, the trio discovers the Marine Life Institute, a massive rehabilitation center and aquarium. With the aid of new friends Hank (Ed O'Neill), Fluke (Idris Elba), Rudder (Dominic West), and more, Dory begins piecing together snippets of her past to discover the fate of her parents.<br/><br/>Everyone's favorite short-term-memory-loss-suffering fish is back, this time starring in her own show and getting to relive and redeliver many of her hysterical routines. Although her disability here is even more severe, generating significant, almost stressful amounts of affliction, it's all part of the theme of overcoming setbacks. She may be disastrously forgetful, but a major part of her voyage is to figure out ways to transform her misfortunes into boons.<br/><br/>And in doing so, her tale becomes a very human, very emotional one of enlightenment, identifying inner strengths, never giving up, and establishing new friendships with indispensable allies. It also leads to one of Pixar's most mesmerizingly poignant sequences, rivaling even the opening scene from ""Up,"" which is now renowned for its exceptional beauty and stunning heartbreak. There's an emotional wallop here that goes beyond any single moment in ""Finding Nemo,"" which gives this new picture an undeniable edge and consequence rarely seen in sequels (or animated features, or cinema in general).<br/><br/>But Pixar sequels are no ordinary follow-ups. Even though many returning bit parts make an appearance (including a bucktoothed, bug-eyed, nerdy classmate fish, the surfer-guy turtle, and the singing manta ray teacher); the plot retreads familiar terrain to repeat the basic concept of an epic, cross-sea expedition; or a menacing squid replaces an out-of-control shark, a detrimental, loss-of-creativity sense of repetition never seeps into the proceedings. Instead, the dialogue gets cleverer, the quirky jokes about specific species become more creatively bizarre, and the character designs grow ever more caricaturized and comical. Hank the octopus is one of the most impressive CG creations so far in the industry, utilizing photorealistic textures, spot-on movements, and a camouflage gimmick that is so sensational, the filmmakers chose to showcase it again in the closing credits.<br/><br/>Where the first film was a harrowing odyssey across the vast unknown, this continuation shifts into a monumental mystery, retaining the themes of friendship, trust, negative reinforcement, and confidence, while also adding the notion of manipulating adversity into resolve. In its mix of superior visuals, a recognizable and endearing voice cast, laugh-out-loud gags, and a level of pathos not witnessed since ""Toy Story 3,"" ""Finding Dory"" becomes a technical and artistic masterpiece. For a film set in the ocean, it somehow even manages to throw in a car chase sequence.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Massie Twins</li></ul>"

","Finding Dory is a sequel to Finding Nemo(2003). It takes place one year after the events of the previous film. Dory(Ellen DeGeneres) starts recollecting memories from her past, despite her short term memory loss. She starts remembering her family & where she is from. Dory takes the help of her friends Marlin(Albert Brooks) & Nemo(Hayden Rolence), to help her find her long-lost family. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is a fantastic movie. Pixar delivers another flawless sequel that improves upon the previous installment, after Toy Story 3(2010). Finding Nemo(2003) is a classic. However, Finding Dory is better. This film is more humorous than its predecessor. Directors Andrew Stanton & Angus MacLane made a great decision, by making the lovable yet forgetful Dory, the protagonist in this movie. For me, Dory was the highlight of Finding Nemo. Dory is definitely the highlight of her own film, as well. All the new characters in the sequel, are excellent additions. There is as much heart in this movie, as there is in the 2003 original. This film imparts a great message to all of us that, we should never give up no matter what the odds are. The animation looks extremely realistic & is another highlight of the movie. The 3D definitely gives you a more fun & engrossing experience. The voice cast, is the reason this film is filled with hilarity & heart. Ellen DeGeneres is outstanding as Dory. Albert Brooks is awesome as Marlin. Ed O'Neill is spectacular as Hank. Kaitlin Olsen is amazing as Destiny. Hayden Rolence is good as Nemo. Ty Burrell is brilliant as Bailey. Diane Keaton & Eugene Levy are superb as Jenny & Charlie, respectively. Sloane Murray is adorable as Young Dory. Idris Elba & Dominic West are hysterical as Fluke & Rudder, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. The animated short film called Piper(2016) that came before the movie, is stupendous. Finding Dory is a must watch for the whole family. Go for it immediately, if you haven't already."
"isaiahwilson15","9","4","13","2 July 2016"," The first Pixar sequel to best the original
","In all honesty, like many others, I went into Finding Dory without much anticipation. While I expected it to be a good film, this is Pixar!!, I did not expected to be amazed, and boy was I wrong. Finding Dory is not only an improvement on Finding Nemo, but I would say it ranks among Pixar's best films. The magic of Finding Dory is found in its surprisingly emotional story and its colorful characters. The way the story is presented with the use of flashbacks, and the emphasis on short term memory loss adds a great amount of emotional weight to the typical ""searching for my family"" storyline. The importance of family is stressed through both the flashbacks, and some callbacks to Finding Nemo which forces the viewer to quickly become attached to Dory's personal story. The execution of the plot is done just as well as the film moves at a perfect pace, never appearing rushed or dull at any point. The well constructed story is further helped buy an amazing cast of supporting characters. Each character plays a particular role in the story, and the awareness of knowing the capacity of the role each character has helps in the development and balance of these characters. The inclusion of a slew on new characters makes Finding Dory really feel like a Dory film, and the chemistry between Dory and each new ally feels genuine! Finding Dory is yet another victory for Pixar as they once again prove their ability to blend mature, emotional stories with wildly entertaining characters."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","4","13","27 June 2016"," Middle-of-the-Sea Pixar Outing
","Finding Nemo was a groundbreaking feast of state-of-the-art oceanic visuals and piercing emotions. With Dory, Pixar used 13 years of experience to take the animation even further, while slightly bogging down with overly familiar storytelling. Luckily, that familiarity is mostly forgiven. Through some smart retrofitting of our absent-minded protagonist, they've managed the difficult task of taking a comic-relief side-character and giving her pathos and passion (take note, Minions). Outside of Toy Story, Dory is the best Pixar sequel to date. We pick up one year after Nemo made it back home, with some distant memories of her parents conveniently creeping back into Dory's memory, leading her on a journey to find them. She is still the lovable short-term memory loss loser we grew to love, but director/writer Stanton takes her disease a much more seriously here. Surprisingly, the film has some really insightful things to say about dealing with mental illness, both for the individual and the people who care for them. This being a Pixar film, the tears flowed freely (i.e. an emotionally wrecking scene involving paths of shells). Not that this purely a dreary occasion; far from it. Dory is arguably one of the LOL funniest films in the Pixar cannon. Including an effective horror movie spoof in the form of a fish-touching pool, a perfect use of Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World"", and a hilarious use of Sigourney Weaver, it's filled with clever humor. If only that cleverness spread into the plotting a little more (Dory's memory loss is full of inconsistencies to further the story), this may be slightly more unforgettable. So while Dory's not top-tier Pixar, it's still solid family fare."
"trevor-82944","8","4","13","22 June 2016"," A Journey Over Waters Not to be Easily Forgotten
","To tell the truth, I was at first worried about how Finding Dory would turn out. I originally feared it would become nothing besides the writers taking advantage of nostalgic fan service to overuse the famous character's short-term memory loss solely for laughs. Worst of all, it would dumb her down into an offensive stereotype toward people who actually have her condition. But you know what? Finding Dory instead did the opposite, showing how tragic short-term memory loss can really be for a poor little fish.<br/><br/>It all appropriately starts with Dory as a cute little tyke being taught by her parents how to explain her short-term memory loss to others. Then this touching opening turns immediately devastating as she wonders if she would ever forget her parents. Mom and pop simply affirm to her: follow the shells to find her way home. Then suddenly, she unexplainably appears in the middle of a dark kelp forest, separated from her parents. What happened to them? Where are they? How can she find her way home?<br/><br/>It would be easy, except she doesn't remember.<br/><br/>Now little Dory has nothing to do other than wander the ocean asking random fish where her mommy and daddy are. Yes, only five minutes in and it's already the second most devastating way to start a family movie (number one being Up). Eventually, she forgets what she's even searching for, left only to wander the ocean for the rest of her life, questioning her own existence. Here is where Marlin comes in. ​ One year later, she's living in a coral bed across Marlin and Nemo's anemone. Life seems just fine, until a freak accident causes her to remember something: her parents are in California! Thus, she talks Marlin and Nemo into going with her across the ocean to find her parents. Once a traumatizing giant squid attack follows after a trip through the EAC, Dory gets separated from her clown fish friends, ending up in the Marine Life Institute, quarantined and tagged for shipment to the Cleveland aquarium. Yet she'll stop at nothing to find her family! Picture Yes, it is unbelievably tragic to see how her short-term memory loss got her into such a bad place; it makes her character in Finding Nemo so much deeper, accomplishing exactly what any sequel should accomplish. But she thankfully has some friends to help her along the way.<br/><br/>There's Hank the cranky octopus, whose slippery tentacle movements create some phenomenal visual gags with his camouflage ability. There's Destiny the ditsy whale shark, who can't stop running her head into things. There's Bailey the beluga whale, who adds some fantastic comedic material with his whale shark friend. There's Becky the silent loon, who pecks at anything that moves. There's Rudder and Fluke, the lazy sea lions who are relatively weak in spite of some definite hard-hitting laughs. There's the irresistibly cute otters who you just want to cuddle with. Then there's Dory's loving parents, who undeniably care for their little girl.<br/><br/>Along with the memorable new characters and intense emotion, the world's setup also adds tremendous influence on Dory's journey of literal self-discovery. While it's not in the ocean, it's for the majority of the part in the amusement park reminiscing Sea World. The film's director Andrew Stanton has stated that Finding Dory features a new upgrade for their usual RenderMan system, allowing the animators to craft indirect light. Now let me tell you something: it pays off— each individual location has its own set of colors and textures to brim its own unique feel, making you feel like you're there. It's incredible to see how the barnacles and kelp decorate the environment, as well as how the soft, vivid memories of Dory are rendered as they come back to her. The aquarium's brilliant blue fish tank looks the most visually satisfying of all the set pieces, all even more of an immersive delight in 3D. It almost seems like computer animation exists specifically for underwater animation.<br/><br/>In the end, the stunning animation adds so much power into Dory's discovery of her past. It's all a matter of asking, ""What would Dory do?"" I felt surprisingly empowered while seeing a seemingly hopeless fish like Dory resolved a major issue independently by learning the way around her disability. Contrary to my thoughts coming into the theater, the mentally disabled can learn quite a bit from Finding Dory.<br/><br/>Whether if you have Alzheimer's, dementia, down syndrome, autism, Asperger's, or even are a bit short on remembering things, keep in mind one philosophy for you to live by: whatever seems to hold you back from everyone else will never hold you back from yourself. If Dory can ignore her mental situation to make it all the way to a Californian aquarium, then you can do similar. If Dory can remember little things by seeing related items, you too can do similar. Dory has her own unique way of remembering things which works toward her survival. As for you, you too have that one unique thing to help you to overcome your one unique obstacle. Therefore, I recommend Finding Dory to family, kids, teens, everyone.<br/><br/>You've already heard this said many times before but here it is: Pixar, you've done it again!<br/><br/>Overall Grade: B+"

","Likes: Everything about this film!! Hahah!! Characters - of course,Dory is given to be the funniest character in Finding Nemo but in this film, I get to know her even more. She's more than that. I also loved Hank the octopus (septipus), Becky, Destiny and a lot more. Plot - even though it's more on of finding Dory's parents, at the end of the film you'll understand why it's Finding Dory. :') Humor - of course, it's not gonna be such a huge hit if Dory's antics won't be funny but more than that, new characters brought more laughs in this film. I would love to have a Finding Hank or Finding Destiny sequel. LoL. Hank is just so funny.<br/><br/>Dislikes: Pacing/Editing - there were just some scenes where I got bored for a few seconds, maybe because I wanted Dory and her parents to meet already. :D<br/><br/>Over All Impression: Finding Dory made me laugh, giggle, cry and laugh some more. Its humor is in its characters but its heart is in the story itself (like most Pixar films) and what sets it apart is its reach not just to kids but to everyone."
"MrDHWong","8","5","18","15 June 2016"," A more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing
","Finding Dory is the long awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic Finding Nemo. While Pixar aren't well known for the quality of their sequels and prequels (with the exception of the Toy Story films), this one was actually very good. It's a more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing.<br/><br/>Six months after the events of Finding Nemo, Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) suddenly remembers something important about her childhood and sets off to her original home, located in Morro Bay, California. Due to Dory's frequent short-term memory loss, she has great difficulty trying to piece together the fractured remnants of her memories and often forgets things at the most important of times. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), with his son Nemo, follow after Dory to help her along with her journey to discover what it is she is really looking for.<br/><br/>Beautiful to look at and quite touching at times, Finding Dory is a worthy successor to the excellent original film. Being more slow-paced than its predecessor, this allowed for more poignant and atmospheric moments to really take effect. The voice acting was great as well, particularly from Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. I also enjoyed many of the new characters introduced, my personal favourite was Hank, a cynical Octopus voiced by Ed O'Neill. If you enjoyed the original, then I recommend seeing this one.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10. Special mention also goes to the cute animated short at the beginning titled ""Piper"", which is about a baby Sandpiper learning how to feed itself."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","9","21 October 2016"," The general plot is not convincing, but the love to detail is
","""Finding Dory"" is an animated movie from this year (2016) and as such it is the newest release by Pixar and Disney. The film runs for slightly under 100 minutes and it is the sequel to the 2003 movie ""Finding Nemo"" as you probably already guessed correctly from the title. The man in charge here as one of several writers and directors is Pixar's Andrew Stanton, a two-time Academy Award winner and the reception of his newest work here indicates that it may soon be a 3 perhaps. The focus here is on Dory, the fish voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, the one with the pretty bad memory who keeps forgetting everything so quickly. And this ""disability"" is also one of the major plot points in this movie here. But it is not really working at all. Dory was a character that existed almost exclusively for comic relief in the first film and her problem there was used as something funny, which makes it really difficult for me to accept it as part of a serious characterization. I would generally say that the character of Dory is not the perfect choice for a dramatic approach. In my opinion, she works best as a fun supporting character and in here they want her to be a lot more.<br/><br/>It is the story of Dory searching for her family, i.e. her parents, who she had forgotten a long time ago, but then her memory returns. At least partially. And she goes on the search for them, which takes her to all kinds of different places and has her meet all kinds of different characters. This includes Hank, an octopus, who is voiced by Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy) in the original, and he is probably the most fun part about the film, even if he isn't entirely perfect at all either. That whole camouflage aspect felt pretty unnecessary. He probably has even more screen time than Marlin and certainly also than Nemo, who is almost non-existent in this film. Another big problem I had with the story is that it is so much about Dory looking for her parents and after a melodramatic turn of events that has other fish (including the two clown fish) say they are dead, they suddenly appear out of nowhere and then they are gone just as quickly again. It left a bit of a bad note on everything before that really and the mere explanation that Dory's memory is now strong enough to find them anytime wasn't sufficient for me.<br/><br/>One of the greatest strengths of the film is the animation for sure. I know it is somewhat a given looking at animated films (especially Disney/Pixar) these days, but we should nonetheless not take it for granted. It's a feast for the eye and the scene when all the sea animals eventually return to the sea is pretty powerful. And the comedy is fairly decent again too. The film did little for me on an emotional or dramatic level, but the fun factor was certainly very existent from start to finish and this is once again due to the love to detail. It's not about the core plot, but about small scenes and comments in-between, such as Marlin saying she should just choose her two favorites and they can leave. And there are more examples of that. Even the scene near the end with the octopus driving the van is quite funny despite being quite a lot of hullabaloo, which usually annoys me more than it did there. All in all, as usual with Pixar, this was a good watch. I do not think it was one of their best or worst films and in my opinion I hope there are still better animated movies from 2016 as this one we have here (despite being a decent sequel) would not be a really deserving Best Animated Feature winner at the Oscars. A nomination would be enough. Overall, I recommend checking it out, especially to everybody who loved ""Finding Nemo"". I think both films are good without being great and I guess I prefer ""Finding Nemo"" slightly. It is a franchise that offers little in dramatic/emotional (except the beginning to FN) content unlike some other Pixar works, but there is lots of fun in there. Fans of the first had to wait long enough for sure."

","""Finding Dory"" meets our favorite fish characters one year after having found Nemo (Hayden Rolence). Life seems pretty great and ordinary for Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), Nemo and Marlin (Albert Brooks), yet suddenly Dory is amazingly triggered back to her past and starts remembering little bits of her youth, most notably she remembers her parents and sets out on a journey in search of them with an enthusiastic Nemo and a slightly reluctant Marlin.<br/><br/>Not to be in anyway hyped for a Pixar film would prove stupid, especially considering their enormous achievement with last year's ""Inside Out"", which proved to be for me the best movie of the year, not to mention the amazing sequel work they have done with the ""Toy Story"" series. With ""Finding Dory"" we arr unfortunately far away from the brilliance and top notch filmmaking Pixar has produced, yet that in no way detracts from the enjoyable and occasionally touching ride we are offered.<br/><br/>After reviewing so many Pixar films, I find myself once again having to mention at the forefront the animation. It might be obvious, it might be almost routine by now, but that in no way should take away from the brilliant work these animators put forward every single time. The frame is rich and beautiful, yet never looses the viewer, it is always there to tell a story and the complexity of what is conveyed through it is both overwhelming and magical. The coherent tone they always manage to craft is something that is not to undersell since we have seen many animated films fail at it in the past. There is hardly a moment to get your eyes off screen and that is both because of how engaging the frame is on a basic composition level, but also because of how smartly every character and action is brought to life, resulting always both funny and intelligent.<br/><br/>Furthermore and, might I say, once again, we are carried in a world that is incredibly fun, filled with jokes at every corner, pop culture references peppered throughout, running gags that develop character and excellent slapstick humor. But the best part is that all of this is, as always, done uninvasively. Hardly ever does the story stop to make way for a gag, the story is the focal point of everything, the characters and their struggle are always o the forefront, all of the above is just an addition that enhances the film and gives it this incredibly adventurous and funny tone which always leaves a big smile on my face when leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Still what ultimately makes everything work is the affection for the characters both old and new, the way they are treated and how they act. No matter how off the rails the film is going at times, and it really does, the banter between these fish is so sharp and electrifying you just don't see fish and you don't want it to end. Moreover, Dory is funny and genuinely works as a main character, if only a little one beat, yet her comedic value is inexhaustible.<br/><br/>As I said the movie does go off the rails, the action portrayed on screen is simply too far fetched too many times to keep the audience suspending disbelief. The difference with ""Finding Nemo"" is exactly in how the predecessor manage to weave character, emotion and plot so seamlessly into a deeply touching tale. ""Finding Dory"" has good intentions, but the scene weave is just to extravagant and unmotivated to have any kind of deeply thematic effect on the viewer.<br/><br/>No doubt everyone in the family is going to have something to enjoy in the film, everybody will have loads of fun and a really pleasant time, even if it won't leave any mark the predecessor managed to leave on everybody."
"steveneven","7","5","19","16 June 2016"," Finding Dory is not as good as Finding Nemo
","It is ironic that Finding Dory's ending credits song is ""Unforgettable"", considering the film is not. The Finding Nemo sequel might not be as timeless as its 13-year-old predecessor, but it delivers the heartfelt moments and laugh-out-loud scenes that is to be expected from Pixar.<br/><br/>Finding Dory revolves around Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who lost her parents since she was a young girl. In the meantime, she has lived with clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence). As the title suggests, Dory loses her clownfish friends. As a result, Marloe and Nemo go looking for Dory. In the meantime, Dory goes looking for her parents. The question is, will Marlin and Nemo find Dory? And the bigger question is, will Dory find her parents?<br/><br/>The problem with these questions is that the film answers them at surface- level (no pun intended). Gone is the poignancy that Finding Nemo had, where Nemo loses his mother. Gone is the relevancy of plot structure, where every plot point furthered Finding Nemo. Instead, Finding Dory is a cute and harmless film where conflicts happen because they can. And, those conflicts get resolved quickly. Come on Pixar, you are better than this. <br/><br/>The film also stars some truly forgettable characters. Jenny (Diane Keaton) and Charlie (Eugene Levy) play Dory's parents, who are loving and charismatic, but are not given much to work with. As a result, they play the role of Dory's parents and that is strictly the only role they play. In Finding Nemo, there was Crush (Andrew Stanton) and the Fish Tank Gang, who were Marlin and Nemo's friends, but they were there to instill courage and hope in them. Finding Dory characters Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) and Bailey (Ty Burrell) are there to help Dory, but they do not teach her anything. If anything, Marlin and Nemo do. Yet, Marlin and Nemo taught Dory that it was okay for her to be herself in the first movie. Ergo, Finding Dory is an unnecessary sequel if Finding Nemo already established Dory's character. <br/><br/>Yet, what Finding Dory achieves, like its original, is being entertaining. The animation looks impeccable- so much so that audiences will feel like they are really at Monterey Bay. The grass, the pipelines, and the backroom all look unbelievably real. Watching the animation look so photorealistic and detailed is compelling to watch. <br/><br/>The film also has several laugh-out-loud moments. Destiny, while being a forgettable character, is the butt of a hysterical joke. The cameo in this film is also funny- gut-bustlingly funny. And, Dory has some great one-liners at Mr. Ray's school. <br/><br/>What Finding Dory also has going for it is the relationship Dory, the film's protagonist, has to her friends. Dory has a heart-to-heart moment with Hank (Ed O'Neil), her and Marlin engage in funny quarrels, and Dory has some big sister moments with Nemo. That is another advantage of Finding Dory- Dory is a very likable and engaging character. Yes, Dory's memory loss shtick can wear thin- so much so that I was rolling my eyes at how much she repeated Mr. Ray's lines. Yet, she redeems herself at the end of Finding Dory when she discovers her flaws make her who she is. <br/><br/>Essentially, Finding Dory is an entertaining sequel that stars an engaging protagonist. If one expects a clever story with characters that are as three-dimensional as the film's animation, they will be disappointed. Finding Dory fails to live up to the original, and is a sequel that was made because it could be made. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Toy Story 2 and 3 were not required to further Toy Story's plot, yet they were dimensional and gave audiences some truly developed characters. Finding Dory does not do this, but it is just as entertaining as those sequels. On that merit alone, it is worth a matinée. However, catch the matinée in 2D because the film has no pop- up moments or true depth of field in 3D."

","Finding Dory was undoubtedly the most awaited animated movie of the year as it returned to screen after 13 years of Finding Nemo. Getting back in the water 13 years after Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a supremely delightful sequel. The film defines loss and separations but never make us bore at any point of time. Andre Stanton after his failure with John Carter, came back strongly for which he is best known (Animations). Finding Dory doesn't create new standards for Pixar line of movies but surely makes it worth watching for children as well as Adults. I enjoyed the movie very much and definitely it is one of the best movies of 2016. My overall rating for Finding Dory is 5/5. Highly Appreciable."

It's a problem the animation power house never use to have but with expectations come great pressure's Pixar currently aren't living up to.<br/><br/>Finding Dory looks great (as do all Pixar films) and there are some inventive scenarios at play here but this sequel which has taken too long to come to surface fails to live up to the name we've come to expect from its classic forefather and with an annoying forgetful fish as our main point of contact, Finding Dory is more arduous for adults than we'd have liked and is one for the kiddies only.<br/><br/>2 learning on the job truck drivers out of 5"

","OK here goes. Saw Dory last night and I have to say it was better than Nemo. Going in, one should know the basic plot, hence the title. Without giving anything away, let me say that Pixar has a way with supplemental characters stealing scenes, and Finding Dory is no exception. The story starts innocently enough, giving us a bit more background on Dory and why she is why she is. The movie moves at a frenetic pace, and while Dory is the main character, her supporting cast is really what steals the show. There are plenty of scenes only Pixar could pull off, and do they ever! The ending scene made me laugh so hard I cried. I have seen every Pixar movie, and never have I laughed until my belly hurt. Dory is hilarious; kudos Pixar!"

My favorite character is Dory (main character) because she speaks whale, and that she just kept swimming. The most touching part was when Dory found her parents and they announced that they were collecting shells just for Dory. The funniest character was Gerald, the otter.

","Having raised my children on ""Finding Nemo,"" and recognizing that Nemo probably stands out as my favorite Pixar film of all time, I feel that my criticism may come from a place occupied by very high expectations. I admit that I made constant comparisons to the first movie. <br/><br/>So with that as a backdrop, I have to say that I felt ""Finding Dory"" somehow lacked the ""imaginative color"" of Finding Nemo. The new characters, while wonderful in their own individual ways, seemed less robust to me. There was plenty of comedy, but it somehow seemed a little bit like the B-side of an old 45. I kept wanting Dory to conjure up the same emotional connection I felt when I saw Nemo, but it never really delivered on that front. To this day, I get a lump in my throat thinking about the scene in Nemo when father and son finally reconnect. It was real and emotional...very human in its take on the power of family and unwavering love...and not too dissimilar from the emotions displayed by people who watch videos of soldiers returning home to surprise their children and families. Dory, by comparison, seemed to miss the emotional opportunity of this reconnection. While the story shared many similarities to the quest in the first film, I felt it was a bit more confusing and cumbersome (particularly for small children). Some of the comedy fell flat because in many ways it'd been done before, and if I'm being totally honest, Dory's forgetfulness quickly shifted from a humorous character flaw to an annoying gag as the movie went along. <br/><br/>But at the end of the day, the real question is, ""Is the movie worth seeing?"" The answer is yes, of course. If for no other reason than to reconnect with old friends in the ocean (and to make a few new ones along the way), it's worth the price of admission. The periodic flashbacks to Dory's youth are funny and sweet, as is her character as a ""toddler"". And while the water often feels dingier out of necessity to the story, Pixar has once again created a visual buffet for the viewer that is second to none. <br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" may be the ""B-side"" of the 45, but it's still a pretty good song."

","Finding Dory<br/><br/>The last place your child wants to find Dory is in his or her Filet-O-Fish sandwich.<br/><br/>Luckily, the forgetful fish in this animated-adventure is poisonous to humans.<br/><br/>When a school activity elicits a memory in the absentminded Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the regal blue tang and her adopted family (Albert Brooks, Hayden Rolence) head out in search of Dory's parents (Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy).<br/><br/>But when she becomes separated from her friends, Dory must get assistance from some new ones: an injured octopus (Ed O'Neill) and a concussed beluga (Ty Burrell). <br/><br/>Despite arriving 13-years after the original, this Pixar sequel doesn't miss a beat, delivering the studio's brand of poignant storytelling, engaging characters and off kilter humor years on. The biggest change, however, has to do with the bounds and leaps made in the animation process.<br/><br/>Furthermore, all those clownfish flushed down the toilet in 2004 will finally have new friends. <br/><br/>Green Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","Whoa! 200 million dollar film, 1 billion box office collections worldwide. The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.<br/><br/>Firstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.<br/><br/>We know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.<br/><br/>For me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.<br/><br/>The Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is supposed to be a sequel to Finding Nemo? Well No its not called Finding Nemo 2. Its called Finding Dory! Its a new movie in the Finding Nemo universe. And yes we get to see bits an pieces from Finding Nemo, but Finding Dory is its own film. Add i liked it. You know now a days when you watch a movie right?, you often get to thinking halfway into the movie if this will soon be over. You know if the movie is good but not super good. You will start wondering if its over soon. But with Finding Dory i never got that thought. When it ended i was like, wow! This went fast! I felt time flew when i watched this. I am a big fan of Finding Nemo and Pixar in general. And Finding Dory is a good edition to the Pixar universe! I had some good laughs and it has a great story! Not boring at all. Yes yes its not as good as Finding Nemo, but that's how it always is. Most of the time the next movie in a series is never as good as the first one. But its not far from it. It really is a good movie. I believe i gave Finding Nemo 8 and Finding Dory 7. And its funny, the people that really like a movie seldom writes anything about it, where as the people that don't like it often feel like they have to tell the world about it. Its the same in here. The movie rating is 7.7 but if we only took the rating of the reviews it would have a rating of 4. So don't listen to the grumpy people in the reviews! Its a good fun movie that if you liked Finding Nemo, you have should watch this too! No doubt about it!"

","Friday, 5 AUGUST 2016 Finding Dory<br/><br/>First of all what I am about to say will no doubt be taken by those reading with a few gasps and be in complete and utter shock. I don't like Finding Nemo. Never have. No matter how many times I watch it, it just isn't for me. And as someone who considers themselves to be a big, and I mean big, Disney fan it is almost criminal to say such a thing. Never the less, I went to watch Finding Dory and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film follows on a year form when the first film was set. The Nemo is still with his Dad (Marlin), but it is safe to say that in the movie it appears he hasn't aged a day, and Marlin is still a hot headed worrier. Dory still can't remember anything for more then 10 seconds, or so you would be lead to believe.<br/><br/>As the film progresses Dory is starting to remember her time when she was a child and when she knew her parents. This is a film that takes you on a heart wrenching emotional journey that will get parents in tears and children to understand what it feels like to be home. <br/><br/>The movie does have lots of comedic moments and the introduction of Hank the Septapuss (Don't worry when you watch it will make sense) is a welcome addition. The seals are also a highlight of the movie and a bit like the Seagulls in the first movie, the seals in this almost steal the show. The two Whales in the movie also bring some light relief to this emotional roller-coaster. <br/><br/>The only criticism there is to make is how far-fetched this movie is. Yes I know fish don't speak and yes I know it is computer animated, but it's the way it presents itself. Such as the Beluga Whale and its Sonar system or how the locked doors of the truck suddenly open. It just sort of makes you feel that they couldn't think up any other ideas. <br/><br/>It is hard to see on reflection what they could do next for a Finding 3. I suppose one option could be Nemo's journey to adulthood. I found Finding Dory to be a big improvement on the original.<br/><br/>The Average Joe Film Review Score: 7/10 http://tajfr.blogspot.co.uk"
"IAmMrDexB","9","3","10","17 August 2016"," So so much better.
","Let me tell you a story about Finding Nemo. It's pretty overrated, even to the point when I hated it after multiple plays of the film, because I couldn't stay repeating the film again and again. I wrote an angry IMDb review, rating it 1/10 (0.5/5), saying that the film was more boring than Plan 9 from Outer Space. I deleted it about a year or two ago. I've now given it 3 1/2 stars, as I appreciate it a bit more.<br/><br/>But this film is way way way better than Finding Nemo, which doesn't surprise as Dory was the standout of Finding Dory. What felt like a slow journey in the sea and an endless scene set in a fish tank was what made me think was overrated. Dory finding Dory was slightly obvious but the story is well presented and told. The fast paced scenes gives the film an extra sense of humour. Fish jumping from one tank to another might be very unrealistic but it sure is fun. Although the actor for Nemo wasn't changed from an child to an adult, the chemistry between Marlin and Nemo is bloody brilliant and was at times unexpectedly funny.<br/><br/>While I didn't break into tears, like I did with Inside Out, it would be no surprise if the emotion hits other people. Both happy and sad.<br/><br/>The ending though. How have they survived a year?!?"
"CraigsCritique","8","3","10","17 August 2016"," Pixar Finding Sequel Form
","It's with great pleasure and relief that I'm pleased to report I very much enjoyed Finding Dory.<br/><br/>Pixar in recent years have gone back to their hugely successful films seeing sequels to the likes of Cars and Monsters Inc, but unlike those sequels the end product of Finding Dory is a property certainly worth revisiting and was a huge relief to me, yes it can't live up to Finding Nemo, but then again how many animated films can? But what it can do is stand on its own two feet and still be a very entertaining animated feature that really when you look at this years animated films is pretty much head and shoulders above what has been this year, although I'm sure in the coming month or so Kubo and the Two Strings may up the ante in the quality animation stakes.<br/><br/>So what does the film get right? Firstly I'm glad they didn't try to go bigger with the story/plot, they didn't try to travail the ocean yet again because we would of just been retreading old ground (or should that be old ocean?) instead they use that kind of plot just on a smaller and possibly more intimate way.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Dory trying to find her parents who of course she has forgotten the location of, in doing so we end up at a sea life rescue centre/park where of we meet an array of new characters who each have very positive effects on the film.<br/><br/>The voice work is just another level when it comes to Pixar and this film is no different with Ellen DeGeneres on blistering form as the amnesiac Dory and Pixar have done it again when it comes to casting children in their films because in the flashback scenes where we see Dory as a child they cast seven-year-old Sloane Murray the daughter of this films producer Lindsey Collins and an astonishing unforgettable baby Dory will never be gone from your memory, just superb work.<br/><br/>Also like I said earlier the supporting character all have entertaining moments, my particular favourites were a Beluga Whale played by Ty Burrell, a couple of sea lions played by Idris Elba and Dominic West therefore making it a mini Wire reunion, but special mention has to go to Sigourney Weaver who plays...well herself as the park/aquarium intercom announcer, it was funny every single time.<br/><br/>It kind of doesn't even need saying but the quality of the animation is outstanding and breathtaking at times, a little mention on this does need to go to the short film Piper that played before the main feature which featured animation that if you were to blink you may struggle to determine whether it was animation or actual footage, phenomenal.<br/><br/>Yes it can't compare to Finding Nemo for absolute 10/10 high end quality but its an unfortunate comparison it does have to live with.<br/><br/>But overall it was funny, it was heartwarming and briefly it was gut-wrenching, it never overstays its welcome and you are entertained from beginning to end, I mean what more can you want from a film?<br/><br/>It's definitely Pixar finding sequel form just at the right moment in time with upcoming project sequels to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles to come in the next three years.<br/><br/>It is Pixar doing the business."
"khanz-35314","7","3","10","16 August 2016"," Fantastic , but lacks something
","I remember Finding Nemo, it was great, I remember seeing those vibrant fish and the true story of family and love.Finding Dory, takes a different route, while its still about family and friendship, it does have more of a darker story and is more deeply emotional. Dory, who is a blue tang fish suffers from short term memory loss. Her parents, Jenny and Charlie lose her. Dory, than meets Marlin, a clown-fish who's looking for his son. (This happens in Finding Nemo). Now we go onto the story of Finding Dory. The little blue tang fish is living near to her friends, Marlin and Nemo. But Dory's memories of her long-forgotten parents come flooding back to her. Dory than asks her old friends and new to help her discover her past. The story is very simple but decent , the screenplay was fine too, the editing kind of bothered me, but what did bother me the most was the characteristics. So we have the good ones from Finding Nemo. Than we have Hank, a weak and a unnecessary character to the Pixar franchise. Overall, I would recommend this movie although it does seem like a film on a commercial purpose."
"tom-43722","7","3","10","11 August 2016"," Not bad
","I find Dory rather annoying but endearing at the same time. In this film, she often remembers things that happened a long time ago, hence she specifically calls her memory problems SHORT-TERM memory loss. She never said anything, in this movie or the previous one, about long-term memory loss so remembering things that happened long ago makes sense to me.<br/><br/>What I like about Dory, despite her being annoying at times, is that she's a unique character. I've never seen another movie, apart from Finding Nemo, that deals with short-term memory loss and she has instincts and a way of getting herself out of trouble that make up for her disability. I may find Dory annoying but I haven't seen another characters like her. It's not that she's particularly complex as her personality revolves around her memory problem but she's different and that's enough to make me like her.<br/><br/>Sometimes this film makes fun of Dory's condition, as well as Destiny's sight problems, but it's supposed to be a funny film so it fits the tone. I can't speak for people who actually have these disabilities but personally, I don't think they were being too offensive with their humour. If anything, it's refreshing to see a film that's willing to take risks by using characters with disabilities.<br/><br/>With all that said, this falls short of being a great film. It was good but the story line is way too similar to the first film, which is one of the most common weaknesses you can find in a sequel, with a handful of exceptions like Kung Fu Panda 2 or the Toy Story movies. The only plot difference I noticed between this film and the first one is that while Nemo was the one who needed to BE found in the previous movie, Dory was the one DOING the finding in this one. However, I did like the way Dory's past was slowly revealed throughout the movie instead of just being shown at the beginning. It was a way of giving the audience an idea of what was going on in her head and what it's like to have memory problems.<br/><br/>Hank the octopus was likable enough, despite being a bit of a jerk but his motivations were never really explained, particularly when he changed his mind about not wanting to return to the sea. His decision to suddenly go back to the sea, despite being so determined to go to the safe place where tagged marine life goes didn't make any sense to me. However, I did like the way he moved around in places where Dory, Marlin, Nemo and the other fish characters couldn't and seeing an octopus drive a car was quite enjoyable. Due to my lack of knowledge about the species, I actually had no idea that octopuses had three hearts or could go invisible so those were interesting little things I learned from watching this film.<br/><br/>Marlin and Nemo are likable but neither of them are really interesting characters. I enjoyed the scene where they talked to the clam who was abandoned by his girlfriend though.<br/><br/>It was nice to see some of the other characters from the first film like Crush and Mr Ray but I wish Gill and the trio of sharks had appeared too.<br/><br/>Finally, they actually got Sigourney Weaver in on this project. Gotta give 'em credit for that. Although did they have to use her actual name? Why not just write a character for her like every other movie?"

","At this point, I'll wait another 10 years for Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4. Instead of unnecessarily cranking out sequels every year or two to capitalize on box office success, Pixar waited 13 years to give us Finding Dory. For me, it was well worth the wait. With plenty of heart along with a well-structured and poignant story, this Pixar sequel will give you all the feels.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, I went into the film knowing and seeing little to nothing from the film. I watched the trailers when they were released, but I wasn't wowed by anything from the marketing campaign. With that said, being a huge fan of the original back in 2003, I definitely had high expectations going in. I won't go as far as saying it's one of the best films of this year, but it will be difficult for any film this year to flood me with the amount of nostalgia and emotion that Finding Dory did.<br/><br/>There were a great number of skeptics going in about Dory, a great side character, carrying a film on her own. While the supporting cast certainly helped, I didn't have a problem with the heavy focus on Ellen DeGeneres' famous blue tang fish. Not only is her comedic charm back but the tragic backstory of Dory is what sucked me into the film. The first 10 minutes rivaled some of Pixar's most gut- wrenching moments.<br/><br/>Besides Ellen, most of the original voice talent is back, and much like the first film, it's impeccably cast. Sure, it's great hearing Andrew Stanton back as Crush, a fan favorite, but bringing in Idris Elba, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, a few SNL cast members, and one hilariously meta-cameo was brilliant. But dissimilar to other animated features, the cast doesn't overpower the importance of the story being told.<br/><br/>Finding Dory isn't without its problems, however. Perhaps it was due to my attachment to the original, but it takes a while to get used to some of the supporting fish and animals. Eventually, they each serve an important and unique purpose, but their first few scenes are sluggish for sure. Similarly, there was something special about the trip Dory and Marlin took around the ocean in the original, and the adventure here never reaches the heights of the first. That's not to say I didn't appreciate the new spin they took with Nemo and the crew, but it just didn't feel the same.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are quite a few leaps of faith you have to take as an audience member in the final act. As we reach the emotional climax, it does get a little messy and convoluted, but the overall emotional arc isn't lost. It just takes a few too many jumps at the end in what is otherwise another gem for the studio. It doesn't necessarily meet the original on many fronts, but there is a certain rush of emotion every time I hear Thomas Newman's score. So Pixar just keeps swimming to greatness as Finding Dory is one of the best films of the summer and certainly of the animated genre. <br/><br/>+Voice talent<br/><br/>+First 10 minutes<br/><br/>+Poignant and meticulously crafted story<br/><br/>+Beautiful score once again<br/><br/>-Spin on the adventure story didn't have the same effect<br/><br/>-Some suspension of disbelief is needed for the finale<br/><br/>8.7/10"
"coreyjdenford","6","5","22","29 July 2016"," Adoryble
","This is my review of Finding Dory (spoiler free) <br/><br/>***** (5/5) <br/><br/>Cast: Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brookes, Ed O'Neill, Kailtlin Olson, Hayden Rolence <br/><br/>Plot: The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.<br/><br/>Let's spare a thought for the bazillionaires at Pixar and duty they have done to make marvelous masterpieces, also the amount of Oscars they have won over the past 20+ years. Finding is just one of the many sequels to come over the next few years like Toy Story 4 (2018 was 2017) and Cars 3 (2017), this isn't like the Monsters Inc. sequel that wasn't really a sequel and also wasn't very good. This however even though it is set 1 year after Nemo gets his father but really that was 13 years ago. It isn't often that Pixar make flops unlike last year's The Good Dinosaur but other than that not many Pixar are just one of the few film companies to actually make brilliant films.<br/><br/>We all know who Dory is at this point she is a blue tang fish with a little bit of a curse she forgets everything and it's not her fault but we go along with it anyway and she has grown in popularity ever since Andrew Stanton's Finding Nemo came out, for some the director wanted to take a spin on live-action so then he made John Carter back in 2012, which saw a huge drop in the box office. The first we see on the screen is Dory living alongside Marlin (Brookes who is still as stern as ever) and Nemo (Newcomer Hayden Rolence) who is outstanding as Nemo but not as good the previous Nemo, played by Alexander Gould now 22 years old. Dory lives alongside their vicious anemone (such a hard word to say) Dory has dream of remembering her family in her mixed up way. As usual DeGeneres was an excellent choice for Dory, so then we see that dream of when she was a baby when you see baby Dory it will just make you go ""awww"" at how cute she is because she is adoryble. That dream sequence along with many other sequences in the film is one of the best.<br/><br/>Off she goes to find her parents and even with a few flashbacks along the way, she meets all sorts of new characters in the film and they are all amazing in their own way, the friend she keeps for some time is an angry cephalopod Hank voiced brilliantly by Ed O'Neill he helps her find her family and the story just plays beautifully from there, She also thinks of a new creature for Hank she calls him a Septopus because he has lost one tentacle, the two get along so well and is another list of lovable creatures for you add to the Pixar list which might be getting a bit full at the moment.<br/><br/>Not only doe you see the film from Dory's point of view but also Marlin and Nemo's point of view. From then on of course there are a few silly moments which is to be expected the most silly part which you will probably laugh at, are the lazy Sea-lions Flubber and Rudder resting on a rock voiced by the wonderful Idris Elba who has changed his way from playing Shere Khan in Jungle Book (2016) he and his friend Rudder (Dominic West) are just wonderful and they change the story so much.<br/><br/>Other characters she meets are Destiny and Bailey (Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell) they are to whales that she meets and conveniently Dory helps Destiny to swim and as for the criticizing Bailey who isn't much help at all is always bring her down, these two characters are just charming and lovable everything they do just makes the story a whole lot more to watch and to enjoy. Throughout this Pixar sequel you're never bored and it doesn't suffer the fate as many other sequelitis in fact this is just as good as Finding Nemo way back in 2003 which only if you a teenager in your late teens you will remember Nemo, and the brilliance that, that was back then.<br/><br/>Dory finally sees her family again voiced by the remarkable Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton, then of course she has to save the day again and this possibly is the most human Pixar sequel ever and when it ends you'll clapping your hands and begging for an encore. Pixar is back and it's here to stay.<br/><br/>Verdict: An adoryble sequel with plenty of charm and lovable characters another masterpiece from the geniuses at Pixar, well done guys. Oscars 2017 anyone? 10/10 a charming delight."

It definitely felt more like a Disney movie than Finding Nemo did. The interactions of some of the animated characters were more standard fare than the highly original Pixar used to produce. Overall though, this was a fun movie to watch for an adult. The young children with us lost interest about 3/4 of the way through (during a slow period while Dory was lost) and could not appreciate much of the humor in the movie older viewers could, such as reappearances from Finding Nemo and the ubiquitous presence of Sigourney during the final search."

","As far as the infamous Pixar sequels go this one was the best I have seen by far, but I'm generally not one for Pixar movies anyway. By having the release so far behind of the original ""Finding Nemo"" this sequel allowed for a younger generation to explore the sea and meet the cute and humorous fish today's adults grew up with. However, this means that the people who were most looking forward to ""Finding Dory"" were not very pleased with the outcome and anticipation, myself included. Yes, I laughed because of the humor, I wanted to cry because of the sadness, and I said the occasional ""Awww"" on both accounts but it definitely did not live up to the expectations I had put next to this movie. That is what this movie comes down to because it was, by no means, a terrible movie it just did not live up to the overpowering expectations that we all had. Whether these expectations were caused by your love for Nemo or the hype surrounding ""Finding Dory"" the outcome is the same, it can't live up to them. Would I recommend seeing this movie? Yes, in six months when it comes out on Blu-Ray and you can watch it comfortably at home and, most importantly, save money by making your own popcorn. Would I recommend seeing this movie in theaters? No, definitely not. All in all, yes I found the movie enjoyable and if you have little ones who don't know understand the expectations surrounding ""Finding Nemo"" then by all means get them out of the Summer heat and take them to see Dory, because they will definitely fall in love with her.

","Finding Dory (2016): Finding Nemo.....One of the best animation movies of all time.I love that movie and I watch it every time it comes in TV.Now its time for its sequel Finding Dory.I had huge expectations on this.So how is it???<br/><br/>Plot: Finding Dory picks up a year after the original film.Dory is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.<br/><br/>Plus Points: 1)Animation: Of course there will be no flaws in movies of Pixar and Disney.They always give best quality animation.Finding Nemo is visually beautiful with bright colors and perfect view of underwater.I loved it.<br/><br/>2)Funny Moments: Finding Dory has lot of funny moments.As Dory suffers from short term memory loss we have lot of funny situations which will make us laugh..But wonder is that it reminded me of Bhale Bhale Magadivoyyy (where hero also suffers from memory problem).<br/><br/>3)Climax: Climax is awesome and gives us ultimate fun.I constantly kept laughing through out the climax.Climax is as thrilling and funny as first part.<br/><br/>4)Voice cast: Well Voice cast is not changed from original.So they gave their best output for the roles.<br/><br/>Minus Points: 1)Only one thing is that it is not the best one as Finding Nemo.Its good but did not reached my expectations.<br/><br/>So Finding Dory is good fun to enjoy but not the best one.Funny thing to say is that Finding Dory is bit like Animated version of 1 Nennokadine with comedy like Bhale Bhale Magadivoyy (I mean that some series of situations bears similarity)<br/><br/>My rating 7.25/10"
"tjgoalie13","9","3","11","21 June 2016"," Funny, Touching, and Beautifully Animated
","Finding Dory, the long awaited sequel to Finding Nemo is here and while it's nowhere near as good as the original it's a pretty solid follow up. It should be stated that a solid follow up by Pixar is still a great film, as they've shown that they have making amazing films down to a science. Finding Dory is funny, beautifully animated, and often touching. It should be stated up front, that Finding Nemo is a nearly flawless film, and that when comparing them, Finding Dory doesn't quite live up, but on it's own merit it is still a great film.<br/><br/>One major reason that Finding Dory is so good is that it's hilarious, and not just a few moments of humor, but hilarious throughout the entire film. Much like Finding Nemo the film gives voices to animals we see and throws their own wit into what those characters would say and do, much like the crabs and seagulls from the first film. It isn't as consistently hilarious as Finding Nemo and never reaches the same range of pure hilarity and heart stopping moments, but it does have quite a few of both. Above the humor of the film another major element that worked so well for the film is the animation which is gorgeous.<br/><br/>This is true for both the film and it's short, both were gorgeously animated, so much so that it's becoming more and more realistic. Animating people still seems to be a work in progress, and we may never get that right, but when it comes to animals, Pixar seems to have a firm grip on making them look flawless. The only problem I have with this film is the story, which is okay, but coming from such a talented studio that consistently focuses on story, the story had some liberties and plot holes that aren't common from Pixar. That is the major area where Finding Nemo was so great and Finding Dory fell a little flat.<br/><br/>However, Pixar's greatest strength over the years has been it's ability to make mass amounts of people feel something watching their films. This is an amazing accomplishment, because some people are easily invested in a film and get immersed easily, while some find it very hard to get immersed in films, but Pixar seems to know how to make everybody feel something watching their films. There are multiple moments in this film that do that, and convey as with many other Pixar greats an amazing amount of emotional depth. I typically say if a film can make somebody have a visceral reaction then it's a great film, I wouldn't say this film does that but it comes very close, which is impressive in it's own right.<br/><br/>For those who loved Finding Nemo I wholeheartedly believe you'll love this film to, but restating the obvious don't expect it to match Finding Nemo. This film is hilarious, beautifully animated, touching, well paced, and features great voice acting. The film isn't as good as Finding Nemo, as it's story isn't quite as good and frankly was probably never going to be as good. That being said for all who love Pixar films, families especially, this is a great film to go see."
"dball-61330","8","4","17","16 June 2016"," Finding Dory: A Delightfully Worthy Sequel
","Thoughtful, humorous, moving and inspired. Finding Dory sees a familiar return to the deep blue, offering a new array of wonderful characters and locations. However, despite it's emotionally driven narrative and engrossing demeanor, Dory can't help but reveal some obvious flaws. <br/><br/>In the opening sequence alone, Pixar shows off it's ever-improving technical abilities in the world of animation. From the detail of coral to the skin bumps of Hank the Octopus, Finding Dory boasts an incredible wealth of creative achievement and visual splendor. Even the adorable short beforehand, 'Piper' showcases the incredibly immersive technical wizardry of today's CGI.<br/><br/>Though nothing captures the heart of the film more than it's lovable characters. Forewarning: Dory, depicted in her early childhood years, is the cutest baby fish you will probably ever have the pleasure of watching on the big screen. Aided by Marlin and Nemo, Dory finds herself in a race to rediscover her past and, along the way, stumbles across a fresh set of entirely new and often hilarious personalities. Stanton, who penned the story, does an excellent job of working and developing new characters into the film's narrative without ever feeling like they're overcrowding their space. <br/><br/>The story itself, whilst admittedly not the most original concept ever conceived, delivers and extends upon the typical Pixar formula. This ultimately creates a satisfyingly engaging piece of cinema, if not more slightly disjointed than it's definitive predecessor. All criticism aside though, it's undeniable that Dory plays on multiple emotions, from euphoria to heartache, and even moments of frustration. Finding Dory, however, seems to rely a little too much on it's jokes and low points to drive the narrative, sometimes it works gloriously, and other times it doesn't. Sometimes the realism and context of the extreme situations just feels a little to uncomfortable for entertainment pleasure. But overall, and more often than not, it works, and that is what Pixar does best. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an undoubtedly worthy and enjoyable sequel to the high-status original. Whether Finding Dory holds up the standards set by Finding Nemo is simply up to interpretation. It is unquestionable, however, that Dory is a solid film and another great addition to the Pixar canon. It exhibits strong underlying messages of perseverance, love, friendship and family, and is suitable for anyone wishing to indulge in some great moments of heartfelt entertainment. Words of advice: go see it, leave your expectations at home, have fun, don't talk. You wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>My overall rating: 8/10"
"hooma814","7","1","2","3 June 2020"," Worth the reboot!
","This was a great adventure taking us back into a much loved world of Nemo. Finding Dory, delivered in many ways that made a great sequel where others have failed. It doesn't try to make the same jokes. By focusing on Dory and her short term memory loss, the story felt really fresh but still relevant as it absolutely nails the graphics of under sea life. The visuals are incredible and have no doubt given children across the world a sense of wonder at what lives under the sea. The story was interesting and it did a good job of introducing new characters that were helpful and not annoying, unlike something like Toy Story 4 where the new characters got too much screen time and drew away from the overall storyline.<br/><br/>The second half of the film does struggle a bit when they are based in the aquarium and definitely gets way too far fetched when it comes to Dory and an octopus driving a truck down the motorway! But despite this it really hits home with a heartfelt message when Dory finally finds her parents as they are bringing back shells. It's hard to hold back the tears in this moment, and again you animation has come so far that it came make humans cry at the story of fish - it would seem odd to be staring at a fish bowl and begin to cry and be overwhelmed at the fish family! They really personify and humanise the characters. The whole movie really tugs at that question deep within us all of where do we come from, of knowing your ancestry. It's no wonder that so many people travel all over the world to make the same links as Dory does.<br/><br/>Overall its a great side story. It was never going to be as great as the original, but it is definitely well made and adds rather than takes away from the whole story."

","Surprisingly enough, Finding Dory managed to impress me even more than Finding Nemo did many years ago. It's palpable that the high-quality Pixar always delivers is still present in strong form. Finding Dory tells its story in an imaginative way, filled with clues and flashbacks that help Dory decipher her own origins. It's a type of wild adventure that only animated pictures can offer that is truly satisfying to watch, it's a thrilling ride so fantastically translated to the screen, the animation is precious. The newly added character, the octopus (well, septipus) Hank is nothing short of incredible. First off, it was greatly voiced by Ed O'Neill and his octopus mobility was perfectly captured, I was tremendously impressed every time Hank was moving around like a ninja or a trapeze artist with such effortlessness that it was engrossing to watch.<br/><br/>The film itself is highly entertaining, it does not bore nor tire at any particular moment, it is carried by a strong visual narrative that manages to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. The visuals go along really well with the story of Nemo and Marlin trying to find Dory, and Dory trying to find her parents.<br/><br/>The scene standout for me is without a doubt the truck scene where it falls to the river, freeing the fish. That is simply a stunning and inspiring scene, done so cleverly that is no surprising that it came from the masters at Pixar.<br/><br/>Check out this wonderful sequel to a Pixar classic, you may even like it a bit more, or maybe not, depends on you. But rest assure that you will have a great time with this fine animated film."

","For a sequel, this movie is actually really good. The voice acting is still great, the animation is more impressive than ever before, Dory's character development has increased, and the humor is still hilarious. We get to see Nemo, Marlin, Dory, the Tank Gang (even while their roles are rather small), and the sea turtles once again after such a long time. Not only that, but we were also introduced to new characters, such as Hank the cranky but good-hearted octopus, Destiny the nearsighted whale shark, Bailey the beluga whale with the inability to echolocate because of his big head until the big climax, the sea lions, Becky the offbeat, kooky loon, and of course Dory's parents.<br/><br/>There are also hilarious moments, like Hank hijacking the van, a fish suddenly sneezing after saying ""I feel fantastic!"", that running gag where Fluke and Rudder shout ""OFF! OFF! OFF!"", Destiny and Bailey making puns out of each other's names, and the entire touch pool scene.<br/><br/>It's been 13 years since the original movie was released and I waited so patiently for it, and I gotta admit that it was worth it. Dory's backstory was really emotional, and it was great for those who have remembered or forgotten something, and it plays like a big adventure just like the original movie. It was kinda harsh that Marlin blamed Dory for almost getting Nemo attacked by a squid, which she didn't remember, and told him to just forget. Ouch! Otherwise, great sequel! :)<br/><br/>9.5/10"

"dp-17275","8","1","2","28 February 2019"," Brilliant!
","Another brilliant Pixar movie. Incredible animation, excellent voice acting. However a nitpick towards the Nemo voice actor, obviously its a different kid voicing him but its too noticeably different but it really doesn;t matter. Pixar takes on a character that wasn't really interesting in the original finding Nemo, and makes something pretty great. The movie has an emotional story line and manages to make Dory likable and slightly interesting. The main problem with this movie is that it's just another Pixar movie, it's really nothing unique, there's no tension, there's a scene involving a chase with Marlon and Dory and it mirrors the original chase with the angler-fish in the original Finding Nemo except it has no tension. You never feel like anything is going to happen to these characters and it makes it tension-less. The movie makes up for that however by being fun, and it does not feel incredibly long, it feels quite short. The plot is quite simple but heartwarming with some fantastic music at the end. Overall the movie is very well made highly recommend, it just feels like another Pixar movie, not what could've potentially been done with a Finding Nemo sequel."

"tabuno","9","1","2","12 January 2019"," Great Animated Film Concering a Difficult Character Study
","30 June 2016. ""Find Dory"" stands out because of the of difficulty of developing a script that focuses primarily on a character who has short-term and long term memory loss. In some ways, like the challenging script of ""50 First Dates"" (2004) where Drew Barrymore plays Lucy Whitmore, a human who also suffers from memory loss, in a live action comedy, the ability to maintain interest and a delicate balance of respect for such characters is definitely not easy to accomplish. Nevertheless in both instances, both comedies accomplish a continuing series of fumbles and ironic come backs that offer both humor and sympathy for their female characters. ""Finding Dory"" offers up some great comic lines, a fast and involving pace with captivating and emotive interest. More involving with its extensive character portrayal more so than the classic ""The Incredibles"" (2004) as a close collection of family members, the audience gets to experience a more personal, intimate voyage much like those found in the animated dog move ""Bolt"" (2008), the lonely sci fi robotic waste collector ""Wall*e (2008), even the live musical drama ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001), the lonely adventure of a woman in ""Wild"" (2014) or the personal blacker demons of ""Black Swan"" (2010).<br/><br/>Except for a rather abrupt and not fully developed scene regarding Dory's parents later in the movie which doesn't come across as smoothly, this animated film stands out for its compelling interesting pacing and engaging comedy revolving around a rather peculiar but very likable lead character."

","Wow. A sequel to Finding Nemo. When I first heard of this movie, I was very skeptical of its ability to be entertaining. For one, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's best films. Everything from the visuals, to the story, to the ambient music was top notch creative design. To feel the emotions that this film is meant to evoke, you will have had to watch Finding Nemo, as it contains many aspects of Dory's younger self in an ambiguous form. Lots of moments in this movie make you think back to the first and say to yourself, ""ohhh that's why..."". There are lots of small points of humor that can be missed if one is not really paying attention, although most of them are quite obvious. The plot is amazingly fluid, at no point do you ever feel a pause or break in the story. One of those movies that it is hard to add commercials to if aired on TV. This is reflective of Dory's character in that she just keeps ""swimming"". Every obstacle she faces is taken in perfect stride, just as every scene in the movie flows from one to the next. And the music is so perfectly fit to the situations and story; it creates a real feeling of immersion that you can only really enjoy if you let the film play in front of you, instead of picking it apart as you watch. If anyone hasn't seen either movie, please watch both in order, feel the story as it happens, don't sit outside of it."

","Finding Dory is the sequel to the well-known film Finding Nemo. It is an animated adventure/comedy film directed by Andrew Stanton who was also the director of the first film a while back in 2003. It stars Ellen DeGeneres, among others.
 The movie is about Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss who remembers short clips of what it seems to be her past before she got lost in the ocean. As she travels back to find her family, she keeps remembering this memory that helps her find her way back.
 There are a lot of new characters in this movie. There's a grumpy septopus (he only has seven tentacles) who can mimic things, which is helpful for Dory to find her family. There's also a whale shark who can only see close objects. Moreover, also some old characters have come back
 I think this is a great movie to watch with your family. It is sometimes funny, sentimental and adventurous. The animations are so good that you feel like you are underwater. I recommend you watch it with your family or friends; I can assure you will have a great time!"

","After hitting rock bottom with the release of Cars 2 and the mostly disappointing Monster University, I'm happy to see how Pixar was able to capture the essence of what made Finding Nemo so memorable yet again. <br/><br/>I always wondered where Dory came from and all that stuff. And how that journey was strung together is yet again filled with memorable characters both old and new. <br/><br/>The flash backs used for Dory's steady recall of who her parents are and how she got away from them was a clever choice of narrative, because that was how it was supposed to be in ""Nemo"" about how Marlin lost his wife and children. It works so well in here because of the short-term memory loss of Dory.<br/><br/>With that said, I must address a few problems with the movie. You see, I loved how both Nemo and Marlin figured out there escape plans in the first movie, and that is only occasionally the case in Finding Dory. Many times it just seemed like something just happened to go that way or that just happened be there. It made me feel like: ""oh, that was adequate"". <br/><br/>But aside from that, it captured all the things that made me love the original, so all in all it is a solid movie."

","This movie is about Dory, the sweet forgetful fish from Finding Nemo, finding her family. There is a very touching ""Pixar"" moment when this is resolved. But the rest of the movie...<br/><br/>OK, we do not expect movies to be realistic. But we expect some level of plausibility. In Finding Nemo, a large portion of the movie is dedicated to planning how to get one fish out of a fish tank. In Finding Dory, every move the characters have to do (like getting from the ocean to a tank, or a tank to another tank) is about 100 times more difficult, and is solved with about 1/100th of the effort. There was the same problem with dreadful Cars 2: they feel the need to ""up"" the action, to the point that the amazing is commonplace. There are no highs and lows, no tension, just wall to wall actions for the kids. And to paraphrase one of the good Pixar movies: ""When every action in the movie is super... nothing is."" <br/><br/>Great if you're with kids under about 10. But if you're older and want a nostalgic follow-up Finding Nemo - disappointng."

","Finding Dory is a G-rated film that is a sequel to the popular movie, Finding Nemo. The movie is based on the character, Dory, and her short-term memory. Her short-term memory is what I love about Dory the most since it makes her humorous. In the film she begins to sleep-swim. During her dreams, she sees her parents and memories of her childhood. What sparked Dory's memory of finding her family was the conversation that Nemo had with Dory about family, than she later hit her head which sparked a flashback of her parents. One day Marlin and Nemo are unable to find her after they awake. The movie shows Dory's adventures in the aquarium and Marlin and Nemo's journey trying to find Dory. Along the way she finds out that she was born at an aquarium in Sydney, Australia. Turns out Dory ends up in an aquarium where she was born which is ironic since her short-term memory lead her astray. I enjoyed this movie due to its humorous, innocent jokes and its sense of nostalgia. It introduces new characters, such as Destiny and Hank. These new characters' play key roles in helping not only Dory get to her family but Nemo and Marlin in getting to Dory. Also, the movie's graphics were bright and detailed which captured the audiences attention which is necessary to capture children's attention. There were only a few scenes where the movie failed to make us laugh. Somehow even after a series of serious moments, the dialogue and personalities of the characters were able to make me laugh. This film did a good job at making a sequel to a well adored movie, which is often not the case. Also, I enjoyed how there was a surprise appearance of Sigourney Weaver as the announcer of the aquarium at Sydney, Australia. Definitely would recommend to all ages!"

It was drawn out, and way less sentimental than Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo showed the utter despair and depression that Marlin faced when Nemo was taken.

It's also kind of that quest for your past story where you have to find those special to you, even if you've only known them for a short while. Who hasn't had that experience or event in life?

","Amnesiac Blue Tang Dory takes centre stage in this sequel to Finding Nemo: Finding Dory might more accurately be called Finding Dory's Parents, although Dory finds herself, too.<br/><br/>Dory's memory which, we know from Finding Nemo, is highly unreliable in the short term, conveniently returns sufficiently for her to recall her parents and, voila, we have our plot. Dory, accompanied by Marlin and Nemo, goes on a search which takes her to an extensive Sea Life Centre, where her trip from tank to tank, exhibit to exhibit, is helped enormously by a 7-tentacled octopus (heptopus?) who is talented at slithering from place to place.<br/><br/>The story is fairly straightforward - far from dissimilar to Finding Nemo, in fact - but, rather than the heart of the story being the need to let go of your children (quite a deep concept for a kids' film), here it is friends, family and hope, a more accessible idea for a young audience.<br/><br/>Dory is a likeable character as we already know, but is she strong enough to carry a whole film? My personal jury delivers a mixed verdict here. Baby Dory is simply wonderful, and Ellen DeGeneres does an exemplary job as the voice of adult Dory, but I found that a little of Dory's constant disquiet over her forgetfulness went a long way. And there was a lot of it, so it went a very long way. I understand that it was the central element to the plot, and that it was used to ratchet up the emotional stakes: I still found it tiresome.<br/><br/>On the visual side, the often quite lovely visuals were matched with an awful lot of swimming about in dark, murky tunnels, pipes, weeds and depths - the film wasn't as dazzlingly eye-catching as Finding Nemo. Having said that, the finale was great, and the reveal of the multiple shell-trails caught me by surprise and choked me up.<br/><br/>The 3D had little value.<br/><br/>This is a worthwhile sequel with much to enjoy, but Finding Nemo is still the reigning champeen."

","Those who have seen 'Finding Nemo' will remember Dory the Blue Tang with short term memory problems but just in case you haven't watched it or have forgotten, the opening of 'Finding Dory' shows us Dory as a child with her parents; she gets separated from them and starts asking other fish for help but as she can't remember where they were or what they are called she doesn't find them. Eventually she forgets all about them and her search. She then bumps into Marlin, a scene that features near the start of 'Finding Nemo' as well.<br/><br/>A year passes and suddenly Dory realises that she must have a family and determines to find then. Various things lead to her remember that she was from 'The Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California'. With the help of the sea turtles she, along with Marlin and Nemo head to California. Dory gets tangled in some plastic and pulled from the water by a worker from the local Marine Life Institute. Here she meets Hank the octopus who offers to help her find her parents; she also gets help from a short-sighted whale shark who knew Dory when she was little and a beluga whale who thinks his sonar is broken. While Dory is looking for her parents Marlin and Nemo are trying to find Dory with the help of a pair of sea lions, a slightly batty loon and some cute sea otters.<br/><br/>In many ways this film is a rerun of the first with fish looking for each other across the width of the Pacific thankfully they are plenty of differences too. Dory makes a charming lead; it is certainly interesting to have a lead character with a mental health issue as protagonist in something that isn't an 'issue film', especially one aimed at younger viewers. Dory's memory issues are dealt with in a way that manages to show that she copes in her own ways and isn't overly played for laughs. The new characters are pretty good; I particularly liked Hank the grumpy octopus and Destiny the myopic whale shark. There are plenty of child-friendly perilous moments and some good laughs as well as one or two melancholy moments; these don't last long enough to make things depressing though. As one would expect from a Pixar film the animation is of a very high quality and the voice cast do a great job; especially Ellen DeGeneres who brings a real emotional depth to the role of Dory. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Pixar, especially those who enjoyed 'Finding Nemo'."
"zmcgowen","8","1","2","28 April 2017"," Finding Dory and the Value of Being ""Different""
","As a parent of two small children and big fan of pretty much all things Pixar (""The Good Dinosaur"" being the notable exception), I was anticipating this film as much as almost any I have experienced. For the most part I really enjoyed this movie, though there were certainly points where it fell short, almost all of which had to do with the plot.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW: Plot = Overly complicated - With a movie title like ""Finding Dory"" it is no surprise that conceptually the plot borrows heavily from the original. The impetus of Dory's initial journey is to find her family in much the same way Marlin leaves the reef in search of Nemo. While the background behind the ""lost family member(s)"" is different, the motif is the same... of course, if that were the end of the body of narrative the movie would have been called ""Finding Jenny and Charlie,"" so there is a shift where Dory, who is in search of her parents, becomes herself ""lost"" (though she is not entirely aware of that) and must be ""found"" by Marlin and Nemo. In the process of all this ""finding"" more plot twists ensue with ultimately a truck-driving octopus (septopus) launching himself and a box-truck full of sea life into the air and diving into Morro Bay... It's a more than a bit over-the-top even by cartoon standards. For me that's where the shortcomings end...<br/><br/>Characters=Delightful - Where this film shines is in the characters... With the exception of Marlin and (to a lesser extent) Nemo (though I think their lack of likability helped move the story along), all the characters were likable and compelling. Ed O'Neill as Hank was a welcome foil to Ellen DeGeneres' optimistic Dory, and their back-and-forth dialogue rounded out Dory's character in a nice way.<br/><br/>With all its delightful characters and stunning artistry what stands out is that this is an important movie for all people because it reminds us of the value of every single person regardless of their perceived brokenness. Character after character in this film deals with some physical or mental challenge: Becky, Destiny, Hank the Septopus (!), Gerald, Bailey (though his is more a challenge of accepting his wellness), and the host of other ill sea creatures that are at the marine life institute to get well. All these characters work to greater or lesser degrees to the ultimate end of the narrative (as convoluted as it is). And of course, the central figure of the film Dory is notorious because she suffers from ""short- term remembery loss"". It is this challenge that caused her to lose her way, but it is also this challenge that helps her maintain an (almost) endless optimism. (As a side note, the opening sequence of Dory's parents trying to help her find her way around their home was both endlessly touching and heartbreaking). In fact, it is not until Marlin and Nemo (the least likable of the central characters) begin to thoughtfully ask the question, ""What would Dory do?"" That they begin to have any real impact.<br/><br/>As a pastor, I am constantly trying to remind people they are made in the image and likeness of God... that there is a significant divine imprint on everyone. As a pastor who advocates for families and children with special needs in the faith community, I see how important this ideal is to reiterate amid the challenges these families face. As a person who has many many friends with children with autism, Down syndrome, and the like, I am encouraged by their stories of realization and gratitude. <br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" demonstrates that what may seem like a brokenness in a person is but an opportunity to see life from a different and fresh perspective that, while not without its difficulties, is rewarding."
"Honu-86","8","1","2","11 April 2017"," A fun and heartwarming romp in the sea
","While, to me, Finding Dory was not as good as Finding Nemo - and rarely, in my opinion, do sequels hold a candle to their predecessors - I still found this movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and heartfelt; an entertaining addition to the Disney lineup. <br/><br/>With the mere mention of Dory's family in the first film comes the concluding chapter into who Dory really is. The film includes some new and hysterical characters who each provide their own charm and humor and, of course, Dory is as gleefully clueless as she was in the first film. The new environments and scenarios she finds herself in are all beautifully animated and baby Dory is to die for.<br/><br/>The only critique I have would be Marlin and Nemo's inclusion in Dory's quest to find her family. Their presence, while supportive, seemed at times to be more distracting, taking away from Dory as the main focus of the story. Marlin is obviously more approving of Nemo's independence and open to crazy ideas, so there's not much more growth to his, or Nemo's, character. <br/><br/>Overall, however, I found the movie to be greatly entertaining and a joy to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the first."
"davispittman","9","3","12","26 June 2016"," Better than the original
","Finding Dory (2016) is even better then the original film, Finding Nemo. This movie is just fun and OMG it is so heartwarming! I cried more than once while watching it. Ellen of of course is still awesome as Dory, and her parents were so great! Diane Keaton was great as Dory's mom, perfect choice for her mother, and Eugene levy is good too. The comedy here is even better than in the first movie, there are definitely moments of pure hilarity. Along with those funny moments, are the scenes that are heart warming and beautiful. The dialogue here is spot on and it just goes to show the talent of the writer for this film. The adventures and different obstacles that Dory, Nemo and Marlin go through to find dorys parents are fun, engaging, and well done. It's tough to find a sequel that surpasses the original, it just simply does not happen a whole lot, but here, in my opinion, this one did surpass the original. Don't get me wrong, I love finding nemo, but finding dory is just better I think. 9/10 for Finding Dory, this is the perfect family film to go and enjoy, suitable for all ages really. And there is a great positive message to go with this movie. Part of that message is revealed in the credits. ""This film is for all families - every kind"". That is so awesome, and it teaches children that all types of families are good and loving, and that we don't all have to be the same. So go and have some fun with Finding Dory!"

","This is honestly the best Pixar movie I've seen in my whole life. I was about 6 when I saw Finding Nemo, and Dory got to me so mush I couldn't get her out of my head. When I was 12, I couldn't stop watching Nemo just for Dory. She still was in my system-- amazingly.<br/><br/>But let me tell you, I will never, ever, EVER, forget this film. It's one of this year's best, PERIOD.<br/><br/>Now to any people who think Finding Nemo is better than this one, you better think again. Finding Dory has twice the emotional heart wrench than I thought it would have. I mean, I was actually sobbing in the first half of the movie. It had hurt me very deeply, but in the best way.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was AMAZING. All those beautiful scenes, the funny scenes, the emotionÂ…it all came together perfectly. I definitely recommend this film to everyone I know. You will NOT be disappointed, I promise you."
"Quinoa1984","8","4","19","17 June 2016"," Pixar does what it does, and they shine often
","Hey, sometimes a sequel that's very good is good enough. That may be the take-away to have with Finding Dory, which follows up on Finding Nemo 13 years after that film introduced children and adults around the world to Marlin, Dory, Nemo and the other sea-bound characters (though the events take place about a year after the start of the first story). Sometimes a sequel is hard to pull off, even (especially) if it's by the same group involved in pulling off wonders with the first one. What expectations will we have? Can the jokes all work if there's no surprise anymore to things like Dory's short-term memory loss or her catch phrase ""just keep swimming"" diddy or her whale-speak? As it turns out the people at Pixar are high-functioning geniuses because they do make us care about Dory, who was a heartfelt but ultimately comic foil (sometimes a helpful one) in the first story), as someone who has full agency for her own tale and in this it's... finding her family, of course.<br/><br/>It's familiar, yes, we've seen this before. Maybe a lot of kids coming to see this - and who knows if you may take them to it as one of their first movies ever - won't see it as tired or hackneyed as something adults have seen many times. It all depends on the ingredients the filmmakers put into the story that counts. Here Dory finds herself coming to California at a marine park full of fish in aquariums (and helpfully the voice of Sigourney Weaver, no really it's her, is there to welcome everyone to the park and she becomes in a funny way like some minor God in this realm to the fish), and her mission is simple: find her parents and use the clues dug deep in her scattered long-term memory to find them, with the help of some new under-water friends like Hank the octopus (well, septupus since he has seven limbs, one is lost but hey Ed O'Neill), a near-sighted whale-shark (Kaitlin Olson) and a beluga whale (Ty Burr).<br/><br/>The filmmakers never pass up a chance for comedy, and I'd say nine times out of ten they're successful with big laughs for the audience as a whole. Whether the kids will be laughing at some things more than the adults, and visa-versa (I don't think they give a darn or even know who Weaver is, for example), but once again applause must be given to how deftly Stanton and his writing team balance out major comic-peril and behavior related comedy with some dark-sad moments too. And Dory, again, makes for an unlikely compelling protagonist. It seems odd to make her the hero of a story as someone who can't remember anything - it worked in Memento but that was a noir with tattoos of memories written on someone's damn skin - since in order to have forward momentum you need to remember things that can take you from A to B to C. Some of the fish friends help, and sometimes those conveniently times long-term memory flashes (including an incredibly cute little Dory by the way) help her along.<br/><br/>If I feel at all hard on the film, which by the way keeps consistent with the first movie's gorgeously rendered sea world of creatures and environments and small details that make up everything here and yet is stronger than what was available in 2003, it's because Pixar continues to set the bar so high for themselves. If you're the Picasso or Van Gogh of your medium, then as much at it may not be fair to judge the still wonderful works as flawed it's still something to point out (not that this movie doesn't try harder or swing for the fences more than the majority of kids animated fare out there, with the exception of Disney animation studios).<br/><br/>If there were two main issues, aside from little pieces of familiarity that stuck out (or the occasional gag that didn't work for me, like the, uh, mentally challenged seal character, hey guys, if you already have an 'off' bird character, don't get greedy with two), it's these: Nemo and Marlin are in the story and are supporting characters which is fine except they aren't really given much to do, and while their story was told in the first movie aside from comic peril situations (albeit well times and executed with Brooks always game in the role) it doesn't add much to the story that's here. The other is the third act reaches too far into upping the ante moment to moment and there's an air of anti-climax since, well, the real emotional climax is already found, and you can sort of guess where that's coming too (also by this point Dory's memory loss is not really taken as much into account story-wise as it could/should be).<br/><br/>And yet Finding Dory is a charmer and a full delight because the filmmakers are sincere with how they present this story and is one of the must-sees of the summer. To put it another way, it is great, just flawed-great if that makes sense and the 3rd best Pixar sequel for what it's worth."
"cloudj-11044","6","2","7","28 July 2016"," Please- be kind to people with special needs!
","My 4 year old daughter loved this movie. She loves fish, and she knew all the characters' names before watching it. My daughter has autism, and hyperactivity disorder, but she was able to sit through most of this movie, which makes the movie a success in my book! The only thing that disturbed me and may keep me from buying this movie on blue ray is the way Gerald the seal is treated by the other two other seals. They refused to share their rock with him, even when he was sad about it. They tricked him several times, yelled at him, and treated Becky the loony loon better than they treated him. They could have made fun of the fat seal, but that would have been mean,yes? So to get laughs, which the children in the audience did, they zeroed in on the seal who was not the same as them. In a time where society is more aware of bullying and trying to take measures against it, where the affect of bullying is being splashed across every media outlet, and where more children than ever are being diagnosed with special needs, I feel that movies do not need to generate laughs by having characters be cruel to each other. There is never a reason to treat another cruelly, and Pixar needs to find another way to create a funny scene."
"Miguel_Melo","7","3","13","1 July 2016"," Completely unnecessary rehash
","I never understood why people loved Finding Nemo so much: the story was unexciting and the main characters (Merlin and Dory) were fairly one-dimensional. So I went into ""Finding Dory"" with low expectations... and I can't really say that I was far off.<br/><br/>Dory really is a one-trick pony (fish?) - she forgets things... and that's it. To make matters worse, the film ensures we don't forget that by driving the point home until it grates.<br/><br/>The film does pick up a bit and provide a few laughs when a motley crew of quirky secondary characters like Hank the curmudgeon octopus or Becky the loony bird come to Dory's aid, but you have to worry when Pixar needs to rehash a story line around forgettable characters. Luckily, the intro short is a lot more endearing than the main feature. 6.5/10"
"anthonymichaelbangert","8","3","13","22 June 2016"," Pixar's Fish Still Got It
","Finding Dory is the 2016 sequel to the beloved Pixar film Finding Nemo. In this movie, the lovable Dory, a blue tang fish with short term memory loss voiced by Ellen Degeneres, starts to get fragments of memories about her long lost parents and sets out on a quest to find them. She is joined by Marlin and Nemo (Albert Brooks and Hayden Rolence) as they travel to California. There, Dory goes to a Marine Life Rehabilitation Center and meets Hank (Ed O'Neil) a Septopus and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) a whale shark with farsightedness who help her navigate the facility. This movie, as with all Pixar films, had a lot of heart. The story felt important. The stakes felt high. It didn't pander to kids. There was no real enemy or bad guy. This was an isolated story about what a home and a family really means. Baby Dory is adorable. And adult Dory is sweet, and sad. Anyone watching can feel her emotions. You understand her pain, and her insecurities. The animation, as always, is gorgeous. So much detail. The Ocean feels like it's there. It feels alive. There's so much to take in, and you can tell the animators really put in a lot of love to make this. The voice acting and scripting is top notch. The words and the characters give an almost perfect balance of comedy and drama. The emotions are genuine. The plot points are put together quite well. This movie is not as emotional as Finding Nemo. The stakes are nowhere near as high. However, it is still a quality film that is worth seeing, and felt as if it had a place in the Pixar world, and the Nemo lore. I'd say it was about as good as the Original Film. And would give it a solid 8/10. Go See It."

","This sequel introduces some memorable new characters, and sets them up within some really quite funny scenes. From scene to scene, and through a child's eyes, this film will deliver.<br/><br/>However, the weight of this jumble of frenetic scenes threatens to collapse the thin narrative and simplistic emotional framework underpinning it all. The scenes and dialogue are great, but there are too many ideas being thrown at a rather flimsy concept. The film feels long, there is too much geographic back and forth. Parts of the film, though entertaining, seem unnecessary in the larger scope of the tale.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic ride for the most part, but the adult in me can't help wonder whether this essentially basic story really needed an entire movie to tell.<br/><br/>For many, this film will provide an entertaining outing into a world we haven't heard from in 13 years. Sadly, while I can appreciate the film's many positives, it feels all too long, tries to do too many things without enough narrative drive, and the main plot was not enough to keep me absorbed throughout."
"sharky_55","7","3","13","21 June 2016"," Mommy likes blue shells...
","If anything Finding Dory does a pretty good job of connecting the dots to its predecessor. This does not feel like a sequel forced by the executive's hand but rather the natural extension of Dory's own journey. When she breaks down near the end of Finding Nemo because Marlin has given up hope and is left to drift alone in the oceans, there is a suggestion that there is more to uncover for her character than just her goofy, comedian-voiced antics. But that film was about Nemo - this one is about Dory's origins. <br/><br/>For much of the film it relies and retreads the same emotional ground as Finding Nemo did. On its own, it does quite well. The young Dory is practically cuteness overload, with big bug eyes nearly bulging out from the eye sockets and strategically mispronounced words which instantly paint her vulnerability as well as Nemo's little fin did many years ago - admittedly without Newman's gentle, floating title track, which again is familiar, but dulled. The loss is meant to be tragic, and we are supposed to sympathise. Is it a mistake to be overly familiar? Andrew Stanton is asking us to offer the same emotional stakeholds, but has fallen short of giving us the same story and characters worth rooting for.<br/><br/>The film's climax is the most egregious offender. The basic principle behind both is that the child is once again going off to commit a daring rescue - Dory launching herself into the truck, and Nemo into the fishing net. The conflict arises from the parent(s) not wanting to part with their child after such a long time apart. But for Marlin this rings so much truer. We've swam alongside him across the entire east coast, through jellyfish masses, in complete trench darkness, away from a minefield inhabited by semi-vegetarian sharks, even in a whale's mouth. For Marlin to go through all that and then once again let Nemo slip would be agonising. The fact that it was Nemo's own incompetence that led to his capture makes it doubly meaningful - only by finally trusting his son's now improved judgement can he begin to grow and learn himself (we see a little of that here too). It's a very delicately constructed dilemma, and fraught with tension. We get little of that in Finding Dory, however. The moment between Dory and her parent's reluctance is short-lived, and besides the point. Instead of a thoughtful and character building scene we get a wacky action set- piece that never ever seems actually tense or life-threatening. The octopus-driven truck can weave in and out of traffic or go round and round in circles for as long as the jokes need it to be, but we are never made to doubt that Dory will make it back to the ocean. <br/><br/>Nemo and Marlin's inclusions almost seem questionable, in fact. The row which separates the group is minuscule and insignificant; Dory swam a little too fast and Nemo gets hit on the head. This is enough to open up old wounds and grievances about Dory being a complete airhead, which have been apparently bubbling under for over a year. But in the space of a day it is all neatly resolved, with a vague aspiration that sometimes her crazy antics might seem useful. This varying degree of chaos versus helpfulness is noticeably contrived, especially when it involves hair-raising aquatic acrobatics that make Gill's escape plan look like a little tumble in the park. It's cartoon of course, so these things are forgivable - what isn't is the implication that Dory's wackiness is some magic mantra that will somehow get you where you need to go. <br/><br/>Finding Dory's strengths lie in its visuals and humour. Whilst the predecessor broken ground with its water animation, Pixar have gone above and beyond that to present an eye-poppingly gorgeous world that prompts the audience to once again race to the nearest aquarium (and have the new generation of kids excitedly point out ""There's Nemo!""). It isn't quite as photo-realistic as its preceding short, but nevertheless looks stunning. Stanton has also shown the ability to build on at least some of the elements that he previously mastered. We had psycho Darla with Hitchcock music and all, but here we have a very original and humorous gag involving a touch pool where fingers becomes exploding landmines and the fish all experience waves of PTSD from the roaming little hands. Overall Finding Dory is competent as far as Pixar standards go - it hits the right emotional beats without complete reliance on the already familiar backstory, and is bright and colourful enough to bring in the attractive box office numbers. But its best feature must be reminding me just how great Finding Nemo was and still is. Has sunlight hitting the ocean sand ever looked so gorgeous?"
"jakedog-1","7","3","13","19 June 2016"," Keeps hitting walls
","The film is very funny, and there is wonderful creativity and imagination at play here. But these movies, all movies, are about the building of momentum, and Finding Dory can't seem to link it's set pieces effectively. It reaches a jog but keeps stumbling. You clench in your seat, you want it to keep moving. I can't believe 3000 people can work on a movie but no one sat the director down and told him there are too many slow, stirring scenes with piano twinkling in the background where characters convince Dory that she is special. There are at least four and every time they murder whatever rhythm the film had going. They tread on the groove. They are dull, superfluous. This message is built into the plot, we feel it, we don't need to be told it. There needs to be only one of these scenes, and it needs to come before the climax. The climax has THREE. Heck I was antsy, god knows what the 3 year old's will be doing.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie is very funny, it almost feels like it was written for adults. The jokes are for the internet generation. They feel like memes. When a truck flies off a cliff in slow motion spilling fish everywhere and a salmon slaps two sea lions to the tune of ""What a wonderful world"" the movie becomes absurdist. I felt like I was watching a video that would crop up on my Facebook feed, edited by a stoner. Frankly the jokes might be a touch too strange, they undermine the reality of this world. They are funny but phony. Too meta. Perhaps they belong in a different film.<br/><br/>Look, the point is you will enjoy this film. It's thoroughly enjoyable. But I just don't think there is enough adventure here to have kids coming back, and kids are really the only ones who come back."
"Biodigital_Jazzman","7","3","13","18 June 2016"," Another great Pixar film, but the original is still the best
","With John Lasseter at the helm, it's hard for Pixar to make a bad movie. But some are better than others and resonate more with the viewers. All of them are entertaining, and the best bring a fresh perspective on what it means to be human. Finding Nemo was (and still is) a brilliant piece of art, not only one of the greatest animations of all time, but one of the greatest movies, period. The core of Finding Nemo was a parent having to finally let go of his child so that the child could grow, something every parent could understand and every child could relate to. I'm hard-pressed to say exactly what Finding Dory is about, though. Some reviewers have said it's about dealing with disabilities. Some have said that it's about family. And there are certainly moments where that's true. But I never got a sense of a strong theme that carried through the entire movie and gave the coherence that Finding Nemo had.<br/><br/>There are many exciting showpiece moments, the requisite chase scenes and threatening creatures. There are lots of comic relief moments. But throughout the movie I kept thinking that I had seen it all before (ironic considering Dory can't remember one moment to the next). Many scenes so closely echoed the original that occasionally I wondered if Pixar had simply copy-and- pasted them from the original and then changed a few characters and scenery pieces.<br/><br/>Even though I know talking fish with front-facing eyes is a hard premise to swallow, I could accept that. In Finding Nemo, I never once questioned many of the improbable things that happened (like the dentist office escape), because the story made it all seem possible. But in Finding Dory. too many of the scenes seemed so impossible -- even in the context of an animation -- that I simply couldn't accept them. Instead, those moments came across as convenient plot devices when the writers had backed themselves into a corner.<br/><br/>I did like how Andrew Stanton was able to connect certain elements from the original in a way that formed a deeper backstory about Dory. But I never found myself connecting with the characters the way I did in the original. I read an article about how the movie's creators wanted to make the film have a heart. Well it does have that, but I think it needed a stronger spine."

"RLTerry1","7","3","14","17 June 2016"," A Cute but Ultimately Emotionally Static Sequel to a Beloved Classic
","Disney-Pixar's highly anticipated sequel Finding Dory makes a splash this week. Following the critically acclaimed success and continued popularity of Finding Nemo, Finding Dory hopes to find a place in your heart as well. Unfortunately, this film struggles to leave as lasting an impact as the first movie. Many film and Disney enthusiasts, approaching this film, knew that it was most likely going to be either a Cars 2 or a Toy Story 2; it falls somewhere between the two, but closer to the former. Not straying too far from from the plot of its predecessor, Finding Dory's message about disabilities turned strengths get a little lost in the emotionally static feel and somewhat forced turning points and dialog. The film certainly has its moments of laughter and surprise, but those are few and far between. Using its predecessor as an example, it is highly unlikely that Ellen DeGeneres could have been replaced by any other voice actor and the character of Dory still remain as endearing; however, honestly in this film, not just Ellen, but any of the other voice actors could have been replaced and the characters and plot play out just the same. A film needs to be a roller coaster of sorts--have its ups and downs--but Finding Dory pretty well stays rather somber the entire time. But yes, it does have some funny and pull-at-your-heart-strings moments. All in all, this movie feels like a forced sequel that wasn't entirely necessary but produced in response to the high demand for a return to the world of Dory, Marlin, Nemo, and their friends.<br/><br/>Like with Zootopia as well as other Disney films, there is usually a message in the subtext of its animated features and shorts. Finding Dory clearly has a message about perceived disabilities. Perceived in that, what is otherwise a physical or emotional disability, can be used to develop strengths. Most of the characters that you will encounter in this movie have some kind of disability. Dory and her memory is the main one, but there are definitely others. I don't want to give much away, so we'll just leave it at that. Although I feel the approach to writing this message into the diegesis of the film was a bit forced or heavy-handed, it doesn't take away from the fact that it was handled very well and is mostly seamlessly integrated into the plot and mild character development. The two characters who offer the audience the most, in terms of character arc and development are Dory and her septopus friend Hank (Ed O'Neill). What's a septopus? Just watch the film and find out. Both characters are mildly entertaining but lack that magical spark that was so much a part of Finding Nemo. One area that sequins sometimes find themselves in, is pulling from the first movie so much that you leave the sequel wondering why it was even necessary. Thankfully, that really isn't the case with Finding Dory. But you'll be happy to know that you will see some familiar faces from the first one, including everyone's favorite sea turtle and stingray. <br/><br/>I had the fortune of screening the film with one of the lead vocalists from Disney's Animal Kingdom's Finding Nemo the Musical. And I won't disclose who it was, but he ""totally"" eats, breaths, and sleeps Nemo and his friends. This was a fantastic opportunity to include an analysis of, not only my point of view on the film, but someone else's who has a lot of time and energy vested in this property. I half expected him to disagree with me after the movie ended when we began discussing it. But, it turns out that he feels very much the same as I do. He was able to point out some elements that were actually taken from the show at Animal Kingdom, which was really cool! It's a show that I watch fairly often as well, as I am a former Cast Member myself and current Annual Passholder. Having the ability to discuss Finding Dory in regards to how it fits in with not only its predecessor but the live show was fantastic! He echoes many my same opinions on the movie, but also adds that the kid behind us told their mom that it was amazing. So, in terms of how well this film plays out for children, it does a great job. Many of the young people are about the same age I was when I saw the first one. I think what I missed most in Finding Dory as opposed to Finding Nemo is the lack of comedy. There is definitely some funny moments in the film but the comedic timing and structure simply doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor. Reminds me of a quality just above a straight to DVD/BluRay or a commercial-free Disney Channel Original Movie. Let's remember this: Toy Story 2 was also a fairly week sequel--albeit entertaining and heartwarming--and then it came back with the phenomenal tear-jerker Toy Story 3, so it is entirely possible that the Nemo property will go through the same evolution. <br/><br/>Competing against Central Intelligence and a handful of limited releases, Finding Dory is sure to beat out the competition this weekend. And for what it's worth, it is a fun movie that warms those of us in our 20s and 30s with childlike nostalgia of when we first saw Nemo. Is this destined to be the next great Disney-Pixar film? Probably not. However, that doesn't mean that you cannot enjoy it with your friends or family. Certainly, it is a wonderful movie to be enjoyed with those who love seeing familiar characters and meeting new ones. I just wouldn't go into the movie looking for an excellent and dynamic story."

","This is a terrific sequel to Finding Nemo. It actually tells about where Dory came from and that she actually does have short term memory loss. It also tells where she got that valuable life lesson from. She got the saying just keep swimming from her parents. You see Dory lived in the Marine Life Institute in California with her parents in a very huge aquarium with other fish and sea creatures. Her parents were very good with Dory and helping her cause of Dory's short term memory loss. Then one night Dory saw her mother crying cause her mother was worried that Dory would forget about her parents and Dory knew what would cheer her mother up. A purple shell. When she was about to get one near the drain pipe, the current from the drain pipe sucked her through and out into the open ocean and was separated from her parents. For many years Dory kept searching for her family until she ran into Marlin who was after Nemo in that boat. Then a year after the events of Finding Nemo Dory suddenly starts remembering her family and that she had to go to California to find them. She actually gets there and Marlin and Nemo go to try to get her out. Dory is put into quarantine where she meets this octopus named Hank who also wanted to get out. They both go through a lot of stuff such as getting touched by little human kids hands in a touching area until the reached where Dory lived before she got separated from her parents. When she realizes that it was her who got separated from her parents, she declared that it was her fault that she was separated from her parents, until she decided to go through the pipes. When she gets back into quarantine, she finds a tank of other blue tang fish and they tell her that her parents were gone meaning that they were dead. Feeling sad Dory just kept rolling through the kelp where she finds this area with shells. Then the most surprising thing came to her. It was her parents. For you see they made that area in case Dory would come back and she did. Dory was so happy to be with her parents again, until she remembered that Marlin and Nemo were still in quarantine and were being shipped in a truck to an aquarium in Cleveland, Ohio. With the help of Hank, Destiny the whale shark, and Bailey, Dory manages to get Marlin and Nemo out of the truck as well as all the other fish. Then they all go home back to the reef and played hide and seek. Then at the end, Dory goes to the drop off and enjoys the view and realizes that her parents taught her that she's very special and that she can do anything. Marlin thought so too. Brilliant story here. Pixar still has it. We get another brilliant performance from Ellen DeGeneres. We also get to see an octopus driving a truck which is cool and funny. lol. It also teaches us that people with disabilities are unique and can do anything."

Octopus was the best part of the movie with it's many many funny moments and situations that it was creating.

","Sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo but set one year after the events Dory remembers her parents and where she lived before meeting Marlin and Nemo all three go on a journey across the ocean and through a fish hospital to find Dory's parents.<br/><br/>After 13 years the geniuses at Pixar have released the sequel to Finding Nemo this time centring around the forgetful supporting fish character of Dory. So with Dory now taking centre stage do Pixar make another successful dive or do they violently Belly flop for the first time? To be honest there's not even any need to ask that question, it's Pixar of course the film is going to be good! Yes Pixar once again deliver another film that causes the audience to feel all kinds of emotions. They can laugh with the characters and they can also feel for them when the film gets a bit emotional. Pixar once again do one of the many things that they do best and that's providing adventure, animation and laughs for the kids and for the adults a different deeper story and moments and some laughs specifically targeted at them. Basically Pixar return and do what they do best and that's provide top quality animated films that appeal to all ages. Finding Dory is funny and has a feeling of the original film but is also able to feel like it's own original film ,which it is, and this is something that Pixar are able to do with all their sequels they have a feeling of the original film but the sequels are their own original story and plot. The start of the film does feel a bit rushed and a lot like the original but this is mainly to build up the plot of this film and rushed is slightly understandable but still a bit distracting but seeing as this is at the start and the film wants to jump straight into the plot it's a bit excusable but not completely excusable. There are many laughs throughout the film and nearly all throughout the film are successful and the same can be said for the emotional parts of the film ,mainly intended for the adults that are watching the film, are successful and get a different point/ side of the film across to the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>Brilliant characters and once again with something for kids and something for adults, Pixar strike high again with their newest film that's both funny and emotional, Finding Dory is another Pixar hit.<br/><br/>*** <-- Three Stars"
"SpoilerAlertReviews","8","2","8","7 August 2016"," Ultimate Disney/Pixar cuteness
","There is no limitation to cuteness that Disney can do, giving audience the beachmark of aww factor. This Finding Dory doesn't fall short, the long awaited seaquel to Nemo thirteen years on, but only a year after Nemo so none of them have aged a bit. <br/><br/>American TV superhost Ellen DeGeneres returns to voice the titled star Dory, the lovable blue tang who suffers from short term memory loss, loves sand because it's squishy and gets a sudden urge to find her parents. Albert Brooks returns as Father clownfish, Marlin and Hayden Rolence does a superb job of replacing Alexander Gould as Nemo, though Gould is still casted with a small part. <br/><br/>The new cast of characters are good including Idris Elba, this being his third Disney appearance this year after Zootropia and Jungle Book. It's not the first time Sigourney Weaver has loaned her voice to Disney either, voicing the Axiom in Wall-E. Ed O'Neill is brilliant as Hank the octopus, or was it septipus? Bill Hader, Dominic West, Diane Keaton and American Pie Dad, Eugene Levy make up the rest of the cast among others. <br/><br/>Another two additions is Destiny the short sighted Whale Shark played by Kaitlin Olson and Bailey the Beluga played by Ty Burrell, both giving great comedy value, I can see these two both becoming favourites. And then you have the sea lions which remind me of the hyenas from The Lion King and the huggable Otters (I love otters.) <br/><br/>Wall-E/Nemo director is again at the helm so it's very much a 'Nemo' film in terms of style and feel, so fans of the first shouldn't be disappointed. It's super fast paced possibly so kids don't lose interest and so much happens in the 97minute running which goes from one side of the ocean to the other turning into a far fetched but brilliant rescue/escape mission filled with Dory flashbacks of her super cute childhood. <br/><br/>It's pretty much the same team as before and Thomas Newman also returns to reprise his score which is reminiscent of Nemo, enchanting and atmospheric filled with jazz tones and the occasional operatic. <br/><br/>It's certainly a great addition to the Pixar/Disney catalogue not forgetting to mention the 'Piper' short at the beginning which shows how far the animation has come. Yet another good job by the class of A113 and everyone else involved. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the assortment of good new characters, Hank, the sea lions and of course the otters. <br/><br/>82% 8/10"
"lesleyharris30","9","2","8","8 August 2016"," While it May not have the Same Sense of Adventure, the Heart is Still Strong,
","Finding Doey is a terrific movie with a well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It was the correct choice for a sequel, as we follow Dory, who takes the spotlight in this film, struggling to remember her family in order to retrieve them. She was a highlight of Finding Nemo, despite the fact she was underdeveloped, so giving her the lead role was a wise choice from Pixar as it gave her character time to expand. <br/><br/>I was disappointed by the lack of adventure in this film, in Nemo they travel across the whole ocean and it is quite thrilling, not so much with Dory, as it all takes place in a Marine Life Institute, it made me feel confined to this space. I felt the story should have been stretched out further.<br/><br/>As well as that, many characters from the original do not appear. Dory, Marlin and Nemo are present, of course, but there are several other characters, such as Bruce the Shark, Nigel and Squirt, who do not appear which let me down as I would love to have seen how they were. Even Crush only appears briefly and feels thrown in. <br/><br/>The voice cast is one of the films highlight, Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks are still in great form in their famous roles. They are joined by an excellent new cast that includes Ed O'Neill as a sarcastic octopus, Kaitlin Olson as an optimistic whale, Ty Burrell as a pessimistic beluga, Idris Elba as a lazy seal, not to mention Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton as Dory's parents. Sweet, funny and beautifully animated, the biggest downfall of Finding Dory is that Finding Nemo must be compared to it, it's a great ride, a mostly pleasing sequel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>Dory seeks Marlin and Nemo's help to find her parents, who she lost a long time ago as a result of her short term memory."
"Equalizer16","9","2","8","7 August 2016"," How the hell do Pixar do it?
","After 13 years Pixar have been cooking up something amazing.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is the sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo (A Disney Classic). A year later Marlin, Nemo, and Dory are living peacefully together until Dory begins to remember her family and becomes determined to seek out her parents.<br/><br/>Directed by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, WALL E), Pixar have resurrected a classic animation and brought it to new depth. Supported by a outstanding new team f voice actors, Finding Dory introduces hilarious new characters to enjoy. In Finding Nemo, Dory's short term memory loss was touched upon and joked about, but now we have the real tragic emotional story behind Dory's memory problem, which really makes you feel for the character. What is also most unique is remarkable score by Thomas Newman, which is so good I didn't even have to listen out for it to hit me.<br/><br/>Of course without Pixar, there also comes the marvellous comedy made me laugh very frequently, out loud ad well. But what makes the film is the emotional story of Dory losing her parents which is made up by numerous powerful emotional moments which was twice close to drawing tears from my eyes.<br/><br/>Lets be honest, this film was not made for children of the current generation, but for all of us who witnessed the first film 13 years ago. Only we can purely understand the emotional depth of the film.<br/><br/>The film however does try to do too many things as once, in being a sequel, but also its own film, and hence becomes unbalanced in trying to create the theme of the first film, but also new and independent. Both are good but together can make the film messy.<br/><br/>What makes Finding Dory shy away from being perfect is its unbalance but also certain scenes that have a mixture of humour and emotion which sometimes spoils the atmosphere. But just for once couldn't Pixar try to just aim to be mature audience film, so the easy child friendly atmosphere wasn't there so the film could be perfect with depth and comedy on an older scale.<br/><br/>But how do Pixar do it? in creating beautiful, fun, and marvellous films which we will never forget. Finding Dory is amazing, exactly what we love in animated films, and is just brilliant but not quite perfect. 8.9/10"
"OlieRendch","7","2","8","4 August 2016"," An adequate sequel from Pixar but had some story issues.
","So Finding Dory is the sequel to 2003's brilliant Finding Nemo and we rejoin our main fish friends Dory, Marlin & Nemo as they go on an adventure in the waters of California. I really like Finding Nemo, I think it makes the ocean really interesting and encompasses the vastness of it really well along with giving us investing characters to enjoy. I was a little concerned with Finding Dory however as Pixar has only had success with follow-ups in the Toy Story series; both Cars 2 and Monsters University were average at best. <br/><br/>This sequel though, isn't too bad. Finding Dory is mostly an entertaining and well-made movie. As with all Pixar films, the animation is some of the best in the business. The sand, the water, the textures on the animals is all so breathtaking to look at (even more so in the short-film beforehand) that the visuals alone make the film worth watching. Fortunately Finding Dory also has a top- notch script filled with funny moments, really good life lessons and mottos, all delivered wonderfully by the cast. <br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres obviously is the highlight as the titular character and she is just as entertaining as the first time we met her and you really feel that she is always so genuine in everything she says and does, you want to be friends with Dory. I actually enjoyed a lot of the new characters introduced also; Hank the octopus makes for a visually interesting character with him being able to change colour and manipulate his body and they allude subtly to things from his past which was a nice way to build the character. Destiny the whale shark is also introduced and I wasn't the biggest fan of her character, I felt the 'clumsy friend' thing wore off quickly and some things she did didn't make sense in terms of what animal she is. Her friend Bailey the Beluga however I thoroughly enjoyed, he had some great lines and entertained me whenever he was on screen, and proved to be educational in some respects with cool visuals. Two more characters I'll quickly mention are the two sea lions voiced by Idris Elba and Dominic West; they were great, I'm always happy to see Idris in stuff so this was a treat and their scenes were very funny together.<br/><br/>Moving onto one or two negative points now; the story has some issues. I really enjoyed the beginning and the majority of the main story but pacing was a problem every now and again. For instance, I won't spoil it, but the whole reason they had to find Dory happened so quickly and rushed it kind of felt they were trying to make a reason to call it ""Finding Dory"", if I were honest it's more like finding Dory's parents, which isn't a spoiler as that is the synopsis of the film. <br/><br/>Another point is that Finding Nemo took place almost entirely in the ocean which made the adventure seem that much bigger and exciting whereas here it all happens in an aquarium which makes sense I guess as they don't want to rehash the same things and try something new but one part did require them to cross the ocean and it made it seem as though it takes just a few minutes whereas in the first film it took the entire movie to get to somewhere much closer than where this takes place. And a final thing I wasn't a fan of was the climax. Now obviously it being a children's film I have to suspend some disbelief but the whole final bit just didn't fit into the world Finding Nemo set up, I thought it went a bit too far.<br/><br/>In the end though Finding Dory was an adequate sequel; I was entertained and it was certainly better than some of Pixar's recent entries. Nostalgia still makes me prefer the first film but when you've been watching it since the age of five, it's hard to root that out."
"dion-06636","7","2","8","2 August 2016"," ""Finding"" the right words
","So Finding Dory was probably one of the most anticipated movies of the last few years along with Star Wars and the Suicide Squad. This movie was great visually, which is what we have come to expect since the first one went places with animation no one else had even thought of yet. Also the audio was top notch, as far as hearing things like side chatter in the background during scenes, the flapping of a birds wings, and even the idling of a cars engine. So the audio and video in this movie is what saved it for me. As far as the actual movie I was not impressed at all by the story line and I mean AT ALL. I don't know what I was expecting this movie to be but I know I was expecting it to be more than what was given to us. To me the whole story line seemed rushed. Yes I know Finding Nemo came out in 2003 and it has been 13 years I know this. Which is exactly why I expected so much more. That is a long time to be in development I just feel like with that much time and money they could've given us something so much better. I'm not saying this was a bad movie at all because it was good hence the 7 rating. They gave us things like new characters, new selfish marine life other than the MINE birds, and even whales! The new characters made it worth while to me. If you haven't seen the movie yet look out for the octopus (Hank) he was hilarious and definitely is my new favorite character. Overall it wasn't a bad movie but I definitely wouldn't say it was good either. I saw Finding Nemo maybe 18 times in one week when my brother was a kid. I would not be able to watch this movie that many times."
"maralex-68464","6","2","8","17 July 2016"," It don't lose the wit
","Finding Dory is less wise than the preceding film, also less touching, but it maintain the wit and the comedy. The realism of the images is plausible, the scenes and the characters are very original, the script is incredibly funny and the argument is well. However, I saw some deficiencies. Sometimes the memory lack of Dory tire me, the actuation of Marlin and Nemo is poor and there is less feeling. Besides Finding Dory has few adventures if we compare both movies. <br/><br/>But I want congratulate the Pixar Studios for make this entertaining film. My favorite part of the film is the end. I recommend this movie despite the shortages."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","8","5 July 2016"," 'Dory' makes up for a little sequel unoriginality with lots of heart and a great message
","The talented storytellers and animators at Pixar are too creative to be devoting so much time to sequels like ""Finding Dory,"" but money talks. At least they're clever and thoughtful enough to turn an easy payday into something entertaining and heartfelt.<br/><br/>Created 13 years after ""Finding Nemo,"" at least filmmaker Andrew Stanton had some time and space to let his vibrant animated underwater world and colorful characters breathe, and find a story that needed telling. That story centers on sidekick character Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the blue tang fish with short-term memory loss, who suddenly uncovers some long-term memories about her family and goes off in search of them.<br/><br/>One of the more lovable supporting characters in Pixar's short but storied history, Dory makes for a great subject, and her disability allows for a really powerful and uplifting message. ""Inside Out"" changed the everyday discussion about emotions last year; ""Dory"" continues the studio's impressive focus on social values and teaching utility that should inspire so many of its younger viewers or at least give adults the tools to discuss these challenges with the children in their lives.<br/><br/>""Dory"" is also clever and entertaining, even if the story structure relies heavily on convention and repetition. Dory's search for mom and dad takes her to a California marine life park, where almost all the action takes place. It's a very Pixar move to put these characters in an environment we know with humans in the background oblivious to the story unfolding (think ""Toy Story""), but it kind of takes away from the majesty of the open water that made ""Finding Nemo"" so epic. That film was truly an odyssey, a long and winding, exhaustive journey, whereas the ""Dory"" plot feels as though it is stuffed with predicaments and complications that prolong the end point that we know is just within reach (and inevitable).<br/><br/>Essentially, Dory – and Nemo and Marlon, who are chasing after her – find themselves in and out of dangerous situations (or in jeopardy of their plan failing) with minor breathing room in between and the help of more new supporting characters, most notably a camouflaging ""septopus"" named Hank (Ed O'Neill). Their escapes are preposterous, which is no shocker, but the filmmakers' ingenuity loses a bit of sparkle the more frequently it occurs.<br/><br/>But these criticisms come with the high bar Pixar has set for itself. If the studio is going to go for the sequel cash-grab, it needs to justify the choice through creative, thoughtful storytelling. ""Dory"" does this better than ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University,"" but there's just enough of a sense that it was produced by a sequel machine.<br/><br/>All this makes the film's heart and social welfare component all the more vital. In this area, Stanton and co. do not falter one iota. Leaning on a story formula is less of a sin than creating a family film that has nothing original to say and doesn't pull at the heartstrings. ""Finding Dory"" avoids this most important sequel pitfall and its emotional factor proves, in the end, to be the only justification Pixar needed to bring us Nemo, Marlon and Dory once more. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for Reading!

"CANpatbuck3664","9","3","15","19 June 2016"," Not Too Far Behind the Masterpiece That is Finding Nemo
","Having lived through the Pixar golden age, it's hard not to get nervous with them announcing sequels to some of the more successful movies. These movies are happening years later and as a big fan of those classic movies, it's hard not to feel that Pixar is taking advantage of the nostalgia. To be fair, Toy Story 3 was amazing and completely lived up to the previous movies but I found Monsters University to be really disappointing. But I want to trust them so I went into Finding Dory hoping for the best. Finding Nemo isn't my absolute favourite Pixar movie but it is tremendous and is definitely one of the best animated movies of it's time so that's a high bar to hit. I can't say I loved Finding Dory as much but to even come close is an achievement.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin with Dory (Ellen DeGeners) when she's very young. She tries to deal with having a terrible short-term memory but luckily she has her parents Charlie (Eugene Levy) and Jenny (Diane Keaton) who love her dearly and are trying to help her. One day when she is distracted, she gets separated from her parents and cannot find them. She searches for them for years without remembering anything about them and she grows up unfortunately being unable to locate them. We follow her up until the events of the original Finding Nemo when her and Marlin (Albert Brooks) collide as he's trying to chase down his son Nemo (Hayden Rolence). If you have seen the first movie you know that they bond crossing the ocean together and they are able to get Nemo back and they become their own quirky family.<br/><br/>A year later from the end of the original film, we join the 3 of them living in the same spot. Nemo goes to school and Dory even attends class with him. The teacher Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson) doesn't really want her along but she comes along anyway. While they are out on their field trip, something jogs Dory's memory and she realizes that she has a family out there. She decides immediately that she has to go find them. Marlin tells her that they were lucky to make it back the first time and that there are no assurances that they will be able to find them. Dory decides that its something that she has to do and they set out to go across the Pacific Ocean to find them.<br/><br/>With the original Finding Nemo you got not only a great story but a really cool cast of interesting characters that were not only funny but touching and really well developed. I'm happy to say that you get to see a lot of the same characters again but you get some pretty awesome new characters. I really loved Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil) who was the right balance of cranky and sympathetic. Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) and Bailey (Ty Burrell) were fun additions and Fluke (Idris Elba) and Rudder (Dominic West) were really funny. It's a credit to the writers to find ways to bring in so many new characters and to make them as memorable. If I had a complaint about the character development it would be that Nemo and Marlin are put on the back-burner and they don't really get much to do until they get to their destination. The stuff they do until that point seemed really cliché (being overly mean to Dory despite knowing the problems she is dealing with just to advance the plot).<br/><br/>Another thing that the original Finding Nemo did well is that it really brought the beauty of ocean life to the forefront with some really colourful and interesting computer animation. Finding Dory gets the same treatment, there are scenes where it's hard not to be in awe of how beautiful everything is. The colours of the environments and even the fish themselves are really vibrant and help you get into the world the movie exists in.<br/><br/>The plot of Finding Dory seems a little contrived at first (after how many years why would Dory believe that her parents are still out there looking for her?) but if you stick with it, it's actually a lot more emotionally involving. The beginning of the movie is a little reminiscent of another great Pixar movie (Up) in that it gets really emotional really quickly. This isn't a bad thing, it helps you get invested immediately. Dory goes on quite the journey throughout and you really get swept up in it. Again it's a lot like the first film in that way. The movie is about the concept of family which isn't necessarily complicated but what makes it great is that you go on this sweeping adventure with the characters that gets that message across. Finding Dory really takes you on that ride and by the end you'll more than likely be happy you took it.<br/><br/>You get some really good voice acting in Finding Dory too. Ellen DeGeneres really does embody Dory I don't think anyone else could really do the character justice. Albert does more good work and Hayden did a good job filling in as Nemo. Again the biggest surprise was how good Ed O'Neil was as Hank. I could just go on about the whole rest of the cast as there isn't a weak link among them.<br/><br/>I love most of the Pixar Animation films I have seen. I do have that bias but I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was. Living up to Finding Nemo is a tall task but I found Finding Dory to be a worthy sequel. I will say thought that I don't think we need a trilogy, just leave us with these 2. Having a third entry won't really add anything and I wouldn't want to risk the great memories I have from the first 2."

I also caught myself laughing and smiling like a child at parts right along with the kiddie crowd surrounding me (which was a large majority... I have no regrets). 'Finding Dory' was entertaining for a kids movie. Had enough humor to satisfy young and old alike. The voice actors and actresses were great. Of course, I had a slight issue with some majorly unrealistic aspects of the movie near the end but beggars can not be choosers.

Please read to find out. <br/><br/>Is it any surprise that Pixar has surprisingly managed to bring comedy to their works? If it is, then shame on you for not watching more of their films. Finding Dory has a little bit of something for everyone that had the audience (including yours truly) laughing up a storm. Kids will love the exaggerated, goofy, slapstick comedy and guttural noises, often repeating the words over again as if a second time will make it even funnier. Adults, however get the better end of the deal for once, with plenty of references that older audience members will relish in, while their kids will just stare at the pretty colors and cute fish. <br/><br/>Speaking of cute, despite some of the more adult references this film maintains that charm and magic that Disney brought with the first film. Dory is adorable, her innocence and sincerity by far the most endearing quality of the film. Her flashbacks to her younger self had everyone in the audience going awwwwww, and her moral compass brought the emotional tearjerker to the eye. Outside of the blue tang, Nemo is still as cute as a button and the new addition Destiny was sweet as well. <br/><br/>But all of this factors down to the legendary talk show host Ellen providing amazing voice work. Ellen's dynamic personality carries over into Dory and keeps the film fun and energetic (yes like a dog). Her delivery is jokes is perfect and very Ellen like and the more emotional moments are laced with a strong talent Ellen has. Yeah, the other actors did a great job, each providing their own zing, spin, and emotion to the mix, but Ellen as the headlines was the thing that won me over. In particular, the interactions between Hank and Dory were by far the most entertaining of the bunch. <br/><br/>As for the animation, there are no surprises that Pixar did a fantastic job as always. The fish move just like fish, delicately floating in the sea until something massive attempts to make dinner out of them. The water itself is also fantastically brought to life, each component of it looking incredibly realistic in terms of texture and fluidity. These detail even carry over to the environment itself, as the reef, wreckage, and the marina are brought out into the high definition detail Pixar is famous for. If only the humans looked better, then everything would fall into place. <br/><br/>Okay, I know I'm probably committing a sin by calling out some of the weaknesses to the film, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't provide a full report. Finding Dory's story is one area of improvement that Pixar should have looked into a little more. Think back to Nemo's tale, his dad transversed the whole ocean with Dory facing dangers and uncovering areas of the reef we only saw in documentaries. It was exciting, it was exotic, and it was incredibly detailed. Not the case in this one. Finding Dory had a lot of emotion and the comedy was there to make it fun, but it wasn't as exciting as its predecessor. The dangers of the deep were a little more lax, and the aquarium while stunning, didn't have the same edge we got all those years ago. Seeing Dory's flashbacks were great in the character development strategies, but the obvious foreshadowing and diluted suspense had me feel something was missing. <br/><br/>In addition, while the comedy was fun for all ages, it got overdone at times. Yes, little kids can't get enough of anything and from a market standpoint it makes sense. However, in terms of quality, blasting the audience with whale noises, silly sounds, and smacking into walls begins to lower the scores a bit. Most will probably be okay with beating the dead house, but for me I like a little more balance in the comedy than what I got in this film. <br/><br/>Jumping back to the story, I felt manay characters got the short end of the stick in this film. No surprise that Dory takes the center stage, hence the title, but does that mean that characters like Marlin and Nemo have to be reduced to a shell of what they once were. Again, think back to Finding Nemo, a good balance between Marlin's adventure and Nemo's struggles in the tank. In this film, Marlin and Nemo are more side characters with some humorous moments, but seldom important for the story. I'm sure this was to help give the movie a different feel, but they could have done better to balance their characters. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is still a great addition to the Pixar library. It's fun for all ages, very sweet, and packs the same animation punch this studio is famous for. Unfortunately the story is not as exciting as the first travel into the blue void and some of our characters get the short end that is disappointing. Overall though, I'm happy with the adventure and I hope that many will enjoy this movie as much as I did. Worth the 3-D showing? I can't say it makes the total experience, but the visuals promise even better detail in 3-D. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Yesyes it is. <br/><br/>Scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"sarahorlando-02113","10","4","23","23 June 2016"," Perfection
","This film has completely met up to the hype and exceeded expectations. This film broke the rule that sequels are always worse. Finding Dory includes brilliant humor, child friendly themes as well as amazing animation. Every detail of the underwater world was perfected right down to the scales on Nemo and his father. The backstory of Dorys life was extremely touching, giving awareness to children that people with mental disabilities (such as Dorys memory loss) can do just as much as normal people and their qualities are even to be admired. This movie is great for adults and children, with constant adventure and humor no one could be bored during this movie. The Finding Nemo sequel is just as good as the original, adding more moral lessons and even better animation tithe franchise. I recommend this movie to people of all ages."
"jcmiggy","10","4","23","17 June 2016"," The Best Movie
","The much awaited ""Finding Dory""<br/><br/>5 star for the movie! Highly recommended and worth your penny! Watch it on the big screen and if you can afford 3D please do so.<br/><br/>Some people posted about parents bringing their babies to watch it. I Totally agree with it. It's a serious business! But of course as we watched in the movie house there's still some babies who were crying but anyway so much for that.<br/><br/>As per my own perspective, this is the Best movie of all time as of the moment for myself. It's actually my first time to cry in a movie house and me and my cousin ran out of napkins lol. It will make you laugh so hard and of course CRY.<br/><br/>Finding Dory talks about life, family and friendship. Most importantly, it taught us to never give up despite of our impairments or weak points in our lives whether it is a disability nor an imperfection in ourselves. Instead, Dory taught us to use it as our main key and strength to be successful in whatever it is are we looking in oneself if we ever felt lost in one point of our lives. We sometimes don't recognize the people that surrounds us, can be the piece of the puzzle we are looking for.<br/><br/>As what they say, ""Just swim and swim and swim till you find it."" Alright people, Let's do the ‪Cuddle Party!<br/><br/>If I can give a 20 star for the movie I will do it. I will watch it again, but the next time there should be no babies crying in the movie house LOL."

","**CAUTION! You're about to run into a tail-load of spoilers here!** I know, I was born almost a year after Finding Nemo came out. But I'm still a big fan. Same with Finding Dory! I watched it yesterday, and can I just say, ""Pixar's third movie that was great since Monsters University!"" Wait: I just did.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I had Inside Out as my #1 Pixar movie. Finding Nemo was my #2, but then that changed yesterday (I ain't sorry). Now, Finding Dory/Nemo are my favorite movies.<br/><br/>While it has comedy (e.g. Marlin's little, um- ill fish feeding), it also has messages (e.g. Dory's fun fact about three hearts) and would be great for little kids (especially since Dory doesn't tell young viewers about- the thing.) <br/><br/>Long story short, get you and your kids some tickets to see this. And try not to cry, because there are sad scenes on the way if you see it."
"SnoopyStyle","8","2","9","24 November 2016"," Dory a great character
","Dory is a blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss. As a baby, she got separated from her family. After the events of 'Finding Nemo', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is living with Nemo and his dad Marlin (Albert Brooks). Mr. Ray is teaching school about migration and home which refreshes her long dormant memories. Marlin reluctantly agrees to help her find her parents.<br/><br/>It starts off great with little Dory all the way up to the turtles. Then Dory gets captured. I'm not saying it's bad but part of the magic fades in the human world. I know the fish tank was a part of the original but it wasn't my favorite there either. So much of this is hopping from one aquarium exhibit to the next. On the other hand, Dory is a wonderful lead character. DeGeneres' voice work is terrific. Destiny and Bailey are great additions. The animation is sharper than ever. The quest is touching and poignant. This may not be the sequel I expected. I prefer the quest to be in the natural world but this is good nevertheless."
"billywazhere","8","2","9","26 August 2016"," Amusing and nostalgic
","I found many points in the movie what i have become to expect from pixar and much better than the other recent additions. I found there was enough references to finding Nemo but not too many to make the film not able to stand on it's own. A few adult jokes and the reemergence of the sandwich bag escape artists after the credits made the movie for me!! The idea of leaving stones for dory to find her parents and the whales broken echo-recondition where unique and additions that added to the feeling of the film. The animation was what is expected, very impressive graphics that have improved massively every new film released, this one just happened to have the story line to back up the excellent work on graphics going on behind the sceans!"
"jboothmillard","8","2","9","7 August 2016"," Finding Dory
","Finding Nemo in 2003 became one of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, a sequel had been planned, and it only thirteen years later that Disney and Pixar made it happen, I was hoping it would be as good as the original. Basically it has been one year since clown fish Nemo (Hayden Rolence) was reunited with his father Marlin (Albert Brooks), with the help of regal blue tang fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who suffers short-term memory loss, she is now a helping hand raising Nemo. Through flashback it is seen that before joining Marlin in finding Nemo, she was searching for her family, suddenly she recalls the memory that she has a family, she is determined to find them, but her memory loss makes this difficult, she only remembers that they live at the Jewel of Morro Bay. Marlin and Nemo join Dory in her quest, they start with a ride in the water current on the back of sea turtle Crush (Andrew Stanton), arriving in California they soon encounter a predatory giant squid. Dory is hurt by a sarcastic comment Marlin makes, she swims to the surface for help, when caught in six pack rings, she is rescued and captured by staff at the nearby Marine Life Institute, and separated from Marlin and Nemo. Dory is sent to Quarantine and tagged, there she meets grouchy but well-meaning seven-legged octopus Hank (Ed O'Neill), the tag means she will be sent to a permanent aquarium in Cleveland, this is where Hank wants to go, so he agrees to help Dory find her family, in exchange for the tag. Hank carrying Dory in a pot of water, they explore the Institute, along the way they find an exhibit, where Dory encounters childhood friend Destiny (Kaitlin Olson), a nearsighted whale shark, who communicated with her through the pipes, and also Bailey, a beluga whale, who has the ability of echolocation. Dory learns that all regal blue tangs species are being moved to Cleveland, Dory struggles with her memory to recall details to help find her family, but has flashbacks, meanwhile Marlin and Nemo are attempting to rescue Dory, with the help of sea lions named Fluke (Idris Elba) and Rudder (Dominic West), and a common loon named Becky, they manage to get into the Institute. Dory finally remembers how she became separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying, she went out to find a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an undertow current. Dory travels through the pipes to continue her search, there she reunites with Marlin and Nemo, and they get back to Quarantine, and find the tank of blue tangs, they tell Dory her parents escaped years ago to find her, but never came back, she thinks they are now dead. Hank helps Dory out the tank, but Marlin and Nemo are left behind, an employee apprehends Hank, he unintentionally drops Dory into a drain and flushes her into the ocean. Dory comes across a trail of shells, and recalls a memory of her parents telling her follow shells to help find her way back home, following the shells she finds an empty home, as she is about to leave she is finally reunited with her parents, Charlie (Eugene Levy) and Jenny (Diane Keaton), they tell her that have spent years making shell trails in the hope that she would one day find them. Marlin and Nemo are put in a truck, transporting various aquatic life to Cleveland, Destiny and Bailey escape their exhibit, find Dory, and help her to rescue them, once Dory is in the truck, Hank escapes his tank and together they hijack the vehicle, drive it back to the ocean, and crash into the water, freeing all the fish. In the end, Dory and all her newfound friends have returned to the reef with Marlin and Nemo, after the credits have rolled you also see Gill (Willem Dafoe) and the Tank Gang are still trapped inside their plastic bags, they have reached California after a year of floating, they are rescued by volunteers from the Institute. Also starring Sigourney Weaver as herself, the Institute voice intercom announcer, Bob Peterson as Mr. Ray, Spy's Allison Janney as Peach, Austin Pendleton as Gurgle, Stephen Root as Bubbles, Jerome Ranft as Jacques, Brad Garrett as Bloat, Vicki Lewis as Deb and Flo, Sloane Murray as Young Dory, Ghostbusters' Kate McKinnon as Wife Fish, Bill Hader as Husband Fish and John Ratzenberger as Husband Crab. The characters and voices are terrific, it is nice the supporting character of the first film gets an origins story and becomes the star, the new characters, including the curmudgeonly octopus with camouflage powers, are great, the scale of action is increased, it makes you laugh at the right moments, the emotional journey gets the heartstrings going, and the inventive computer animation remains superb, it is just as compelling as the original, a splendid animated comedy drama adventure. Very good!"
"shadowyx12","7","2","9","25 July 2016"," A sequel that does justice to the original.
","Dory now lives with Nemo and Marlin. From time to time, she even tags along with Nemo's class on field trips. On one of these trips, Dory gets knocked out while witnessing a mass stingray migration - and reawakens her childhood memories. After recalling that she was separated from her parents at a young age, she sets out on a journey to California with Nemo and Marlin to find them.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" was lightning in a bottle - not only does it contain a wholly original concept but it also managed to shift many of our perceived attitudes on the art of animation. It was a perfectly contained story - one immune from getting the franchise treatment. Before this year, I honestly believed that making a sequel or prequel to this brilliant film would have been a bad move on Pixar's part.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Pixar proved me wrong. Although I still believe that no sequel/prequel to ""Finding Nemo"" can stand up to the original film, I wholeheartedly welcome ""Finding Dory"" with open arms.<br/><br/>The film is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton - the mastermind behind the original ""Finding Nemo"". For ""Finding Dory"", Stanton and his team bring their A-game: the animation is wonderful (as always), the voice-acting is top-notch, the euphonic score by Thomas Newman is Oscar-worthy, and the cinematography (lighting, camera angles, etc.) is breathtaking beyond words.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story is overshadowed by those elements (as well as the original film). Dory's plight still tugged at my heartstrings and her journey made me laugh multiple times; however, I can't help but think that Stanton and his writing team may have squandered the story's full potential. The story is written rather haphazardly, but still comprehensible. Some viewers may be disoriented/annoyed by the film's constant cutting among the separated characters and time periods, as well as the sudden shifts in mood.<br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" also introduces an entirely new cast of characters – and they're just as entertaining and enjoyable to watch as Dory herself. The additions of Hank the Octopus, Destiny the Whale Shark, and Bailey the Beluga are outstanding. Not only do all three of these sea creatures have their own unique personalities (leading to some hilarious situations), but they each have their own distinct character arcs!<br/><br/>On a final note, the last quarter of this film was without a doubt the single most exciting thing I've seen in theatres in a long time. <br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" is a gorgeous film filled with suspense, laughs, heart-wrenching moments, and thought-provoking sentiments. The story is a bit of a mess, but that shouldn't keep someone from enjoying this film."
"kalbean","9","2","9","25 July 2016"," Reframing the Disability Narrative
","Finding Dory continues and further explores the disability narrative, as it was touched upon in Finding Nemo. It presents to the viewer the complex and often difficult narrative of both raising a child with disability and growing up with one. Finding Dory pushes the disability narrative phenomenally and shows the perspective of not only the main character and what it is like to live with a disability but the perspectives of the other characters that Dory interacts with on a daily basis. <br/><br/>The film wrestles with the narrative that Dory needs to be with people to protect her because of her disability. But the movie reframes the narrative through the moments that capture Dory being placed at odds to believe in herself. It all builds up to her being alone again and instead of giving up she follows her instincts; she follows what she does best and is ultimately what leads her to her parents. She uses her instincts (""What Would Dory Do"") and shows the viewers and other characters at the rehabilitation center how disability is not a hindrance but rather a unique gift. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't stop there and shows perspectives of what it is like living with those who do have disabilities. The parents show the all too real fear of letting their child whom they love and whom they see as perfect going out into the world. Marlin on the other hand shows a deep friendship with Dory but a protective one. As he embraces Dory's disability, their friendship shows that sometimes it can get in the way of the ones you love, Nemo. <br/><br/>This movie shows the beauty of observing the journey of self-acceptance and discovery. This movie reframes the disability narrative as one that is not a weakness or a life of needing constant care of loved ones but one where there can be triumph and success. Not only do we get to see Dory's journey of coming into her own but we get to see the other characters wrestle with letting Dory go on her own. This translates into a wider message of how we can and must see people holistically and not just for their disability. That people are more than just their disability and that we should not just look at the ways that disability is limiting but the ways that it can be strength. It paints a picture of what it may look like to reframe the disability message we see within our society and to rather than see it as impairment for our society is to value the entire person. It is the heart of a person that truly matters as seen by the lovable and compassionate Dory. Dory extends this to each character she encounters by seeing who they truly are and not by their impairments or even anger (Hank the Septoctupus) but by their hearts. Finding Dory provides the viewer with the posture and grace that needs to be extended to everyone we interact with, even the ones that we don't fully understand at first."
"schroeder-gustavo","8","2","9","21 July 2016"," WORTHY Sequel
","""Hi. I'm Dory. I suffer from short-term ""remembery"" loss.""<br/><br/>These are the very first words we hear in Finding Dory. And we hear them SEVERAL times throughout the film. Look, I love Dory as much as everybody else, but I was really worried this was gonna suffer from ""Minions Syndrome"". You know how the Minions kinda work in Despicable Me in small measures but a movie filled with them was just annoying as hell?. Luckily, Finding Dory finds ways to avoid that and I am glad to say it succeeds as a sequel.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is able to introduce NEW, MEMORABLE, COOL and FUNNY characters to the universe and it proves that this was not a cash grab by Pixar by selling a well established brand (Cars 2). Destiny and the other whale are funny, Hank the Octopus (or whatever you call an octopus with seven tentacles) is awesome, we are introduced to some pretty hilarious sea lions, and more. One particular scene involving a clam had me laughing HYSTERICALLY. <br/><br/>The ultimate flaw of Finding Dory is that it relies a lot (too much if you ask me) on call backs from the original. It is a sequel and you have to have that connection to the first movie (I get it), but it seemed that all this movie was gonna do was do things that we already knew from the original, especially in the opening of the movie. ""Oh, remember the cool turtle who talks like a surfer? And remember Dory talking to a whale?"" Things like that are scattered throughout the film and it appears as if they are just there for the sake of people remembering how great the original Finding Nemo was.<br/><br/>So the question everyone wants to know is is it better than Finding Nemo? NO. Not by a long shot. But here's the thing. Finding Nemo is the Lion King of Pixar in terms of scope and epicness. It is as perfect of an animated film as I would ever want any animated film to be. But in the end, I can say with confidence that this is a WORTHY sequel. I was invested in the story, I was thoroughly entertained, I laughed, I didn't cry but some scenes got pretty emotional. And the story is worth experiencing. If you liked the first movie, I can almost guarantee you WILL like this one too IF you don't go in thinking this will be better than arguably the greatest Pixar movie ever made. That's just a dumb mindset. Enjoy Dory for what it is: A good, entertaining sequel to a perfect (or nearly perfect) movie."
"jdesando","Null","2","9","19 July 2016"," Could be an Oscar nomination for best picture.
","""I suffer from short-term memory loss."" Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres)<br/><br/>Just to intimidate you and me, the statistics show that Finding Dory is the largest grossing animation in film history, currently at about half a billion dollars and moving up. Yes, more than its companion, Finding Nemo. However I make more demands on the film with that kind of pedigree, and this one exceeds my demands as few other animations have.<br/><br/>Dory is the cutest fish you've ever seen, a blue tang with a disability. The genius of this warm, family comedy is that her short-term memory is a source of affection for her family and friends and the audience. She struggles to remember from moment to moment, most prominently after she has lost contact with her family.<br/><br/>The film becomes her odyssey to find her family and, in existential terms, herself. The companions who accompany her are eccentric and lovable, most notably Hank (Ed O'Neill), whose gruff octopus exterior masks a heart as big as the ocean.<br/><br/>Overcoming Dory's disability and re-connecting with her family are the prominent motifs, not that the latter is at all foreign to the Pixar empire. It's just that Dory's lack of self awareness and genuine love of her fellow fish predict she will be a winner no matter where she lands.<br/><br/>""What would Dory Do?"" is a refrain that tells us we have a self-directed heroine here who has a reasoning ability better than her mortal man's. Everyone is smarter for asking that question, regardless of the death-dominated consequences.<br/><br/>I don't usually dwell on the technicals, but this film has art work to make even kelp beautiful. The undulating vegetation and synchronized fish schools are marvelous to behold.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a film not to be missed if you want to keep up with the best of cinema. Who knows if an Oscar nomination for best picture will follow?"
"carolinejanacek","8","2","9","18 July 2016"," Very Enjoyable
","I thoroughly enjoyed Finding Dory from start to finish. I thought that revealing Dory's past through short flashbacks and snippets of memories was an excellent directing choice and offered a very creative plot line that left the audience guessing. It almost reminded me of another enjoyable children's movie, Brother Bear, in the way that it kept everyone on the edge of their seats. The cast brought back old favorites from Finding Nemo, such as Ellen Degeneres, but also featured some new names such as a cameo from Sigourney Weaver. This production was especially enjoyable for young adults who were young enough to enjoy Finding Nemo when it first came out, and can now relive their childhood with this wonderful blast from the past."
"slicedbread117","8","2","9","13 July 2016"," A Welcomed Return to the Deep Blue Sea
","It's been 13 long years since the release of Finding Nemo, Disney/Pixar's instant classic that turned every clown fish at a pet store into ""Nemo"". Now, we return to the ocean, this time to follow the story of everyone's favorite Dory, and in large, Finding Dory is able to recapture the magic that was harnessed 13 years ago.<br/><br/>Finding Dory brings a lot to the table that its predecessor also did, none more so than the film's terrific animation, which, like the first, captures the beauty and dangers of the ocean in spectacular fashion. The atmosphere is vibrant and alive, and the characters are animated splendidly, especially Hank the squid (who I'll talk more about later). Pixar has a near perfect track record when it comes to its animation, and with its gorgeous ocean setting, Fining Dory is no exception.<br/><br/>The story, obviously, centers around Dory, the lovable, forgetful blue fish who decides to set out on a journey to find her long lost family, and reunite with them once again. While a simple premise is to be expected with an animated kids film, I found the overall plot to be less memorable and less intimate than Finding Nemo, with more sporadic pacing as well. Finding Dory was heavier on goofy jokes, which isn't bad by any means for a kids movie, but as an adult viewer, I would have been more satisfied with a more emotionally engaging plot. The movie definitely has its heartfelt moments, and like I said, there is plenty of humor to keep viewers of all ages entertained. So at the end of the day, Fining Dory has a story solid enough to be worth the view.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo introduced a slew of memorable characters, from Bruce the shark to the star of this film, Dory. The supporting cast helped fill the enormous space of the ocean and made it feel alive, keeping you excited to meet the next set of characters on the journey. In Finding Dory, there are plenty of enjoyable faces, both old and new. Ellen DeGeneres returns to voice the title character, and really is perfect for the role yet again. The dialogue isn't as memorable this time around, but Ellen is stellar in her delivery. Nemo and his worrisome father Marlin (Albert Brooks) also return, this time in smaller roles, but still are important enough to the story and fun enough to watch that I didn't mind too much of their lesser involvement.<br/><br/>Then there's my new favorite character, Hank, a seven-armed octopus who's grouchy demeanor and charming heart won me over as the film's best character. He's grumpy, funny, and loving at the same time and you can tell how much work Pixar had to put into his animation to make him move like a real squid, and really pop on screen. Ed O'Neill is wonderful in the voice role, and gives Hank the perfect personality. What's a bit unfortunate, is that the rest of the supporting characters we meet either aren't memorable, or didn't get enough screen time to convince me that they were. Dory fittingly had the most screen time, but aside from some very brief cameos and Hank, I was not sold on the new supporting cast.<br/><br/>There have been loads of sequels in recent years coming out 10-20 years after the original, and most have proved that if you don't have a legitimate story to explore, it's not worth the time. Finding Dory, however, is a rare exception, where, even after a long wait, is able to deliver a strong enough film to be worthy of its predecessor. Fantastic animation, plenty of humor, and a strong enough cast of characters combine to make Finding Dory a return to the deep blue sea that was worth the 13 year wait.<br/><br/>8/10"
"tempestnyx","8","2","9","13 July 2016"," Fun, Heartwarming But Lacking Realism
","Simply adorable. Everyone's favorite blue tang fish is back in this sequel all about her. Finding Dory is all about Dory and where she came from and how she came to meet up with Marlin and Nemo. Going back to Dory's origins, the audience gets to see Dory as the cutest animated baby in the world. I mean let's just give the animators here a round of applause for getting some of the smallest details correct, mirroring real fish and lighting and the like, perfectly, but also they created one of the cutest little fish in the world that completely fits with the character. Dory is great, and this film highlights everything about her that makes her so great. She kind, she's loving, she's generous, and she never lets anything keep her down. Dory is a strong character who has never ending hoping and optimism. She's carefree much like Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen was perfect for the first movie, and she was perfect here too, she gets the characters, she knows which emotions to bring to life to the character with perfection. I cannot stress enough how heartwarming that was, to see Dory back on the screen on an adventure to find her home and her family.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest problem — yes, while the acting was perfect, the story was not — of the film is the over-the-top story. Finding Nemo took the audience on an adventure through the ocean. It was very much an adventure. Here, the audience is taking a trip to an aquarium. There is no sense of adventure here. It's fun, it's heartwarming, but the adventure, that sort of tension, it's massively diminished once they are out of the ocean. Then there is the realism of the film. You would think that going to an aquarium would be realistic. Unfortunately not. Once again, Finding Nemo was more realistic. It almost seems as though the writers were trying to balance out the lack of adventure with fun, outlandish antics, but that only resulted in the film being unrealistic. You've got a septapus driving around the Aquarium, a whale shark and beluga escape the aquarium, and much more somewhat ridiculous things are going on in the movie. Is it fun to watch? Totally, kids will love it, but the realism is gone, and that detracts from the overall potential of the film.<br/><br/>There is so much heart in the movie, even scenes that will make the audience cry and it's a film about family, so it's great. But, if you ask me, Finding Nemo is still better."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","2","9","11 July 2016"," Not the same magic, but enough of what makes these stories special
","While Finding Dory is not the same magic that Nemo was back in 2004 (it's hard to catch that kind of lightning in a bottle twice), it's safe to say it's it's own awesome little movie, and as far as a sequel goes, passes with flying colors. It's more or less structured the same way as the first in terms of plot, adding it's own twists, new characters and a core message that relates to previous themes while intrepidly covering new ground. My only complaint is I wish it were longer. It seemed to be over in a flash, even for a reliably slim Pixar running time. It would have been nice to have an extra 15 or 20 minutes to flesh out a few scenes, and elaborate a bit more on one particular character. Even so, what we get is completely charming and inspired. It starts off pretty much where we left off, with Nemo, Marlin and Dory living happily on the reef, intercut with scenes featuring an infant Dory who is most likely the cutest little thing to ever be seen in a Pixar movie. It's revealed that a long time ago she was separated from her parents (Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton), and has grown up lost, adrift and afflicted by her relentless memory disorder. When an interaction triggers memories of them, she sets off with Marlin and Nemo in tow, on a merry quest across the ocean to connect with her roots. A great deal of this one is spent in a Sea World like habitat, which is another change and leaves room for many more new jokes and creatures. An octopus named Hank (Ed O Neil) begrudgingly helps her out, as well as a nearsighted whale shark (Kaitlyn Olsen), and as beluga (Ty Burrell) whose echo location is busted, providing one of the best jokes. There's also a couple of exuberant seals played by Idris Elba and Dominic West, a few returning familiar faces and an epic cameo by a huge star, dead panning the voice of the aquarium tourist announcer in classic Pixar good humour. The film stresses the importance of acceptance and resilience, putting forth the idea that someone with a debilitating condition can in fact find their own unique method of coping, and achieving their goals despite the symptoms of their ailment. Trust Pixar time and time again to take mature, lofty themes and mold them into totally relatable fables that never preach, and are distilled to a point where the little ones can absorb them right alongside their parents. Like I said before, the film needs a bit more padding in its narrative to feel complete, which may materialize in an extended DVD version. What we have here is brilliant enough though, and didn't disappoint."
"tavm","8","2","9","10 July 2016"," Finding Dory was a worthy sequel to Finding Nemo
","So after Finding Nemo, Disney/Pixar decided to make a sequel in which the short-term memory fish Dory suddenly remembers that she has parents and goes out looking for them. Along the way, she encounters a septopus (an octopus with a missing appendage), a near-sighted whale shark who was her pipe pal, and a male beluga whale who has a radar. Also, Marlin and his son Nemo are also along for the ride. There are a few laughs and plenty of touching drama during Dory's search. It's quite a ride as she journeys through various aquariums and oceans, not to mention a few motorized vehicles and strollers. I enjoyed most of what happens here along with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched this before. So on that note, I recommend Finding Dory."
"omar-alikaj","7","2","9","7 July 2016"," A Pleasant Sequel to Finding Nemo
","""Finding Dory"" is the sequel that I didn't realize that ""Finding Nemo"" needed. The movie, as the name implies, focuses on Dory's origin, long before the now-grown-up character collided with Marlin... as we remembered in the previous film. Thus, this movie answers much about Dory that some of us had wondered about for years.<br/><br/>After going through her origin, the audience get to see the events a year after the first movie's plot. Switching between Dory's past and present is a pleasant, artistic direction for story-telling, a bit better than that of ""Man of Steel"", that you'd notice from beginning till end, as Nemo's field trip in understanding migration leads to key terms that cause Dory to have flashbacks to her childhood days. Thus, remembering her parents for the first time since growing up. The plot of the movie finally begins, as she talks Marlin into escorting her to California.<br/><br/>Much of the plot reveals that Dory came from an aquarium, where Dory, tangled with a plastic can holder, gets separated from Marlin and Nemo, and sent to the facility's quarantine. It is there that she meets an octopus (or a ""septopus"", as Dory rightfully pointed) named ""Hank"" who attempts to escape to Cleveland in a truck. Thus, half the movie, these two unlikely duo have a reluctant deal in finding Dory's parents in exchange for her orange tag that'd guarantee Hank being transported to Cleveland... as opposed to be sent back to the ocean that he dreads so much.<br/><br/>This aspect of the plot goes on till almost the climax, long after Dory meets her childhood friend in person, a female, short-sighted whale shark named ""Destiny"", and acquainted with a not-really- handicapped white whale named ""Bailey"". Hank gets busted during the transfer (while wearing Dory's tag), while a mishap leads Dory going down a drain, and back into the sea.<br/><br/>At this point, like when Marlin thought Nemo died in the previous movie, Dory reaches her low point, thinking that both her parents passed on, losing her memory as to why she is in where she is in the first place. A quick pep talk on ""What would Dory do?"" gets her to look around a bit, thus noticing lines of shells laid as roads leading back to a fish house. This style of story-telling, and the flashbacks regarding shells, having seen the movie twice, is impressive and engaging, you'd feel it when Dory and her parents have their tearful reunion on the spot.<br/><br/>As for Marlin and Nemo, we get to see Marlin being Marlin again, being skeptical and worried. As for Nemo, feeling bad that Marlin may have hurt Dory's feelings over her memory loss, after a rather dangerous squid incident, is judgmental to his dad on a handful of occasions. Having gotten separated from Dory, they get help from two healing sea lions. Of course, this leads to an odd-looking bird, resembling Psycrow in ""Earthworm Jim"", helping the guys fly around in a bucket at least a couple of times throughout the film. Eventually, having being so close to Dory, yet so far, they and Dory reunite. But, they get separated again during the Cleveland transportation, that Marlin and Nemo result to seeking help from Dory's friends and parents.<br/><br/>Of course, since the movie heavily focuses on the aquatic facility, it's not as deep and adventurous as ""Finding Nemo"", as some viewers pointed out. In fact, just like ""Night at the Museum 2"" is to ""Night at the Museum"", ""Finding Dory"" now only takes place in the same day, at the same place. But, as for the story, it's really good still; the misadventures, the character developments, the reunions, the rescues, everything.<br/><br/>The movie wouldn't be complete without funny moments, like the sea lions yelling at the third to get off their rock, even after they allowed him, for using his bucket, for about ten seconds... or that sole clam mourning over his ex leaving him. But, the movie focuses more on drama than comedy by its nature, as you'd realize.<br/><br/>By the end, we get to see everyone living around Nemo's anemone, with Hank, being talked into liking the ocean, working as Mr. Ray's assistant. Worried that Dory swimming off could get her to lose her memory about her friends and family, Marlin swims off to find Dory. The two hang out at the edge of the riff, with Marlin complimenting Dory's effort in finding her parents. Personally, that's a good way to end the movie, although don't expect any extra scenes like ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>So, how is this movie a sequel that ""Finding Nemo"" needed? Basically, it reveals that Dory telling folks that she suffers from short-term memory loss was rehearsed from childhood, answers how she got separated from her family, how she learned how to speak ""Whale"", and the song ""Just Keep Swimming"". In fact, it feels like it was long planned since the first movie premiered.<br/><br/>As a family film, I recommend people go see it, or even plan buying the BluRay or DVD for home viewing. Just, don't expect it to top ""Finding Nemo""."
"pamma09","8","2","9","30 June 2016"," Deep blue sea search
","Having grand kids we definitely wanted to see this film - and we are happy we did. I think that the feelings for the original film about Nemo is still there - just has another focus this time around. Dory still has her memory problems and this time you really want her to find her home. I love Hank - the animation of him is incredible - stay for the ending credits as they are so much fun. As Pixar usually does these well. The animation of Dory appeared to be more plastic to me - we did not see the 3D version but the last movie was better in some instances because of that. The notion that Dory was looking for her parents and slowly remembering things was good for kids. They cheered when she found her parents - the shells were a great way to have her find home. A well done animated movie - just not the same as Nemo."
"pinkarray","6","2","9","23 June 2016"," This year isn't going so well for animated movies
","Well, last year's movies weren't so good, this year's movies have improved a bit but they still aren't anything great. Zootopia and Finding Dory both have pretty long runtime (running for about an hour and 45 minutes) which is too long for a kid-friendly comedy. And they didn't have that much drama either.<br/><br/>The story starts off with a young Dory (at about 2 or 3) and she announces that she's suffering from short-term membory loss. Then, it shows her playing with her parents, before out of curiosity, she looks at a shell or something and then gets whisks away (in the same vein as Nemo in he first film). Since then, Dory has been asking other fishes and have been looking around for her parents.<br/><br/>Then, she gets lost and Nemo and Marlin have to consistently reunite with her as Dory tries to remember what has happened in her early years.<br/><br/>This is the unnecessary, pointless Pixar sequel of Finding Nemo. Kids may enjoy this but don't expect much new out of this, it's pretty much the same plot of trying to find your family relative, kind of like The Good Dinosaur but done in a slightly better and more heart-warming way.<br/><br/>I guess it's nice to see Dory, my childhood favorite character come back but even Marlin seems to have gotten more overprotective and Dory has gotten a bit more forgetful than the first one (although, that doesn't seem to be much of a problem since the film is about Dory recovering her memories)... And the voice acting isn't the best, while newcomer Sloane Murray does alright as the voice of Young Dory, Hayden Rolance tries to sound like the original voice of Nemo but ends up coming off as high-pitched.<br/><br/>The animation was also okay but the character design was beautiful.<br/><br/>I would put this on the same league as Monsters University. It's like a mediocre Dreamworks film. I don't understand the appeal this and Inside Out has already, even though it did have some touching and heartfelt scenes, but the only thing it's missing is some originality."
"EthanBJones_03","6","1","3","5 August 2017"," It's cute fluff - Nothing more; nothing less
","'FINDING DORY' was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neil. ​Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.<br/><br/>This movie will satisfy children and adults alike for its run time. If you hunger for something more than basic satisfaction from an animated feature, however, I cannot say I recommend it. Good voice acting, stunning animation and lovable characters are all things that this movie succeeds at while the humour and emotional payoff both lack substantially.<br/><br/>One thing I will award credit for, however, is that they don't completely copy the plot of 'Finding Nemo' and actually attempt to change things up. That said, I didn't find the plot for this film that interesting or exciting. An instant thing I noticed that differs from 'Finding Nemo' to 'Finding Dory' is the claustrophobia of it. In the original, we had a wide, amazing ocean to explore and meet colourful characters. In here we meet colourful characters but the enclosed space we're limited to negates from the sense of wonder and amazement found in the original.<br/><br/>Something that they improved in this movie, for me, was the climax. I hated the original's climax so I am glad they opted for a more inventive and interesting(to say the least) conclusion.<br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres was, of course, great as the titular character 'Dory' and continues her hot streak of playing the character to perfection. Part of the fun with Dory's character when she was introduced was her short term memory loss. That is what made her an inventive and unique character. That is why it was frustrating for me that they turned a key CHARACTER trait of hers into a nothing more than a meaningless plot device that only happened whenever the plot demanded it. I am not an avid supporter of the majority of changes between the two movies but this one takes the cake for me, as far as how unnecessary and annoying it was.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks reprises his under-appreciated role as Marlin and still delivers a strong performance to a character that didn't need to be in the movie. Other than to bloat the film's run time with a Marlin/Nemo(who they recast by the way and I guarantee you did not notice) subplot that feels unnecessary and like just a way to pad run time. Pixar - you are above run time bloating!<br/><br/>Ed O'Neil debuts the character of Hank and does a great job at it. I loved the character of Hanks and, to be honest, if this movie existed just to set up 'Finding Hank', I would be totally on board for that. Katie Olson also debuts another character, in the form of a blind whale called 'Destiny'. The performance is perfectly passable but the character is so weak and dull. Pixar try to catch lightning in a bottle twice by giving Destiny a 'craaaazy quirk' in the hilarious form of blindness. She isn't totally blind but she's pretty darn close and they use this to get a couple of laughs but it just doesn't work, at least for me.<br/><br/>Animation for this movie is stunning and Pixar continues its noble tradition of making other studios step up their game. One thing I find quite funny, however, is that the water effects in this movie, a movie about FISH and WATER, has lower quality effects than that of 'The Good Dinosaur', a film about dinosaurs. Not to say that negates the wonderful animation put to use in this film, I just thought it was kind of funny. <br/><br/>The cinematography is great, as is the editing and lighting.<br/><br/>I will say that I laughed around 4-5 times in this movie, which is really not a good batting average. Obviously children will be crying on the floor with laughter(If your kids do then may God bless your soul) but I just don't find it that funny. They run jokes into the ground and fail to create any new ones. I may very well be the only one alive who doesn't think this film is 'funny, poignant and thought provoking' but I must express my opinion with complete honest. I didn't laugh at this movie as much as I wanted to.<br/><br/>Pixar's strong suit is milking pathetic humans for their tears and films like 'Toy Story 2' and 'Up' show an inane ability to make me well up with tears from just a single scene. I didn't care about the characters in this movie. I wasn't invested and I didn't feel an emotional connection to any one particular character in this movie. The emotional payoff is not strong with this one.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this movie would work so much better as a 15 minute short accompanying a special edition of 'Finding Nemo'. Cut the filler fluff and redundant side plots and create a nice, compact story about Dory finding her parents in the OCEAN. Obviously they did not go down this road and thus I must judge the movie on its other merits. I recommend this movie for children but not really for more mature audiences because I doubt you'll find a connection to any character or really find much of the film's content funny. I'll rate the movie 6 Pointless Sequels out of 10."
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","3","7 July 2017"," Nothing soulless about this one
","Because of the studio's recent emphasis on sequels (prequels, what-have-you), I'm in the habit of selling PIXAR movies short. And ""Finding Dory"" was no exception; my expectations were admittedly low. But the filmmakers quickly reminded me of why I liked ""Nemo"" so much, and I was on board from there.<br/><br/>It's a lively adventure movie, briskly paced and boasting worthy additions to the cast. It maintains the gorgeous ocean visuals of the original and there's something genuinely heartfelt about the story. A classic family theme is sufficient, but the real message is extremely touching and appropriately subtle: teaching kids how to live with a disability.<br/><br/>There was just no disliking this movie.<br/><br/>7/10"
"christonr-64261","4","1","3","16 February 2017"," Proof that Pixar can't do sequels
","The long-awaited sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo seems to exist in a much bleaker universe than it's predecessor. Despite the 13-year gap, there is a clear shift here toward a more issues-centric film which attempts to primarily tackle common per- (and mis-)conceptions of disability (both mental and physical. The way that title character, Dory, is treated for example, is a little close to home and clearly intends to do so. Meanwhile, supporting characters such as: Hank (the septopus); Becky (seagull); and Gerald (sea lion) are each given turns to be routinely ridiculed by their peers (even Marlin!), undermined, oppressed or generally downtrodden.<br/><br/>Thankfully, each is given somewhat of an opportunity to succeed in the face of animosity and this, combined with the joyous cameos of Cockney Sea lions, a short-sighted Whaleshark and fan-favourite Crush, do provide moments of light amongst the general dour atmosphere the film appears determined to remain confined to."
"meeza","7","2","10","27 June 2016"," Should include it in your short term list of things to do
","Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of Disney Pixar's sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" called ""Finding Dory"". This time around the primary fetch star is the lovable, short-term memory loss blue fish Dory. Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of... Wait a Second! I am ADoryble myself, as most of us are who reach our mid 40's with our short term memory. Anyways, ""Finding Dory"" is very similar to the original in narrative content but does not exactly reach Nemo's depth. Dory's dilemma in ""Finding Dory"" is that she suddenly is aware that she has a mother & father and goes from sea coast-to-coast to try to find them, Nemo and his neurotic dad Marlin do help Dory in her sea quest. There are new characters in this one including a wonderful octopus named Hank who Dory meets along her search for Ma & Pa. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton, who also scribed & orchestrated ""Finding Nemo"", did a fine job also this time around; but the originality was not as creative as before due to similar plot line of ""Finding Nemo"". Ellen DeGeneres nailed the Dory voice once again, and the Ellen Show was one of the main reasons what baited me into liking the picture. Albert Brooks was also superb in his vocal performance as Marlin. Ed O'Neill also was quite the modern squid with his voice work as Hank. Right now there are not too many movies in the ""to see"" tank from what's playing in theaters; however, ""Finding Dory"" is one you should find. **** Good"
"ofpsmith","9","2","10","26 June 2016"," Just as good as the first.
","But if I had to choose which one I liked better, I would probably say the first one. I don't know why but I just end up enjoying the first one more. However this film has a lot more going on. Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) begins having random memories of her parents and remembers that she came from the Marine Life Institute in California. There she inadvertently meets Hank (Ed O'Neill) an octopus, meets up with an old friend, and ends up driving a truck. You'll really have to see the movie to understand it. Finding Dory continues expanding on characters we've already come to love, and introduces a few new ones. We also delve more into Dory's history which I was always more interested in seeing. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out. Your kids will love it."
"Filvies144","9","2","11","5 August 2016"," A sequel on par with if not, bettet than the original
","I saw Finding Dory several weeks ago, and I have to admit, I can be slow at making reviews, but that's not the point. I really enjoy Finding Nemo for its great concept, humor, and heart. Similar to the gap between Toy Story 2 (1999) and 3 (2010), this comes 13 years after the original. Because of the long gap and how most sequels aren't as good as the original, I thought I would enjoy it but it wouldn't be as good as the original. I was wrong, and here's why:<br/><br/>In this movie, Dory, (the blue tang who suffers from short term ""remembery"" loss) remembers that she has a family and sets off to find them with her two friends, the clownfish father and son Marlin and Nemo, and Dory (while trying to find her family) gets separated from Marlin and Nemo, and the father and son duo must FIND DORY (get it). From this summary, I will admit it has similarities to the original, and it can get a little predictable. However, the story has depth, (no pun intended) and true heart of a Pixar movie, especially when we see Dory's struggle with short term ""remembery"" (I meant memory) loss. It is also enjoyable, with some cleverness and it isn't very predictable.<br/><br/>As for the characters, everyone's favorite blue tang is back, and she's better than ever. She's three dimensional, therefore well developed, and still very enjoyable with a good personality. However, Marlin and Nemo are still enjoyable and funny, however not as well developed as Dory in this one. Hank the octopus (or septopus) is a very funny character who is grouchy, but later shows that he does in fact have three hearts. Destiny and Bailey are like the tank gang, and are enjoyable as well, however not as great. Mr. Ray is as funny as ever, and other characters from the first one get cameos. This may not be the best cast of characters, but it is good to see some old ones again.<br/><br/>For other things, the animation is better than terrific. It upgraded the original animation by giving out even better textures, backgrounds, and design. Pixar delivered a whole new level of high by animating Hank and his camouflage well and detailed. Also the humor is really funny, mainly from Marlin, (no pun intended)Mr. Ray, Dory, and Hank.<br/><br/>Finding Dory isn't as good as Zootopi, but is close with a 3 dimensional plot, characters that not even Dory herself could forget, and stellar animation. I definitely recommend it. Pixar has rebounded from the let down the good dinosaur."
"valen060","8","2","11","27 June 2016"," A Rare Pixar Sequel That Can Be Emotionally Riveting
","In the past, Pixar movies I've come to know as a kid since the 90s have introduced many funny and versatile characters going on the most riveting adventures. Now, Pixar has produced a sequel that may possibly be worthy of reaching the same ranks as the successful Toy Story film series. 2003's Finding Nemo spin-off sequel 'Finding Dory' is a movie that can reach an impactful emotional tone in its own right.<br/><br/>The story takes place about one year after blue tang fish Dory helped clownfish Marlin search for his son Nemo. She now lives with the clownfish family, but feels she needs to piece together the whereabouts of her own long-lost family. As before, it's a desperate search which this time ultimately leads them to another side of the Pacific, a marine life aquarium in Monterrey, California.<br/><br/>Admittedly, when I first heard the title, I began to sneer at such an idea since the studio's last two sequel/prequel efforts like Cars 2 was disastrous in terms of story. Whereas Monsters University was pretty average. Thus making me think ""what gives them the idea this sequel will be any different?"" Of course, when I first watched 'Dory,' it was something I found just as emotionally driven if certainly not better than its 2003 predecessor. I feel it is something as poised as Pixar's recent Oscar-winning hit Inside Out, namely on its importance of family. There were times in the movie where I felt lost and had some predictable scenarios as well, but this felt more than just a sequel where they throw in new characters or settings, it's the issue of how one can comprehend loss or separation, especially if the individual has an impairment in short-term memory at a very young age. Ellen DeGeneres gracefully reprises the role as forgetful fish Dory with such believability in making her look vulnerable and helpless with such a condition. With Marlin and Nemo tagging along for the ride, they are assisted by their de facto guide Hank (voiced well by 'Modern Family' star Ed O'Neill), an anxious octopus (or ""heptapus"" as Dory humorously calls him regarding missing a tentacle) wanting to escape to Cleveland as she continues her search around the aquarium. What gave a nice touch to the whole movie was actress Sigourney Weaver serving as the aquarium's hostess (similar to what she did for Pixar's Wall-E) and especially highlighting how Dory's personal journey clumsily, yet fatefully intertwined with Marlin's own journey when they first met in the 2003 original. Pixar easter eggs are also worth pondering over in various parts of the movie, too.<br/><br/>This is more than just a ""kid's movie"" and I emphasize on that. I would recommend this to adults with children of their own to see that because Dory has an impairment, she is easily misunderstood by many. But that doesn't mean it should be taken for granted. Instead, it's more about the values and what longing to be with a family truly feels like after so long."
"jacobclark512","8","2","11","27 June 2016"," Pixar hits my nostalgia button, and it works.
","If you're around my age, there's a pretty good chance that Finding Nemo was a part of your childhood, and there's also a good chance that you really enjoyed it both then and now. It is an incredibly heartfelt and emotionally rich story that just happens to be incredibly well-animated. It also stands quite well on its own.<br/><br/>So, naturally, when Disney announced that they were making a sequel entitled Finding Dory, I was more than a little skeptical of how they were going to proceed. Finding Nemo to me was so self-contained that there wasn't much of anywhere to go with the story. I mean, I know that Pixar has done some good work with sequels before, but they've also misfired big time (anybody else remember Cars 2 or Monsters University?).<br/><br/>Thankfully, Finding Dory definitely fits into the better half of Pixar's filmography. It is surprisingly engaging and a natural progression of the first film's story, and also has some of the best animation Pixar has done yet.<br/><br/>How does Pixar make this story work, you ask? It's quite simple (and quite spoiler-free as well): everything revolves around Dory's condition of short- term memory loss. There's not a real villain or even a mild antagonist anywhere to be found in the entire film. This makes it a much lighter and simpler journey than Finding Nemo, but it also makes character development suffer a little bit. Granted, there's plenty of good characters that are developed quite well in the film, in particular an octopus named Hank as well as Dory herself. I'm just of the opinion that an antagonist makes a good character into a great one. That being said, for the kind of film that Finding Dory is trying to be, it actually kind of works and is not something noticed while actually watching it.<br/><br/>This is mostly because of the stellar voice acting. Pixar has always had a knack for finding great voices to fit their characters, but Finding Dory has some particularly good choices. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory was a great choice in Finding Nemo, and seeing the back-and-forth between her and Albert Brooks as Marlin is quite refreshing and quick-witted. As far as new characters are concerned, all of them have great casting behind them. In particular, I enjoyed Ed O'Neill as the aforementioned Hank, Ty Burrell as Bailey, a beluga whale, and Kaitlin Olson as Destiny, a near-sighted whale shark. All of them had great emotion and really made their characters come alive.<br/><br/>What always sets Pixar's films apart from every other animation studio's is the quality of the animation. Finding Nemo was so gorgeous when it was released and remains an incredibly groundbreaking step in animated technology. Finding Dory takes this even further. The sheer quality, depth, and texture of the animation present here is astonishing. It might be their best-looking film to date, which even to someone who understands how far computer animation technology has advanced in the past few years might be surprising.<br/><br/>You might be asking yourself at this point whether or not I'm going to find any significant flaws in Finding Dory. As hard as I try, I can't; however, that doesn't mean it's perfect. It's mostly just really, really good all around. It never quite reaches the stellar narrative heights of the best Pixar films that have come before it and can't seem to tug on my heart as much either, but that doesn't diminish it as a standalone film. Even though it's not the best thing Pixar has ever made (which at this point would be an incredibly hard thing to make), Finding Dory is a well-animated and emotionally tugging film that will entertain both children and their parents that bring them to see it.<br/><br/>Grade: 89"

","What in the hell is wrong with the haters??I'm starting to believe they missed the point of the movie entirely. Some say Nemo is better, I actually like Finding Dory a lot more than Finding Nemo and here is why. This is the first movie for kids (and adults) that I've seen where they tell you that your illness is not an obstacle in your life, that whatever problem you have you can turn it into a positive thing and something unique that makes you who you are. In a world of bullying and discrimination, I think it's an incredibly beautiful message to give both to kids and adults. Marvin and Nemo love Dory for who she is and Dory realizes that everything she accomplished she did because of who she was. Apart from this, the movie is funny, sweet and really entertaining. The cast is also superb!! So, please, please go watch Finding Dory, no matter how old you are, and enjoy."
"christophershobris","7","2","11","22 June 2016"," Remarkable
","After a decade since Finding Nemo we finally get the...sequel? Spin-off? That we've been looking for. Pixar proves they can still make outstanding masterpieces. Lets hope they keep this going, and build back some momentum...we'll see how Cars 3 works out...but Finding Dory may become one of the greatest animated sequels or spin-off (call it what you want) ever. Here's why. Unlike some other studios who would make this a full-blown comedy like Minions with nudity, and fart jokes. Pixar shows how mature it is with their films and reminds us why we fell in love with the characters from Finding Nemo in the first place. Virtually every character is likable and none have lost their niche despite over a decade of time between this and FN. However, when it comes to Dory, she obviously is the star. Now, this is risky because sometimes when you make a supporting character the main character it can majorly backfire making you wish the supporting character stayed just that. Pixar wonderfully makes Dory extremely likable even though she has short term memory loss which you would think could get annoying, but somehow Pixar finds the right balance to keep it charming and even, yes, funny. I can also tell the animation has significantly improved from 2004, sometimes making me say, Wow, this looks like I could swim amongst them in this realistic environment. But here's what I personally love about the film is Baby Dory. She is so cute, but not annoying and awkward. Baby Dory adds this innocence to Dory as an adult making her that much more effective. I do feel like however they do seem to exploit the fact she has short-term memory loss. I thought I was going to get irritated. Even though I said it has a good balance, it did get a little bit annoying, but maybe I'm missing the fact that it is her character trait. She forgets every 10 seconds or so. As for the other characters like Hank, I felt nothing special towards him and typical grumpy character who helps the main character, I've seen those many times before. Everyone else was justifiable, Marlin's role was downgraded but still the same worry-wart he has been. Nemo is the same as the last film, and has a stronger connection to his dad. As a whole, this film is definitely worth seeing. If you miss this one in theaters, you will regret it. Beautiful animation, Dory is likable, other character are good, and the story is well crafted.

The voice cast was brilliant. The whole movie was just brilliant beautiful a piece of art on the big screen. Dory is the best Pixar character in my option she is just amazing and that is an understatement. <br/><br/>Oh yeah BECKY is AMAZING"
"Ramascreen","10","3","22","16 June 2016"," It goes straight for the heart
","How do you top a masterpiece like ""Finding Nemo"" which by the way won Oscar for best animated feature of the year more than a decade ago? How do you follow after that is exactly the million dollar question with FINDING DORY and although this sequel doesn't reach the same level of greatness, it holds its own just fine. Pixar's eternal reliance on a well-told story is why FINDING DORY goes straight for the heart.<br/><br/>All is well from the events in ""Finding Nemo,"" every character seems happy doing their usual routine. Until something triggers Dory's (Ellen DeGeneres) memory which is quite rare since as you all know, and as she keeps reminding us, she suffers from short term memory loss. She remembers she had a mom and a dad. With the help of Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Marlin (Albert Brooks) the trio once again go off on another adventure to find Dory's parents. But of course, they don't have a solid plan and they only rely on Dory's bits and pieces of memory to guide them, so this across the ocean adventure leads them to California's Marine Life Institute where Dory finds help in an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) a beluga (Ty Burrell) and a whale shark (Kaitlin Olson) If ""Finding Nemo"" has part of its story set in the ocean and the other set in a small aquarium tank in a dentist office, FINDING DORY is partly set in the ocean but mostly set out of the water, on land and in a giant rehabilitation aquarium center kinda like the one up at Monterey Bay. So the scope this time around is a lot bigger, and I'm sure that presents its own set of challenges for director Andrew Stanton and his fellow animators. But luckily the film doesn't suffer from what usually befalls other sequels which is the difficulty of recapturing that magic once it's already out of the bottle, thankfully that doesn't happen here because FINDING DORY doesn't worry too much about giving winks and nods to the first film, it can stand on its own, and aside from Marlin, Dory, and Nemo, the film also features a ton of new characters that play into a whole new round of camaraderie.<br/><br/>Does it matter for Dory to remember and find her parents? In other words, is this sequel necessary? Perhaps, and perhaps not. The first movie already ended with happily-ever-after anyway and that's what it seems to be happening at the beginning of FINDING DORY as well, but going back home and reuniting with your loved ones have always been the reason why this franchise is dearly loved by many. And another thing that stands out is that not one, not two, but more than a few of the new characters in this film have shortcomings or flaws. The beluga doesn't think his sonar skills could work, the whale shark is nearsighted, the octopus only has seven tentacles, and even a certain bird helping Marlin and Nemo is a bit unstable. But that's the beauty of FINDING DORY because it showcases the strengths from the characters that others would quickly dismiss or not deem as normal. Dory, who suffers from memory loss, is at home in this film surrounded by characters who feel for and understand exactly what she's going through in terms of their flaws. And I think that's a great lesson for children everywhere to not look for perfection but to do the best they can with what they've been given. FINDING DORY may not be the masterpiece that ""Finding Nemo"" was, and the third act may seem a bit too outrageous for some, but overall it's still a funny, heartwarming, and exciting adventure movie that the entire family can enjoy.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"
"mooreawesomeness","9","2","12","26 June 2016"," A beautiful, hilarious, and touching new adventure
","Wow. I am amazed at some of the negative comments about this movie.<br/><br/>It's been 13 years since Finding Nemo swam onto the big screen and immediately captured the hearts of people everywhere - young and old. I always felt like there was something special about Finding Nemo. Now, Pixar has created a truly wonderful sequel, Finding Dory.<br/><br/>At first I was somewhat hesitant about this new film for two reasons: 1, How could it ever live up to its predecessor? 2, Everyone knows sequels are never that great.<br/><br/>But it's important to address that this is not Finding Nemo. It is supplementary and should not really be negatively compared to it. I thought this film was stellar. From start to finish, I was locked in. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was darn close. I laughed and cried, embracing this new sequel for what it was: a new adventure. Halfway through, I told my movie buddy that I felt like this was a film you had to see again in theaters. The animation was beautiful, the actors were wonderful, and the idea of the rehabilitation center was interesting. It was nice to see Marlin and Nemo working together, and Hank was one of my favorite characters.<br/><br/>For someone who grew up on Finding Nemo, I can honestly say that I'm so happy about this sequel. It will never replace Finding Nemo, but I don't think that was its intention. This film was fueled by different intentions. In Finding Nemo, Nemo's goal is to prove his worth, while in Finding Dory, Dory wants to find her long-lost parents. And maybe I'm just naive, but at times I really didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed tagging along for the ride as new events began to unfold left and right!<br/><br/>I really loved this movie and am not ashamed to say it! I will definitely be seeing it again soon."
"RforFilm","8","2","12","20 June 2016"," Finding Dory makes for a fun splash, even if the wonder and emotional punch isn't as strong
","Thirteen years ago, Pixar gave the world one of the biggest animation hits of all time, Finding Nemo. People went nuts for the beautiful animation, the father-son story that parents related to so much, and probably the biggest selling point, the use of Ellen DeGeneres as the fish with short- term memory loss. As much of a surprise as it was to some people, I originally didn't care for Finding Nemo. I was a freshman in high school at that point and was the wrong age to get into a story about a little child trying to be found by his worrywart father. It wasn't until several years later that I gave it another watch and really started to appreciate what it gave us.<br/><br/>When Disney announced that a sequel would be developed, I wasn't sure how to react. The tract record for Pixar sequels has been a mixed bag. The Toy Story sequels are amazing movies that built upon the world of toys, but Cars 2 took a step back by giving the uninteresting side character his own story while Monsters University did all right showing us an origin story. Lets take a dive back into the water to see where Finding Dory ranks. <br/><br/>It's been about a year since the events of Finding Nemo and Blue Tang Dory (played by Ellen DeGeneres) has been living peacefully with Clownfish Marlin (played by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (played by Hayden Rolence). While she's still suffering from short-term memory lost, she's been experiencing occasional flashes of old thoughts. While helping out on field trip for Nemo's class, a view of the sting ray migration triggers a sudden urge to find her parents. With the only clue being that they might be off the coast of Morro Bay, California, Marlin and Nemo accompany her to help.<br/><br/>They arrive, but are separated when Dory is ""rescued"" by marine biologists. It turns out that the coast is right outside of a Marine Institute/Aquarium attraction. It's here where Dory also comes across a grumpy Octopus Hank (played by Ed O'Neil), a near-sighted shark whale Destiny (played by Katlin Olson), and a beluga whale whose sonar is broken Bailey (played by Ty Burrell). They all try to help Dory see where her parents went while Marlin and Nemo try to find Dory. <br/><br/>Finding Dory seems like a sequel that doesn't have much reason to exist, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Thanks to the same team from the original movie returning, they give Dory a pretty solid background on where she came from. Parents of children with disabilities will probably relate to this story given how much Dory's parents go through to make sure their daughter is happy. While part of me misses some of the characters from before, it makes up by including some likable new animals. Ed O'Neal seems to know how to use his ""grumpy"" personality to his advantage. Of course this movie belongs to Ellen DeGeneres who is not only funny, but a pretty good dramatic actress (she much love doing her talk show, as I've always wondered why she hasn't done more movies).<br/><br/>Finding Dory is a very good movie, though not a great one. To be fair, the original movie is tough to top. I think the issue falls on two things. First, the story of Dory finding her parents can feel a bit repetitive to the first movie. And also, while Finding Nemo gave us a vast ocean off the coast of Australia, here were stuck at this Marine park for most of the story. It's nice looking, but it does limit how much these fish can do.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Dorys out of ten. This movie will definitely please families looking for a fun animated movie and movie fans that have been waiting for a sequel. I myself was laughing at several jokes and even hoped that Dory would find what she was looking for. It may have not had the emotional punch the original had, but Finding Dory is a solid effort, come on in with the fishes and keep on swimming."
"captainmike-michael","8","2","12","20 June 2016"," Generic, but a Satisfying and Beautiful Sequel
","Pixar has once again strengthened its brand on delivering quality animation, though lack of highly original featured in Inside Out but definitely not repeating the sequel misfire just as the Cars franchise. The plot itself seems a bit generic, familiar and sort of predictable but the combination of both positive and negative core values about determination, love, family, friendship, memories, sadness, lost and regret have contributed to several thought provoking moments. It is a bright, clever and simple thanks to the adorable main character, Dory and introduction of new characters full with heart; audiences might have mix feelings of sweetness, inspiring and sadness throughout the adventure of this little blue creature under the sea with spectacular and colorful visual treats. It might not match the classiness of Nemo and full of kids imagination especially at the final act, it still works well for family goers and delivers the messages which the film intends to. Just like what Dory says ""The best things happen by chance, because that's life""; the best animation happens by teamwork, because that's real effort."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","2","12","17 June 2016"," Worth a Gander
","So this is it. It's been 21 years since Pixar first released its maiden film and captured the coveted cross-generational appeal and universal acclaim that brought unbelievable success to a once fledgling animation studio. Within those 21 years there have been some stumbles (cough, cough Cars 2 (2011)) yet to date none of Pixar's films, full feature or otherwise have been critically panned to the point where audiences stay away in droves. Will Finding Dory be the one to put down the giant? Like everything that turns 21, will Pixar stop growing and slowly slide into ill-health?<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that despite being a sequel, Finding Dory is a solid, visually striking and thoroughly entertaining feature. Dory (DeGeneres) the Blue Tang with the heart of gold and a memory of...well a fish, begins to remember where she comes from after connecting the dots of past traumas. She, along with clown fish Marlin (Brooks) and Nemo (Rolence) make the long journey from Australia's Great Barrier Reef to California in order to find her family. Along the way to Dory's ultimate self-discovery they meet a cast of colorful characters including a grumpy octopus named Hank (O'Neill), a nearsighted whale shark named Destiny and the recorded voice of Sigourney Weaver which drones over the loud speakers of the California Marine Life Institute.<br/><br/>Finding Dory hits just the right amount of familiar story beats to keep children rooting for their favorite characters while introducing new themes, characters and emotional textures as to not seem repetitive. Very little of the film focuses on the journey to get from the anemone to the shores of the Golden State (despite it being far further than P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney). Instead much of the movie takes place at the aforementioned Marine Life Institute where our protagonists split for a spell. By that point Finding Dory more closely resembles a game of Zelda than a road movie with characters solving a multitude of problems within a finite time frame.<br/><br/>It is the scenes where Dory and Marlin come up with out-of-the-box solutions and take bold risks that remain the most entrancing thematically. While many children's films follow the mold of a moral about perseverance despite adversity, Finding Dory takes things a bit further. With the help of the camouflaging Hank, the echo location skills of Bailey the beluga (Burrell), the unique (let's say) abilities of Becky the sea bird et al. we get the sense the movie is telling us that we can all use a little help from our friends from time to time. Friends who through a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and abilities can help you figure things out.<br/><br/>There were some small missteps many of which stem from the dicey proposition of having the goofy sidekick play the lead roll. In Finding Nemo (2003), Dory's short-term memory loss was an endearing (if occasionally annoying) little quirk that worked well against Marlin's growing perturbation. Here however, Dory is left to fend for herself one too many times. It may sound heartbreaking on paper but on film, Dory's constant struggle to realize where she is and what she was formerly doing gets frustrating after a time. Luckily Hank fills the straight-man void while Marlin and Nemo hurriedly try to find Dory.<br/><br/>In comparison to Pixar's other features, Finding Dory arguably sits comfortably in the middle of the pack. It doesn't reach the narrative nadir of The Good Dinosaur (2015) but it's certainly no Up (2009). The stakes aren't as grave as the original and the emotional core of the film feels slight by comparison. That said, the film's keen ability to solve problems creatively, coupled with some new and interesting characters keeps the film incredibly entertaining to watch. Additionally the takeaway in this case is sincere, will executed and not all that common. Overall, Finding Dory is worth your time to see in theaters and proof that not everything begins to dystrophy after 21."

","I saw ""Finding Dory"", starring the voices of Ellen DeGeneres-Pauly Shore is Dead, Coneheads; Albert Brooks-Concussion, Drive; Ed O'Neill-Modern Family_tv, The Bone Collector and Sigourney Weaver-Chappie, Avatar.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to the 2003 'Finding Nemo', which is 13 years later-if my math is correct-but the time period in this movie takes place only a year later. Ellen/Dory gets separated from her parents and runs into Albert/Marlin, who helps her in her quest to be reunited with them. If you recall from the previous movie, Ellen has a short term memory loss. Thankfully, she runs into lots of helpful friends, which seems to be the theme of the movie; Sometimes, you need friends. Ed/Hank is an octopus that becomes a friend and Sigourney plays the voice who is in charge of the Marine Life Institute-she is never actually shown as a character, only heard over the speaker systems. It's kind of like Seaworld where they have sea creatures on display for the public and they also will do rescue and release service for the fish and they will then release them back into the oceans-or to a zoo, if that is where they are needed. Before the movie, there was a 6 minute cartoon called 'Piper', about a baby sandpiper learning to hunt for food at the beach. Also, there is a scene after the end credits, at the very end of the movie, so try to keep your little ones seated until then, if you can-it should be easy enough since they show scenes all through the end credits. This is another hit for Pixar/Disney. It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie, as did everyone with me, and I would buy it on DVD."
"sesht","Null","2","12","18 June 2016"," Review-proof: Breathless, yet endearing ride
","Some movies are gonna do well, in spite of anyone trying to recommend them, or not. <br/><br/>Now, few reviews I've read on this, before I stepped into the cinema, remarked that this was an inferior sequel, and the focus should have been more on the journey than on the ultimate destination. <br/><br/>I have to disagree with that, though the reviewer is someone I do respect.<br/><br/>They also took exception to the number of times Dory keeps referring to her condition - but, in her position, if we buy into that conceit, like we did, in 'Memento', where the lead character also keeps mentioning the same fact whenever he got to interact with any other character in the movie. <br/><br/>I do wish Andrew Stanton was more ambitious though, but this was pretty serviceable and decent. <br/><br/>The myriad supporting characters, including a new hero of sorts, the octopus, an imprinted bird, 2 whales, returning characters from the 'Finding Nemo' pop up to great disposable entertainment. <br/><br/>However, at one point, I thought the audience was expected to be too patient with the goings-on, and the number of ways in which the main characters lose and find one another so many times, that it soon gets to be tiring, and more mainstream than anything I've seen in a Pixar flick. <br/><br/>This is a fitting 2nd chapter though, which propels the tale forward, and does not need the tag of it being a 'cash-grab' or 'unnecessary' sequel.<br/><br/>The 3D overwhelms, and the score has to be one of the best composed, bettering the one composed for the first one. <br/><br/>The pace never flags, and there's always something going on, without the characters pausing for a moment of respite. I generally prefer if movies allow their characters to breathe, but this one will appeal to the young-uns with shorter attention spans. Older ones with the same problem also will be entertained.<br/><br/>Little Dory is one of the best, cutest characters ever committed to (animated) film.<br/><br/>There are flaws, like how, after some time, the malady does not pose heavy plot problems, but they can be ignored, overall. This is a children's flick, after all. <br/><br/>But I have to compliment the makers for something - the loneliness experienced by someone with a condition like Dory's, has not been glossed over either, and the pathos of the situation, and the character, comes through strongly, even though that might also be a function of where I might be in life, and what I was reminded of, by my own life experiences. <br/><br/>Movie watching is ultimately a subjective experience, and I loved this one, and will watch it a few times more."

","I wanted to give this movie a higher review, but unfortunately I couldn't allow myself to. However, with that said, before I get to the movie, I'd like to mention that if you're the type of person who expects a certain amount of plausibility and realism from a computer generated image movie, written for children in a blatant (and should be quite apparent) attempt to suspend reality for an hour and a half, this will not be your movie. And if you're that type of person, you probably find A LOT of movies disappointing. <br/><br/>Finding Dory was an absurdly fast-paced movie, with too much emphasis on driving the plot forward, rather than letting it develop on its own. Dory was a wonderful supporting character in Finding Nemo, but in this movie we just weren't given enough of a reason to invest emotionally in her adventure. While Finding Nemo felt like a very organic and nuanced story, this movie feels incredibly contrived and tries to inflate its bland emotionless existence with over-the-top action sequences and clumsy joking around which only made me want to know when things were going to get interesting, only to discover that they never really do. While Finding Nemo relied a great deal on the ocean and played on different sea life and settings, this movie makes almost no attempt to involve the aquarium where the majority of the movie takes place - instead it forces the story to take place around it and in spite of it. <br/><br/>But even as a stand alone movie, Finding Dory falls short of giving enough reason to want to see what happens next. Rather it relies on being the sequel to a wonderful movie and attempts to ride those coat tails while also trying to skimp on the storytelling. In all, a disappointment."
"jfgibson73","4","1","4","25 February 2017"," Disappointed
","I thought Finding Dory was a letdown. After the first Nemo movie and Wall-E, only a masterpiece of the same magnitude would have satisfied. The story of this movie is that Dory, the beloved character from Finding Nemo, makes her way to an aquarium to find her parents. Most of the movie consists of her making her way through the facility trying to track down where she came from. There are a lot of scenes of her being carried in a pail, swimming through pipes, and moving through nice looking scenery. I just wasn't moved by any of it. When the movie arrives at its climax, I felt no emotional payoff. There was also an action sequence near the end that drained any interest I had of not only finishing the movie, but of visiting these characters again. This movie was just a series of empty obstacles with no reason for viewers to care."

The character easily steals the show in this movie, being the most interesting and most fun to watch with his stealthy, ninja/secret agent moves and tricks.<br/><br/>I found ""Finding Dory"" to be almost as good as ""Finding Nemo,"" with Hank the octopus being the most interesting, animated character I have seen in years.

","People seem to be quite disappointed by this movie, I on the other hand could not have been happier with what Pixar provided for one main reason. Dory has a mental disability that isn't played for laughs and does not stop her from achieving what she wants to achieve. That simple thing is going to mean so much to so many people. <br/><br/>Dory suffers from short term memory loss, a mental disability, this affects her a lot this can be seen in both movies. But what is mainly shown in this movie is just how much it affects her life. It is so severe that she forgets parents for a large portion of her life. But it doesn't stop her and that is what separates this movie from so many others.<br/><br/>There are going to be thousands, if not millions, of kids who are disabled who will see themselves in Dory. This character is so rarely seen in any movie much less a kids one. A character that is more than their disability, Dory never rids of her short term memory loss instead she learns to overcome it, to live with it and not against it. There was even a little of that in Finding Nemo with his ""lucky fin"" but it's taken whole other level in this movie. <br/><br/>Yeah Marlon and Nemo weren't in it that much, but it wasn't there story. It was Dory's, her story was overcoming her short term memory loss. Maybe that wasn't what the masses wanted to see, but it's what many have needed for a long time."
"aceofspades96","7","2","13","19 June 2016"," A heart-wrenching story of a fish... I'm serious.
","Finding dory was a great, fun, and emotional journey from start to finish. While the film is definitely aimed at family audiences in 2016, the people who grew up watching Finding Nemo when they were younger will definitely appreciate this film as much as everyone else. <br/><br/>Pixar for the most part stayed true to the original film. We obviously have the same characters, the same actors (except for one) and the same overall universe. Pixar did a great job of connecting the dots between the two movies. Some of the same scores from the last film. For instance in the last film when Marin followed the boat, the same score is used when we see Dory's perspective of how the two met. It's a nice little touch, and it really shows how much detail the writers went into creating the character. It really is a puzzle how Pixar manages to create these visually stunning animated films every year. The picture was great! Really tiny details such as dust particles, or individual grains of sand, and other fine touches really add to the great depth the animators went into making the film from the ground up. <br/><br/>As usual, Pixar had very little flaws in their work. I felt like Nemo was poorly used. Sure they make references to the other films, but it's the way Nemo says things to his dad that anger me. For instance, Nemo tried to tell Marlin he should trust people because he keeps making him feel like they can't do it. And then they just drop it there, and don't say anything about it again. <br/><br/>For the second time in my life, I had the joy of being able to go see a Pixar film. This, and Tou Story 3 are the only two Pixar movies I've ever seen in a theatre. And I'll go ahead and say that I love Pixar's work even better on the big screen. Truly a sequel worth seeing, and a sequel that everyone should love."
"cartoonfreak1989","8","2","13","19 June 2016"," Unforgettable
","There are two ways to make a good sequel. The first is to make a film that's better than the original. In this regard, Finding Dory fails. Compared to the near-perfection of Finding Nemo, this sequel falls short. Too many scenes lack thematic resonance, the pacing is often rushed, and the set pieces threaten suspension of disbelief, particularly towards the end. <br/><br/>This is not to say that the film is bad - quite the opposite, in fact. The concept of a character with short-term memory loss trying to find herself is incredibly daring, and only Pixar would dare to even try it in a mainstream movie. The fact that they pull it off is nothing short of incredible. Make no mistake: this may be Pixar's darkest film yet, at least on a psychological level. Andrew Stanton directs this masterfully, composing shots in just the right way to represent Dory's emotions, whether it be first-person shots to display her anxiety, or zoomed-out shots of her alone in the open void of the ocean (the latter reminds me of Gravity, and I deeply regret not being able to see this in 3D just for those moments). Yet Stanton's script always manages to balance the darkness with light humour, even if it' sparely quite up to the wit of the original film. <br/><br/>One area that is a huge improvement over the original film is the performance of Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. I think I may be in the minority when I say that I wasn't overly enamoured with her performance in the original film. It was solid, without a doubt, but I can imagine several professional voice actresses doing it just as well, if not better. In this film, however, she lifts the par, flowing seamlessly from hilariously ditsy to tragically lost, and finally to a wellspring of personal strength. DeGeneres has been very, very public in her support for this film, and it shows in the passion of her performance. It is easily the best I have heard in a Pixar film, and is one of the best that I have heard in any work of animation. <br/><br/>Pixar always deliver on a technical level, and this is no exception. Thomas Newman continues to be the ideal composer for Stanton's films, his haunting scores fitting the stories, scenes, and characters perfectly. From an animation perspective, the film is as gorgeous, as we've come to expect from Pixar. It's just a shame that the film spends most of its time in a man-made environment, thus rarely taking the audience to a place of wonder. <br/><br/>In a sense, that's the problem with the film, and why it's not as good as the original: it rarely managed to fill me with the same sense of wonder that I felt watching the original. Finding Nemo is a modern classic, a film as revolutionary, in its own way, as Toy Story. Finding Dory is not. <br/><br/>But that's okay, because there is another way to make a good sequel, and that is to make the the original better, and to expand upon its world, characters, and themes. In this regard, Finding Dory is a phenomenal success. If Finding Nemo is about learning to let a child stand on his own two feet (well, swim with their own fins), then Finding Dory is about being that child. In seeing Dory as that child, it enriches her character, and adds another layer to the already brilliant original. <br/><br/>In short, Finding Dory is like its protagonist. Like Dory, it's often unfocused, at times frustrating. And like Dory, it's beautiful, amazing, and utterly unforgettable."
"dave-mcclain","8","2","13","18 June 2016"," ""Finding Dory"" fish-tails nicely with its predecessor, but has different strengths.
","Movie Fans are always searching for something when we go to the movies. I mean, that's why we go to the theater, right? We're looking to be entertained, touched, inspired, educated, and more. Filmmakers are more than happy to facilitate our search. In the past three decades or so, we Movie Fans searched for Spock, spent time searching for Bobby Fisher and for Sugar Man, and engaged in efforts aimed at finding places called Graceland and Neverland, finding people called Forrester and Mr. Right and, of course, finding a little lost clownfish named Nemo. But all that looking was easier than actually finding a sequel to the Best Animated Feature Oscar winner ""Finding Nemo"". One of that film's voice acting co-stars, Ellen DeGeneres, spent years on her talk show calling for a sequel. You wouldn't think it would be difficult to find the motivation to make a sequel to one of the highest-grossing and best-loved animated films of all time, but the original's director and co-writer, Andrew Stanton, felt he needed to find a decent story first. Eventually, he did, and now Ellen and her co-stars, along with all of us Movie Fans, get to enjoy ""Finding Dory"" (PG, 1:37).<br/><br/>It's a direct sequel to the 2003 original, but is also part prequel and part sidequel. At the beginning of this film, we get a short origin story when we meet the adorable titular regal blue tang fish, who's even more adorable as a tiny, young swimmer (voiced by Sloane Murray and Lucia Geddes). Dory is struggling to navigate life under the sea as a small fish with comical (but not overdone) short-term memory loss but she has the help of her patient and loving parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy). Sadly, Dory forgets about the dangers of the undercurrent near her home and she ends up getting swept away from mom and dad, and just lost. As an adult, Dory (Degeneres) meets a clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is desperately working at finding his lost son, Nemo (now voiced by Hayden Rolence), and the kind-hearted Dory offers to help Marlin find Nemo. (That's the sidequel part.) A year after Nemo is found and returns to life off the coast of Australia, Dory is living right next to Marlin and Nemo's anemone home and regularly accompanies Nemo to his school of fish. During one of the lessons taught by Mr. Ray (a spotted eagle ray, voiced again by Bob Peterson), Dory flashes back to a memory about her parents. She decides that she needs to find them and asks Marlin and Nemo to help her – even though it means swimming to California. Marlin is reluctant to embark on another adventure in the open ocean, but he kinda owes Dory for helping to save Nemo and all, so Marlin agrees. With the help of their old friends the sea turtles, led by Crush (again voiced by director and co-writer Andrew Stanton), and with his son, Squirt (now voiced by Bennett Dammann), Dory, Marlin and Nemo make it all the way to an educational water park at Morro Bay, California... but have no aquatic idea what to do next.<br/><br/>As with ""Finding Nemo"", in ""Finding Dory"", creatures of various species show themselves to be more helpful and compassionate to each other than most members of the species homo sapiens are. After Dory gets herself scooped up by people harvesting fish off the coast, a couple of lazy sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) lift their heads off of their favorite rock long enough to hook up Marlin and Nemo with a (literal) loon named Becky. She scoops Marlin and Nemo up in a pail and helps them get inside the Marine Life Park in hopes of finding Dory. Meanwhile, Dory has been tagged and taken to a quarantine area, where she waits with the other sea creatures to be shipped to a new large aquarium in Cleveland. Dory meets a grumpy octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) who is set to be sent back to the ocean, but wants Dory's fin tag so he can be sent to Cleveland. (And why not? With a world-class arts scene, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, improving sports teams and terrific zoo, what's not to love?) Marlin and Nemo spend the rest of the movie overcoming obstacles to find Dory as she, with Hank's help, tries to find her parents. Dory gets additional aid from Destiny (Katilin Olson), a nearsighted whale shark who turns out to be a long-lost childhood friend, and a beluga whale named Bailey (Ty Burrell) who lacks confidence in his own echolocation abilities. Guided by additional flashes of memory, the signs within Marine Life Park and the educational loud-speaker narration of Sigourney Weaver (as herself), Dory slowly zeroes in on finding out what happened to her parents, even as all of the characters learn some lessons about determination, helpfulness and valuing each other's individual qualities.<br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" is a true sequel to its predecessor, but has different strengths. While ""Finding Nemo"" was a revelation in its animation and story-telling, ""Finding Dory"" keeps the action more confined and tighter. The first film has more interesting characters and more laughs, but the sequel has more heart. Of course, the sequel also benefits from the significant advances in computer animation over the previous dozen years. The backgrounds are wonderful, the textures on the sea creatures are remarkable and the colors are vibrant. I definitely recommend ""Finding Dory"" (whether you saw the original or not) – and I'd also recommend that you get to the theater early enough for the adorable animated short ""Piper"" (which is deserving of an Oscar nomination, along with the main attraction) and stay long enough to see the cute and funny post-credits scene. From the end of the previews until the screen finally goes dark, it's all worth it for ""Finding Dory"". ""A-"""

","When I heard about this film, I thought to myself that it really wasn't needed, and that creating a film out of another character getting lost would be too similar and repetitive. As it is, I do give props to the filmmakers for not really repeating the same beats as Finding Nemo. In this one, it's not as much that Dory gets lost, but rather that she is on a mission of her own. Still, I never found it anything more than good. I think the script is a bit over-stuffed, and some of it just seems tired. I do like the message but I wouldn't consider this one of Pixar's best efforts by any means. The voice performances are great as always, and although there are some flaws and none of it really hits greatness, it is still a very enjoyable film that families can enjoy together. Definitely recommended."

","When I saw they were making a sequel to Finding Nemo called Finding Dory I was excited and skeptical at the same time. Although all the Toy Story sequels are spectacular, I couldn't help to think about how much Cars 2 was a mistake. <br/><br/>I guess this is why they needed a more than a dozen years to work on Finding Dory to make sure they get it right, and they did get it right. <br/><br/>Like the title states, the movie was focus around the supporting character from Finding Nemo, Dory, a fish suffering from short term memory loss, brilliantly played by Ellen DeGeneres. <br/><br/>Who didn't love Dory in the first movie and now, they made an entire movie that centers around the character.<br/><br/>Finding Dory was so much fun and so funny all the way through. I was worried that they would not be able to take the magic of what DeGeneres did with Dory in the first film and keep it going for an entire feature, but that's exactly what happen beyond my expectations.<br/><br/>I was not expecting to laugh out loud so many times. Though Dory's adventure to find the parents she finally remembers was not as impressive as the adventure of Melvin Finding Nemo, the entire journey was filled with fun and very heart warming. <br/><br/>It's definitely worth a trip to the movies."
"leonblackwood","7","1","5","29 November 2016"," Brilliant fun for the whole family! 7/10
","Review: I really enjoyed this film. Its full of energy and originality right from the beginning, and the different characters made it a joy to watch. Pixar are definitely back on top form, because they get the mixture of comedy and drama, exactly right so it's great for all ages. The animation also looks terrific and the attention to detail, especially with the octopus (Hank) was truly amazing. Although the first film, Finding Nemo, looked terrific, I must admit, I did prefer this movie, mainly because of the new characters which covered every element of the sea world. The story writers didn't waste time on the fact that Dory had a memory loss problem, and that he was lost in the middle of the ocean, so it gets straight on with Dory trying to find his parents, which I really liked. Every character had there own mission, and they brought there skills on board to help Dory on his wild journey. Even Sigourney Weavers 3-step message played a big part in the film, so they really had everything covered, which is why it made such a profit at the box office. The only downside of the film, was that it seemed to end very abruptly, after following Dory on such an epic journey. With all his new friends, I was expecting a big singalong or something to end the film on a high. Anyway, it's definitely a feel good movie which has something for everyone, so it gets the thumbs up from me. Great!<br/><br/>Round-Up: With such a hefty budget, Pixar took a big gamble with this movie, mainly because the first movie was such a big hit but in this case the gamble seemed to have paid off. It was directed by Andrew Stanton who brought you a Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Wall-E and the awful John Carter. He also contributed his writing skills to the Toy Story franchise and Monsters Inc., so he's a big player in Pixar, whose vision has played a big part in Pixar's success. With some great actors supplying there voice to the cast of this film, and some great bonus material, Stanton has definitely comeback from the terrible loss that John Carter made. <br/><br/>Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $1billion (WOW)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell, Kaitlin Olson, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, Idris Elba, Dominic West, Kate McKinnon, Bill Hader, Sigourney Weaver, Andrew Stanton, Willem Dafoe, Austin Pendleton and Allison Janney. 7/10"
"bob the moo","Null","1","6","26 December 2016"," Has the technology and comedy but, most importantly, the heart is front and center
","I confess I approached Dory with a certain wariness, since it seemed odd to have a sequel so many years after the original, plus the concept sounded like it would simply be a rehash of the original film but with a different lead character. In a way the latter thought is valid, since there are similarities between the films in terms of characters, jokes, and narrative. However Dory manages to be more than a late cash-in, and stands up as another very fine Pixar film.<br/><br/>The impressive animation goes without saying, although it is really amazing what can be done with computer animation now. The plot itself is not brilliant; it does feel overly familiar in essence, and it of course relies a huge amount on coincidence and convenience – in a lesser film such things would be a major distraction, but here they are not so much. The reason for this is how well the majority of it works. The pacing of the delivery is spot-on throughout, and the writing of the characters and their dialogue is much better than the base narrative. It is consistently funny, with plenty of snap to the delivery, but really what makes it work is the same with the majority of Pixar films – which is that it has heart.<br/><br/>Dory is more than a comedy blue fish; she has inadequacies, pain, and insecurities while also at the same time being warm, likable, and engaging. A lot of this rests with the delivery by DeGeneres; certainly this is not a dialed-in piece of voice-work that can often be the case with animated films, this is a real performance. She brings a lot to the character and it comes across in the film, making us care and go with her. The other voice work is not at that level, mainly because they do not have to be, but there is plenty of good work here, even if some of it is a bit more of a piece (eg O'Neill and Burrell very much play how you are used to them playing). Too many to point out, in small and larger roles, but my favorite of course was a Wire reunion for McNulty and Bell.<br/><br/>A very enjoyable family film; all of Pixar's usual strengths, but the most important one is that the character of Dory is tangible, emotive, and engaging."
"RyanMRobertWalker","6","1","6","29 July 2016"," Finding Dismality
","Aren't we all children at heart? I know for sure I'm a big one, especially when it comes to sequels to animations that came out when I was a genuine younger kid myself and I begin to get all nostalgic. I went to see Ice Age: Collision Course yesterday but I'll cast my view on that one aside. I watched Finding Nemo in cinemas upon its release back in 2003 (among other traumatised kids after the opening...) and for me it was a dip into an ocean filled with a near perfect balance of excitement, laughter, shocks and the occasional sad moment (... with that barracuda! I handled Jaws as a kid better than seeing that thing.) In the case of Finding Dory however, the ocean was filled with a lot more sorrow than anything else this time. It is often the case with many movies that the trailers turn out to be better than the film as a whole, and sadly that was exactly the case here for me. I was laughing throughout the trailer I first saw before a screening of 'The Secret Life of Pets' (another film for which I enjoyed the trailer much more.) There isn't much that is special about the 3D version I watched, and if you don't wish to pay the extra few quid for the glasses, you won't be missing too much flying out of the screen your way that would amaze you any more than it would in standard 2D. The movie didn't offer as much laughs as the first film, and most funny moments I had already seen in the trailer. There were much more emotional moments and I felt the balance was poor between the joyful and the sorrowful, with the sorrowful vastly outweighing. I didn't cry, though if I was the age I was when I saw Finding Nemo then I probably would have. It was definitely great though to see old animated faces in a new adventure, with, alongside Ellen DeGeneres' Dory, Albert Brooks returning as the voice of Marlin and newcomer Hayden Rolence replacing Alexander Gould (who actually guest voices as another character) as Nemo, as well as meeting many new characters, my personal favourites being Fluke and Rudder the Sea Lions (voiced by Idris Elba and Dominic West.) John Ratzenberger, as expected, had his usual Pixar cameo as a random character. It's a fun enough new adventure, if not a little familiar in moments, and Pixar's animation is as beautiful to watch as it is in any other of it's movies, but I did walk out of the screening at the end feeling slightly depressed. It could have been less dreary and offered more laughs and general happiness, but this is essentially the story of a young child searching for her parents for years. It shouldn't disappoint the youngest kids eager to see it who haven't had to wait so long for this sequel because they were born years after the first film even came to DVD, but many of the older kids didn't seem so impressed. Personally I would by chance watch it again, but most likely following Finding Nemo as part of a 'Finding' marathon at home... so long as I don't misplace my copy of it."
"pkeets","8","1","6","28 July 2016"," Loved Hank and the Freedom for Fish Theme
","I thought this was a great movie, but maybe that's because it's more for adults than for children. I'm not a fan of sentimental stories, but this one really caught my imagination. People are looking at the wrong thing when they complain about Dory's story being weak or overly sentimental. The important theme here is how we treat intelligent sea creatures like whales and octopi. They're hunted, held captive and even slaughtered as food in some parts of the world. I love Hank's attitude and the way he takes over at the end to save the whole truck load of fish from imprisonment in the Cleveland exhibit.<br/><br/>Besides that, the animators have done a great job. The way the fish move looks very realistic, and the colors are beautiful. The job they did on Hank is especially notable, as he moves very gracefully for a seven- legged creature, and manages to combine octopus and human characteristics. That's pretty hard for something as alien as an octopus."

I was having all kinds of emotions while watching this movie, and to be completely honest ""I even cried"", I've never cried when it comes for me and watching a movie.

"iaintemperley","8","1","6","28 July 2016"," Pixar keeps on swimming to success
","I had some concerns going in to watch this. Namely, the quality of Pixar's output since Toy Story 3, Inside Out aside, hadn't been as strong as what had gone before. A feeling of sequelitis seemed to be setting in while also being overshadowed by the recent hot streak Walt Disney Animation Studios has been on, both critically and commercially. Could Pixar then be able to do original film Finding Nemo justice an d expand the story without losing the magic and not feel like a retread or fail to bring the creative ingenuity the studio was known for? Suffice to say my concerns were laid to rest.<br/><br/>Finding Dory avoids feeling like a retread by focusing on the backstory and journey of Dory, voiced again wonderfully by Ellen DeGeneres, while still keeping Marlin and Nemo at arms length thus providing a new dynamic to the story but still retaining that sense of familiarity of the already established world. It helps that Dory is such an engaging and likable character meaning, that you'll never be bored in her company and remain emotionally invested in her quest to find her parents (spot-on work from Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton) but also who she is. And she is not the only well-written character in this film.<br/><br/>Sequels tend to be bigger in scope and story however while Finding Nemo had the whole ocean to explore here the action is mostly confined to one location: The Marine Life Institute. However this does not prove to be limiting and is explored in depth with a community of characters that are well-defined and not one note, with a good range of a top voice cast, like the toys from Sunnyside Daycare (TS 3). Ed O'Neil's grouchy Hank the octopus is a stand out, providing a nice counterpart to the optimistic Dory generating plenty of laughs and good driving force for the plot.<br/><br/>The animation is of course excellent, bringing both the ocean and the Institute to beautiful life with the occasional creative visual flourish Pixar is known for. In particular the animators have fun with the chameleon abilities of Hank and the range of colourful fish at their disposal.<br/><br/>Admittedly the film does have its faults. There is a rather repetitive feel with an element of the story of characters being separated and reunited again as well as multiple scenes in pipes plus running jokes. Nonetheless this film reminds us just what makes Pixar so special. Funny, visually impeccable and a story that is original and inventive. The jokes will appeal to both children and adults (they even find a great use for one of the most overused songs in film history) plus there is an underlying message of coping and succeeding with, or despite a, disability, a disappointingly rare observation found in a family film. Nothing fishy here: this is a real human treat."

As the film moved on, the excitement and stirring of emotion increases to wrap up the film very nicely. In addition, the animation is stunning and beautiful, it's almost hard to believe.

Young Nemo asks Marlin, ""What Would Dory Do?"" and they do what Dory would. As strange as it sounds, there is a car chase involving the truck transporting the fish with Hank at the helm.

","Another Pixar sequel is here, and this time it takes place under water with 'Finding Dory', the sequel to the 2003 hit 'Finding Nemo'. Wow, has it really been thirteen years since Pixar made $940 million off that cute orange fish? Well, Pixar is in the sequel making business these days, and with 'Finding Dory', they seem to have made an enjoyable and entertaining sequel that has some funny moments, but misses the mark on the heart and soul of the first film – not to mention the lack of creative story telling devices that the first movie had throughout. I'm sure this sequel will make a huge splash with all audiences, but the kids are more likely to eat this up than the adults.<br/><br/>Taking place a year after the first film, Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) are enjoying life in the reef, where Marlin is still worried about everything, Nemo is loving school, and Dory is still forgetting everything, due to her short term memory loss condition. Somehow, she remembers she has a parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy), and even stranger is that she somehow remembers where they live, which is in California. Soon, she enlists the help of Marlin and Nemo, and the trio are off from Australia to California via a recognizable sea of turtles. This is where I thought the plot would thicken with adventure, but in a split second, the trio is in California, where the bulk of the movie takes place at a dreary Monterey Marine Life Institute, which is more like an aquarium, leaving the vast ocean life on the back burner this time.<br/><br/>Things get a bit silly and ridiculous from here on out in the form of Dory trying to enlist the help of other animals to get herself inside the aquarium. Perhaps the best addition to this sequel is in the form of a color/shape shifting octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill), who is perfectly content being inside a tank and not in the vast ocean abyss. He's super funny in a good dry way. Other supporting characters include a near-sighted whale-shark and a Beluga whale who can't use its auditory sense very well. They are also welcome additions, but don't serve much purpose. There are some genuine moments and a decent, if not jumbled message for the kids, as well as some good laughs, but it doesn't pack the creativity nor the current that the first film had.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning, and maybe one of the BEST looking Pixar films to date. Every nuance of sea life and underwater scene is intricate with the finest of details and fully immerses you into this world. The voice work is spot on and Ellen DeGeneres shines as Dory, while Ed O'Neill and Albert Brooks pack some good laughs. Even though, a lot of the charm and boldness of the first film is gone here, 'Finding Dory' is still worth seeing. Be sure to stay until after the credits for a great sequence involving some cameos and a trio of hilarious sea lions.<br/><br/>WORTH A LOOK!"

Scenes in the aquarium are bright and lively and I could watch a whole movie just exploring that tank and meeting the various sea creatures that reside in there.<br/><br/>Young Dory is maybe the cutest character I've ever seen, and her determination to find her family is what made her such a breakout character 13 years ago. This film doesn't really reach the great heights of Nemo, but it certainly adds a whole lot of charm to an already charming world. I hope Pixar continues to make original and creative movies, but if they want to make more sequels they need to look no further than this movie to get an idea of how they should be done."

","I registered to this site just for this review! Why? Because the movie was seriously good. I'm really impressed. So, firstly, plot was really good. A sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" as ""Finding Dory"" was pretty much a good idea. And all of the scenes was beautiful and creative. They both appeals to eyes and memories, and they were not cliché either. I also want to refer that this movie was a good choice both for kids and adults who watched Nemo before since for kids, it has cool and creative scenes, which are also funny, and for adults it has moments that are emotional, deep and motivational. A person who watched Nemo in his childhood times could easily like this film because with generation, i can claim, this film has grown up too..."

","In 2003 Andrew Stanton brought us the story of a clown fish who loses his son and goes on a wild adventure, along with the help of a forgetful palette surgeonfish, to find him. 13 years later (or a year later Finding Nemo time), Stanton is back with another underwater tale, only this time focusing heavily on fan favourite Dory. A highly anticipated and long awaited sequel, Finding Dory doesn't disappoint, being a fairly good Pixar film, but it does fail to come anywhere close to the original.<br/><br/>The voice acting talent is good. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks slip right back into the fins of dysfunctional dynamic duo Dory and Marlin seamlessly. The casting team on this film must watch be die hard TV fans as the rest of the newly recruited cast come from a wide range of shows, such as: Saturday Night Live, Modern Family, It's Always Sunny In Phillidelphia, Luther and The Wire. As a whole the voice acting is fine and the casting choices made were wise ones indeed.<br/><br/>In true Pixar fashion this film aims to appeal to both the kids and the adults in its use of humour. This film has a couple of adult jokes hidden within it but they do seem a little too obvious and forced compared to Pixar's standard. Most notably the ""Mummy's and Daddy's talk"" that Dory gets confused about. When I say there are a ""couple"" hidden adult jokes I mean like very few, in fact there isn't a lot for adults in this film which is odd considering that the sequel comes 13 years after the original. The film is geared a little too much towards kids and not enough towards the complete family unit. Don't get me wrong there is enjoyment to be had just a couple smiles and exhale-out-the-nose-laughs. In my opinion I would have liked to see more of the seals, especially Gerald as (if it wasn't shown in the trailer) they would have been the funniest thing about this film.<br/><br/>The films plot takes from the previous in part but not completely. The motif of the importance of family whether they are genetic or chosen by you was good to see nearer the films close. As well as that, Dory's bonding with Hank the Octupuss was something I rather enjoyed and was interesting to see develop over the course of the film. The film revolves around Dory completely, and so Nemo and Marlin take a big step back in this one. What was good about Finding NEMO for me was the range of different characters and how they all got bits to do. In Finding Dory this happens just not particularly as well as Nemo, for example its felt to me like Marlin and Nemo weren't in the film that much and I almost forgot about everyone else in the film except Dory who has a permanent spotlight on.<br/><br/>The films climax feels like it goes on for a while. The close of Finding Dory continues to throw obstacles in the way of its characters and to me this happened a little too much. The ending jumps all over the place and just tried to do too much. I understand this may appeal to shorter attention spans little children will have, but again this sequel comes 13 YEARS after the original so to fans of the original less would be more in this case. I must also add how the films closing shot felt incredibly weak to me, so overall the ending left me rather underwhelmed, maybe play some dramatic happily ever after music or something to give some sense of emotion at the end? Just a thought.<br/><br/>Overall Finding Dory is a fair film that pales in comparison to 2003's Finding Nemo.On the scale of Pixar films quality I would say this falls in between Monsters Univerity and The Good Dinosaur. It's a wild adventure that never has a dull moment but is geared a tad too much towards kids and a tad not enough towards the older family members. Another somewhat good film from the animation company that just keeps on swimming"

","Finding Dory it's not as great as Finding Nemo, but we can agree it is a good Pixar sequel. The animation is really better then the first, the characters are OK, the voice cast was amazing, the comedy was good, but the stronger part of this film is the drama. In the movie, i cried in the part when Marlin tells Dory for her good actions in the last movie and when Dory finds her parents. This two scenes are really emotional. If i had two problems they are: 1) The movie never tells why Dory has short term memory lost, ¿It was for accident or it was for born? and 2) The song Unforgettable i end up disliked. But the movie is a really good sequel. It has some of the charm of the original and they got new things that i like. I recommend this for those ones who grow up with Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"llamareview","8","1","7","3 August 2016"," A Good Sequel
","Finding Dory had some pretty great humour. Not laugh out loud comedy, but more along the lines of ""that was funny, I'm going to smile now because that was funny, well played Pixar"". Here are some jokes which I can loosely remember: ""Don't bail on me, bailey"" and ""You trust Becky? Becky is eating a cup"". The stronger laughs came from the visual humour- the slapstick. I would expect this since when I watched the movie the majority of the audience were children. I found myself being entertained the most by the subtle, ""adult"" jokes that came mainly from the voice acting and animation. <br/><br/>The new characters were all really likable. I loved the sea-lions as well as the octopus. However Nemo and Marlin (returning fish) felt stale and boring: they created so much conflict in the movie which felt unnecessary and forced, also they hardly added anything to the humour and were mainly there to be damsels in distress. The movie would have been much better without them. Dory on the other hand was great, her quirkiness worked well with every character she encountered and it never got old for me. The only thing that I didn't like was the whale noise she had to make in one scene that made me cringe a little. Her growth as a character was really enjoyable to watch and I found myself rooting for her. The moral message of the movie was quite weak. Unlike Zootropolis which did a great job providing a strong, meaningful message emphasised the importance of treating every person equally, to not discriminate on what somebody looks like and not to stereotype. On the other hand, the only message for children and adults alike in this movie is that you should not overthink your life and follow your dreams no matter what. I know this is a positive message but the movie could have done so much more! They could have made a social commentary about how fish should not be used for profit and how their enclosures are unnecessary small so that the paying public can easily watch miserable animals. However, by being anti-sea world they could have potentially faced some sort of law suit for slander and/or deformation. There was one scene which I really enjoyed and that was partly anti-sea world. Dory and Hank the octopus found themselves trapped in a petting pool for sea life in the children's section of the aquarium. It was kind of epic how the movie portrayed children as extremely rough, deadly and terrifying, kind of like a tentacle monster. Hands thrusted into the petting pool and created an explosion of water and sand as star fish cowered under rocks and buried into the sand. It compelled me to start a petition to end petting in aquariums because sea-life are not really into touching. A comparison must be made to the original movie because this is not a stand-alone movie; it has numerous throw-backs to Finding Nemo are not unwelcome. However, the whole tone of the movie was rather different. Finding Nemo was about a desperate father who would stop at nothing in order to find his son. Marlin went through many dangerous and deadly trials as well as traversing so many miles of ocean. Finding Dory is a much more contained experience since the focus is around an aquarium. I remember early in the film Dory says that she is desperate to find her parents and she must reach California to see her parents again. Marlin reacts in a manner that would indicate that California is literally thousands of miles away. Next couple of scenes, boom! They're in California. I can understand that this was done in order to fit more of the aquarium story line in but it kind of takes away from the first film. Let's talk about Hank the octopus. I love Hank the Octopus. He was so cool; he could transform into any object via camouflage, had a selfish bad-ass personality, could perform stunts similar to a special agent and had lost a tentacle (like a decorated war hero). He was always there to help characters out and he was compassionate even though he had a tough exterior (because octopuses have three hearts), he was also beautifully animated because even though octopuses don't have a visible mouth on the front of their face I could always tell what emotion was being expressed. Another character that really stood out was Gerald the sea lion. An absolute lad. He had a mono-brow, a bucket and a very sassy personality. Resented by the other sea lions Gerald always plotted the next opportunity in which he could bask on the beautiful rock which was always occupied by Fluke and Rudder. I was rooting for Gerald. He was the most interesting and unique character I have ever laid eyes on in an animated film. Just go and see Finding Dory you will enjoy it regardless of your age because it is a well-made great movie."
"alindsay-al","8","1","7","3 August 2016"," A great sequel
","I love finding nemo, it's one of my.favourite animated film's of all time. But I wasn't too excited for finding dory and thought it was a little unnecessary but I am happy to say that this is a great film. The premise of this film sees dory remember she has a family and goes on a mission with Marlon and nemo to find her parents. Ellen DeGeneres plays dory and is fantastic in this film. Her character is incredibly lovable and you really want to see her succeed in finding her parents. But she also has allot of heart and emotion as you see her deal with her short term memory loss. Marlon and nemo are back in this film and they add a really nice dynamic, Marlon and dory have a great relationship that is more developed from the first film. I liked all the new characters, the octopus hank and dory's relationship and chemistry is really good and fun to watch throughout the film. All the supporting characters are great especially a pair of sea lions played by idris Elba and Dominic west who just had me laughing the entire time. The story has similar beats to finding nemo but It develops well. You see a great journey of character development with dory and a very different one then the first film. You also see a different location which allows different types of characters to be fun additions to the story. There are good flashbacks as well that add further depth to this film. The script has great drama in it that makes you truly makes you care about dory and her situation. The humour is really funny at times in this film its just not everything hits and there are some times where the humour isn't that funny. The style of this film is great just like finding nemo it provides a beautiful ocean littered with fun characters. However, this film does get a bit too ridiculous in some of its stylistic decisions that took me out of the movie. Overall I really enjoyed this film and if you like finding nemo you should like this movie."

","2 August 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Finding Dory. I have been looking forward to this film for soooooo long. A sequel to Finding Nemo what could be better. It did not disappoint. There were a lot of children in the audience and I'm not entirely sure they got it all but I also espied a white haired lady who must have been in her 80s so that just goes to show how Pixar entertains the generations. As the title suggests this film is all about Dory, how she remembers that she once had a family and the journey she takes to find them again. Now you have to remember we are talking about fish here.....they cannot survive out of water......yet our heroine and her friends constantly gain access to buildings, travel on highways and generally do stuff that fish wouldn't do!!!!!!! Yes I know it's animation but let's have a big shout out for the imaginations of the writers who feed the creative minds of the animators and together they constantly bring us characters we take to our hearts, and ultimately to our DVD collections. Executive Producer John Lasseter who must be the Godfather of Pixar brought to us a film with great characters, the cutest baby Dory, and a good simple storyline which was both touching and funny. Oh and the short film just before called Piper.....no dialogue, just music and soooooo cute!!!!"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","7","2 August 2016"," Just keeps swimming to your heart and pulls on your strings.
","Pixar's animated film this summer, Finding Dory is the sequel to Finding Nemo and this time focuses on Dory as she tries to find her own family and prove that she can actually remember things. Now, Finding Nemo was a personal favourite of mine and is actually in my top ten favourite animated films of all time so my expectations were high. Thankfully, this film was not a letdown! It's safe to say that Finding Dory is another great Pixar entry and does not lose the charm of the original. Ellen Degeneres is back as Dory and is witty as ever, this is her film and she holds it all together. Great to see many returning characters but it's actually the new characters that make the film refreshing (especially Hank the Octopus). The animation is stunning, probably Pixar's best animation yet...so much detail and the camera going in and out of focus is a great touch and definitely defines certain details. The script is witty with many, many funny scenes that will make everyone laugh and that's one of the great things about this film and Pixar in general, everyone can enjoy it! Not only is the story comedic and witty, but it's also very emotional and makes you feel. I did notice many getting out their tissues to dab their eyes (not me though, I'm heartless...). The soundtrack was relaxing and suited the environment, so thankfully it was not radically changed from the original. The only flaw I felt was that it was too similar to the original. Sure, some may say the whole ""don't fix it if it isn't broken"" but the plot is exactly the same which means certain aspects will be predictable. Overall, this is a heartwarming, funny yet emotional adventure that everyone can enjoy albeit very similar to its predecessor.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","Finding Dory is Disney Pixars's 17th feature film and a triumph in animated storey telling. Set after the events of Finding Nemo writer and director Andrew Stanton takes audiences on a greatly emotional yet heart-warming adventure alongside Dory voiced by the incredible Ellen DeGeneres who, this time round, sees herself as the picture's leading protagonist. The film begins with a young Dory and her parents. She resembles an adorable small blue fish with bulging eyes however this isn't the overly happy, slightly annoying yet funny Dory we are used to this is a young child who is suffering with a disorder; that disorder being short term memory loss and is reliant on her parents. When being caught under an undertow of manta rays Dory is separated from her parents and can't find them as she has no recollection of their names or where she saw them last. Dory searches the ocean un successfully, asking fish if they have seen them until she meets Marlin for the first time. This is when Finding Nemo takes place, this film however is set after these events. Realising how much she misses her parents Nemo and Marlin accompany Dory to help her find them, facing various obstacles along the way. Of course there are a few familiar faces on their journey furthermore various new characters are met such as Hank (Ed O'Neil), an octopus who is missing a tentacle and is therefore an septapus and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson), a whale in which used to communicate with Dory via the pipes of her marine exhibition. <br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres's vocal humour is something unique, particular to this film, I couldn't imagine any other actress fulfilling the role of Dory and doing it justice simply because I've grown accustom the character from a young age and her energetic and excitable tone of voice. However unlike Finding Nemo, Ellen no longer is in that supporting role. She finds herself as the films protagonist and my God she owns it. There was always a risk with this character that at times she could become annoying or perhaps just a little over the top, based on her supporting role in Finding Nemo however director and screen writer Andrew Stanton ensures this is not the case, adding much more depth and emotion in which was never really explored in the original film. Finding Dory has a focus on Dory's short term memory loss and presents it as a serious condition unlike the first picture where it was more so a humorous trait. Of course Stanton interprets traditional Pixar themes in this picture such as the most obvious theme of loss, notorious in other films such as Toy Story 2, Wall-E, Up and of course finding Nemo. Not only this however Dory finds her calling which is to search for her parents, a character finding their calling is a theme which is followed in pretty much all Pixar films. <br/><br/>Audiences will be blown away by Pixar's revolutionary animation. The sea flows realistically and naturally whilst coral reefs look like something out of a beautiful acid infused trip. The fish swim and move so naturally and fluently whilst light reflects from the surface and from the fishes scales as if it could be real. Animation wise finding Dory is an absolute spectacle and a stoner's dream, I would certainly place it up there alongside Inside Out which is a tough one to top simply based on the art which I loved. Finding Dory is a well- deserved sequel to an iconic piece of animated cinema which does its predecessor justice even if it doesn't quite manage to top it. I therefore rate finding Dory an incredible 8/10. I would also like to add that I have been inactive for a year and almost considered giving up whatstheplot.info, I realise that it's something I don't want to give up and can ensure readers that this is no longer the case. I will aim to update the sight with monthly reviews so please stay tuned and keep checking our Facebook page for any news or updates to the sight."
"nathannicolarobertscouk","9","1","7","1 August 2016"," An unforgettable and deeply enjoyable adventure...
","Whilst the gorgeous animation, impressive voice cast and technical skill are all incredibly important and central to the film's overall success, it is the subtlety in its inspiring themes that make Finding Dory work so profoundly. The plethora of messages - home, identity, love, family - gives something for all the family to appreciate, and learn from, without ever feeling heavy-handed or out of place. Finding Dory is evidence that it takes multiple elements to make a film successful and Pixar pass each of them with flying colours. I can nit-pick and go searching for flaws but at the end of it, Dory's own determination reflects that of Pixar's to craft another incredible tale and, like the theme song suggests, it really is unforgettable.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/08/finding-dory-3d-2016- review.html"
"nicolechan916","7","1","7","31 July 2016"," Adorable enough
","After years of speculation and doubts about whether a sequel to Finding Nemo (2003) was coming to screens, Finding Dory finally emerged. While visuals are amazing, and the voice acting full of personality, the recurring theme of short-term memory loss got a tad annoying. <br/><br/>DeGeneres carries the film, and her voice is very recognizable as Dory. She is definitely a perfect fit for the character. Having said that however, I sense that she 'babied' her voice a little too much. At times, it felt like too much effort went in to trying to make her voice sound more adorable. Adding to the fact that she says the same few lines about a hundred odd times in the film can be pretty tiring. Other voice actors did a good enough job with their characters too. Hank (Ed O'Neil) is very impressionable and provides some spy wannabe drama to the movie. Though she only had a few lines, the addition of Sigourney Weaver was a fantastic idea, and provided probably one of the best laughs for me. <br/><br/>Animation is great, as expected. The colors are all very vibrant and aesthetically pleasing. The sea lions are fun to watch, and especially the quirky one, whose name I believe is Gerald. Becky is another such character, who like Gerald, doesn't have any lines, but provides much comic relief. <br/><br/>While animation, and voice acting is done well, the characters are pretty much stock types, and reactions are often over exaggerated because it is a kid's film. As such, I found it somewhat enjoyable yet tiresome to watch."

","After 13 years the wait is finally over as Walt Disney Pixar have delivered on screen 3D animation movie sequel of pure delights . The movie from the very first scene of Baby Dory & her parents to the very end scene where Marlin & Dory are at the Drop Off each individual scene contains a new heart-warming filled storyline welly blended with Stanton Spark that we saw in it's predecessor film that never seems to fail on delivering tearfully eye performances & make you feel such utter out of this world empathy for all the characters involved in that particular scene . The special effects , sounding effects and film's song soundtrack were used with extreme effectiveness so that the movie does not come to be overpowering and become ideally slotted to there perfect fit . The voice - over casting was to complete perfection as if each individual character had there own chose of who they wanted to voice them to blend together to deliver a 97 minute on screen feature of utter audience pleasing . However there are some less positive feedback for this film is that in some scenes in the movie in seems to need a tad of the action injection as some scenes don't make it quite as high as I hope they would , the movie seems to have lost several main characters or seem to have them in small cameo type roles including the tank gang, crush & many others which cause the film to lose some of movie's character core strength therefore having the film to lose what made it's predecessor a true one of a kind film & parts of the plot surrounding the actual the hunt to rescue Dory seems to if Dory's rescue was placed into a confined place where the water seems to have eroded the heart and magic that it's predecessor film once had only leaving tiny fragments of it remaining after it's 13 year gap & the confined place being the Marine Life Institute . Despite the less positive feedback I have given these comments do not effect the film in anyway and the movie bursts with life , laughter and emotion that no words can describe .<br/><br/>A truly uplifting Stanton sequel that was truly worth the wait ."

"Riley-H","9","1","7","8 July 2016"," Another Pixar film, another lesson.
","I was actually a little nervous before entering the cinema, worrying that Pixar might fail to meet my expectation. But the film succeeded in keeping Pixar's long known reputation and gave me another lively lesson with the attracting and touching story. To this, I'm grateful as always.<br/><br/>The film is about Dory looking for her parents this time. She spared great efforts going home despite her problem of short-term memory loss. Through the whole story, we can find that Dory's ability to recall memories is actually linked closely to the other characters around her and their care. For example, when Dory eventually found her parents, she could even tell them her story of helping Marlin find Nemo. On the other hand, when she's alone, Dory forgets everything about herself and others in a couple of minutes. Such a thing occurred when Marlin decided to abandon her in Sydney because he thought Nemo was dead(Finding Nemo 2003). It also occurred when Dory was flushed into the open water with seaweeds where she could do nothing but follow her instinct and swim blindly. That accounts for Dory's friendliness and sadness when others decide to leave her. She needs to be loved. In reality, the willingness to tend others is something that we all need to learn, especially when it comes to the disabled.<br/><br/>There is a sharp contrary in the film about memories. While Dory was trying hard to recall, Hank the octopus would rather forget. That comes down to the question of whether to live in the past tasting every bit of one's experience, trying to find out who you are, or to let go of everything and live on one's own path. To be honest, if you are Dory, would you like to end up living in an aquarium similar to a jail for the rest of your life merely because that's where your parents are? Many films have brought up the question whether one should pay more attention on his/her own path of life or the family, Pixar films included. However, this is such a controversial question that Pixar never answered it straight. In a Pixar film, the conflict between career and family is often neutralized itself at the end of the movie in order not to force the characters to make the difficult choice. Remy's father eventually helped him with the career as a cook, as an example.(Ratatouille 2007) In Finding Dory, the conflict becomes a process. It tells us birds that migrate do leave home to strive for life, but they will finally come back. While her parents are waiting, unchanged. Dory has grown up and become mature. Since the thought of going home sparkled, not only has she been finding her parents,but also she's been Finding Dory, finding who she truly was.<br/><br/>It's fate that Dory as well as Hank and the other fish would be back in the ocean at last. The film tells us that home is not a place to live, a house to stay. It's where our family members are, where we are tied to each other. So no matter how reluctant Hank was, he belonged to the ocean, and that meant he would return to the nature and stay with those who loved him even if they are not related to him. As for Dory, she's home the moment she meet her mom and dad. Instead of the exciting scenes such as an octopus driving a truck, the reunion scenes are the real highlights of every Pixar film and they are emotional enough to make us weep. It was when Boo was home(Monsters,inc. 2001), when Riley was home(Inside Out 2015), when Arlo and Spot were home(The Good Dinosaur 2015)that the real spirit of Pixar was shown.<br/><br/>Same lessons, different ways taught. It can be noticed that a lot of time and conversations are spent to explain the thinking of the movie. Such arrangement might be used to let the majority of the audience understand those deeper meanings, but they surely used up a lot of precious time too. As for myself, I would appreciate it if those conversations and time are saved to make the plot more fluent and the story carry more reflections of the real world. The idea of the film is also conservative, fewer imaginative points are found, and the shadow of Finding Nemo evidently limit the possibility of the film's imaginations. Besides, there are definitely more laughter in the cinema than usual when I was watching. The film is more funny than the previous Pixar films, which I guess was designed to excite more children mainly. I personally consider these subtle changes as a sign that Pixar is trying to change its original ways of telling stories and teaching audience. I can only hope Pixar will find its way.<br/><br/>I watched many films animated by Pixar when I was little, and when I came to the age of 18 half a year ago, I pick those films up again and I found much more meanings in them. Pixar has accompanied my childhood, taught me, and now it has changed my life twice. Pixar films are always suitable for kids and adults alike. The idea of Pixar figuring out a new route somehow frightened me. If Pixar abandons its classical way of filming and eventually switching its attention completely to the new generation, I will be among those who are most unwilling to say goodbye. I wish Pixar can teach the new generation in the same way it taught us, or maybe a real better way."

","When I first heard they were making a sequel to finding Nemo I really was not that impressed. Sequels is not really a Pixar thing, but eight years ago when I was in kindergarten, I adored finding Nemo. I am 14 now and wanted see it! And wow! I was blown away! This is a great Pixar movie! It blew away all expectations! I really loved the idea of it being in a aquarium instead of the open ocean like in the first one! That worked great! Pixar nailed the opening scene with baby dory! This movie has some flashbacks with Dory and when she was a child and I loved how they tied everything related to dory to her in the first one! It was very clever. It introduces new characters which are great and hilarious! Catlin Olsen, Ed O'Neill, and Ty Burell worked terrifically. It is a fun and well written story which can entertain adults and kids. It also has good morals and some serious parts to it as well. Kids can learn good lessons watching this movie. The characters are very likable too, Ellen DeGeneres as dory and Albert Brooks as Marlin gave great performances. You will also love how funny it is, not just the adult humor (which by the way was hilarious) but all the jokes can work for everyone! At the end of the day this movie was so awesome and so fun! Take your date or the whole family and you will love it!"
"dutchs-1","8","1","7","7 July 2016"," Not Quite up to Finding Nemo But Lots of Fun
","A fun sequel to Finding Nemo that somehow treats California and Australia as close together. Dory's attempt to locate her dimly remembered family lands her in a marine aquarium in California. Much of the undersea action takes place in deeper and murkier waters than Finding Nemo, so the visual appeal isn't quite up to the original film. The high point of this film is an octopus named Hank whose ability to camouflage himself and squeeze through tiny openings is exploited to the max. Also Hank has the wise- cracking ability of his voice actor, Ed O'Neill (AKA Al Bundy). Dory is about to be shipped to an aquarium in Cleveland, but she and Hank hijack the truck in a hilarious escape sequence. Eventually Dory meets her parents, though the meeting isn't as heartwarming as it could have been and just seems a bit flat. As is the custom these days, viewers are encouraged to stay through the end credits by the promise of humorous interludes. Do stay. There's a great tie-back to the original film at the very end."

It's a shallow observation, with no depth as to how it ruins the movie, to begin with.<br/><br/>But let's dive into Finding Dory, which I found to be a really good movie. I highly recommend you guys go ahead and see it. Why might you ask? Well, this is because Finding Dory for one has better animation than it's predecessor. Numerous CGI improvements over the years blend more ability for the filmmakers to try out new things that would have been difficult back in 2003, and it shows in beautifully constructed scenes such as when Dory is at the dreaded Kids Zone of the Marine Aqualife where the camera sometimes would point at a first degree angle, or one scene when Bailey uses echolocation to point Dory as to where she is going.<br/><br/>This film also contains some of the most beautiful visuals Pixar has ever put together, in my estimation. One scene when Dory is looking out and seeing a gigantic aquarium tank is beautiful eye-candy that I believe was not really that much possible with the original film. Then again, you did have Monsters Inc with its own door scene when Mike and Sully have to ride on one of the doors to get Boo back where she belongs, so I cannot really say much there.<br/><br/>Is the film flawed? Yes. Finding Dory suffers from the same problem as Finding Nemo, and that is it's ending. No, not where they all live happily ever after, but in the climatic scene. Finding Dory has one of the most unrealistic car chases I have ever seen. Seriously? Would an octopus drive a car with the help of two sharks and two clown fishes? No, it would not happen in real life. To be fair, this is a film with fish talking, so I cannot really say much about it. Still, however, who would see fishes trying to escape with a car, a boat while being chased by police? Absolutely not, and I believe this film suffers for that.<br/><br/>Finding Dory, despite what everyone will tell you, is a great film with one major flaw. Recommended. 8/10."

","Watched this with kids in 2D. We are a big fan of Pixar in general and Finding Nemo in particular. It was rich in story, characters and visuals.<br/><br/>We enjoyed this one but I found it to be a lighter effort from Pixar. Story itself did not impress. Characters were a bit meh. Dory has a prominent role but both Marlin and Nemo felt like cameos. Both the sharks (?) were dull. The Octopus and the Sea Lions were the only bright characters. Visuals were OK but the setting itself was kind of grimy, so nothing memorable there. The story was serviceable but nothing great.<br/><br/>All in all, an average effort but nothing great. Perfectly fine to catch this on video."

","I loved the original, ""Finding Nemo"" and was looking forward to seeing the sequel. It probably wasn't quite as good as the first in some respects but was very good in other respects.<br/><br/>Visually: I was expecting great stuff visually in this film. There didn't seem to be the beautiful scenes as the first. <br/><br/>Storyline: The storyline was possibly similar to the first but different enough. The story had an interesting emotional touch with Dory's background being quite poignant. It was good fun for a children's film with emotive content for older audiences.<br/><br/>Emotive value: As said above this film tugs at the heartstrings and has you really feeling for Dory and her situation.<br/><br/>Messages: The main message is about the value of family and friendship, however I found a secondary message running through the film that added value to the film. A number of times we see Dory apologizing for her memory loss, afraid of putting out those around her. She is reassured later on that she is not a burden and that her disability gives a unique perspective on life. This can teach children that people with disabilities come with unique abilities and perspectives that add value to our lives rather than the misconception of them being a ""burden"". I liked that the viewer could really empathize with Dory's struggle. <br/><br/>Overall it was quite enjoyable and can complement the first form as well."

","Finding Dory (2016): Dir: Andrew Stanton, Angus MacLane / Voices: Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Kaitlin Olson, Ty Burrell: A surprisingly engaging animated masterpiece sequel to Finding Nemo, which is one of Pixar's best. Dory is the fish with the short term memory and the film opens with her loving yet cautious parents warning her about the dangers beyond home. When she eventually is separated from her parents, the film crosses where Finding Nemo began then jumps ahead a year. Dory is beginning to have flashes of her past and decides to search for her parents. Little clown fish Nemo encourages his father Marlin to allow them to join her. Reluctantly he joins the search and the screenplay weaves comedy and tragedy with a suspenseful yet triumphant conclusion that reminds viewers why Pixar is great. New characters are introduced including a red octopus named Hank who helps Dory but really desires to remain in his water den away from being released at sea. Destiny is a near-sighted whale shark who was childhood friends with Dory. Bailey is a beluga whale wrestling a concussion. There is also a couple of sea lions offering advice while dominating their rock. There is also a bird with awkward eyes that becomes a benefit. The animation is colourful but most of all it avoids the typical sequel flaw that repeats the previous film. We have a message where one's impairment becomes a benefit when Dory finally makes discoveries. When we all band together our weaknesses become a triumph leading to lasting happiness. Finding Dory is finding satisfaction. Score: 10 / 10"

","Oh Andrew Stanton, why did I ever doubt you? First off, let me get one thing out of the way. I was not expecting this to fail. I was SCARED it would fail. However, like I said, there was no point to that fear. One thing I was absolutely marveling over in this movie was the animation. I said this in my Finding Nemo review but the water looks like real water and not just that. The lighting on the ocean has gotten much better since the last movie and it looks more realistic. However, the cartoon characters still blend well with the realistic sea. Well some characters do look a little off especially compared to the last movie but thankfully they're minor characters and don't get a lot of screen time. The main characters look just like they did in the last movie and the new characters look just as great. Oh yeah, Pixar animated an octopus and he moved naturally. I was in shock with how gorgeous the animation on Hank looked. I mean wow. Pixar have come a long way animation-wise. I won't spoil the story here but I will say that it is a bit more complex and dramatic than you may think. It's not just some rehash of Finding Nemo. For example, Dory's short term memory loss, which was primarily used for laughs in the last movie, is played very seriously here. Dory actually worries that she will forget things and tries to get a hold of her short term memory loss. It's actually treated a lot like a mental disorder. I'm pretty sure that was the metaphor they were going for but I have to point it out. Thankfully, the movie isn't all depressing. There is a lot of comedy and it's actually really funny! Yeah, I laughed at all the jokes presented. There's a very good balance between drama, comedy and action which is why I love movies like Kung Fu Panda and Zootopia so much.<br/><br/>I like all the new characters in the film but my favorite is Hank the Octopus, or septapus whatever you want to call him. I thought he was pretty funny even though he was pretty rude in the beginning. I didn't mind that too much since he did go through a lot of great character development throughout the rest of the film. Hank's friendship with Dory is one of the things that carries this film along with the main characters, dramatic elements, serious tone and of course some great action. If I did have to issue a flaw with this movie, it's that the ending action scene was a little rushed and maybe a bit ridiculous. Maybe the ridiculous nature of it is to show you can do anything if you set your mind to it (which is a bit of theme with this movie) but it didn't have to be that rushed. Oh well, at least we got that funny thing that I will NOT spoil!<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great Pixar movie with outstanding animation, a serious story, great old and new characters and great action and drama. I don't even know what else to say without giving away too much. (Also you have to stay after the credits for big surprise)"
"anandrajeev979","8","1","8","26 October 2016"," Beautiful and Amazing sequel with simple ideas put together for a simple story having family value and effective stunning visuals and characters but Nowhere near Finding Nemo
","As Expected from Pixar , the movie is great and is among their best sequels although little far from Toy Story 2 and very great than Cars 2.At its own its a great voice cast especially Degeneres is phenomenal. The visual of the sea world are also stunning. I loved all the characters in this film most probably though the octopus Hank and Destiny. Story is simple as Dory regains some of her memories and search for her parents.Her journey is fruitful as well as painful as it reveals the importance of family and love and also showcases the pain of separation.Baby Dory takes the crown for this film as her cuteness and childish behavior is so adorable that you will just smile and her and feel sad for her whenever she feels sad.The ending sequence is also very funny and dramatic. I would also say that it is nothing like Finding Nemo as that film has its own magic which is perhaps not in this one. Still it is a very good animated movie filled with comic scenes. It will get a tough competition for winning Best Animated Feature Oscar as Zootopia and Kubo and the two strings (both great) are also present.But I clearly see how much people love this movie as it surpassed box office collection of Civil War in North America. Final Word - Another pitch perfect from Pixar that should be watched..."
"matrixpolaris","9","1","8","9 October 2016"," More like Toy Story 2 than Cars 2.
","Okay. The original was a flawless Disney masterpiece, and is arguably the best Pixar film of all time (rivaled only by Toy Story). This one was a bit like Toy Story 2. Fun, but not as good as the original. Finding Dory is fun, and great entertainment for parents and kids alike. I do recommend this, and it's fun, but it's not without its flaws. The memory loss thing gets a little repetitive and annoying by the end, and realism is nonexistent here. But it's full of heartwarming, funny and fun moments, and while it's not as good as it's predecessor, it's enjoyable, and it's a fun film. And Hank is great. I've seen so many bad reviews on this film, and I don't understand them. Okay, it is a little long, and I already mentioned the memory loss thing above, but ultimately it's a good, enjoyable Pixar film. If you love Pixar films, and you love the original characters, then you'll probably like this one, even though it doesn't match the flawlessness of the original, it's worth a watch."
"dfy-40575","8","1","8","7 October 2016"," Finding Dory
","Suffering from short term memory loss is a trait we often relate to elders and it often has a more negative than positive outlook on our lives. On the other hand, in Finding Dory, the main character, Dory, suffers from short term memory loss in a beneficial way. She always has an optimistic approach to solve problems and never seems to give up. Her innocent, carefree mentality allows her to make new friends and build her own family. To Dory, family is defined as people who love and take care of her, and not only her biological ones.<br/><br/>She treats everyone with respect and at times overly altruistic even with potential enemies such as the octopus. I think her constant attempts to think outside of the box allows her to be a role model for kids. In our current day society, many people are too reserved and judgmental to physical stereotypes and it often thwarts us from gaining new innovative opportunities. Dory is innocent and sees everyone as a potential friend. Some may view this characteristic of a dangerous Utopian characteristic, but it actually is an example of being a dreamer and model for our future leaders in youth. If everyone followed the set prescriptions and chose not to take risks, we would be still living with tools in the stone age and hiding in caves. For a brighter future, we need to show friendly examples of how expressing yourself and making friendships can pave the way for a better future with supportive peers around you.<br/><br/>Dory is also an example of an independent female who empowers those around her. I believe her instinctive nature to pursue her goals and focus on the task at hand is another trait the movie explores. We need to remember that the audience for this movie is intended for children. This movie encapsulates the true meaning of a individual who values family. Whatever Dory defines as family, ranging from strangers in the aquarium, childhood pipe pals, to natural predators, she always remember to be respectful, courteous, and grateful. Finding Dory is a story of overcoming adversity and reinforcing the idea of community and family that we so often overlook today in a growing independent society judged by others and controlled by others. As Dory would say, ""Just keep swimming,"" and anyone can achieve whatever you put your mind to."
"Ana_Nowiel","8","1","8","4 October 2016"," Touching story of teamwork
","With its fast paced story line, cartoon graphics, and aquatic protagonist, Finding Dory is perfectly tailored to captivate a child audience. As a result, it is likely those older than children have overlooked the movie, thinking it to be too juvenile to interest them. However, digging beyond the cute graphics, the film has a deeper lesson: interpersonal relations can be the most powerful tool in overcoming hardships. This moral makes Finding Dory relevant to all age groups. Some critics argue that the portrayal of marine life as being literate and surviving for long periods of time on land takes away from the validity and enjoyment of the film. However, quite the contrary, this unrealistic setting actually helps to accentuate its moral, making it more satisfying. Often times, familiar settings lead viewers to become biased and less able to see the true meaning of the film intended by its producers because they overlap their own life experiences onto those of the characters. That being established, Finding Dory has a clear moral. Dory is only able to accomplish her goal of finding her parents by borrowing the help of many others. Without, Marlin's affection, Nemo's optimism, Crush's generosity, Hank's resourcefulness, and much more, her mission would have been totally futile. The final scenes of the film are especially memorable because all of the characters are working together to return to the ocean where they belong and where Dory's parents may be. Hank the octopus is furiously turning the steering wheel and the fish are sloshing every which way in their tanks as the truck topples over the edge of the seacliff. When they reach the water, everyone knows that it was nothing but their teamwork that brought them so far. These interpersonal relations, or rather interfishonal relations, are Dory's most valuable asset. Finding Dory's powerful lesson of teamwork makes it appealing to those of any age. Watching the film will serve as a reminder to all that asking for help is not showing weakness. In fact, it is when we rely on each other that great dreams are fulfilled, just as Dory's dream to find her parents was realized."
"kermitkid","8","1","8","18 September 2016"," Better than expected
","My expectations for this were it would be OK at best. From the trailers it looked like a straight rehash of the first movie. Main character gets kidnapped and put in an aquarium and other main character(s) go to look for them. I'm happy to say that it's not like that all. The plot is actually pretty original. Baby Dory is a-Dory-ble. The cutest Pixar baby since Baby Mike Wazowski in ""Monsters University."" The way they showed Dory's backstory leading up to Finding Nemo was done very well. Sometimes too many flashbacks can kill a movie, but these didn't feel forced or excessive. One problem I do have is the writers/director seemed to have forgotten that Marlin learned not to be overprotective at the end of Finding Nemo. He still has some overprotective tendencies. I still say the original is better, but Pixar has made worse. ""The Good Dinosaur"" wasn't near the big spectacle it promised to be. ""Dory"", however had enough familiarity for those who grew up with the original while at the same time bringing something new to the table Grade: B. 8/10. 3.5/5 stars"

It is entertaining and beautifully animated, with some amusing set-pieces that will thrill children and the truth is that Dory's story will not leave a dry eye in the cinema.

"rcolgan","7","1","8","29 August 2016"," Dory Never Reaches the Same Depths As Nemo, But It's Still a Lot of Fun
","Whilst Pixar has a deserving reputation for being one of the greatest animation studios of all time, their sequels have tended to be a lot more hit and miss. The second and third Toy Story films are some of the studios best works, but its other sequels 'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' are probably the studios biggest disappointments. As for finding Dory it's probably somewhere between these two extremes. It doesn't quite live up to Finding Nemo, but it's still a worthwhile sequel that still better than the mediocrity of 'Cars 2'.<br/><br/>Taking place about a year after the first film, Dory (Elen DeGeneres) has started a happy new life with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence). But one day when helping out with a class trip at Nemo's school Dory see's something that remind her about her family and she realises she has to find them. Knowing what it's like to lose their family, Marlin and Nemo go with Dory on a journey across the ocean to find her family. Their search quickly leads them to an aquarium (wisely changed from being located at Seaworld after the Blackfish documentary) where Dory rediscovers her roots and remembers her life before she found Nemo. <br/><br/>It's a good story and one that does feel like an organic development from the first film, but it does feel like a step down from Finding Nemo. Whilst the journey still allows for a lot of emotional moments, there's never the same feeling of urgency or danger as there was in the first film. Plus everything just feels like it's happening on a smaller scale this time. Instead of focusing on a vast adventure across the sea, it's much more scaled down from Finding Nemo taking place almost entirely within the aquarium. It's still a fun setting, but it fails to recapture either the epic scale of Marlins adventure across the ocean, or Nemo's hilariously confined setting of a dentist's fish bowl. <br/><br/>Unlike Cars 2 where Mater never felt like he was a strong enough character to be the lead, it really felt natural to have Dory become the lead. Dory has such a likable personality and DeGeneres' incredible comedic timing makes it difficult not to love her. Plus she's still able to have a lot of powerful emotional moments, including one dramatic sequence that shows her before meeting Marlin and searching the sea for years slowly forgetting her family across her lifetime. It's also a lot of fun to see Albert Brooks return as Marlin and it's nice to see how he's become Dory's surrogate family. But Nemo's return was a little more disappointing. He's still the cute and kind clownfish that we knew from the first film, but he never really has much to do in the film other than just tag along. <br/><br/>There's also a range of new aquatic creatures that the gang encounters when they're exploring the aquarium. There's Destiny (Katilyn Olson) a blind whale who Dory knew as a child who offers a friendly glimpse in to Dory's past. A pair of kind sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) who want to do nothing but nap on their rock. Though the best addition is a octopus with a missing leg named Hank (Ed O'Neil) the loner who is says he's helping Dory for his own gain, but is shown to be a creature with 3 hearts of gold. He's also a real scene stealer with a dry wit and some really creative and over the top sequences showing him getting around the aquarium. Seeing him blend in to environments and sling himself across the aquarium does lead to the most visually creative sequences of the film. <br/><br/>Parts of the film does seem a little too over the top at times. Even for a film with talking fish, some moments where we see fish flying through the air or at one point even driving a truck seems a little too unbelievable. But it does always remain fun. Plus whilst the film shares several story ideas and characters to its predecessor, it's still able to remain wholly original by introducing its own ideas about family and has several scenes that will be able to resonate with audiences of all ages."

","Finding Dory is a sequel to the 2003 hit film Finding Nemo only this time its Dory's story that we get to witness instead of Nemo's(who is now voiced by a different actor since the other actor that voiced him was too old for the part).<br/><br/>The story shows Dory having flashbacks about her family(voiced by Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) and she ends up getting lost. Problem is she suffers from Short Term Memory Loss and can't remember a thing about her family. Fast forward a few years later and Dory(DeGeneres)and her friends Nemo and Marlin,takes part in a school talk about families and Dory figures that she had a family also. But when she goes up ashore(like Nemo in the first movie)she ends up getting taken away by marine biologists and its up to Marlin and Nemo to rescue her again. While she is there at the marine exhibit voiced by Signovery Weaver she teams up with an octopus called Hank(voiced by Ed O Neill) and she later meets a shark called Destiny(who she was friends with since she was a little tadpole). So the question though is this; will Dory find her family again and discover who she really is.<br/><br/>The animation was very good and the plot is very familiar to the 2003 version as we see a scene that happened in Finding Nemo and the movie gets very predictable during the 3rd act of the film but still it was very good. Ellen DeGeneres was very good as Dory as she has this humor that is very witty and charming at the same time. For some strange odd reason she reminds me of Meg Ryan in a way as both of them have the same features and they have that same humor.There is also some new characters that I have mentioned that are hilarious especially the whale with the bottle-head and Hank who was very funny.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion this is one of my favorite movies of this year next to The Jungle Book and Zootopia,probably in my top 5 list of movies I have seen in 2016. Idris Elba, Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy if you loved the first movie then you should check it out. All my family loved it.<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for a very cute short called Piper which tells the story of a cute bird who is afraid of the water. <br/><br/>Verdict: Pixar has done it again. Well done."

","Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton & Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Hayden Rolence, Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell.<br/><br/>The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.<br/><br/>It's been 13 long years since we've visited the colourful world under the sea, wonderfully created by the Pixar Animation team, yet it feels like we never left. The story picks up 6 months after the events in Finding Nemo (2003), and takes us on a whole new journey with our favourite characters; Marlin, Nemo and of course, Dory. After the first film being such a hit amongst children and adults alike, it was always going to be a challenge for a sequel to live up to the greatness laid before. It's been rumoured for years and carefully discussed by the imaginative minds behind the scenes, thus it's been greatly anticipated by all fans of Pixar. Finding Dory may not tick all the boxes, but it has heart (three of them, in fact) and looks incredible. If you have the chance, 3D is something I highly recommend - which is something I don't usually do - because it simply works. There's a lot of vibrancy and depth created in this world that can only be truly witnessed in this format. That said, there's still a lot to love, regardless.<br/><br/>We're all pretty familiar with the returning three main characters, so I don't need to tell you about those. What's really nice to see, and something Pixar are really skilled at, is the introduction of new characters you can instantly attach yourself to. Most notably, is Hank the Octopus. A very fun and friendly presence that really wouldn't have been possible to include in the predecessor 13 years ago, due to his impeccable detail. Also, Destiny and Bailey are particularly quirky and humorous additions to the line-up. Idris Elba and Dominic West both make great appearances as Fluke & Rudder and feel a lot like previous characters we've seen before, which isn't a bad thing. They actually deliver some pretty funny jokes during their screen time. Diane Keaton & Eugene Levy also give nice performances as Dory's parents.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that Pixar strive in their incredible talent with computer generated animation. This movie looks absolutely amazing, just as the first feature did back in 2003, but with added texture and using techniques that just couldn't have been implemented at such times. Now that computer technology is so advanced, Pixar can really delve into some of their best ideas and create some more unforgettable characters and stories. Some of the only movies I bother watching in 3D are from Pixar, and this is because they know exactly what they're doing with such a format.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman returns with another atmospheric and heartfelt score that flows peacefully in and out of scenes and touches on the action, comedy and drama throughout. A lot of the material is brand new which is great and as expected from Newman.<br/><br/>Of course, when you go to see a Pixar movie you expect a message that's weaved into the story and this doesn't disappoint, by keeping the tradition alive. Its touching moments may not be as dramatic as seen before, but it's still relatable and pleasing to see. I'm very satisfied with this sequel, as a huge fan of the original (it being my second favourite Pixar feature, following Ratatouille) and I'm sure a lot of other fans will be pleased as well. I can't wait to watch it again.<br/><br/>My verdict; Finding Dory is another wonderful effort from the hard-working men and women at Pixar Animation Studios, and a worthy sequel to a much loved movie by many. This is one to sea.<br/><br/>Finding Dory, 9/10."

","13 years for a sequel of a family-friend animation picture is something boldly risky in this consumerism age, since 2003, DreamWorks's SHREK series has been long over its last gasp after its fourth breath SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010), BlueSky's ICE AGE franchise has reached an abysmal nadir with its latest fifth offering ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE (2016), but FINDING DORY, the belated follow-up of FINDING NEMO (2003), inscribed with Pixar's trademark, safeguards itself as another superlative family fare can win over audience without age restrictions (from toddlers to the elderly).<br/><br/>Storytelling is as always, the trump card for Pixar studio, the core of FINDING DORY is to find one's home, even for Dory (DeGeneres), the regal blue tang only has a short-time memory (an idiosyncrasy meritoriously hasn't been over-employed here), but how can Dory remember her family? Here the narrative deploys a conventional fillip, - sudden flashbacks of Dory's past conveniently transmit into Dory's mind with key information - to the trio's intrepid ocean-cross adventure, of course, clownfish father-son duo Marlin (Brooks) and Nemo (Rolence) cannot let her go gangbusters by all herself.<br/><br/>Soon after, the movie's setting undergoes a sea change from the dim deep ocean (it is noteworthy the animation team doesn't choose to cartoon the ocean scenery, which looks extremely realistic than one would expect, murky, claustrophobic and uncannily threatening) to a man-made Marine Life Institute, where Dory is separated from Marlin and Nemo, the siren call is from Sigourney Weaver herself, this quite unanticipated change drastically lights up audience's sense of visual assimilation and introduces a new friend to Dory, the seven-tentacled, quarantine-obsessed octopus Hank (O'Neill), whose staggering camouflage skill would buoyantly lead Dory to a freewheeling caper, terra firma style. Shortly, Dory meets her childhood friend, a myopic whale shark Destiny (Olson) and her neighbour, a beluga whale Bailey (Burrell), the latter's re-gained echolocation capacity would play a really important role in Dory's and the clownfish pair find each other again (and again), that's another plus point of a Pixar vehicle, you can always learn something new in addition to all the roller-coastering fun. (octopus has three hearts, do you know that?)<br/><br/>Certainly, there is an overhanging dreadfulness that Dory's parents might have been dead, and indeed FINDING DORY is dauntless enough to bringing death up for a closer look before diverting into something more traditional but also massively touching - all the shells lead to home, it is an emotive moment, how incredible neither Dory nor her parents have lost hope for their ultimate reunion (the story is one fish-year after FINDING NEMO 2003, but in human year, it feels like 13 years). Family first, but friends are in close second, in the third act, Dory has to go out on a limb to do something no other blue tang has ever done and off the beaten track to where no other blue tang has ever been, she must stop a truck heading to Cleveland on the busy overpass and set free the captured Marlin and Nemo, with the help of all her friends, mostly Hank and a ditzy common loon Betty, the upshot is that they release the entire aquatic life in transportation into the ocean along the truck itself, emotionally elevated by WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD and spectacular slow-motion, finally, Sia's rendition of UNFORGETTABLE in the coda pertinently leaves audience a lingering savour of blitheness and satisfaction.<br/><br/>FINDING DORY doesn't have a concept as groundbreaking or intricate as INSIDE OUT (2015), but it is all the same, immensely fulfilling, so is the preceding wordless short PIPER (2016), directed by Alan Barillaro, where a baby sandpiper overcomes his primal fear about water and finally wallows in the waves near the sea, a pithy story reflects weighty meaning. All in all, Pixar is a godsend to us who are blessed with innocence and simplicity, we can only covetously wish its inspiration and talent never run dry."
"scottshak_111","8","1","8","21 July 2016"," A-DOR-able!
","Finding Dory is as extraordinary as its predecessor in terms of drama, CGI and humour. What it also is, like every other movie in the Pixar universe, an edutainment bandwagon that keeps steering towards the thoughtful learning curve.<br/><br/>Even after more than a decade Pixar manages to bring back the panache of the first. The movie has Dory written all over it, with the heart-melting cuteness of young Dory voiced endearingly by Sloane Murray. Pixar does occasional visits to depict glimpses from the past which gives us plenty of baby Dory to enjoy. Also, it is thoroughly entertaining and packs in humour galore.<br/><br/>THE SHORT MOVIE PIPER Before we even get on the Finding Dory joyride, we are allowed to feast on a beautiful Pixar short called Piper. The short gorgeously helmed by Alan Barillaro is a visual feat that cashes in on a baby Sandpiper's life. There is so much education holed up in those ephemeral 6 minutes that you cannot thank Alan enough to have thought something so winning. I wouldn't spoil it for ya! Go ahead and watch. You will know! WHAT IF I FORGET? There is something about the notion of forgetting, which is profusely poetic. Amnesiac Dory's inclusion, that started for mere fun in the Nemo franchise, ended up getting a profound treatment, and Pixar has a knack to identify the fervent. There is no doubt humour lurking in things that grind out from someone's mishap, but to truly live the horror of the fallen is what makes you empathize. Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane milks this very fact with an unrivalled flair as they leave us swimming in the shoeserfins of Dory, when her life seems like a lost affair.<br/><br/>FINDING DORY SPOILERS SWIMMING AHEAD Finding Dory's most powerful moment is when she realizes that her parents could be dead all this time. Also when she percolates out alone with her thoughts, totally clueless of where should she go. It has an element of dark to it, very shattering as she ends up being masticated by dismay. The music touches the melancholic chords there. But just then the reunion happens, and it will fill you up with tears of joy.<br/><br/>The whole team of Dory, starting with Hank, Bailey (watch him use his echolocation skills) and Destiny voiced brilliantly by Ed O' Neill, Ty Burrell and Kaitlin Olson are all endearing additions to the franchise. They complete the tale helping her out to achieve what she set out for in the first place.<br/><br/>LACKING THE THRILL OF FINDING NEMO Searching hard for the downside of Finding Dory, we don't get to see both sides of the coin like we did in the previous installment, so it was harder to relate to what her parents were going through all this time. Au contraire, in Finding Nemo we were constantly grinding in the distress of a father who had just lost his child. It was adventurous as there were unexplored corners of the ocean, and a whole new enclave to look forward to. Sadly, here everything seems convoluted in one place.<br/><br/>THE FINAL VERDICT Finding Dory is constantly flinging at us the importance of saving the ocean life, rehabilitating the weaker species and helping them out in dire situations. It is a lesson to those who don't care.<br/><br/>A beautiful, beautiful movie! <br/><br/>Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com"
"kensington_english","7","1","8","19 July 2016"," A nice sequel to Finding Nemo
","Before seeing Finding Dory in the cinema, I bought and watched the DVD Finding Nemo at home last week as I didn't watch the latter 13 years ago.<br/><br/>While the setting of Finding Nemo is an ocean, most scenes of Finding Dory take place in an ocean park / conservation centre. This is a nice surprise to me, as I thought the director and the production crew would still use an ocean as the setting.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Dory is as cute in this sequel as in Finding Nemo. Nemo and Marlin are not the focus this time, though they are still lovely. The new characters Hank, Destiny and Bailey successfully make this sequel more fun. In fact, the scenes that Hank changes his colour and even his shape to hide himself are hilarious. Having said that, I'm not sure a real octopus can really change its colour like what a chameleon does. Also, can an octopus in reality survive without water? Well, after all, this is an animation and we should not over-emphasise logic, or we should watch National Geographic on TV instead.<br/><br/>I think the plot about Hank and Dory being 'attacked' by kids trying to catch them is thought-provoking and educational.<br/><br/>Personally I like the sequel more than the first one. And among all the characters, I like Bailey best. .<br/><br/>I chose the 2D Cantonese version. I'd love to watch the 3D English version later to see if I have the same feelings towards this animation."
"prabsinakxata","7","1","8","17 July 2016"," Another lesson for another generation
","Like one should expect from a traditional animated film, this is a story that teaches another lesson to another generation. Disney always tells us the stories about being nice and friendly, so does ""Finding Dory"". It has delivered us once again the feeling of affection and care that once ""Finding Nemo"" brought to us.<br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" is directed by Andrew Stanton, a job well done like he did in ""Finding Nemo"". Albert Brooks as Marlin did excellent as expected. Although i think Ellen DeGeneres as Dory could have done little more with her character in this sequel, the additional characters like Hank (Ed O'Neill) and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) have carried her well enough to make us not feel the doubt. We all were attracted by that innocent adorable blue tang Dory in ""Finding Nemo"", this movie is exactly about the same Dory trying to find her long lost parents.<br/><br/>So, after the successful venture of Marlin and Dory to find Nemo, they are all back home happy and playful. In the homey environment, Dory starts to miss her mom and dad. Then she decides to go on a search for them in spite of the dangers she might face in the open ocean and with the disease she already possesses, short-term memory loss. Even thought Marlin, paranoid as always, doesn't want anyone to leave the sweet home anymore but for Dory, it is a very different situation. Darlin and his son Nemo joins Dory anyway to help find her parents.<br/><br/>The movie is as expected is family friendly, admirable and worth watching. Same as its initial sequel, it touches our heart and soul.The animation is as usual the best Pixar can provide, casts are perfect and the story is well written. Although it is sometimes hard to catch things about how characters move from one place to another, as long as it teaches us the essentials of living life, it is fine with me.<br/><br/>Friends are the ones that make our journey of life better in every aspect possible, family is what matters the most, there's nothing we can't do if we are destined to do it, the movie is all about these lessons presented in the most adorable way possible. There could not be another better way to teach our kids as well as ourselves about the beauty of life, living with kindness love and adventure, then this movie itself."

","Such a great movie. It is just as good as the original if not better. The story line is fascinating. It's a very touching movie that tells a lot about family, friendship, and love. The movie introduces new characters who are very engaging and humorous. You cannot go on your own without help, and you can reach your goals no matter what the difficulties are. If your memory fails you, your instinct wouldn't. With the help of friends, everything becomes possible. Plus, family would lay shells for you all across the ocean. Friends and family will get you to safety. I gave it 9 because I wanted it to last a bit longer."
"rhythm_intoxicated","8","1","8","12 July 2016"," Not another Cash-Grab Sequel
","This sequel has been a long time coming. 13 years after the release of 'Finding Nemo,' The kids who once sat in theatres worldwide- munching popcorn and Twizzlers with their parents and siblings- have now returned, perhaps with their own little ones in tow. After the tear-filled reception of Toy Story 3, Pixar has gained a reputation for making sequels that not only tie a story together, but are good stand-alone movies in their own right.<br/><br/>'Finding Dory' did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The two most notable things about this film are: A)The flawless animation, coupled with almost an over-saturation of cuteness. (The trademark short film at the beginning, ""Piper"", practically made me melt out of my seat.) The first scene shows a wide-eyed baby Dory (What's the proper term here...small fry?) repeating a disclaimer that her parents patiently teach her, in an effort to prepare her for social interaction. Which leads into point B)...an underlying social statement about disability, primarily mental illness.<br/><br/>Dory knows that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and this impairs her ability to function independently. Her parents, Jenny and Charlie, are near perfect in their patience and understanding. Instead of babying Dory- or worse yet, blaming Dory and pitying themselves- they empathize with her and work hard to give her the tools she needs to succeed in the outside world.<br/><br/>In 'Finding Nemo,' we see evidence that Dory's mental illness has little or nothing to do with her intelligence. Unlike Marlin, who never ventured far from his some anemone, she is able to read English and speak whale. Both skills prove to be invaluable: They are able to find Nemo's whereabouts and avoid being eaten along with a school of krill, respectively.<br/><br/>However...mental illness is one thing, but 'Finding Dory' decided to approach mental disability a different way. This is evident in the treatment of Gerald, the presumably mentally challenged sea lion (who bore eerie resemblance to an individual with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome) and of Becky, the helpful but easily manipulated loon. I'm not saying that the whole movie needs to be completely sanitized and PC (we all know how famous Disney is for hidden dirty jokes and racism)- but, given the overall theme of the story, it makes for an interesting contrast.<br/><br/>The 'Finding Nemo' franchise has one more overriding theme: Parent-child relationships. Marlin represents the hyper-conservative, over-protective single parent. His pivotal line in the first movie- ""You think you can do these things, but you just can't, Nemo!""- Is the opposite of what Dory's parents tell her:<br/><br/>""Now you can go anywhere you want!"" ""Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming..."" After their first encounter with Becky, Nemo grabs the chance to throw this back it Marlin's face. ""You made her feel like she couldn't do it, Dad!"" The scene where Dory reunites with her parents is incredibly gratifying. Even after suffering her loss for so long, they still managed to support her enough to go on another crazy adventure to rescue her friends back at the rehab centre.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Pixar succeeds in making another thought-provoking, heartstring-pulling, visually pleasing masterpiece."
"lizzieejohnson","9","1","8","12 July 2016"," It was really good!
","Firstly, to get it out of the way, I watched the film in English. This movie was what I expected it to be. Funny, heart warming and with a strong theme of family. The plot is very similar to the first film in the sequence, however focuses on Dory trying to find her parents that she forgot about before finding Nemo and Merlin. The characters were funny, the story line made enough sense to appeal to everyone and was simple to follow. This was a solid film, which I would give 8 stars usually. However, this movie made me cry. The reason is simple, it hit home for me, hence why I gave the film a 9 star rating. If you are looking for a good time with a film, or need something to watch with kids that you can enjoy yourself, I would highly recommend it."
"kunalkhandwala","9","1","8","11 July 2016"," Found a true gem
","We return to the Great Barrier Reef, thirteen years after Pixar's marine adventure with Nemo and friends with the story's focus now shifting to that forgetful blue tang, Dory. Co-directed and co- written by Andrew Stanton ('A Bug's life', 'Finding Nemo', 'Wall-E') and Angus MacLane, both accomplished Pixar films' creative geniuses, Dory's story is more a complementary one rather than a sequel. It's richer, funnier, wackier and lightly emotional with our investment in its animated characters that are nimbly voiced by capable actors. Like every Pixar film, Finding Dory too has its lessons for life for children and adults alike and this is especially, an unforgettable one. <br/><br/>An adoryble young Dory is nurtured and protected by her loving parents who train her to cope with her 'short term memory loss' issue but there was always that lingering fear that she would forget it all and wander away from them unknowingly. The inevitable thus happened and now, a year after Nemo was found, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) wanders away as usual but this time, farther away from Marlin and Nemo until she revives a distant memory of her parents. She relates that to her home being in the Jewel of Morro Bay which of course, was on the other side of the great ocean. Riding on the turtles, they embark on the California current in search of Dory's parents as they encounter various creatures including Hank (Ed O'Neill) the Septopus, who serves as Dory's guide and savior at the Marine Life Institute even though with a vested interest, Destiny the whale shark who was Dory's pipe-mate, Bailey the Beluga whale that has some mutant-like sonar senses, the outrageously funny sea lions and their eccentric bird friend who is just.. well, odd. <br/><br/>Hank is truly the hero here with extensible tentacles that can ride strollers, pick up and transfer items including Dory, out of one peril to the next. There is even an incredible talent he possesses that shapes the climax in the most exciting, incredulous manner that only Pixar can pull off. Marlin and Nemo get separated early on from Dory and have their own entertaining adventures in their search for her. Their encounter with the hilarious sea lions and the awkward seabird is the funniest scene of the year. On the other hand, Dory's journey to find her home engages many of her friends and acquaintances with progress being made along the razor's edge for the most part. Dory's search for her parents and the clownfish duo's search for her happen at a frantic pace that rarely spares a breather while we are completely amazed by the beauty of the world that they swim, hop or fly in. <br/><br/>There isn't a villain in 'Finding Dory'. Just like most Pixar films, there are challenges upon challenges in a journey that teach many of us some simple lessons while creating those everlasting memories with impressionable characters against a richer canvas. Directors Stanton and MacLane have thus tackled the short term memory loss problem with a lovable little Dory and depicted it as a frustrating element as she grows up and embarks upon her quest for home-coming. As she suffers from low self esteem due to her memory, she never loses the will to just keep swimming and that, is a brilliantly crafted transition that hits all the emotional cords. Besides, the way the multitude of creatures offer help is also showcasing the goodness that adds to the film's charm for both children and adults alike. Those elements are impeccably enhanced by the mesmerizing animation of the imaginative world underwater. From the various types of fish and sea creatures to the coral reefs, plants and Dory's big round eyes. <br/><br/>Pixar just keeps breaking new ground in animation and with Dory, they've taken us through a memorable journey of a forgetful fish and her friends in a timeless tale that has life's essential learnings, charming characters that are voiced by a brilliant cast and in the end, the incredible entertainment that has brought several 'awwww' reactions, laughs, hysteria and relief after a daring escape from a peril. 'Finding Dory' will go down as one of the best Pixar films and animated entertainers but one must also applaud the brief opening clip that showcased some striking animation that was completely real-looking. 'Piper' is not to be missed. <br/><br/>9.211 on a scale of 1-10."
"jdaugh","8","1","8","11 July 2016"," An unexpected gem!
","I went into this movie expecting something like Cars 2 but instead got something closer to the Toy Story sequels. I had two main concerns first was will this character be able to carry an entire movie and keep it interesting? Or would this end up being a situation like where they try to force-feed a character with a bunch of shtick? My second concern was whether or not the story itself will be strong enough to keep me interested? Well the answer to both of those questions was a most definite YES! I found myself really being invested in this story and the character's journey. I also felt that they wrote Dory great. Nothing too over the top, no schlock and the over-the-top elements were that way for a purpose not just some random gag. In addition, the supporting characters were great as well, highlighting both the emotional and humorous aspects of the story. Nemo and Marlin were of course fantastic, but I really found Fluke and Rudder one of the comedic highlights of the movie. In summary, Finding Dory was a delightful, well-written, funny movie with fully developed characters that you care about and a story that will keep you interested. All-in-all a must see!"

","Lots of people say they're disappointed at the sequel, I however, found it much more entertaining than the first. <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is how it ingeniously configure the character of Dory (Ellen Degeneres did a really good job!!!!!) Dory is a fish that suffered from short-term memory lost, which caused her to be a bit annoying sometimes, and yet her never-give- up spirit and positive attitude not only softened the heart(s) of a octopus but led her home eventually. (The scene of shell extending all the way was so touching!!) <br/><br/>In the beginning, Marlin was irritated by Dory and told her to just forget about it because that's what ""she does best"". However, when Marlin and Nemo were trapped in the fish tank, they began to think "" What would Dory do? "", and by doing so they overcame the obstacles along their way of finding Dory, that's when Marlin learned to appreciate Dory's personality. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is like completing a puzzle, it's amazing all that trivial things be put together in the end. This joyous movie showed us that even sometimes we may forget, we could still somehow find the answer. I loved it."

With Ellen Degeneres returning as our favourite forgetful fish, we feel for Dory, she's not some side character who gets her own movie after 13 years. Dory has layers, she wants to belong, Degeneres & the writers gave her the exact lines & the performance in a lot of the scenes will pull at your heartstrings & give you a bad case of the feels. <br/><br/>The storytelling is top notch, the new characters don't feel tagged on, or 2 Dimensional, they have feelings & goals in life too! <br/><br/>There are some hilarious scenes in the movie too that will make you laugh & cry at the same time. <br/><br/>It's a movie both kids & grown ups will love.

","This animation tells the story of a young fish who has a severe anterograde amnesia.

Not only is realistic, it even has appropriate depth of field according to the distance of the objects from the viewers! <br/><br/>As for the main character, I find Dory a little annoying because the amnesic jokes are far too frequent and overly repetitive. She's not as cute as Nemo either, but cute enough. The children in the cinema maintain their concentration, didn't talk or run around. However they are not overly excited either. I guess that also reflects my opinion of the film. It is an adequately entertaining animation, but not as engaging, touching or fun as expected.

"FelipeCarrillo","8","1","9","27 June 2016"," ""Finding Dory"" Moves Like A Fish In Water
","Quickly, I want to praise and honor the exquisite work of the Disney's animated shorts, simple and plain but with a soul and a perennial and vital message in a young's life. It is indisputable the years of preparation in textures, colors and effects that look like real life. ""Piper"" the short film directed by Alan Barillaro prior to the screening of the film, has the same heart and essence to the film of the surgeon fish, maturity and the acquisition of independence in a person's life.<br/><br/>Days leading up to Finding Dory's premiere I felt too excited, and although fearful of find a bad surprise, love for Pixar films and especially to ""Finding Nemo"" - one classic with whom I grew up - only did increase cravings. Minutes before of the movie's beginning, something within me was nervous, and it's logical, I was about to see a sequel of a true classic. The air conditioning was warmer than normal, I was uncomfortable in my seat and my whole body exuded; but like a divine tranquilizer, Disney's castle appeared, Pixar's iconic lamp jumped and unexpectedly on my cheeks are slid a few tears, the adventure had begun again.<br/><br/>Lately, in American films has been divulged one rumor that affirms that the famous and costly sequels, prequels and remakes have been a fiasco, for which reason, the major studios are rethinking finish these projects and start a new original boom. Although this statement is quite true - on account of revenues at the box office -, there are unique gems which deviate from this path fully (""The Conjuring 2""). ""Finding Dory"" that personally, isn't a sequel, since Nemo and Merlin does not return in the main roles, and for that reason, we can't judge it based on the original. It's a successful Spin-off that meets with the long wait - 13 years-, providing the same anticipation, the same connection with the characters, a wonderful and new adventure and a remarkable technological improvement.<br/><br/>One year more after what happened in the first film, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) lives agreeably with help of her friends, an almost normal life, has a house next to them, she gets a family and is happy with the lifestyle that has. The problem lies in the moment in which brief memories came to her head about her childhood, reminding immediately that she had a real family. With courage, joy and a little of short term memory loss - interesting fact, she hasn't forgot her purpose - begins with her faithful friends an oceanic adventure without precedents that will bring back to the most famous fishes in the film world. On the way different and beautiful characters are added to the trip with the same connection and coupling than the previous. Crush (Andrew Stanton), who leads the marine turtles and Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson) teacher stingray are the characters already seen that momentarily do presence, but the new and fantastic heroes are an inattentive bird (clear substitution to the seagulls), a duo of unique sea lions, the octopus Hank (added to the list of ""best characters""), a beluga whale and a whale shark with loss of vision. Throughout the film, acceptance of the peculiarities of each fish, learning to live with these defects and keep swimming to achieve self-determination or freedom underlie, a clear message to every family who has a child with special conditions represented in the film by the shortcomings of each marine animal,<br/><br/>In 2003, the computer effects were still in its foundations, even so they provided visual landscapes never seen before. However, thirteen years later, long enough so that these techniques mature , ""Finding Dory"" surpasses its predecessor. Beauty and perfection marine is illustrated with a detailed and fine brush, carefully from every ray of sunlight that penetrates into the water to each color and size of the hundreds of fish. Andrew Stanton and his team have recreated one of Disney's best sequels , narrative and visually.<br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" despite not being a direct sequel, tends to take elements rendered, made up meticulously for its benefit, but these are obvious. From the replacement of characters to the pools and tanks of the ""Quarantine Section of the Institute"" a clear synonym for the fish tank of the dentist. I must confess that a human character of the magnitudes of Darla was not present.<br/><br/>A sense of humor more relevant and a fluid and ingenious script makes of the adventure a real enjoyment. Dory's flashbacks are captivating and poignant - trick that Disney has continually exploited in its films - and although sometimes the reaffirmations of her loss of memory becomes a little repetitive, it finished them on time and fun arises.<br/><br/>""Finding Dory"" is a film crammed family, soul and intelligence, the quest for independence, love to each person and the enjoyment of the moment are mixed of heterogeneous way with a sound and visual landscape of first-class.<br/><br/>It's ""Unforgettable""."

"sunnyboyindian","7","1","9","25 June 2016"," It's sweet and consistently funny, but never breaks new ground
","Hollywood's fascination with lost and found themes is unendingwhether literally, or figuratively when characters go on cathartic journeys to 'discover' themselves. Finding Dory, sequel to Pixar's gorgeous, emotional classic Finding Nemo falls somewhere in between. Dory, the Blue Tang fish with a short-term memory problem does get lost, and clownfish father-son Marlon and Nemo have to find her. But Dory is also looking for her lost identity here and searching for home.<br/><br/>Is Finding Dory the visual sucker-punch that Nemo was 13 years ago? No, but it is a solid sequel – the film has its share of teary moments, there are many hilarious characters, and some dazzling animation on display. All of this makes up for the fact that the film feels overlong and has an unmistakable been-there-seen-that quality to it.<br/><br/>Kooky amnesiac Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) finds herself remembering flashes of a childhood spent with her loving parents (Eugene Levy & Diane Keaton), and sets off all the way across the ocean to California's Marine Life Institute to find them. When her friends Marlon (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) lose her, we watch two parallel sets of misadventures. Dory gets help from Hank (Ed O'Neill), a cranky scene-stealing octopus who has incredible camouflage powers. Meanwhile, Marlon and Nemo rely on the kindness of two cockney-voiced sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) and a madly eccentric bird named Becky. A near-sighted whale shark Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) and her Beluga whale pal Bailey (Ty Burrell) regularly step up to help Dory navigate her way out of danger. And there's also Sigourney Weaver, making a terrific voice-only cameo as herself.<br/><br/>This being Pixar, we get multiple subliminal messages delivered over the course of the film – that you can dare to be different, how not to let your disability stand in your way, and that friends can be your family. Director Andrew Stanton, who also helmed Finding Nemo, does a great job conveying these themes and ideas, but Finding Dory also gets sucked into the sameness of the scenarios that dominated the earlier film.<br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres is once again the heart of the film as Dory. Her scatterbrained ramblings sound a little old when the film opens, but she flies (literally!) as the story progresses. As for Hank, the moody octopus, he deserves his own spin-off movie – somebody make that happen!. It's sweet and consistently funny, but never breaks new ground."

Marlin and Nemo don't play a huge role in the movie but the amount of screen time they get fits into the movie really nicely.

Maybe I'll check IMDb to see if I can review Piper after this review. Anyway, the movie is about Dory having flashbacks and remembering her past and her parents. The first 15 minutes of the movie are a little disappointing because they feel like a watered down version of the first movie. But thankfully the movie became and is its own animal for the rest of the movie. The movie is more of a fast-paced action flick than an epic movie. It is very much a different movie.

",". . . definitely is NOT a random destination of no return for Pixar's FINDING DORY. The first 90 minutes or so of DORY feature some of the gloomiest gray animation ever to come to the Big Screen, such as the 15 minutes she spends lost in the corroded pipes. The parents reassuring their young kids at my showing seemed to be muttering about whether this was a wrong-headed exercise in doom and gloom for its own sake. My guess is ""No,"" it was more than that. Think about it. Attentive viewers will notice that there are 56 species of ocean life depicted in DORY, ranging in numbers from a mere handful to more than 100. It's no accident that this is exactly the number of U.S. states and territories--along with Washington, DC--and these numbers dovetail with the relative strength of each delegation making travel plans to the Republican National Convention this summer in CLEVELAND!! When all of the cartoon delegation's aquariums finally hit the freeway toward the Buckeye state in DORY, she and her bound-to-Trump pals desperately plunge their transport truck into the ocean, Unbinding these wavering or lukewarm delegates once and for all.

","Finding Dory is one of the most inspirational Pixar movies of all time. It shows that one should not give up even if he/she has no idea how to proceed. You might think that this is a movie for kids, however, there is a great lesson for people from all ages to learn in it. You will not be disappointed. It was clearly well thought and produced. From beginning to end, it is constantly reminding the viewer to not give up and ""keep swimming."" Of course, we are not fish but it can be applied to our lives. After watching the movie, you will probably keep repeating to yourself ""what would Dory do?"" like I did. Again, great movie!"

","I was excited when I heard Pixar was working on a sequel to Finding Nemo. The first film was fantastic. My kids were both young when it was released and we watched it many, many times.<br/><br/>I was a little worried about the sequel not living up to the original. I don't think Pixar would ever be able to top Finding Nemo but they did a very nice job on this one. It was a fun movie with many people in the theater laughing quite a bit.<br/><br/>The movie is well paced and has a lot of interesting and funny characters. The octopus was a great new character. The young version of Dory was about the cutest fish you could imagine. She was about %75 eyes. Most of her body mass were just the massively cute eyeballs.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a good family movie and you liked the first one, go ahead and go for this one. I walked out of the theater feeling good about spending the money to see it. That is not always the case with me and movie theaters."

It can hold a little too close to its predecessor and feel repetitive but that being the only flaw. This movie is near perfect and has some of the best character interaction for whenever you encounter other sea creatures. As Dory searches for her parents you are also reminded of the deeper meaning to the movie which is that Dory is overcoming her disability of Short term memory loss to find her family.

","This sequel might not be as great as the original but that doesn't mean the film is bad but instead its another Pixar movie that deserve the praise.Finding Dory is a amusing,touching,moving and a intriguing film that delivers an amazing animation that Pixar is known for and a significant continuation of it's predecessor.The voice works here are appreciable and the characters are just lovable and entertaining.This sequel will feel identical from it's predecessor but some of it are new additions that were worthy enough to make this film great and a touching moments that made people weep but some emotional scenes didn't intrigue me.The movie has also fantastic emotional connection to the characters. <br/><br/>Finding Dory is another example that there is more ideas in a franchise if the people making it has effort and passion to do it.Finding Dory might have some identical story and a some emotional scenes that didn't intrigue audiences but overall the film is near to the ""one of the best animated films"" very very very,very far from the worst"

","Finding Dory isn't so much of a sequel, as it is a continuation of Finding Nemo. This time our favorite blue Tang hero has enlisted the help of her best friends to help her find her family. One that began remembering in a series of flashbacks.<br/><br/>Their odyssey leads them from the sanctity of their beloved reef, all the way to the State of California. <br/><br/>The animation this time around is much more sumptuous, and is just one of the many joys of this film. Another joy is the irascible but big hearted Octopus ""Hank"" (voiced by Married With Children's Ed O'Neil) who is a welcome addition to the new cast of characters. <br/><br/>Of course on its ""surface"" (pardon the pun) this is a big, kid friendly adventure that my kids loved. As you delve into this film's sunlit zone, however, you will find a well nuanced film, predicated on the simple truth that we are all important, regardless of any afflictions we may be suffering, and we should never let these afflictions prevent us from overcoming and ultimately triumphing!<br/><br/>Parents of children with developmental disabilities will find special meaning in this movie...and everybody else will love it as well.

","Out of all of the 2010s Pixar sequels (other than the cars films which were garbage, and the toy stories which were great) Finding Dory is easily the most lackluster when compared to the original. Finding Nemo was so great for it's heartbreaking journey of a father trying to find his lost son. Finding Dory is literally just Dory thinking ""hey I wonder where my parents are."" I get that large amounts of emotion are triggered by its ending, but the entire film doesn't feel very necessary because of greatly finding nemo ended.
But overall it is an enjoyable film with some very funny and exciting scenes. The introduction of new characters was great since they were well written. The ending scene of the film is quite funny because of its absurdity which I think is what they were trying to go for.
I enjoyed this film, but will take Finding Nemo over it in a heartbeat."

","Finding dory has a lot to like honestly, the characters are fun, some pretty good jokes and (kind of irrelevant at this point) the animation is spectacular. This is really shown of with the creative ways they use hank, who is far and away the best part of this movie
What bothers me about this film? Two things; a completely irrelevant cash grab and it is goddamn boring. First of all, I absolutely love finding nemo. Nearly everything about it is great, including the ending which capped of the film well. No Sequel Needed.
And sure the film isn't painfully boring, but the plot gets really really repetitive and you wonder why it's so long
I blame this in part on the setting, which is almost incomparable to the ocean in finding nemo. Each set piece in that film was spectacular, and here we have a couple of animal enclosures.

","Man, this is a pretty dark decade for Pixar. Brave and Cars 2 were really disastrous overall, and this is yet another disappointment from the formerly great studio. The plot is serviceable, but relatively mindless. Dory suddenly remembers her parents, so she, Marlin, and Nemo go to look for them. It's pretty vapid, though, with tons of obnoxious new characters, and only the occasional flashback to Dory as an infant providing any sort of emotion. Additionally, the entire final act is a tiresome series of characters getting captured and/or put into dangerous situations over and over and over, and the scenarios get increasingly ridiculous until we end up with a seven-tentacled octopus driving a truck full of fish off of a cliff and into the sea. The humans are all pretty dull, from the oblivious workers at the aquarium to the dimwitted guests who seem to think that the octopus is actually a human baby for a minute. Finally, there was some discussion about how two characters who appeared to be mentally disabled were treated like garbage and played for laughs. While I'm not usually looking for stuff to be offended about in films, this was kind of a shocking inclusion for the company, and shows that they've become pretty unscrupulous and lazy. Overall, this is just a fishy cash-grab that has no real reason to exist. Ellen DeGeneres' Dory is a character who gets old quickly, so let's hope there aren't any more ""Finding Fish"" films in the works at Pixar."
"jaredpahl","5","0","1","17 July 2019"," Finding Dory, Losing Entertainment
","These days, it's too much to ask for a genuine Pixar gem. The glory days are long past. The creative fire that sustained the animation studio's best films is out. We won't get another Finding Nemo. But when an ill-gotten Nemo sequel comes along, is it too much to ask for something reasonably entertaining? Finding Dory retains the talent from the 2003 Pixar classic, but the 2016 sequel, like others before and after it, drops the passion. Sure, it's passably drawn, and it gave me some chuckles, but It's not as funny, not nearly as charming, and simply not as good as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Finding Dory purports to have come from an original story by Nemo director Andrew Stanton, who also happens to have directed Dory. Honestly, I find the credit dubious. There's a good story here, but original? I don't know. In Finding Dory, a fish is taken off to a human world, other fish come to its aid, and things are wrapped up in an affirming message of love. This time, however, it's Dory that needs finding. Whatever, if Stanton wants to deliver the same beats in Nemo 2, that's all well and good by me. We know the story works. I'm just here for a good time, so shoot. Now if only Dory could have delivered the same personality, humor, or heart.<br/><br/>Dory doesn't get those notes right. It's not a lack of effort, really. Finding Dory introduces new characters like Ed O'Neill's camouflaging octopus, Hank, and a whale shark voiced by Kaitlin Olson, but they are forgettable. It stages new escapes, but they aren't very exciting. There are new emotional beats featuring Dory and her parents, but they don't ring very true. The new elements of Finding Dory, as welcome as they are, are pale. With the exception of Ellen ""Why doesn't she do more movies"" DeGeneres, the voice acting is lifeless, the character designs are obvious and kiddy, and the writing and direction seem flat out lazy. Case in point, the humor. I'll admit to chuckling one or two times during Finding Dory, but I never laughed. Half the jokes are recycled from Nemo, and the rest are uninspired guesses at what makes for good cartoon comedy. The reality is, I spent more time cringing than smiling. Why they decided to take a hilarious one-shot gag from Finding Nemo (Dory's whale speak) and stretch it out for an entire film, way past its breaking point, is beyond me. But it's not just the incessant whale noises that left me grinding my teeth. What about a wacky bird that exists solely to transport Marlin and Nemo around? Not funny, not memorable, not voiced by Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times, when the passion isn't there, the product suffers. Like Cars 2, Monster's University, and Incredibles 2, Finding Dory is good ole' apathetic Pixar. Not as shockingly Disney Junior-ish as Monsters U, Finding Dory doesn't quite qualify as a ""bad"" Pixar movie. The animation is lovely to look at, and the settings are colorful and detailed. It's a nice little world they cooked up in this film, and I can't say I didn't enjoy being there. That said, there is a real lack of entertainment value in Finding Dory, which coasts along a familiar track while sloppily throwing together some ""funny"" new characters, ""exciting"" new situations, and a ""message"" about family. I came into the movie with open arms. I had absolutely no expectations that it would approach Nemo's greatness. All I wanted was a fun afternoon at the movies. And still, I left Finding Dory in an indifferent funk.<br/><br/>55/100"
"datautisticgamer-74853","7","0","1","7 July 2019"," More of a Dory than its predecessor
","After missing out on this film in high school, I got to view it while flying on Finnair. I will say that Finding Nemo is a movie that I can view several times without getting bored, especially from its phenomenal animation. But now that we're here, how does its successor hold it up?<br/><br/>The story does continue with great humor and the use of uneven pacing to its advantage in the action and emotional scenes, though plenty of its ideas (especially the squid chase scene) feel replicated from FN. I do enjoy the new characters very much, especially the clever visual riddles Hank provides, the different kind of heart provided by Jenny and Charlie, and the charming voice acting. I do feel that additional development of Dory's character was a nice touch. From her flashbacks to how her STML is not universal, most additions were not unnecessary, which is the quality a sequel should have. The animation is improved as well, particularly in the land scenes with the extra detail added to the humans and objects. It captures the feeling that each species is what they are supposed to be, from the behavior of the otters to the fluidity of Hank and the squid. It's kind of a given seeing how Pixar has generally top-notch computers, though I cannot stress enough how gleaming a standard it continues to set.<br/><br/>If you can get past how this movie and Finding Nemo have somewhat similar plot executions, then I am confident you'll enjoy it. It has the humor, action, and heart that Pixar rarely produces a dud with, and animation that somehow upgrades the already excellent animation of FN. Besides emotion, parents should also watch for some more intense scenes, for they might be paced a tad too fast for children."

"anselmdaniel","8","0","1","15 June 2019"," Solid if expected
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is a computer animated movie that premiered in 2016. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is written by Andrew Stanton with the screenplay by both Andrew Stanton and Victoria Strouse. The movie stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Hayden Rolence. The movie is a follow-up/spin off of Finding Nemo. Dory, the forgetful regal blue tang, searches for her parents.<br/><br/>It has been thirteen years since the first installment in this franchise. Finding Dory has been a long awaited sequel with many of the younger fans of the first movie having grown up. This movie needed to appeal to kids and the older audience. Does this movie appeal to both audiences? I would say that it does. The movie is similar to the first movie by having its themes be something that all audiences can relate to. The movie has great thrills for all audiences. However, this does not match the original's feel.<br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks reprise their roles of Dory and Marvin respectively. The two voice actors continue doing a good job in this movie. The movie uses the characters to their best but the originality and freshness from the first movie is lost in Finding Dory. This does not make Finding Dory an awful movie. It simply makes Finding Dory a movie that is more predictable and expected. There are not many massive twists or introductions.<br/><br/>The entire sequence in the aquarium is awesome. This sequence has Dory with an octopus trying to escape. The computer animation and dialogue across this sequence is great to watch. It also brought back the idea of children that do not understand their actions might kill fish. The entire sequence is fun to watch but it felt like it took the themes from Finding Nemo rather than creating something new.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, the sequel sets a high standard for animation and effects. There is much to appreciate in this movie from a technical standpoint. All of the characters are well animated and the scenes themselves are well directed. It made for an experience that is worthy of the Pixar Animation name.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Finding Dory.' This is a solid family friendly movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Arriving a decade too late, this long-gestating sequel to 2003's masterpiece ""Finding Nemo"" lands without much fanfare, with a bland screenplay littered with one-liners that are more amusing than funny, a running time that feels about twice as long as it is, and a plot that plays like a never-ending series of climaxes. Ellen DeGeneres is back as the voice of the titular character but the magic seems gone: DeGeneres's vocal performance is distracted, as though the comedian recorded her lines in between tapings of her daytime show. Despite a star-studded voice cast, only Ed O'Neill as Hank the octopus seems to be really trying, and the movie deploys Sigourney Weaver's voice as a running joke that never seems to know whether or not the punchline has been delivered. It's not that the movie is bad per se, it's that, coming on the heels of the original a decade and a half later, the audience expects more than a blandly serviceable corporate effort."

"jkylebennett","5","0","1","2 September 2018"," It's Fine, but too Similar to the First
","It really isn't a bad movie, but it's much too close to the original without actually improving on anything from the first. The beautiful atmospheric presence of Finding Nemo was a big part of the movie. Those still shots that had close focus on Marlin and Dory in the first were a big part of what really drew many people in. It was stunning to look at and it offered a sense of calm while keeping the viewer engaged. It was also better paced and made the movie more about the journey with an overarching goal. <br/><br/>Finding Dory somehow lacks that charm, in part because that whole part of atmospheric presence was skipped in favor of getting to the busier location in the California rehabilitation center within the first 30 or so minutes. It felt rushed when compared to the more relaxed feel of the first movie, even though there was a greater sense of urgency to reach the goal in the first movie. This one somehow lacked that same feel, probably because the circumstances for Dory when compared to Nemo are vastly different. Even Crush's scene in this movie was rushed to simply offer a convenient time skip to the next part of where most of the movie would take place, rather than using it as character development like in the first. It didn't offer the same build up to the ultimate goal. The characters were also somehow less engaging and memorable.<br/><br/> Dory's friends from the Rehabilitation Center are likable, but not very memorable. They were more devicive to explain Dory's excentricities and less endearing than they could have been. Dory's parents are nice. They're well developed and likable. They are the better characters of this movie. Still, it's not enough to save the movie from mediocrity. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to liken this movie to that of Cars 2(and to clarify, I don't hate Cars 2), and Dory is like Mater. A great character in her own right(just how Mater is a great character in his own right), but not so great as a lead. There's something interesting there, just like there was in Cars 2, but it wasn't executed well enough to be interesting or likable. This movie really only fails in terms of execution of the story and, somehow, the presence. Even though they had newer equipment for this movie, with presumably better graphics and software, Finding Nemo looked more polished. It looked more complete. You could feel the dedication to the first movie and the desire to make it right. Finding Dory looked rushed and felt rushed by comparison. The concept was there. It just wasn't developed well enough to tell a great story."

It does have laughs and heart touching scenes, but Finding Nemo had more of both and stronger supporting characters. Oh, I saw Finding Dory today. I liked it, but not loved it. The original is still my favorite Pixar cartoon. That was a more exciting story...wait, what was I talking about?"

","The animated sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) reverses the plight of the main characters: this time it is the memory-challenged bluefish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) rather than clownfish Nemo (Hayden Romence) who gets lost during a search to find her long-lost parents. Nemo and his father Marlin (Albert Brooks) try to find and rescue Dory with the aid of many other new characters. As this is an animated film, there are many antics, perils and troubleshooting that ensue.<br/><br/>Like its prequel, this film has beautiful animation especially in the beginning as the camera follows the sea creature characters through long and fast journeys. The main characters and the array of new ones are quite funny and entertaining. The delightful DeGeneres is quite enjoyable throughout especially her high-energy flow of humour at the start. At times, she reminds one of the benchmark for animated performances: Robin Williams in ""Aladdin"" (1992).<br/><br/>There are times ""Finding Dory"" is less than what it could be especially a pivotal scene in the second half. This scene began with the right emotional impact but then became too casual too soon. But by the end, the movie does what a Pixar/Disney cartoon is supposed to do: entertain. When the climactic scene is met with Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"", we know we are entering goosebump movie heaven. What a wonderful world, indeed."

","I don't understand the hate on this one. I found this movie to be absolutely amazing! It was so sweet. Dory is such a sweet character and I always wanted to know more about her background. She doesn't remember anything in the first one so we don't really know much about her. In this one we really delve into her past and learn everything about her. She is such a likeable character, and I really feel like Pixar did it again with this one. For anyone who's a fan of the first one, I feel they will definitely love this one. I know I did!"

This movie is about grabbing onto every last bit of hope and aspiration and never letting go of it. This movie also emphasizes the moral importance of friends and family. At heart, this movie portrays all sorts of kindhearted and altruistic morals which I believe is what everyone needs every now and then, whether you're a kid or an adult.<br/><br/>Also this is the second movie I have seen with Thomas Newman as the soundtrack composer. Newman definitely hit my feels in this movie and -- to be honest -- is probably the main reason why I liked this movie so much. His idiosyncratic style fills this movie with a truly unique and sentimental and almost idyllic feeling, something that I exactly wanted at the time of watching this movie.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10."

"ElMaruecan82","6","0","1","22 December 2017"," Finding Money...
","""Finding Nemo"" was such a self-sufficient and satisfying masterpiece it was beyond the predictability of needing a sequel. But once again know-it-all executives chose the easy way, milking the success of a beloved animated movie and making an ersatz of a sequel. 13 years after. It's all about the numbers, right? Well here's a number: 10. 10 reasons why the film sucked.<br/><br/>1. Saccharine overdose, I expect many cutesy elements in a Disney Pixar movie, it first started with the babyish version of Dory, with those big eyes meant to make hearts melt and then she opened her mouth and I could have sworn the casting agents auditioned thousands of kids to find which one would have the cutest voice ever. Yes, she was adorable but it was like a doctor telling me to open my mouth and ""say aaaaaaaw"".<br/><br/>2. The action starts too quickly, a random school trip on mister Ray's back, a random Dory's intrusion, and a random flashback and pop goes the Dory. ""Finding Dory"" was trying to create an emotional connection between the opening scene and the adult Dory but it felt just too rushed, it's not like we've seen Dory longing for her lost parents before, she just happens to remember she had parents. <br/><br/>3. You don't base the plots on comic reliefs, there was a reason why the short-term memory loss was used for Dory, it was a defining character's trait but also a running gag, here it structures the plot and makes it dependent on Dory's flashes of memories coming at the most conveniently possible time, just when she's in a false track or a dead end, there's something that pushes her on the road again. The first movie was following a simple trajectory, and was dependent on a few encounters and obstacles, here it's all about hazardous contrivances and twists of luck.<br/><br/>4. The film is about Dory trying to find her parents, the title makes a little sense although it was the only possible one establishing a continuity with the first film. The problem is that the title basically establishes the story from Marlin and Nemo's perspective and they're secondary characters, in fact, they're as ""pivotal"" as Indiana Jones in ""Raiders"", we understand their presence but they're also here to show that the animators didn't believe Dory alone was capable to carry a whole movie. They were right, we needed the pairs of clown fishes as the straight ones, oh the irony!<br/><br/>5. Too much repetition, of course it's inevitable if your main character is suffering from short-term memory loss but how many times did she needed to mention it, how many times did we need to see an excited and happy Dory just going all tail ahead. She was a lovable buffoon in the first, hysterical in a good way, now she's hysterical in the worst possible way. Everything that made the first film genuinely funny became rapidly annoying here and don't get me started on the whale speak.<br/><br/>6. Caricatured characterization, try to say that quickly. It seems pretty obvious for Dory, but how about Marlin? Basically, he's learned nothing from the first film, and he's still acting like a paranoid over-protective sad sack, not only that, but he says perhaps the most terrible thing to Dory without immediately apologizing, following the idiot plot where anything can be solved if the right words are said.<br/><br/>7. Too much time spent above the water,. I don't mind a fish going from an ocean to a tank, but this trip was a bit far-fetched even for a movie that features a fish that can read. The problem is that the first Nemo started with a shocker, but if the very rules of that sequel applied in the first film, the Barracuda or the dentist's fish tank wouldn't have caused much trouble. In a universe where a fish can talk to a sea-lion, travel on a crazy seagull, or when an octopus can easily vanish from sight like a chameleon, any thing is possible. These are not the rules ""Finding Nemo"" was based on.
Which leads me to that infamous car chase, Fonzie jumped the sharks, Dory jumped the truck... it's the same ruining effect. It's not enough that it's possibly the most overused climactic sequence in an action-packed movie, they had to indulge to it an a supposedly aquatic adventure. How about going for the emotional climax, how about actually making a good use of the aquatic park setting... how about not making the damn thing. <br/><br/>8. Indeed, was that trip necessary? Have we ever felt that there something in Dory's arc waiting to be closed. It is usual for animated sequels to focus on a character's background or on the secondary character, it worked with Buzz Lightyear for ""Toy Story 2"" but that's because there was good material in it. ""DreamWorks"" also came up with great secondary stories in the ""Shrek"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" series, but Dory is just another-character-looking-for-her-parents with memory losses as a twist. It's a rather thin premise if you asked me. And you can tell they're trying to fatten it with the usual ""anything is possible"" lesson.<br/><br/>9. What's with that musical schmaltz titled ""Unforgettable"" did they try to pull a ""Skyfall"" or what? The song was so James Bond-esque I expected to see a woman's silhouette swimming in the ocean. What a shameful Oscar-bait, the film didn't get any nominations and there's a good reason for that.<br/><br/>10. It wasn't that funny, yeah, yeah, Sigourney Weaver was funny the first time and then got overused, in the French version, they even dubbed it with a famous anchorwoman, which didn't make sense, once again the star system is killing the film... I guess every country will have a famous national voice. the first film was about ""Finding Nemo"", the second has no reason to exist, except for ""Finding Money""."

","Finding Dory, directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, was released on June 16, 2017 approximately thirteen years after Finding Nemo was released and brought joy to many eager fans. Dory who is played by Ellen DeGeneres plays a fish who suffers short term memory loss. She decides to go on a voyage to find her parents when she realizes that her parents are gone and she doesn't know where they went. Meanwhile Marlin and Nemo are trying to find Dory because she left without notice. Dory ends up in a marine life institute in California where she was from. There she meets old friends that help her remember where she came from, this in turn helps her to find her parents. The film could've been a bit more original and seemed like a cookie cutter of Finding Nemo at times in the movie. Even taking into account that the movie wasn't the most original thing in existence. The target audience of Finding Dory were the people, who are now adults and some possibly have children of their own, that saw Finding Nemo as kids. For the target audience the movie did exactly what it was supposed to do, reliving the joy they had when seeing Finding Dory. Overall it was a very good movie with an easy to follow plot and a nostalgic feeling. Thus we scored Finding Dory as 9/10 and a must see, instant classic."

Marlon and Nemo try to help her but they soon become separated and a lot of the action is set in an Aquarium. There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest because he is getting out of the aquarium and is only doing it for his own benefit.

","I'm not going to say that this movie was just a total waste of time...but about 85% of the film was. Coming from me, a person who is extremely passionate about science and biology wouldn't appreciate the constant factual errors in the film. Dory and other fish friends of hers could never tolerate the constant changing in water quality from hopping from tank to tank. Whale sharks are not whales, either. One thing that got to be a bit annoying was the tank jumping, because that's almost all that we see. Every couple of moments, either Dory or Marlin and Nemo are hopping from tank to tank at the aquarium, or flying in a bucket of water carried by sea foul. It's a constant aspect. Not to mention we have an octopus who can breathe for an undetermined amount of time. <br/><br/>Also, forgive me but, how did no one notice an unattended baby stroller with tentacles flailing about from it, and no nearby adults? I understand most of the American population is rather dunce, but jeez, give commoners some kind of credit.<br/><br/>Anyways, it was a sweet story and heartwarming ending, but the movie was mostly repetitive nonsense and persistence. Not my walk in the park."

Once again, the voice casting is spot- on and goes a long way to making the movie as good as it is.<br/><br/>Not quite as good as Finding Nemo though. The sentimentality in Finding Dory was laid on a bit thick and feels empty and manipulative at times. Finding Nemo felt more subtle and genuine in that regard."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","17 April 2017"," Just as good as the first one
","Pixar has this habit of telling the exact same story with their sequels, yet doing it in such a way that it doesn't bother us. This is a usual sequel problem where the story is the exact same and nothing has changed. And perhaps that's the trick. Because things do change in Pixar movies, yet the characters end up in the same kind of situations despite having grown as people.<br/><br/>Take Finding Dory, for instance. The characters we know and love have evolved. Marlin has relaxed a little bit due to the events of the first film, Nemo has matured and Dory has finally found an anchor point for herself. Yet, as you might surmise from the title, Dory ends up lost and this time it's up to Marlin and Nemo to look for her.<br/><br/>And it works. It really works. In my mind this is very much on par with the original film. If I was forced to choose, I'd pick the original, but that's solely to the novelty of it, and in this case that counts only as a tiebreaker. The animation quality is still superb, the returning characters feel the same, the story is just as exciting as before, the ocean is still a great place to have an adventure, the new characters are all interesting and it just feels familiar.<br/><br/>Is it among my favourite Pixar films? Not really, but that's like saying that you prefer chocolate ice cream over strawberry one. Both are amazing, but the one is just more to your liking. I honestly do think that both this and Finding Nemo don't necessarily need the big action endings they both have, and I'm not a huge fan of Marlin nor Nemo. This film has a bigger action ending, but on the other hand Dory's emotional struggle with her memory loss is some of the best drama Pixar has ever done, so it evens out. And even this is me really nitpicking.<br/><br/>It's a good film from Pixar. Definitely worth a shot if you liked the original."
"Evan_Wheatley","9","0","3","11 April 2017"," A nice compliment to ""Finding Nemo""
","A sour look crossed my face as my friends and I pulled into the parking lot of the Rave Theater in Little Rock. While I wanted to lose some sleep over ""The Conjuring 2,"" the rest of my friends had their sights set on the newest Pixar flick.<br/><br/>Bitterly inhaling my package of raspberry sour straws, I slumped into my seat and made a valiant attempt to dislike this movie. However, much like with last year's ""Inside Out,"" Pixar won me over yet again with ""Finding Dory.""<br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role from ""Finding Nemo"" as Dory: a kind, easygoing blue tang fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. All is well under the sea until Dory randomly experiences a flashback from her childhood of her and her parents. Remembering that she was separated from her family long ago, Dory races off to find her parents, relying only on her poor memory to guide her.<br/><br/>While this film is not a retread of ""Finding Nemo,"" it provides a few nods to the original, and many of the characters from ""Nemo"" return in supporting roles or cameos. The film also implements the voice talents of Idris Elba, Ty Burrell and Sloane Murray, who plays an adorable baby Dory in the flashbacks.<br/><br/>The most interesting character addition, however, is that of Hank, played by Ed O'Neill. The irritable, pessimistic, yet kind-hearted octopus warms up to the spastic, forgetful nature of Dory, and their interplay throughout elevates the film's drama and humor.<br/><br/>Is it as good as ""Finding Nemo?"" Perhaps, but much like ""Monster's University"" in 2013, ""Finding Dory"" differs in many ways from its predecessor and compliments it well. With sequels like ""Cars 3,"" (2017) ""Toy Story 4"" (2018) and the highly anticipated ""The Incredibles 2"" (2019) on the horizon, I am eager to see where Pixar takes our imaginations next."

","Finding Dory is a animated children's movie and is the sequel in the series, the first being Finding Nemo. It was released on 17th of June 2017 and was directed and written by Andrew Stanton and was made in Pixar Animation Studios California. This film featured iconic stars like Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neill. Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) gets lost from her home and gets taken into the ocean at a very young age. She finds the family of Marlin and Nemo who aid her in finding her way back to her parents. The story is set in the great barrier reef in Australia. The tone in this movie is emotional because the film starts out with dory losing her parents. Later in the movie you feel the anticipation to whether or not Dory finds her parents. Overall I would recommend it to any parents to watch with their kids or anyone who likes the film Finding Nemo. This film was very good in my opinion and that is why I give it a 8/10."

","""Finding Dory"" is a good piece of work, featuring beautiful sea scenery ,funny characters, good voice acting and a good demonstration of friendship. But as most of the reviewers pointed out, the plot is somehow too unreasonable to the extent that it exceeds the category of animation. I feel ""Finding Nemo"" goes more smoothly, and the jokes there are more interesting.<br/><br/>But still, if you are a fan of Pixar, I would recommend this film to you. This is an acceptable movie from them but not excelling."
"Okonh0wp","9","0","3","14 March 2017"," A sequel with purpose an flair
","For its grandiose reputation as a creative mecca, even Pixar has been unable to resist the Faustian bargain of a sequel every now and then. While Ellen DeGeneres' popularity and ""Toy Story 3""""s Oscar nomination made a sequel inevitable, it shouldn't be discounted that Dory (DeGeneres) was deservedly a breakout character in her own right when she debuted thirteen years ago as Marlon's (Albert Brooks) memory-addled sidekick. The circuitous dialogue resulting from Dory's short-term memory loss makes for the kind of back-and- forth of an updated Abbott and Costello routine. Similarly, Dory's chipper attitude in the face of her (presupposed) inability to accomplish anything outside a 30-second window makes her a spunky can-do everyman.<br/><br/>The challenge coming into ""Finding Dory"" is similar to nearly every TV spin-off from Gomer Pyle to Joey: Can the comic relief carry their own storyline? In this case, yes: It turns out there's a lot of depth to Dory when you factor in the potential that her memory could resurface and, indeed, that's the route we go down.<br/><br/>Dory begins to experience flashbacks that take her, Nemo, and a reluctant Marlon (taking each other for granted is a theme here) all the way to a Seaworld-like aquarium in California where Dory, Nemo, and Marlin find themselves in and out of various rooms and fish tanks. Lack of opposable limbs or bodies larger than three inches be damned, this is the Pixar universe and pesky human contraptions like doors are no match for you if you have determination and some crafty friends to help. These include a beluga whale (Ty Burrell) with echolocation, a near-sighted whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and a curmudgeon of an octopus whose congruence with voice actor Ed O'Neill's screen persona makes him the film's breakout character. <br/><br/>If you're someone with a deep-seated love for aquariums and Jacques Cousteau like me, there's an enchantment in the animation that you would never get from the renderings of toys, ants, superheroes, or dystopian garbage piles that Pixar has previously done. There's also the added bonus of the biological accuracy and the clever ways in which these traits are ingrained in their characters. <br/><br/>High-quality animated flicks typically come with moral parables and the original one here is the way that people with disabilities can contribute to society and are capable of surprise. Although Dory couldn't really navigate the freeways of California, it all feels surprisingly organic here."
"candlern","10","0","2","13 March 2017"," This beautiful Disney Picture takes us back to the world of Finding Nemo with an explanation of the forgetful yet widely loved Dory.
","To start, Disney animation has improved immensely over the years- transforming from amazing to even better. The overall quality of film is outstanding. The picture is crisp and clear, giving an amazingly realistic view of the ocean. As always, every character, no matter how insignificant, is adorable and brilliantly thought out. The animators did an outstanding job.<br/><br/>Next, the story brings you right back to Finding Nemo. We see the same side characters presented in a slightly older position. Additionally, this movie fills in some gaps of the characters that were left by Finding Nemo. For example, we discover the past of many characters and gain insight to the world that these films are set in. We also gain some new characters to provide comedy relief and slight conflict throughout the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Finding Dory will be a hit for families and older adults alike. With hilariously endearing characters and a rich story, there is really nothing to not like. Everything down to each note of the soundtrack and every pixel on the screen is planned with amazing precision and skill. I would give Finding Dory a ten out of ten."

","Sequels are tough. Even though we live in a strange new age where sequels are already planned and penned seven chapters ahead of time, in movie form as to squash out all of the detail and description a television series could properly do, sequels are still tough. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS goes something like this: The first movie was slightly stale popcorn. The second was trying too hard to be funny. The third was about the same as the first, just in a different location. The fourth turned out to be a bit more interesting when they started playing with the timeline. The sixth was too serious, the seventh was too gritty. Overall, popcorn. Most of it stale, or at least past its prime.<br/><br/>I skipped FAST FIVE on purpose, because of all of the FAST movies, it's easily the best. It takes the best of the slapstick that makes the movies bearable, mixes it with the best of jokes, and just overall has a blast with itself, never daring to take itself too seriously or try to bog us down in soap opera-style deaths while making yet another point about the importance of family (which is yet another reason why I think 8 will collapse, but more on that some other time).<br/><br/>Making franchises, to me, is like having half a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread. Your task is to somehow spread what little peanut butter you've got over the length of the entire loaf. You can't use too much in any particular spot, so what you end up with is a thin layer of flavor over a stack of wheat slices, which by the time you're finished, leaves you wishing for anything other than peanut butter on bread, and may traumatize you from ever eating it again.<br/><br/>That being said, there are, of course, flawed gemstones in the midst of the bread. A moment where you became frustrated, and said, ""screw this, I'm going to indulge myself!"" and slapped a little too much on that middle slice, just so you could get some joy out of it. Thereby jeopardizing the rest of the loaf, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long intro.<br/><br/>FINDING DORY is not a good sequel. Shticks that are put into movies that test our ability to suspend belief are best used sparingly, and this is not something anyone that made this movie really stopped to care about. In FINDING NEMO, most of the action was underwater, and when the fish needed to jump locations, it was done carefully, tip-toeing the edge of where believability would be lost.<br/><br/>FINDING DORY simply doesn't care. The logic is to just throw caution to the wind and hope for the best. ""Just keep swimming, just keep swimming"" ends up becoming less of a mantra for the kindhearted Dory and more of a directive for the entire film, a kind of sweeping message designed to keep you in the game, so to speak, so you won't think too hard about the complete lack of logic presented here.<br/><br/>Tearjerker moments involving Dory's youth take a lot away from the comedy of NEMO, where what could have been a very dark tale of desperation and despair was turned into a fun adventure, and sometimes we're left with that empty-hole feeling, that all-too painful reality of just how hard it would be for someone who truly lived with short term memory loss to live a happy life. I'm reminded of MEMENTO, and that's not something I should be thinking about when watching a film of this caliber. Pixar has always been good at touching the darker side of reality, but only with a light touch, and never one that doesn't have some resolution down the line. While we do have resolution here, it's not a complete payoff as is the case with other films of this kind, because Dory is still Dory, in the end. Will she even remember the journey she's taken, and the point of it all? Pixar's golden age has come to an end, and it's sad to see, from a guy who's found an awful lot to love about their films. I'm supposed to get excited about CARS 3, when I didn't really think CARS was on the same level as so many other Pixar gems, and then CARS 2 which turned out to be nothing more than a giant commercial for churning out Disney merchandise. Needless to say, I don't have any high expectations for Lightning McQueen's 3rd expo into Maynard jokes and inexplicable competition woes.<br/><br/>TOY STORY 4 is coming. I haven't seen TOY STORY 3, but it's one of those films that you end up hearing about because of its overall impact, and there is a certain sense of finality about it that is something I truly appreciate in films. I've always thought, regarding movies, that three is the lucky number, the perfect pattern for a fictional reflection of life: It begins. It lives. It ends. It's how it should be.<br/><br/>So I guess we're looking at FAST AND THE FURIOUS logic infecting everything. As long as we're making moolah, churn out those overpriced theater tickets. How many Toy Stories are waiting for us, just around the corner? How many slices of bread are we headed for, with just enough peanut butter gracing the ridges of the wheat as to tell our mouths what we are eating, without really being able to derive any pleasure from it, because of how much is lacking? Are we facing a time when, as in SOYLENT GREEN, Charlton Heston sucks what's left of the remains of jam off of a dirty spoon, just to tearfully remember a time when food was delicious <br/><br/>Instead of just filling?"

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. <br/><br/>This is mostly a sequel to the early 'Finding Nemo' where Dory, a blue fish with the inability to form new short-term memories, becomes the key to tracking down Nemo, caught and taken away by novelty fish hunters. In that story part of Dory's skill is the ability to talk to whales.<br/><br/>While this movie is mostly a sequel, when an older Dory begins to remember she had a mom and dad, it actually begins when Dory was a new hatchling and depicts how she wandered away in the first place.<br/><br/>While 'Finding Dory' is a rather pleasant 90 minutes it doesn't have the invention and charm of the earlier movie. Dory does work her way over to the facility on the California Coast, uses her ability to talk to whales, and has to use the help of a very inventive Septopus (he lost one tentacle), to eventually join her family again.<br/><br/>Just so-so entertainment."

Overall the movie is quite fun, offering some clever ideas, solid humor, and touching moments that emphasize the strength's that allow Dory to overcome her weaknesses. <br/><br/>While not as good as Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a cute little movie that is well worth watching."
"tapio_hietamaki","7","0","4","3 February 2017"," An understanding study of a fish with a mental condition
","This is a sequel for one of Pixar's beloved classics, focusing on Dory the forgetful fish, who appear as a minor character in 'Finding Nemo'. Nemo and his father appear in 'Finding Dory' but are out of the spotlight so it's not really a direct sequel.<br/><br/>Dory is an adorable character. She inspires pity and sympathy, as even the easiest tasks are very difficult for her and she is painfully aware of her own shortcomings. None of the problems that she creates are her own fault: she is intelligent and has a kind heart, she merely has a condition that makes her life difficult.<br/><br/>I have known several elderly people with memory problems, and it is always heartbreaking to see. Even more so when the condition plagues someone young. We get glimpses of Dory's childhood and see how her parents do their best to give her a safe environment to play around and teach her to deal with the problems that could possibly arise in the future. And they taught her well, as we see Dory overcome the obstacles that chance throws at her.<br/><br/>So it's a humane story about dealing with a condition. But it's also an animated adventure movie. There are sidekicks and twists and turns, beautiful locations and physical comedy. The CGI looks pretty much flawless. The water and lighting especially are gorgeous, and the schools of fish are colorful, and the way the octopus moves is a delight."
"jevonlondoner-15682","8","0","7","20 January 2017"," Very good but not as good as Finding Nemo
","Finding Dory is basically the same as Nemo but it's Dory's turn now. The story line is quite good actually and the characters are very funny and characteristic. If i am being honest, it's not as good as the first one as it's not as interesting and good as the first one. Firstly the comedy was a bit too much but the first one was more emotional than comical. My sister enjoyed it but she's only eight. I, however am 13 and I like good animation like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and The Jungle Book. But this wasn't as good as those past Pixar films. So I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>But as I carried on watching, I realised that the film wasn't that bad and actually had quite good voice overs and a good enough story line. All I will say is don't get too hyped or you'll be a little disappointed. It's a good film but a little bad compared the Pixar's last films like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and Wreck it Ralph."

In every show, we can find fault. <br/><br/>The part that I found to be the best was when you come to realize why Dory says, ""Just keep swimming!"" Because in ""Finding Nemo"" we all sort of judge her. This teaches us to love people, right where they are at because you just never know why people are, like they are.<br/><br/>The underwater scenes are much like it is when you snorkel or scuba dive.

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","7","8 January 2017"," Finding Dory meets a fun, heartwarming return to one of Pixar's most classic features
","Pixar Animation Studios rarely falls short of beautiful, heartwarming features since their debut in 1995 when they delivered the revolutionary 'Toy Story'. Whether their biggest gem is their stellar technical abilities or their gift of bringing their heart-touching stories to life before our very eyes, Pixar never stops delivering the goods. Easily one of their most classic entries is director Andrew Stanton's 2003 feature 'Finding Nemo' which took audiences everywhere in an under-the-sea odyssey of a lovable clown fish in search of his lost son while acquiring the help of a funny, amnesiac blue tang. 13 years have passed and Pixar has managed to bring back most of our characters from the original and take us on another ride for relatively similar adventure. The biggest change here is unlike the predecessor which found Marlin and Dory searching for the young titular character, this one finds a new character in the Nemo's former position. And that is character is no one other than the lovable Dory, the fish suffering from her notorious short-term memory loss. Set one year after the events of the original, clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence) are home with the latter attending school and Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) being a helping hand with raising Nemo. Meanwhile, Dory is haunted by the memories of her family who she lost as a child, prompting her to set out to reunite with them. However, when she is unexpectedly kidnapped and placed in a Californian public aquarium, Marlin and Nemo was set out to rescue her.<br/><br/>When the original hit theaters back in the spring of 2003, Dory is by far the biggest show-stealer of the feature. Bringing on non-stop hilarity with her short-term memory loss and constantly being a burden to Marlin's search of his son due to her inability to remembering anything longer than a few seconds, why wouldn't it be a good idea to explore deep into the origins of this lovable character? This film opens with a long flashback of Dory as a young child with her parents, and how her parents coped with her short-term memory loss which is handled surprisingly well. Rather than establishing Dory as a source of utter annoyance, the story maturely handles her mental predicament as sympathy. Some time later, she finds herself separated from her parents and struggling vigorously to find them. Afterwards, the film jumps to the present with her living with Marlin and Nemo from the previous entry and that is when the story finally kicks off. Like the original film, her amnesia still lingers and is constantly struggling trying to memorize simple things longer than a matter of seconds. But as the adventure begins and the characters making fateful efforts on helping her reunite with her long-lost family, the film not ingeniously handles her amnesiac disorder with substance but effectively established Dory as a self-aware burden who knows her mental disability causes trouble. And this easily stands as one of the most emotional and heartfelt elements of the story. There is plenty of fun (including a ridiculous car chase at the end) and certainly plenty of laughs to be handed on this adventure. And as this is Pixar, the film also holds a fair share of touching moments, though it never reaches the level of being a tear-jerker like 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' series.<br/><br/>While we witness the return of our characters from the original entry (some of which are reserved for a post-credits scene), we also encounter a range of some new colorful characters along the way. First of which is Hank the Red Octupus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) who becomes a faithful companion for Dory on her wild adventure through the aquarium. Similarly to Dory, he provides a good share of laughter throughout his time on screen. Then there is some childhood friends of Dory including Destiny (voiced by Kaitlin Olsen) the Whale Shark and Bailey (voiced by Ty Burrell) the Beluga Whale who both become helping hands along the way. Idris Alba and Dominic West both provide the voices of sea lions who have a few good laughs but spend most of their time lying on a rock while hogging from a another sea lion in a comedic competition (they are not much help). Becky, a black-furred bird and piercing red eyes who doesn't provide much dialogue other than a series of loud squawks but also slips a few laughs for the kiddies. Each and every one the characters here are vastly likable and the film makes a rare surprise to providing a story without the presence of an actual villain (at least not in character form. With all great intentions, it works astoundingly well. And who can forget about the photo-realistic computer animation used to bring both the world and the characters to life.<br/><br/>Finding Dory is a heartwarming animated adventure that delivers a surprisingly touching continuation to Pixar's classic 2003 original. This film is a joyful sure to please both children and adults alike. Predictably so, it may be not endure as memorably as it's predecessor. Regardless, it doesn't have to be. Anyone who enjoyed the previous film is almost guaranteed to enjoy this one without a single noticeable flaw."
"Turfseer","8","0","7","4 January 2017"," Despite an overly talky Act I, Pixar's animated fish tale will charm you incessantly in Acts II and III
","Thirteen years ago Pixar released the mega-successful Finding Nemo starring two clownfish, Marlin and Nemo, with their buddy, a regal blue tang fish named Dory. Albert Brooks is back as Marlin and Ellen Degeneres again plays Dory, saddled throughout with short-term memory loss. Finding Dory amounts to a spin off of Finding Nemo, with Dory now playing the lead and Marlin and Nemo doing the honors as gracious sidekicks.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the Finding Dory narrative is the Act One machinations. The inciting incident involves Dory's separation from her parents who are part of an open ocean exhibit at a rehabilitative Marine Institute in California; after she's caught in an undertow Dory finds herself on the other side of the Pacific and is reunited with Marlin and Nemo.<br/><br/>Dory, with her short term memory loss, represents an opportunity not only to exploit comic possibilities but also to make an important point that parents who have children with developmental disabilities should never give up on them and continue to encourage whatever latent abilities to improve themselves, they might possess.<br/><br/>Dory's parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) are the prototypical nurturers who make periodic appearances in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. Despite all the approbation, Dory still suffers from lack of self-esteem, and it's only through her journey of self-discovery that she overcomes her self-deprecating self-absorption.<br/><br/>The scenarists perhaps at this juncture have made the mistake of explicating Dory's predicament ad infinitum, resulting in a lugubrious Act One, featuring much too much talk and little action. There's a nice little scene of a stingray migration, Dory, Marlin and Nemo hitching a ride on the back of a sea turtle taking them to California and perhaps the only scary moment for young children— an encounter with a menacing squid who puts a nice little scare into our determined protagonists.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it's the voice of Sigourney Weaver playing herself that signals the break into an exciting and much more gripping Act Two—here Weaver is the voice of the Marine Institute, where our fish heroes interact with a coterie of human characters devoted to creating obstacles which prevent Dory from both finding her parents and ultimately saving her best buddies, Marlin and Nemo.<br/><br/>When Dory is inadvertently twisted up in a six-pack ring, she's scooped up by staff members from the Marine Institute and tagged and sent to the quarantine section. There she's aided by the seven-legged octopus, Hank, who oddly derides ocean life and would prefer to live out the rest of his days in quarantine (in Cleveland of all places)—all Hank wants is Dory's tag and he agrees first to help her find her parents.<br/><br/>Dory ultimately learns that her fellow regal blue tangs are all in quarantine and probably hold the secret as to the fate of her parents. Along the way at one of the exhibits, Dory meets her childhood friend Destiny, a benign, near-sighted whale shark, and her companion, Bailey, a beluga whale who's been attempting to recover his powers of Echolocation after a purported head injury. Note that the two whales are as goofy as Dory and are another example of the intentionally designed non- threatening marine life, guaranteed not to scare away younger viewers.<br/><br/>Both Dory as well as Marlin and Nemo take circuitous routes to arrive back in quarantine. Hank, operating a runaway stroller with his tentacles through the Institute, is guided by Dory, who gives directions while ensconced in a fishbowl. They end up in the enormously clever children's ""Touch Pool,"" where they both are almost scooped up by ""possessed"" children, desperate for contact with the sedentary marine life in the pool beneath. Only Hank's sudden release of black ink flooding the pool, saves our protagonists from not accomplishing their ultimate objectives.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo have their set of allies who aid them in their quest to find Dory. The hilarious sea lions Fluke and Rudder end up summoning the disfigured loon, Becky, and are aided by the nerdy Gerald, who provides the pail for Becky to transport Marlin and Nemo into the innermost cave of the Institute. Once inside, Marlin and Nemo propel themselves out of a tank by hopping over columns of jet sprays. Once Dory, Marlin and Nemo are reunited, Dory faces the ""dark moment"" at the end of ACT 2—where she incorrectly comes to believe that her parents have died—after her encounter with her fellow regal blue tangs. Fortunately, the dire belief is short- lived, once Dory finds the shells her parents have left for her—now she has a joyous reunion with her parents who reveal they've waited for her this whole time. Note here Dory loses her self-pity and becomes self- actualized—now she must save Marlin and Nemo who are still stuck in the truck headed for Cleveland that has just left the Institute.<br/><br/>Despite their absurdity (and perhaps that's what makes it so enjoyable), the Act 3 machinations are very satisfying. How does Dory get the truck to stop so he and Hank can take command of it? Just have a bunch of very cute otters crawl up the side of the bridge, crawl out onto the highway, and stop traffic. How does the truck, pointed in the wrong direction, get back to the Institute? Just have Hank grab control of the steering wheel with Dory again providing directions, ensconced inside a fish bowl this time on the truck's dashboard! And finally dig the slow motion scene where the truck crashes through the railings, the back door flings open and all the fish fall back into the ocean.<br/><br/>Despite its slow start, Finding Dory morphs into an adorable animated action film for both adults and children. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks manage to finely provide the obligatory comic relief as well as important encouragement for parents and children who are dealing with the spectre of childhood developmental disabilities."

"atlasmb","7","0","3","1 December 2016"," Another Hit By Pixar
","First the negatives: 1) I found the first half hour of the film boring. 2) I have concerns that the film might be too scary for younger children, so ask others who have seen it first to determine if your child can enjoy it. 3) Some parts of the plot felt meandering. 4) Some aspects of the story felt like clichés (and very reminiscent of ""The Wizard of Oz""). Not every aspect of the story must be original, but this felt particularly derivative.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed the film after the first thirty minutes. I especially thought it picked up when the characters voiced by Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill (""Modern Family"" costars) entered the story,<br/><br/>Pixar's animation, as usual, is tremendous. Some of the sequences feel like ""Mission Impossible"" and they are rendered with inspiration.<br/><br/>Watch for Gerald, who steals the show during the brief scenes when he is on screen."

One more aspect that keeps your interest in the movie is that Dory suffers with memory loss, which marks for several twists all over the movie.<br/><br/>So, it is a feel good movie with interesting elements to watch for and will keep you and your kids glued to the movie screen."
"Tarx309","9","0","5","10 September 2016"," The sequel that everyone hoped for
","Finding Dory is an extremely delightful sequel to the 2003 classic animated film, Finding Nemo. Aside from the great Inside Out, I found Pixar's films to have lapsed slightly in quality in recent years, with films such as Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University not reaching the feats that Pixar has often reached. However Finding Dory is not only a welcome return to form for Pixar, but certainly one of Pixar's best movies to date. The story is strong, and thankfully is not just a rehash of the previous film. But what makes the film so memorable is the excellent characters and voice cast. Ellen DeGeneres is fantastic as Dory and hits every note very well; Albert Brooks as Marlin and Hayden Rolence as Nemo are both great also; and the entire cast of supporting actors (which includes Idris Elba, Dominic West, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Hader and Ty Burrell) are all very memorable in their own right - it is the characters that really make this film swim, and swim it does.<br/><br/>As you would expect from Pixar, the animation is top-notch as always. But what surprised me the most about this movie is how genuinely hilarious it is. The gags are non-stop throughout the film (which is something you cannot say for many modern comedies) - some of which are extremely funny, and the running jokes all work very well. It is also a surprisingly emotional film that almost had me crying at one point, and is a film that certainly has the same heart as the original did. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Finding Dory doesn't feel at all lazy or like a rehash - instead, it is original in its own right while still paying homage to its predecessor. It is hilarious, heartfelt, and has some of the best characters in modern animation. It is exactly what a sequel should be."
"Special-K88","Null","0","8","10 July 2016"," worth watching but feels recycled at times
","Only 'one year' after Finding Nemo, Pixar Studios dives back into the aquatic world in this fun but uneven follow-up. This time around the focus of the story is Dory, the amnesiac blue tang fish who has a sudden yearning for her missing family. With clownfish pals Marlin and Nemo in tow, she sets out blindly yet determined to reunite with the parents she once knew. Visual effects are impressive, clever gags are plentiful, and there are an assortment of new characters—including a slick, scheming octopus voiced to perfection by O'Neill—but there are some story lulls here and there, and it doesn't quite rise to the level of awe or heartwarming emotion as its predecessor. Still good fun, especially as it nears its frantic finale, but unlikely to make viewers forget the first film. **½"
"michaelhirakida","6","0","9","22 June 2016"," It's No Finding Nemo. But It Will Have To Do.
","I really enjoyed Finding Nemo, it was a great film about family and had a lot of heart wrenching moments and it was really funny and had some great characters. When I heard they were making a sequel, I was like ""Yeah. I think that could work."" <br/><br/>Before I go into the plot of the movie, I wanted to tell you what I thought the movie was going to be about and how it disappointed me from the first trailer they showed. I thought this was going to be about Dory of course, but I also thought they were going to make a movie that took place in Nemo's teen years and maybe how Marlin has to let go from Nemo as he is growing older but is still paranoid about the dangers in the ocean. That would have been a stronger story.<br/><br/>What do we get? Well, Dory has memories of her parents and gets help from Marlin and Nemo to find them. She gets captured and put into an aquarium and finds out her parents are there. Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo try to find a way to get her back.<br/><br/>The problem I have is that it takes one year after Finding Nemo. Which means Nemo hasn't grown up as much as I wanted to. This leads to uninteresting chemistry between father and son mainly because the two haven't changed at all from the first film. <br/><br/>Another problem I have is the characters. With movies like The Lego Movie, Big Hero 6, Kung Fu Panda 3, characters in animated movies have become more rich and diverse making them leave a permanent spot in everyone's hearts. <br/><br/>Hank was a character I didn't know I was supposed to like until he helps Dory try to evacuate the blue tang fish from a tank that is being loaded into a truck. His main plot point is that he wants to be in a permanent aquarium in Cleveland. This seems like an interesting plot point until Dory says No he can't because life happens by chance and is basically told to be in the ocean. <br/><br/>This is a big problem I have with this movie. Great plot points being tastelessly thrown away. There is a very great moment when Marlin and Nemo reunite with Dory. Nemo asks his dad if they have to say Goodbye to her if she finds her family and Marlin answers Yes. <br/><br/>Now this is the moment that made me angry. This could have been an emotionally powerful moment in the film if Dory did find her parents (Which she does) and would have to say her farewells. You know what does happen when she finds her parents?<br/><br/>They all go back to the Great Barrier Reef living happily ever after. <br/><br/>Wow. This is the most insulting thing Pixar has ever done. To have such a great piece of dialog, such a great piece of writing and emotion that could actually happen and be extremely powerful moment in the whole entire film RUINED by a crappy ending. Andrew Stanton, who I loved for making Finding Nemo and WALL-E, has created an ending that is a huge antithesis of Dory's story that is sugarcoated to the point of puking rainbows.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean I didn't like it, I thought the film was completely OK for a Pixar movie but it needed stronger story and characters. The climax is fun, Dory reuniting with her parents is a rewarding moment in the film, the animation if fine for the most part but is a huge downgrade when you see the 'Piper' short film before the feature presentation.<br/><br/>For fans of the first film who have been waiting for a long time to see this movie, you'll have to go in with lower expectations. The film is not nearly as emotional as the first and it feels almost more like an unintentional cash grab by Disney and Pixar. Kids will enjoy it fine but the movie lacks lots of things I wanted it to be.<br/><br/>64/100 C+"
