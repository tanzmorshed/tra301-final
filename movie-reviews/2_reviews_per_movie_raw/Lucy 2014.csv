"gogoschka-1","Null","532","765","4 August 2014"," An original take on the superhero movie; silly perhaps â€“ but great fun
","After the many scathing reviews, I went to this film with very mixed feelings. I certainly didn't expect serious Sci-Fi â€“ after all, I had seen the trailers â€“ but I actually wasn't quite sure what to expect (and I'm not sure I would have gone to see it at all, If it hadn't been directed by Luc Besson). Well, maybe it's just because I expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. 'Lucy' delivers a fast paced, crazy ride from start to finish, and I'm frankly a bit shocked so many people seem to hate this film with so much passion. Hadn't they seen the trailers? I thought it was clear from the get-go that this film was first and foremost meant as entertainment (and it certainly doesn't pretend to be the new '2001').<br/><br/>If 'Lucy' were based on a comic book, I highly doubt people would be criticising it as harshly as they are. Let's be honest: from a scientific point of view, the stories of Captain America, Superman, Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Spider Man and the X-Men are all enthusiastically silly. None of these stories are even remotely realistic - and they were never meant to be: that's why they call them ""SUPER-heroes"". So how come so many film fans take the ""10% of the brain"" premise so very, very seriously? I mean, this is Luc Besson: 'The Fifth Element' was just as over-the-top and most people seemed to have really enjoyed it (at least at the time; maybe now it would also get shredded to pieces for ""lack of realism""). The way I see it, 'Lucy' is simply Besson's take on the superhero movie (towards the end of the film, the title character actually comes across like a fun, female version of Dr Manhattan).<br/><br/>Granted, many aspects of 'Lucy' ARE very silly, but visually the film is absolutely stunning and it at least tries to tell an original story and throws in some very interesting philosophical (and yes: even scientific) concepts and questions. So not unlike the films based on Marvel or DC comics, this is a wild mix of Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Action elements â€“ and what's so wrong with that all of a sudden? If you watch it for what it is â€“ a fun, fast summer movie with inventive visuals â€“ I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. Quality-wise, this certainly isn't 'The Matrix' or 'Blade Runner', for sure (but hey: what is?), but 'Lucy' is still packed with enough creative ideas and great action scenes to get your money's worth. Plus it features Morgan Freeman and an absolutely gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>So my verdict: It's rare enough these days to get an original Fantasy/Sci-Fi tale with a decent budget in the first place â€“ let alone one for grown-ups with an R-rating. It may not be as good as it could have been (and it does feel a bit rushed), but it is very far from the catastrophic mess many critics make it out to be. As far as I'm concerned, 'Lucy' is a fun, crazy ride from start to finish. 7 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>In an ideal world, movies would be made without the aim for a certain rating.

"latinfineart","9","63","88","4 February 2018"," A spectacular film- visually stunning - very through provoking
","Unless you are nearly brain dead, you will find this film stimulating. If you are a sci-fi buff like me, even more so. A film like this reminds me of how starved some of us are for films of this sort. This film was brilliantly directed by the French Maestro. Beautifully acted, by Scarlotte Johansson. <br/><br/>While the transformation is happening, we see Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) giving a lecture on the capacity of the human brain. He says people generally use only about 10 percent of their brain's capacity. (Yes, it's an urban legend, but you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more if you ignore that fact and just go with it.) Norman, an authority in this field, has no idea his path will soon cross with Lucy's.<br/><br/>Lucy accidentally ingests the drug and her neurons begin firing. Her brain begins to grow ever-more powerful - so powerful that she's able to easily disarm any captor and figure a way out of any situation she's in. She needs someone who understands brain function to help her while a team is hot on the trail to dispense with her. The film moves at such a frantic pace and provides such mind-boggling visuals and fascinating concepts about time and existence that it's impossible not to be entertained. Besson also throws in some brief but exhilarating nature scenes to emphasize Lucy's vulnerability (at first) and then to expound upon what she is learning.<br/><br/>Somewhat improbably, it's also an ideal culmination of a sci-fi trilogy Johansson may not have even realized she was making. In Her, Under the Skin and now Lucy, the 29-year-old veteran has not only delivered some of the finest work of her career, she's found a trio of characters in conversation about what it means to be human through the eyes of an outsider, be it artificial intelligence, alien or an accidental superhuman. In fact, it's near impossible to imagine Lucy without Johansson and her perfectly calibrated performance, a crucial component to investing in the story's inherent silliness.<br/><br/>The action was a little over the top at times. The Chinese gangsters were perhaps a metaphor for the Chinese Politburo. Perhaps the world's ultimate criminal organization, that will stop at nothing to achieve it's ends. <br/><br/>What you'll find here, is a well-crafted science fiction yarn that might make you think more than you bargained for while you enjoy the shoot-ups and vehicle crashes."
"facorread","10","481","741","24 November 2014"," This is a complete myth! The fun part is: What if it was true?
","This film has greatly polarized critics for its use of controversial concepts. I am a scientist and of course this movie gives me mixed feelings about its science. But I'm sure about one thing, that this is fiction. I am able to watch a fiction movie, am I not?<br/><br/>Some people review this film negatively for its scientific value, ignoring the fact that this isn't a documentary. What are these guys comparing this film against? There is no comparison against real-world science here. If somebody makes a film about black holes, I expect it to be faithful to the latest research about black holes. If somebody makes a film about the Sun, I expect it to be faithful to what we know about the Sun. In contrast, a film about aliens can stretch our suspension of disbelief a lot more, because we know no real aliens to compare it about. And my my, how wide a range of alien species has been spawned by the film industry in all its years! The main concept in this film is equally flexible because it has been proved a myth years ago. Everybody knows that, director/writer Besson knows that. These negative reviewers miss the entertainment value of this film because of something they were expecting (harmony to actual science) that was never there since the film's inception.<br/><br/>So yes, some other people review this film for its entertainment value, because we want to enjoy this ""What if this myth was true"" scenario. And we are truly entertained. I loved how Scarlett Johansson developed her character very well even when there was inherently not much to begin with: an innocent girl with not further background than dating some guy for a week and living in a shared apartment. Scarlett's charisma, weakness, strength, and acting spill all over the place, even during the most flat scenes of the film, even during the most VFX-packed scenes of the film. Morgan Freeman is... well, Morgan Freeman. Fantastic actor except for the fact that he's been typecast into the wise guy role for like, 20 years. I like the ethnic diversity in such a small cast. Not that they are trying to showcase it anyway, but it's a nice touch.<br/><br/>The action pack is very good, the mafia pack is entertaining, and the renditions of Inception, LÃ©on: The Professional, and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all cherished. Once again, the central myth is developed in a very fun way. I believe this film has risked a lot in its development, but for us who want to be entertained and have our imaginations opened, this film delivers very vividly."

","F*** this IMDb rating. I haven't been this entertained in 90 minutes since Pan's Labyrinth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets 8 stars, and everyone is attacking the science of this film... f*** off. This movie is fantastically cool.<br/><br/>Remember, critics and joes thought Boondock Saints, Donnie Darko, and Star Wars blew... yeah. Watch it for yourself. If you're a Luc Besson fan, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan ""the man"" Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do it. <br/><br/>What happened to people that used to enjoy movies?"
"rwmitchem","10","11","13","6 June 2020"," 1 Star people are ignorant
","Did the title get you here? Good. This is important. No movie deserves 1 star.
Perhaps if someone were to film dog poop with their 2009 cell phone and shake the phone excessively every other minute, then maybe that movie would deserve 1 star. Maybe.
People that give films 1 star are being intellectually dishonest. If a movie has a premise, which Lucy does, and it has a decent flow of a story line, and it does, then it's already achieved more than 1 star.
One review on this app the person said that they hadn't seen the movie, but gave it one star because people use 100% of their brains. Well it's obvious this person has never seen other sci-fi films. There is no such thing as a Wookie, lightsabers or fast than light travel. You know, fiction.
Seriously, people that give one 1 star reviews don't deserve the technology they used to write the review."
"gnanag","9","168","272","6 October 2014"," Unusual, interesting and highly entertaining
","Normally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from what people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion. Because of the bad reviews I didn't expect anything at all. In fact, I expected a killer heroine who would beat her adversaries to pulp. However, I got an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically, but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold. So if you don't break into tears because the movie operates on ridiculous scientific premises, watch it and have fun. It's different, it's interesting and its extremely entertaining."
"porlean","8","252","418","27 November 2014"," Not a Documentary!!!!
","Check the genre of this movie, it says SCI-FI, which stands for science FICTION!! If I watched every sci-fi movie expecting it to correlate with real life physics then there would be no point of the genre. All these bad reviewers seem to be on the more intelligent end of the pole but isn't cognitive enough to realize they're NOT watching a documentary!!!! This is a good sci-fi movie, which kind of lets you imagine what you could do if you knew everything and could do anything. Obviously It's not possible because you would have to break the laws of physics to even get near that point but it's still good to wonder. Worth a watch if you like the genre."
"bobbymcgonigle13","4","474","820","30 September 2014"," Starts well, finishes poorly
","Disappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The situation the main character found herself in had an array of extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in. If you're a fan of logical ""what ifs"" like myself I would not recommend it."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","235","400","4 October 2014"," Lucy took the drugs, Luc Besson got high...
","Obviously the main purpose of Luc Besson with this was initially to please the audience. The poor scared girl who takes revenge on the bad guys that hurt her. But with the ridiculous premise ""what can we do if we acquire the 100% of functionality of our brain"" the movie tries to be philosophical and ...fails miserably. What is the meaning of life? The purpose of humans?<br/><br/>The problem is that Luc Besson's brain isn't capable to provide such answers.<br/><br/>When Lucy's brain is at 20% she's starting to control ...tv signals! It's obvious that the writer will hit a wall by his own brain limitations. At 30-40% she has telepathic and telekinetic powers. Later she travels back in...time, and the way she controls it is with...swipe move as in a smartphone! What else is there? The writer couldn't think of anything else! <br/><br/>I am everywhere! It's now a clichÃ© since Edgar in ""electric dreams"". Johnny Depp has done it too! Well good for you."
"j-c-johnson","10","64","101","12 January 2016"," Much more than meets the eye....
","It amazes me how many negative reviews this movie has gotten when its core, its message, is so giant.<br/><br/>I love this movie. Then again, I'm thinking of it in conjunction with The Secret, the book Conversations With God, and my own crazy experiences.<br/><br/>God = a giant being who was, is, and ever shall be, trying to become conscious of Himself.<br/><br/>Humans = each tiny piece God broke off of Himself to create our individual selves.<br/><br/>Lucy = one piece of God (think = SOUL) that happened to have an opportunity to become conscious of itself.<br/><br/>The end is Lucy breaking apart into billions of pieces because the physical no longer mattered. It was her essence... which is why she was able to be everywhere, like God.<br/><br/>I can't believe no one gets this. Look into quantum physics, even just watch The Secret. All we are is energy. If we take this concept to the extreme and to fiction, Lucy is what we get!<br/><br/>I LOVE this movie. BTW.<br/><br/>Then again I think deeply and on a big picture basis, so hopefully all these negative reviewers read this and feel like morons... because they are.<br/><br/>It's not meant to ""just"" be a movie. You really think Morgan Freeman would've signed up for this if it didn't have some deeper meaning? Look at his track record!!! Come on, people, use that gray mass between your ears!!!<br/><br/>Just saying. I love this movie. From a non-science, non-pop culture perspective. I love this movie from a transcendent perspective. The kind of POV that allows you to believe that nothing is a coincidence.<br/><br/>=)"
"sonekken","8","310","542","6 October 2014"," A mix of science and fiction?
","I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their humanity and become real Gods.<br/><br/>Enjoy this film and let your mind explore the impossible."
"swordsnare","7","13","17","22 March 2020"," Luc Besson's 'Lucy'.
","I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.<br/><br/>Note: It's probably best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls, who create accounts to downvote and spread negativity. If you don't have some constructive criticism, don't say anything at all. Any 'Not helpful' downvotes on this review are probably by the aforementioned."
"mdcmdaw","10","59","95","13 October 2015"," Extremely well done
","We watched LUCY about on DVD February this year. I usually don't like the typical shoot- them-up or speculative-futuristic or robotic movies, they turn me off because they are predictable and way over the deep-end of ridiculousness in their violence, special effects, contradictions and same-old-same-old tin spaceships, weaponry galore, and silly story; like the script and story were just thrown together for the sake of selling something at the box office or TV. LUCY, is excellent, credible beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting, good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY. My husband and I often have different likes and opinions but our differences came together in appreciation of LUCY."

"andre-madsen1","3","249","450","18 September 2014"," I F*ng love science
","Scarlett Johansson proves beyond a doubt that she is able to carry the lead actress role in this sci-fi action flick. The camera work and narrative ambiance starts off marvelously. But around twenty minutes into the movie everything starts falling apart as relentless and repetitive force-feeding of pseudo-scientific and underdeveloped philosophical gibberish is applied in a sad attempt to legitimize the developing story line. If you manage to swallow the entirety these factual misnomers you may suffer from having no education or sense of rational thought and may also be eligible to blissfully enjoy the ensuing turn of events. <br/><br/>Have you ever felt at risk of becoming dumber by the process of watching a movie? I regularly enjoy movies that violate laws of physics. However, it is imperative that the movie's setting allows for that to happen. Lucy doesn't. The parallel story line employs Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) as the scientific genius alibi. If you pay attention to his ""lectures"" you may notice this is not science class but rather something at the crossroads of a pseudoscience, scientology and self-motivational course. At this point I should probably disclaim that I am a molecular biologist by profession and proceed to tell you that I was genuinely outraged by the audacious amounts of ignorance displayed throughout this movie. <br/><br/>Sitting at the theater this evening, my brain leapt in and out of sync with the movie due to the constant realism glitches occurring under false pretenses. For some reason I kept thinking of ""The Doors of Perception"" by Aldous Huxley in which he subjectively describes the immediate psychological effects upon ingesting mescaline and LSD. Such psychoactive and hallucinogenic drugs actually work by switching on cerebral neuronal pathways that by default (and apparently by good rights) are switched off. This goes to prove the point that cerebral activity in no way correlates with attainment of super-human powers.<br/><br/>The pharmacological effects that the fictional drug in the movie exerts on Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is irreconcilable with everything in medicine and the story line is shamelessly based on these discrepancies set in action as visualized by unlimited CGI artistic freedom: Wouldn't the sensation of pain be expected to be augmented to excruciating levels following a proposed 1000% increase of cerebral activity? Care to elaborate on the accompanying moral deprivation that makes it OK to kill or help people entirely on random, but first and foremost makes her really narcissistic and sadistic? If Einstein dropped his pen, wouldn't it still fall to the ground; Why shouldn't laws of physics apply to someone who is allegedly more intelligent or aware? How can increased intelligence allow Lucy â€“ possessing no prior concepts of cell biology or drug metabolismâ€“ to figure out what is happening to her in such detail? Why were the internment mafia thugs specifically instructed not to kick Lucy in the lower abdomen, considering the surgical procedure that had just been performed for the sole purpose of drug trafficking? How can Lucy possibly benchmark her cerebral capacity as a percentage? How can the final scenes of the movie where Lucy ad libitum creates matter and baffles the professorial board with some senselessly uttered line of thought be justified in any conceivable way? Omnipotence, dinosaurs and a black hole USB flash drive to top it off: are you serious?<br/><br/>The movie clearly begs the question: what is human and which aspects and ideals of human nature are worth cultivating. But how can you honestly care at this point as you contemplate whether to risk a cerebral meltdown or run for the closest theater exit?"

However it seems he clearly failed his basic science education at school.<br/><br/>There so so much wrong with the science in the film, and I'm no scientist! I enjoy reading about science and have retained much of my science education from school and right from the start when it was mentioned ""what if you could use more than 10% of your brain?"" .. I assumed that would get corrected a few moments later... not be the premise and explanation for all of Lucy's abilities.<br/><br/>Luc Besson seems to think having higher brain functionality allow you to time travel?<br/><br/>To be clear. The whole ""10% of your brain"" argument has been refuted many times and is decades old. 12 years ago when I was at school we were taught how this statement was total BS. Seems Luc Besson didn't get the memo and no one thought to tell him before he started the film.<br/><br/>None of the characters have any depth either. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, standard 'I speak slowly and deeply which means anything I say appears profound'. Scarlet Johansons does nothing to make anyone connect with her character.<br/><br/>The drug they are transporting at it's current state would be legal...

Lucy knows everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%. Telekinesis?

","The danger with beliefs is not you're going to hold wrong beliefs, it's that you hold beliefs at all. Therefore, when you fill your mind with a lot of ideas about what's true or what's false that than obviates the searching for deep direct experiences. You're not willing to let go because you're stuck in a paradigm lock. People like to think that they can represent reality with ideas without recognising their ideas are apart of reality. There are limits on what you can represent with ideas. Representation is not the real thing and as simple as it sounds a lot of highly intelligent people forget this. That's where a lot of stuff goes wrong because if reality was simple and not complex, and reality was intuitive and not counterintuitive than this strategy might work. Except, what humanity has discovered time and time and time and time and time again is that reality does not work in the way we assume. Reality is filled with very weird paradoxes and facts that are completely contrary to anything we assume and that many of our speculations that this is contrary to direct experience. Your speculation about reality are always suspect and could always be overruled by direct experience. The movie isn't perfect but it tries to open your mind to new possibilities."

","It was a moment of utter spontaneity when I decided to purchase a ticket to see 'Lucy', and wow - I am certainly glad I did. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. At the beginning, I thought that perhaps it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. However, as it progressed the storyline became more and more fascinating. In my opinion this film had the perfect balance of realism and sci-fi. Some of the effects were of course slightly questionable... but I cannot really complain because the overall brilliance of this film outshone any negatives I could detect.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson was incredible as Lucy and it was astonishing to observe how her character changed so dramatically within just a few moments. Johansson definitely nailed the smart-girl/genius/superhero role, although I do think this role may have suited an actress like Rooney Mara absolutely perfectly. Johansson is just so womanly, attractive and feminine that I found it difficult to completely accept her as Lucy. Perhaps that's just me bring too picky - I just feel that Lucy could have been better portrayed by someone slightly more masculine and cold.<br/><br/>This film is one that will genuinely inspire you to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I left the cinema feeling like I had been given a new kick of energy and a punch of enthusiasm for personal growth and exploration. This film will also encourage you to consider the endless possibilities of technology and science. It will leave your heart pound if and your brain buzzing. Overall, this is a definite must-see for all action/sci-fi lovers as well as those who have an interest in humanity, history and the incredible gift that is life. You will not at all regret purchasing a ticket to see this, and as long as you keep an open mind, you will find this film to be extremely thought-provoking and clever."

","People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false. Call me a killjoy, but I find it hard to accept movies that are based on an utterly anti-scientific premise. In fact, I find promoting blatant falsehoods that promote anti-evolutionary thinking a bit irresponsible, even for the sake of art and entertainment!<br/><br/>Science education set aside, how does LUCY work as a movie? Well, Scarlett Johansson is convincingly awkward and beautiful. Luc Besson's obsession with strong mysterious female leads clearly shines through and Johansson as an actor delivers. The movie is hyper-stylish, with gleaming colors and convincing CGI (lots of). The action is as entertaining as the visuals. And thankfully they decided to keep things short, focus on the core idea and stop right before it became trite.<br/><br/>That said, I think LIMITLESS dealt with the 10% myth better as it stayed (somewhat) more within the realm of scientific credibility. And as far as movies go in which people develop godlike powers, LUCY doesn't beat the likes of THE MATRIX or SYMBOL (shimboru,2009).<br/><br/>All in all an interesting but ultimately mediocre movie based on an utterly ridiculous (and intellectually dangerous) idea."

"Biologistud2","1","136","274","4 October 2014"," Worse than anyone could have imagined
","Let me start off by saying, I usually like this type of movie. I don't mind movies where the girl kicks ass, even when it is entirely unrealistic. If the girl also happens to be hot, then it's even better. Here we have Scarlett Johansson, one of the hottest women of all time, looks promising right? But everything that could possible go wrong, goes wrong here. <br/><br/>1. Scarlett Johansson does not look her best in this movie. The changing looks, the futuristic makeup and everything just fails completely. The fact that she transforms into an emotionally void cyborg also means that she becomes entirely unrelatable for the audience. For 90% of the movie she conveys the same blank facial expression. Kind of like Will Smith in After Earth. <br/><br/>2. The special effects are lackluster and sluggish. I have been waiting for a movie about a woman with superpowers, able to do anything she wants, but what does she do: She uses telekinesis to levitate a bunch of goons, she pushes a cop to another seat of a car, she stops bullets in mid-air, and...that's pretty much it. <br/><br/>3. The plot. Besides the premise of being utterly false, the movie keeps conveying false information and misdirection. As a biologist, the portrayal of evolution in this movie is worse than what any Christian fundamentalist could do. Every 10 minutes a full screen notice of 10%-20%-30%...appears, just to let us know exactly how far along she is. This is actually good, because we have no other means of knowing. It's not like her abilities improve. In fact, after 40% she does not use her abilities at all. <br/><br/>4. Artistically this movie keeps making cut scenes to completely random images and sequences, that should be used to associate with what occurs in the actual film. But this just adds an element of ""weird for the sake of weird"", and it just makes it more confusing and frustrating to watch.<br/><br/>5. The climax or rather anticlimax of the movie is what topped it off as the worst movie I have seen at the cinema. Spoiler!!! In the end, after she goes 100%, she turns herself into a USB drive for Morgan Freeman, and then the movie ends! <br/><br/>It is completely ridiculous, and so underwhelming. The acting is bad and with no impact, the action is boring and clumsy, the plot makes no sense, and the ending is so under the top silly that it doesn't even make the movie ""so bad that it's good"". While I have seen worse movies before (not many), I have never seen worse movies at the cinema. I did not expect anything good, but to have it be that much worse...I was so disappointed by this, and I thought I had set the bar so low as to prevent this. I thought I would just see a mindless action flick, where a hot girl got to kick ass. This...was absolute rubbish."

They tried to interject some scientific narrative in between with an academic backdrop as if that will lend it some credence, but it falls awfully short. Some of the effects are so wild and unexplained they might belong in a Hulk movie. Johannsen's performance is mediocre, she could easily have been replaced by any average actress. She has one part where she talks to her mom and some emoting is needed, but like the rest of the movie it just comes across as plainly artificial.

"matthewssilverhammer","8","34","68","2 August 2014"," Scifi Action Thriller that Delivers
","Lucy is a Bourne Identity meets Kill Bill meets Limitless romp auteured by Luc Besson, the man behind classics like Leon the Professional and La Femme Nikita. In one of the stranger wide releases in years, there is much reward given to those willing to give Lucy grace (ridiculous premise and over-the-top aspirations). It's flawed, but it's a brightly filmed and darkly themed scifi action thriller that delivers. Lucy posits the debatable notion that humans only use 10% brain capacity. Johansson plays the title character that goes from monotony to superhero when a new drug gives her the ability to use 100% of her brains power. Her capabilities aren't just big math problems and fast reading, but telekinesis, shape shifting and other comic-booky things. It's a fascinating if overly ambitious premise that Besson puts to great use, playing it out like a briskly paced, inventive TV pilot. The scifi is strong, with theories and declarations posited throughout and thematic exposition that works. The shining element here is Johansson, who continues her upward trajectory in a bombastic yet effective performance. Her progression from a nobody to the most powerful femme fatale in history is emotional, funny and relatively believable. It's great to see Besson bounce back after The Family to present what may be his magnum opus, touching on all of time and creation in under 90 minutes. Sure, some of the effects are cheap and goofy, but the editing is unique and tight, the violence and style are lively, and the storytelling is refreshing. Engaging and cool, Lucy is highly stylized scifi pulp of the highest order."

","I thought the commercials on TV for this made it look pretty good. When the reviews came in, I sort of lowered my expectations. Nothing could prepare me for how bad this truly was. From the beginning, it seems like the director is intent on overwhelming us with transitions and cuts from the present to all of these ""evolution"" shots that, instead of feeling creative or intellectual, just feel incredibly stupid. And I'm not one to throw the word ""stupid"" around, but... I don't know how else to describe how obnoxious and annoying I found the film from the get go. I don't care how scientifically accurate this is, no. I just care that the dialogue and directing really range from mediocre to atrocious. There are a few decent scenes, but few and far in between. The car chase is an example, like if it was a scene taken from another actually-decent action flick. I will say that the second half is at least a bit better than the first.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson has been on a roll lately, and I'm a fan of her. But the reason it took me so long to warm up to her is because while I generally like her very much in her more subdued, quiet or more natural roles (Lost in Translation, Under the Skin) she has the tendency to just not be as convincing in more melodramatic, showier roles. Oh yes, she's pretty bad once her character here gets her powers, totally unconvincing at playing the emotionless aspect. She's supposed to play Lucy as if she has no emotions, but instead it comes across as her trying desperately to convince us that she has no emotions. But before Lucy gets her powers, she's also pretty bad, totally unconvincing and probably more laughably bad when she's trying to play a woman with fear for her life. What a misfire of a performance, although the girl tries hard enough and isn't nearly as obnoxious and as downright ugly as the film around her."
"chuck-526","8","44","92","2 August 2014"," ""the best of"" kick-ass (maybe straight-ahead, but maybe tongue-in-cheek)
","""Lucy"" is worth seeing on the big screen. Probably it's a straight-ahead ""summer"" movie which could be (awkwardly) categorized as an action thriller ...or maybe it's an attempt to break new ground ...or maybe it's a massive tongue-in-cheek send-up of current multiplex fare. Although it has sci-fi elements, focusing too much on the sci-fi aspect will be disappointing. It's a bit more thoughtful than most ""action thrillers"", but just a bit; certainly it's not something to look forward to sinking your intellectual teeth into.<br/><br/>It's reminiscent of many other films. Some that come to mind are ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Tron"" (the original one), ""Chunking Express"" (the first half), ""Baraka"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Tree of Life"" (the abstract part), and ""Home"". Originality isn't the point - taking good ideas (sometimes even actual footage) from lots of places and pushing them even further is.<br/><br/>Before going on, let me directly address the premise that ""we only use 10% of our brains"". In a completely objective world, this idea would be no sillier than the idea of telepathically controlling a suit of armor which projects force fields. But, probably because of the history of the 10% idea, right now many people recoil from it. Don't. Leave your scientific/analytic hat at home. If you insist on getting hung up on the ""un-reality"" of the 10% idea, you're certain to not enjoy this film. (The film even jokes a bit with this idea, labeling a U.S. college student studying abroad as using not ""10%"" of her brain power but only ""1%"":-) <br/><br/>I understand why many professional reviews are tepid. The science is somewhere between implausible and laughable. The philosophy is sophomoric. And the ending can feel unsatisfying, even abrupt. That's partly because the logic motivating the sequence of events, even though actually quite simplistic, can be hard to follow on the first viewing. And it's partly because it's pretty hard to ratchet the ""climax"" even higher when the volume has already been up all the way to 10 for so long. In other words, judged only by small-screen criteria, the movie is indeed mediocre. It doesn't help either that the movie doesn't fit all that neatly into any existing ""genre"", so professional reviewers are uncertain what to do with it.<br/><br/>The acting is first-rate. It's not just pretty faces; the characters are engrossing. The main character's development from quite emotional at the beginning to completely flat at the end comes through very well. It might sound like a downer that for the lead role Angelina Jolie was replaced by Scarlett Johansson. In fact it was most likely an improvement. One's reaction to Jolie kicking ass might have been ""again?"", but when Johansson kicks ass one really sits up and takes notice. The technical aspects of the shooting must have been outrageous: there are some outdoor scenes that appear to move far beyond any imaginable boundaries of a ""location"" or ""set""; some perspective shots that make you think you're either flying or high; there's excellent wire work where you'd never expect it; and it's quite difficult to separate what's a stunt, an in-camera trick., compositing, CGI-enhanced, or full CGI (for example the outrageous car crashes that you would think must be CGI are in fact stunts). <br/><br/>But where the movie really shines is as a visual spectacle (or perhaps as a primo example of ""style""). Go with the same mindset you'd use to watch a movie with cartoon characters in a cartoon story. Hang loose. And just let the images wash over you.<br/><br/>There's some of the best nature photography I've seen. There's plenty of blood and gun-fu and random deaths (but that's not the whole movie). The extended car chase scene is the wildest I've ever seen bar none. There's simulated micro-photography (things like cells dividing). And there's simulated macro-photography (things like interplanetary nebulae). There are shots inside airplanes that quickly switch from things you've always dreamed of to matter disintegration. There's improbable mixing of different contexts (for example a woman in a black dress sitting in an office chair, which in turn is hovering on the surface of a swamp). There's an epic battle inside the Sorbonne. There's wide scenic vistas. There are famous landmarks. Time sometimes speeds up, and sometimes slows down, and sometimes runs backward, showing us both fully realized cityscapes a hundred years ago and the birth of the earth and moon. And so much more. And the extremely rapid editing shoehorns all of it into less than two hours.<br/><br/>I admit I had to see it twice to fully grasp it. The first time the story was a bit jumbled, and just letting all the fantastic images wash over me was everything. The second time though the story was fully coherent (if rather simplistic). My suggestions are to use all the movie and TV reading skills you've got, and to not look too deeply for a complex story or philosophy. And if you still don't ""get"" the story, don't worry about it, just sit back and enjoy the visuals."

Ushered swiftly into experiences I thought I knew, only to have revealed to me some new thought, or philosophical idea that I was heretofore unaware of. ""Lucy"" does this honestly and smart. At times I found myself enthralled by the ""Koyaanisqatsi""-like images - here used as a device for squeezing more tension out of a scene - not just for their intrinsic, artistic value. ""Lucy"" is blessed with musical scoring so subtle and powerful that, at times, I was unaware that I was breathing with the tempo of the film.<br/><br/>You will watch it. You will discuss it.

","We went to see this movie last night with a few friends. I was expecting some action super heroine flick - the trailer did look very much like a simple super heroine movie which was more than inspired of the great movie ""Limitless"" from a few years back.<br/><br/>I've always liked Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman and I was looking forward to seeing the movie.<br/><br/>--------------SPOILER ALERT!---------------------<br/><br/>When we emerged 1½ hours later we were stunned. Not because it was so good, so clever or so well acted. It was because it was utter stupidity. The brain theory has been declined loads of times and none of the gibberish in this movie made me feel any smarter - actually I felt my IQ dimming a bit. It's not that I'm not clever enough to follow philosophy - it's more that I'm not dumb enough to act the sheep to this shepherd.<br/><br/>The story goes from simple super hero origin story to utter madness and though I can see some elements of his former glory in this movie (Leeloo's way of not fitting into this world is depicted quite well as Lucy gets more and more inhuman), I can also see a Luc Besson with no honest person beside him to call him on his BS. <br/><br/>Lucy doesn't go for the drug dealers - she is gathering the drugs for research (and consumption). The one time she comes close to the boss and has him at her mercy, she let's him go? Though she knows first hand how dangerous he is.<br/><br/>There's plot holes galore in the mad movie and I hate that I actually spent money on this!"

","This is truly the worst movie i have ever seen. Unlike many of the critics here, I was expecting this kind of a flic from Besson. After The Big Blue and Leon he did not really produce/write/direct anything but movies with weak plots and imitated special effects. (ex.The Fifth Element? What did it really talk about? Does anyone remember?)<br/><br/>I will not even bother to write about the philosophical approach that the movie is based on. I believe that any idea (no matter if it has a scientific basis or not) can be communicated with a fine structure and built-up. This movie does not have that at all. It does not deserve an intellectual analysis. (I mean, really? 3 years after Limitless, having the very exact idea, but not saying anything new? Not even handling it as good as Neil Burger did?)<br/><br/>Taking the philosophical dimension aside, was it fun to watch or OK for an action/superhero/whatever movie? Not at all. In terms of special effects, digitalized images and action scenes, Lucy is boring, underdeveloped, inconsistent and clearly a cheap imitation of the 2000s (and even 90s) action/sci-fi etc movies. <br/><br/>A waste of time and money."

Talking about how if we could use 20%, we could completely control our bodies. If we could use 30%, we can control other people. Then 40%, was matter. What?? Your telling me, that through various electrical impulses in my brain firing all at once, that I can manipulate the world around me telekinetically in anyway I see fit? Does this guy have any grasp on the world he lives in whatsoever?? It's like Luc Besson was smashed on Ketamine and stuck in a K-Hole and in this hole decided to write a film.<br/><br/>But He pushes it...even *further*. Scarlett eventually can control TIME ITSELF. In fact, she manipulates TIME like an iPad. Umm.... What?? Swiping the air back and forward in front of you will control TIME??<br/><br/>ARE YOU KIDDING ME.<br/><br/>It amazes me that this film got commissioned. 40 million dollars?? 40 MILLION DOLLARS?? What the hell. Does that make any sense to you? There are hundreds of thousands of brilliantly capable film writers out there and this guy, LUC BESSON gets 40mil to write and direct this?<br/><br/>Alright. It's a crap film, no doubt. The writing is terrible, the acting is boring and bad, and the directing is AWFUL too. The one saving grace with this film is the CGI. Whoever the CGI artist / studio was for this film did a good job. It was very good (apart from the dinosaur actually, that wasn't amazing - sorry guys).

"caviiar","10","33","69","13 August 2014"," Excellent Sci-Fi Movie
","This movie truly is a masterpiece of science fiction, that is, it fictionalizes what happens if the limits of science are expanded. And it does that at a carefully measured pace. I was surprised that many ""critics"" (i.e. parasites of opinion that compete for the meanest words to retain readers) point quickly to the inaccuracy of the science behind Lucy, but they do not care to point to the physical impossibility of let say Captain America. <br/><br/>This is not your average Marvel movie... it is much better. There is the sexy girl, the exciting action scenes, and some profound questions without trying to give mystical answers. You can just sit down, relax, and enjoy an action sci-fi flick that is outside the predictable and formulaic Hollywood bunch (some of which I also enjoy greatly). This movie is a refreshing view on an old topic. There are many cultural references in this movie (to movies, arts, science, the crown of french archaeological findings, etc.) that you might miss if you do not pay enough attention; even if you do, you need to have vast knowledge to pick them all up. I am sure I missed many. For example, there is an elegant reference to Michelangelo's ""The Creation of Adam"", and another clever fundamental scene with Lucy drinking water happens in what looks like Gorges de l'Ardèche, where the Cahuvet Cave guards the oldest human paintings. Pay attention to the statue destroyed at the University. Perhaps many references are unintentional, and simply reflect the spirit of our time. In any case, Lucy takes you on a ride that will last long after the lights are back on. LUCY IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

"xblackstarrx","2","32","67","27 July 2014"," Plot holes and weak attempts at profundity utterly destroyed this film.
","As a forewarning, this review contains spoilers, so be aware. <br/><br/>I went into Lucy without significant expectations. While I was aware that the science the film is based on has been thoroughly debunked, I was willing to suspend disbelief in order to appreciate the speculative, science-fictional nature of it. For a variety of reasons, this film spectacularly failed to interest me, much less impress me. It shattered what minimal expectations I did have and left me feeling repelled and disappointed. <br/><br/>Firstly, I had trouble stomaching the constant striving for profundity that Lucy as a film attempted. It was as though the film was made to be thought-provoking and deep, yet the statements made, the understandings expressed, were so basic and superficial as to seem almost patronizing. At one point Lucy states that humans have dumbed down the workings of reality and the universe in order to comprehend it. It was framed so that it sounded like a significant revelation, as though it had never been understood before. But isn't that blatantly obvious? We're human. We have limitations. And pointing out those limitations does not a profound statement make.<br/><br/>Another significant problem I had with the film was the character of Lucy as a whole, and the significant plot holes that cropped up because of her godly abilities. While I appreciate the reasons for making her become a seemingly emotionless robot of a person, I can't find it in myself to be interested in a character who can do anything with impunity. From the time that she is on the flight to Paris, the film could have lasted 10 or 15 minutes and eliminated all the plot holes and senseless developments. She could have landed in Paris and collected the drug while outright killing the gangsters instead of just suspending them in midair while she collected the drugs for whatever reason (hint: it was just to manufacture drama and a weak, violent climax.) <br/><br/>When she is at the college with Professor Norman and the other professors, she asks Pierre Del Rio (the French law enforcement guy) to secure the area, because she needed to concentrate on what she was doing. By this time, I believe she was already at 50 or 60% capacity, and was able to control and manipulate multiple people at once, create invisible walls, and physically see and manipulate information. Why, then, did she not just dispose of the interference herself? Why was being able to focus a concern for her? Surely if she was able to do all those amazing things, she was also capable of multitasking. <br/><br/>The very beginning of the film up until Lucy is exposed to the drug is alright- Scarlett Johansson's acting is solid, and the scenes flow well. Judging by the first 15 minutes, it's decent, so it's doubly unfortunate that the film takes such a nose dive later on.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think Lucy had potential, but not very much. It's a very difficult task to take a character, give them the powers of a god, and then expect a very human plot to seem realistic, much less compelling. I can appreciate the attempt to tell such a story, but it was horribly executed and I would not see the film again."

","People saying this is an original movie probably never watched Limitless ( 2011 ).... But that's not all whats wrong with this movie. So lets start. 1. Lucy is a ripoff of Limitless, same idea ( drug that makes you smart/powerful ) just has more action but without a good plot. 2. Humans using 10% of the brain? No, really that has been proved wrong decades ago, but i guess without that you don't have scenario for a movie. 3. As I said there is no plot in the movie, except the part that a bimbo was turned into a ""superhero "" and she has some limited amount of time do give us the knowledge that can save us or its gone for good. 4. Morgan Freeman, as much as good actor he really is, his role in this movie isn't that good considering he isn't a lead actor, to make this movie better. 5. If she was aware of whats going to happen to her, that she will turn into energy capable of communicating to humans, why would she rush to save knowledge inside her brain? 6.

","One star reviews are usually hyperbole. Usually they are people joking about how bad a movie is. I am not joking. And I am also astonished that I am the only written review so far.<br/><br/>This movies is one of the worst scripts i have ever had to endure. And believe me, ""endure"" is the correct word. It is a test for withstanding abuse. Scarlett's character makes no sense. OK, she unlocks hidden potential? I don't mind that. its very reminiscent (and eventually blatantly rips off) a favorite movie of mine called Akira. She gains power and becomes the ultimate. But no, alas, there is no development. She gets a dose of pre-natal blue rock candy and instantly changes in personality.<br/><br/>This would have been wonderful: She suddenly has powers, but is unable or afraid to use them because she is still a meek person. As she becomes more powerful, she becomes less human. It's a no brainer of story, but nope! None of this ""development"" crap!<br/><br/>Other than that, the script is 70% unintelligible techno-babble that doesn't even try to come across as intelligent. The remaining 30%? Over-done, seen it 100 times before attempts and bad-assery. The villains lack any motivation for their actions after the first 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The acting is, after the first 15 minutes, equally appalling. I usually like Scarlett Johansen. She is a wooden board here. Not that she as anything to work with. I LOVE Morgan Freeman and he spends so much time phoning this in that I actually want to see his AT&T bill for the months he was on set. Must be astronomical.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is about accessing other unknown portions of your brain, but this movie was actively trying to shut my brain down. Also, I now have eye strain because i could not stop rolling my eyes. I wanted to rush the ticket holder and demand my money back, but my mind had degraded so much i couldn't process speech to ask for my money back. This review may have some humor, yes, but still, my point remains: This is an absolutely terrible movie and the only good thing is that it came out in a very busy summer, because if this had a blockbuster amount of attention, I would be worried for Scarlett Johansens acting career. Please run screaming from this movie."
"nfinitemonkeys","7","14","26","7 December 2014"," Addressing the 'Sci-Fi' and Third Act questions
","(Spoiler Alert)<br/><br/>This is not going to be a comprehensive review, but a response on two subjects. Whether the movie is sci-fi and whether it goes off the rails and has a 'meh' ending after a satisfying beginning.<br/><br/>Science Fiction has many facets, one being a love of actual science and seeing it taken to extremes, projected into the future, etc... Another aspect, which it shares with Fantasy, is that it allows a storyteller to get at questions that couldn't be realized in ordinary situations. The outrageous science element allows a human/ethical/moral dilemma to exist and keeps that from seeming outrageous.<br/><br/>From about 30 minutes in, Lucy knows she is dying and, despite the (spoiler) extreme transformation at the conclusion, she doesn't try to find a way to continue normally, or even super-normally.<br/><br/>I think the answer to both of these complaints exists in the nature of the conclusion. (Spoiler) This does not end in a 'human-centric' way. It does not end with boy/girl gets girl/boy or good guy beats/reforms bad guy, etc... Transcending even human desire for living is the solution Lucy considers superior. I mean if she can transform herself into a computer and see/travel through time, then she could probably repair or clone herself or come up with some other similar feels- better ending.<br/><br/>Some of the most classic science fiction explores the horrible situation where something essential is removed from a person's being. Frankenstein (yes it was science fiction. Biology is science, people) was conceived during the birth of electricity and discovery that man- controlled currents could move and affect human tissue/muscle. Dracula (a bit more of a stretch) was conceived during the discovery period of blood-borne diseases, disease transmission, blood transfusion factors, etc... Robocop, the Matrix, Total Recall, and many others examine the loss of self or some essential facet of humanity. Lucy chooses that loss of self and in that way makes itself stand out from other such films in a way that at least presents some interesting science fiction.<br/><br/>Was it the greatest science fiction movie of the year? Nope. Would it have had less appeal if not for ScarJo starring? Yes. Does Luc Besson have a hit/miss record with nothing in between? Yes, and this one is a soft hit. In the end, I know I'll watch it again at some future date because I know I'll re-watch a movie with an interesting theme more often than one that just flashes explosions on the screen."

","As soon as I have seen the trailer, I wanted to see the movie. Unfortunately the trailer gives a completely different perception and direction... it is a bit misleading - that could annoy some people - as the movie is hitting my personal right buttons, I didn't mind.<br/><br/>For an action movie, Lucy goes quite a slow pace. I have seen reviews, which are describing it slow and fast and slow again - I would rather say, slow and slower and then medium slow. But then the whole movie is carried by the talent of Luc Besson to showcase impressive visual treats - and while it is sometimes a bit ""head scratching"" (e.g. the repetitive reference to Lucy the ""cave-human"")- it makes just an artsy and beautiful movie. What I didn't liked at all was the basic erroneous assumption, that the human is using XX% of his/her cerebral potential. 10 years ago, Luc Besson could have got away with this - but nowadays common knowledge is flagging this just as nonsense... He could have easily adjusted the story. But he didn't and this ""nonsense"" goes on and on like that. Basically it is naive to believe, that using more potential of your brain, would give you control over more than your very own body. This fact is excusable in fast and rather blunt action-movies with mutants and people with super powers. However a movie like Lucy, which gives enough time to reflect and to think about, just deserves a better built ""game plan"". And these type of problems are going on and on until the very end. Lucy is still a very enjoyable movie, which even could give some philosophical impulses. However it just didn't reached ""perfection"" because of mentioned reasons. After all - I felt, that I didn't wasted my time, by watching this movie - however it also felt that it was always a step below its true potential."

","Honestly, I can't understand why this movie only got 6.x/10. Maybe the German dubbing was extraordinarily well done? Like, better than the original? I don't know. It's not even that I'm a Luc-Besson-Fanboy or something - I found ""The Fifth Element"" pretty annoying, although Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors. So why did I like ""Lucy"" so much? First off, the movie starts and is right away enthralling. Scarlett Johansson plays a rather shy girl on vacation or whatever in Taiwan, who is forced by her acquaintance-of-last-night to transfer a mysterious briefcase to a scary gangster boss, incarnated terrifyingly convincing by Min-sik Choi. It turns out the briefcase is full of drugs, a bag of these drugs is planted into her stomach, leaks, the overdose gives her full-access to her brain capacity, REVENGE! All in the first 30 minutes, as I remember. What sounds like an ""ordinary"" action movie story line is fed with (I admit, pseudo-)scientifical information by Morgan Freeman and behavior-study like scenes of animals interacting, and after a short while, it's anything but an ordinary action movie. The more Lucy can control her brain, the more transcendental her abilities become, the more she is in control of her environment, mentally and physically. In ""Lucy"", Director Besson deals with the most urgent questions of humanity, with the existence of something transcendental, 'where do we come from?', 'what defines our lifes?', 'where do we go'? After this altogether, I left the cinema stunned and contemplative. Yes, the movie might have some goofs and flaws, but in the end, the message is unbeatable."

Prometheus, for instance, nicely developed the idea of our origins. But Lucy is different. With taking some notes of religions and what it has been written on the Holy book or Quran, you can feel our origin, you can feel the source of creation. That's why I love this movie.

Non stop action from start to finish with plenty to think about afterwards.

The first 2/3 of the movie is a fun, violent and trippy revenge action flick, with Lucy using her various superpowers to get back at the bad guys. Who needs a gun when you can send a guy flying away with the wave of your hand? This fulfills the fantasy of every average person who wanted to possess amazing superpowers, and I think it really does it in the most entertaining way possible. The latter half of the movie really gets down to addressing the metaphysical aspects of Lucy's journey. See the last third of the movie, and really try to ""read between the lines"" of what is going on on screen. Lucy's trip through the universe was scary and beautiful all at once...almost equaling the ending to ""2001 A Space Odyessey"". And the time traveling sequence was absolutely spectacular! May I suggest Luc Besson make an all-out time travel sci-fi movie as his next project? It would blow everyone away! Loved this movie!!"

","What a god awful waste of time! Not only is the story ridiculous and infantile, but also are the characters so idiotic and unrelatable, I cannot believe somebody had actually wrote this movie. It is so Awful it seems like the ape from scene 1 played with a typewriter and this so called movie is the outcome.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, what a waste of talent, to be standing there like a d list actor mumbling all those silly theories, Sheesh! And Scarlet Johanson? Dude what gives??? In some scenes she looked like a 40 year old divorcÃ©e? what the F happened to her?<br/><br/>Luc Basson? Dude I loved you! What a heartbreak! <br/><br/>I hope they made money, I hope they made lots of money, enough money to but an island and stay there, away from movie making for the near future. All three of them should think long and hard as to why would they spend our time and money on such a scam of a movie. I swear had I stayed in the cinema's parking lot I would have had a better, more entertaining, use of my time."

","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) gets mixed up with a group of ruthless drug smugglers. Still trying to process what's actually going on, she wakes to discover the smugglers have sewn a packet of a new drug into her stomach. Before she can deliver the drugs, however, the packet busts open, releasing the powerful drug into her system. The drug's effect is an ever increasing utilization of her brain. Soon, Lucy is capable of manipulating matter and energy with her mind. She contacts a renowned scientist for assistance. She realizes that the drug will kill her within 24 hours and she wants to pass on the knowledge she's gained. But the smugglers are intent on getting their drugs back. They follow Lucy half way round the world for a final showdown.<br/><br/>Overall, Lucy is a fantastically entertaining film. The action is nice with plenty of fights, gun battles, and car chases. The direction from Luc Besson couldn't be much better. He keeps things moving at a very lively pace. The acting is also superb. Scarlett Johansson proves once again that a woman can be successful as the lead in an action oriented film. And Johansson does an excellent job portraying the changes to Lucy as the drug changes her brain. Nicely done. The supporting cast is also solid. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Amr Waked as the bewildered French policeman who helps Lucy in her journey. Another highlight for me has to be the special effects. Just amazing. Finally, even though things do get a bit messy and even rushed toward the end (this is my biggest complaint), I still had fun with it. The time travel bits were especially moving.<br/><br/>I really like and appreciate the message I got out of Lucy. Being a father of two boys and getting older each day, I too sometimes feel that the only real commodity of any value that I have is time. Time to spend with my wife and kids, time to do things I enjoy, time to live my life - that's what's important. It's not material objects or anything else. It's the limited time we each have on this Earth.<br/><br/>Finally, if you read comments on Lucy, you'll sooner rather than later run into criticism of the scientific errors made by the film. People love to point them out. I honestly didn't have any problem with the film's scientific realism. It's a movie - I wasn't expecting a science lesson. I accepted the scientific mumbo-jumbo just as I would in any sci-fi film. In the reality in which the films is set, it all makes sense. In our reality, it doesn't. I went with it and didn't let it affect my overall entertainment."

","One of the best films I have seen in the past decade. It is rare for a cinema audience to clap at the end of a film, but they did for this one. Many reviewers are giving the movie a low score and complaining about the end. I think the movie was perfect. Many people simply do not have the capacity to fully understand the premise and hypothesis. As Morgan Freeman clearly stated in the film ""we really do not know how a person would act if they accessed 100% of their brain."" I applaud Luc Besson for showing us what the possibilities could be. This is a film that I will watch again when it comes out on DVD. For those of you who are on the fence about seeing this film I say go for it. Who knows it may become the sleeper hit of the year."
"octavaluna","10","17","34","29 August 2014"," Absolutely mind-blowing. Superior in its own right.
","When I left the theater after watching this movie, I felt that I had trouble grasping into reality. I felt at the edge, at the edge of something more. Of everything. <br/><br/>This is the first movie that left something in me in years. After watching the most praised movies of the summer I would always think they were funny and entertaining, but that's all. <br/><br/>Not this one though. <br/><br/>I don't think ""Lucy"" belongs to any genre at all, and at the same time it has little of all of them. It's not about whether you believe if archiving the ultimate comprehension and control over matter and energy could be possible or not but the moment you understand where the whole movie was headed, when you grasp the meaning and it all slides into place so perfectly...<br/><br/>Lucy is God. <br/><br/>I wonder how many people understood this after watching the film. Lucy is God. <br/><br/>They took all the major theories of creation and evolution, all full of holes in a major or minor state, all with secrets yet to discover or giant flaws that their believers don't know how to explain... And they melted them in one. And somehow it made sense. (I think the one that falls closer is the Gaia theory.)<br/><br/>However, this is a movie that needs to be seen with an open and functioning brain. It leaves a mark on you if you let it sink in, if you listen beyond the mere words that the characters are saying and let their meaning overflow you, think about them and interpret them rather than just listening. Open your mind. That's what all the movie is about, really. <br/><br/>I pity so much all the dumb reviews calling it a ""useless movie"" and a ""careless flick"". How bold can all that people be? Can't they see? Can't they feel it? Just open your mind a little bit and the movie will consume you, capture you and you will believe every word, because it will make perfect sense to you. Whether it is sustained scientifically or not, believe. <br/><br/>And when you are done with it it will haunt you, make you question what you already knew and before you can shake it off it will plant seeds of doubt and wonderings of endless possibilities inside you. <br/><br/>Just let it take you away. And you WILL remember it. <br/><br/>Ps: Scarlett is amazing and the visuals are breathtaking."
"kluseba","9","24","51","13 August 2014"," Three gifted main actors, an incredible director and stunning visual effects lead us through a thought-provoking story where science and fiction collide in equal parts
","Lucy could easily be the best film of the year and should attract a lot more cinephiles to the movie theatres than it already does. The movie has many different strengths, differs from similar films and feels fresh and entertaining despite a more philosophical and scientific approach.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie has a running time of ninety minutes only. The viewer is immediately thrown into a story filled with pace and tension. This films simply doesn't include any unnecessary lengths.<br/><br/>The acting performances in this film are completely incredibly. Scarlett Johansson starts as a naive and shy lady that slowly becomes a clever heroine in a credible manner. Her character doesn't include the usual weaknesses of so-called superheroes. She doesn't talk too much, she only uses her powers when she has to and is still quite impressive and there is no cheesy love story or a demon from her past to distract us from the main plot. Morgan Freeman only has a smaller role in this movie but he simply convinces for being there because he is credible in his role as a clever scientist and has a lot of charisma. The ruthless main villain is portrayed by the incredible Choi Min-Sik who is one of my favourite actors ever and it's great to finally see him in a Western movie where his incredible talents get some more attention. This may not be his greatest performance but this man has a talent and history for playing dark characters.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is another strong point. It's not your usual tale of crime and vengeance. The film has a rather profound philosophical and scientific side and takes its time to explain what is actually going on without boring the audience. Many viewers felt let down by the ending of the movie but in relation to the entire film, it completely makes sense. The movie doesn't only convince with gifted actors and addicting action sequences but also offers some real food for thought.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the movie exploit all contemporary technologies extremely well. I was stunned by many impressive images from animal and nature sequences over animated pictures of the human body up to modern images with different rays and colours. These effects make the movie even more enjoyable in a cinema.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is very well executed as well. There are no annoying shaky camera passages, the soundtrack is very fitting and the whole movie has an intriguing multicultural touch as it takes place in Taiwan and France and involves actors and characters from many different countries. The fact that the Korean actors only speak Korean might be annoying for some viewers but it makes the experience even more realistic. Just as Scarlett Johansson's character in the beginning, the viewer doesn't always understand what is going on when the Korean characters are talking and this adds even more tension to the plot and is a great element that is more and more employed in commercial movies as well.<br/><br/>Lucy may not reinvent a whole genre but this science-fiction movie focuses on the best elements of science and a really gripping fiction. If you only like slow-paced dramas or comedy movies for the whole family, this movie isn't for you but anyone else should absolutely watch this film as soon as possible. There are still some interesting movies to come out this year but so far, this film is a more than solid candidate for the greatest movie of the year and you really don't want to miss it."
"vvg317","1","30","66","26 July 2014"," By far one of the worst....
","It has been a while since I have seen such horrible movies. Cheaply made and plot is downright awful. It is a really bad version of ""The lawnmower man"" and ""Eagle eye"" smashed together. I don't know how they were able to get good reviews. But I want my 90 min of life back. The whole plot line is messed up and you get lost in it.. From the start I had a feeling that it is one of the bad karate movies from the early 80's you can't understand how she ended up where she was and Scarlet Johansons attempts to come across as highly evolved human being just laughable. The only reason we went to see it is because of Morgan Freeman but even after watching it I still have a hard time believing that he would sign up for such a movie... It is bad. Save your money. Avoid at all cost."
"briansouter","10","23","49","9 August 2014"," I love Lucy (spoilers)
","Lucy came out of the blue..It was upon me before i knew anything about it. i went to see it and loved it, tho wary of the MA rating. Luc Besson has made a kick ass movie about a woman who evolves beyond human limits, thanks to a drug ehs goes on the ultimate drug trip. Student Lucy in Taiwan, having fallen in with a dodgy boyfriend/drug mule, is tricked into becoming one.Lucy is all too human at the start, fearful, silly, vain, sexy...when its found whats in the suitcase, she is offered a job she cant refuse...as drug mule. While waiting to be sent home, in a grim room, she is attacked by her jailers, her belly kicked, and the drug enters her body, leading to the first extraordinary scene, as Lucy begins her journey writing up a wall and across the ceiling. Then the new kick-ass Lucy begins to appear: first bent on revenge against her tormenters, but soon her course changes, as she realises her intelligence is accelerating,and as she realises her time is running out, she resolves to go all the way by linking up with interpol to find the rest of the drug. Spaced out yet focused: thats the new Lucy. This is Limitless meets Akira: for me Lucy is more humane than Tetsuo, more desperate than Eddie. Some extraordinary scenes yet its not the hyperkinetic action scenes that appealed so much as scenes where Lucy puts the police to sleep and suspends the criminals from the ceiling (this scene being the most compelling of them all)...all the while calm and focused and beyond the need to commit violence. Action, pathos, and the quirky humor that laces the movie as she interacts with Morgan Freemans theoretician, whos exposition parallels Lucys journey. Strangely moving this movie, as Lucy explores space and time, meet the first Lucy, and in the end,arriving at 100%, dissolves into empty space and find she is everywhere. For the sceptics, don't let the dodgy science get in the way of enjoying his movie. Incidentally, the more wayout features of the film have some parallels with buddhist teachings esp on the siddhis, and dissolution of the body is a feature of Dzogchen"

On the scale of acting both lead actors were good and had produced their best. And some actors are in futile role with no sense.<br/><br/>Though the film has used some fake data and hypothesis to impress upon the audience, you will be entertained and learned.

I don't even want to call these idiotic concoction of images an actual movie.<br/><br/>Given that I found the trailer to be fascinating, this effort is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. It's very tough to set aside the absolute nonsensical elements of the concept itself. Then, they add moronic character decisions to set up and drive the nonsensical ""science"" and events of the film. What the Asian gang/drug cartel does throughout the running time is so insane that all I could do was roll my eyes. There are no real action beat nor are there any interesting confrontations or thrills.<br/><br/>This thing plays like a bad music video that wants to pay tribute to insane philosophy. At least it showcases Scarlett's acting chops a bit (at least until she becomes a superpowered zombie stoner for the third act). Her fear and work on display in the first act is amazing work. The rest of this mess is a waste of time and film even with it's short running time."

Am I glad I did. This was off the wall brilliance and one of the most original films I've seen. (Before anyone tells me there are others, I haven't seen them so can't comment) I loved the idea of Lucy being able to open her brain to encompass the world around her because of the drug seeping into her stomach. OK, the idea is preposterous and the set pieces a bit ludicrous but that didn't matter because this is science fiction and I was able to willingly suspend my disbelief, a little like Lucy suspended the bad guys in mid air. I loved the ending where she became one with the universe and met her namesake in the past. Scarlett Johansson is becoming well known for oddball films and I, for one, applaud her for it.

At each phase there was a different action from extreme agitation and constant movement to periods of calm. The doctors explained it was the mind repairing itself. Thumbs up to Scarlett Johansson for a great job.<br/><br/>Even though Lucy had different twist and turns that you may not necessarily associate with the message of the movie, I enjoyed that I can take something from a movie that made me think beyond the entertainment aspect."
"TheAnimalMother","7","11","21","27 September 2014"," What Is The Limit Of Your Imagination?
","In my view this is the best film Besson has directed since 1997's The Fifth Element. The film in certain ways is a lot like Limitless, but at the same time it takes a very different overall approach and look on the subject of human evolution. I'm sure that many people will not care much for this film since it is filled with a lot of mystical/spiritual references and ideas and even some false science, however those with an open mind and an active imagination will likely be very glad they saw the film. This is clearly a work of fiction people, but there is no one saying you can't relate fiction to reality either, and actually learn something from it once in a while too. Our limitless imaginations are part of what makes human beings so extraordinary, we are best off using this gift and appreciating it. Fictional films can still be very thought provoking, and this one definitely fits that category. 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't scientifically accurate in many ways to our current knowledge, but it's still a monster landmark of a film nonetheless. Lucy is certainly not 2001, however they both ride that same imagination rules line that can spark the internal fires of unique creative thinking. In my view Lucy is a sci-fi trip worth taking. 7.5/10"

","'Lucy' tries to be both an action-thriller and intellectually provocative, but succeeds in neither of these ambitions. The film's tired plot relates how some blood-thirsty Chinese drug traffickers attempt to corner the market with a new designer drug. After sewing packages of the substance into the stomachs of some reluctant mules, they blackmail them to fly to Europe with the contraband. Apparently these incompetent mobsters haven't properly tested their product, and are ignorant that an overdose can endow its consumer with extraordinary physical powers and intelligence. When one of the packages leaks, a ditsy blonde mule metamorphoses into Superwoman. <br/><br/>The plot-holes are gigantic, so writer/director Luc Besson attempts to distract the audience with his standard menu of theatrical fights, car chases, shoot-outs and gratuitous violence. These stale leftovers are served up with some pretentious babbling about the drug's mutations projecting humanity up the evolutionary ladder. Unfortunately 'Lucy' only signifies another dead-end in film-making."

","Lucy is a sci-fi, action movie written and directed by Luc Besson. The movie feels like it's split in two with the first half starting out fairly plausible and by the end of the movie grows into heavy CGI and sci-fi.<br/><br/>Luc Besson is famous for Taken, Leon, The Fifth Element and The Transporter. He is a very good writer. This film leans more towards The Fifth Element in its levels of sci-fi and plausibility but I personally believe Leon and Taken are his masterpieces.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is good for an action movie, never likely to receive Oscar nods. I thought Min-Sik Choi was very good as the dictator boss and Morgan Freeman was his usual composed and impressive self as The Professor. Scarlet Johansson had some memorable scenes in the movie and she pulled off the change in her character superbly.<br/><br/>The way the film shows the origins of humanity and the development of time, particularly in the end sequence is very impressive and well done.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with the Soundtrack. I thought this movie could have done with something similar to the Drive Soundtrack or Tron...or even Terminator. Such distinguishable OST's from the action/sci-fi genre. But other than a few main scenes in the movie it lacked memorable backing.<br/><br/>This movie is very similar to The Terminator and has elements of The Matrix. In fact, during many scenes in the movie I thought that Scarlet Johansson reminded me of and would have made a great Sarah Connor when it was remade.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's an entertaining watch from a very creative writer and the plot is very interesting. 7/10"

","Here's another real odd ball that I watched this past week. It stars Scarlett Johansen and that is of course all I needed to wanna watch this movie. Lucy is about this women who is kidnapped by this group of thugs and then gets a powerful drug put inside her that unlocks the full 100% of her brain and now she's super smart and seems to have the powers of Jedi. <br/><br/>This movie is just really weird and not quite what I was expecting. This is of course an action film. It's got all clichés that were use to. Then becomes a super hero movie and then a beautiful visual ride. It's really confusing a bit at times and it gets worse in the end. The issue I have with Lucy is that she's the only super powered person in this film and there's no one in this that ever becomes powerful enough to give a really cool final final fight in the end, but a weird and visual like dream of a world kinda ending. It's not great and I highly doubt someone would become super hero or a jedi if we used 100% percent of our brain. It's entertaining if you don't look much into it and it's got Scarlett Johansen as a sexy bad ass chick with guns and Morgan Freeman Teaching science"

","Jackson, Courtney N. October 09, 2015 Expository Writing Mrs. Smith Lucy Synopsis: Scarlett Johansson, who plays the brave role of Lucy, is deceived by a guy who she thought was a ""friend"" into carrying a briefcase to a supposed business contact. The once care free student is captured by a gang of men with all of the wrong intentions. After being exposed to a new European synthetic drug, Lucy develops superhuman abilities; which, causes her to seek help from neurologist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who she hopes can and will help her. Review: <br/><br/>The movie Lucy is an exhilarating, action packed thriller that will have you on edge every step of the way. Very similar to the film Limitless, director Luc Besson with an excellent choice of casting and meticulously detailed imagery depicts the first person to access full cerebral capacity . With Scarlett Johansson cast as the main character Lucy is portrayed as a brave, fearless, and sharp minded individual. She was placed in a tough situation, and she follows her instincts in attempt to reach safety and potentially save her own life. As you get further in the movie more extreme things began to happen and more mishap's are stirred up. <br/><br/>Ten minutes after the movie has started, action has already taken place. At a midnight club outside of New York City, Lucy meets Richard (Pilou Asbaek) who she dates only for about a week up until the day of his death. One evening Richard tries to lure Lucy into entering a hotel by herself and supposedly delivering a briefcase to a man she'd never met by the name of Mr. Jang. But Lucy's isn't going along with the plan, so Richard quickly handcuffs the case onto her wrist forcing Lucy to complete the mission. The way she handled herself allowed viewers to get an inside look at Lucy's demeanor before the whole disaster. Once Mr. Jang comes down to ""receive his package"" a spark was lit and more action took place. Mr. Jang's thugs abducted Lucy and shot Richard dead on the sidewalk in front of the hotel they were at. <br/><br/>Although false, the combination of philosophy and scientific theory Besson delivers viewers to ponder is remarkable. These mind stimulating ideas brought additional excitement to the film! That wasn't it though, it seemed like the more Cph4 that dispensed into Lucy's internal organs the more levels of her brain she'd unlock. <br/><br/>Besson manages to use a lot of vivid and colorful imagery of the synthetic drug that was inside of Lucy's body. When she'd reach new levels, you could see the colorful medicine rushing through her veins fast and with really cool illuminations. This keeps the audience's attention. The aggressiveness shown by Lucy was acted on not only for revenge, but also for the safety of the drugs being exposed to the world. In hopes of storing all of the information and knowledge the drugs allowed her to and passing it on from generation to generation, Lucy's entire mission to obtain the drugs, inject them, and use 100% of her cerebral capacity wasn't an easy one. With the help of Professor Norman and his colleagues, Lucy is monitored as she absorbs all of this information through matter.<br/><br/>His choice to parallel Lucy's story with nature and evolutionary biology makes sense and was very unique. I would definitely recommend this movie to any one who enjoys action/sci-fi drama related genres."

","Wow, I really like Scarlett Johansson on screen now. My first persuasion that she was a good actress came in The Prestige (2006) and Woody Allen's 'Match Point (2005)' and 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)' and even the bizarre noire 'Under the Skin (2013)'.<br/><br/>In terms of completely capturing my imagination, it'll be hard for her to top her role as Lucy, in Luc Besson's current science fiction masterpiece of the same name. The fact is there's not much about Scarlett's features or symmetry that I'd call beautiful - she has a funny nose, which goes off in a different direction to her mouth, and on the big screen all that is exaggerated just enough to keep you wondering if she's beautiful or interesting, but in the package with her acting, she's phenomenal. <br/><br/>In terms of holding your attention, Scarlett doesn't miss a beat and, I'm sorry Angelina Jolie, but she leaves what you do on screen, for dead. She's a movie maker's dream. She's one of the few females who can not only carry a movie, but she makes interesting choices and takes risks with those choices. This is one woman who is not going to die wondering if she left any of her talent and ability off screen. No sir. It's all up there in minute, focused and interesting detail. <br/><br/>And for mine, in short, what Luc Besson achieves with Lucy as a revenge movie, is what Tarantino couldn't achieve in two volumes of Kill Bill. I'm a big science fiction movie fan, but it's been a long time since I've had anything satisfy my movie-going instincts on nearly every level. <br/><br/>Tim Burton's Mars Attacks was the last, and that was in 1996. This movie, Lucy, is in a class almost of it's own. Perhaps once or twice there were script elements which reminded me of Brad Cooper's 'Limitless', but they were few and fleeting, given the execution, believability and outstanding effects of Lucy. I'm not going to go into the story. If you've wondered whether or not you really like Scarlett Johansson, this should make your mind up. And if you like a thrilling ride/sci-fi/revenge flick this is up there with the best of them. Scarlett's performance is worth the entry price alone."
"ivo-cobra8","10","9","17","1 December 2015"," A really good descent sci-fi action flick from Luc Besson!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. <br/><br/>Lucy (2014) is written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla. Just like The Fifth Element this movie is very similar to that movie, just it has a different story and different cast of actors in it. At least unlike Taken 3 This film is well shot and bloody. I adore Scarlett and she is an absolute delight to see in this. I just finished watching Lucy today and I like it. It was really good descent sci-fi action flick. In the beginning when Lucy talks to his friend Richard I thought the movie would be boring but it wasn't it was a hell off a ride. It went pretty fast and end well. I watched Scarlet Johansson in Captain America The Winter Soldier which in my opinion is the best action super hero movie for me. And in Lucy Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint me. Also Morgan Freeman was also really good. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it ,it was fun and It is pure fantasy. Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman carry this film, no doubt about it. But there is a story here ,what if we used 100% of our brain?? What would that be like , what would we be like?? Well for one thing ,things wouldn't be important, wars wouldn't be fought, racism would not be anything or wouldn't have started in the first place . You could think what you want on all of this, at least the film makes you wonder and that I find is fun. Lucy was like Inception and limitless combined with its intriguing premise and a film where u have to think more than a lot of other mindless films. every movie needs some sex appeal to make it realistic, film is the art of re enacting life....to some degree....I thought she was kick ass until her body dissolved. fortunately that was at the end of the movie. the small amount of sex appeal that she is given with this role is forgivable because her mind is transforming and everything is new, but I felt betrayed when she lost her ability to be relatable. <br/><br/>I watch this movie twice it was fast paced and Entertaining action sci-fi flick! I really like Scarlett Johansson I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron especially on Scarlett's acting skills and her behavior during that awful movie. I think in 2014 were still some good movies that I like: I love Captain America: The Winter Soldier which Scarlett Johansson surprised the hell out of me on her performance as Black Widow including Chris Even as Steve Rogers and everyone should know that I love this movie to death. I like Lucy and I think of Luc Besson there are three movies that I like: Léon: The Professional (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) which everyone know I am crazy about that Sci-Fi action movie and this one Lucy (2014). I know the director made a lot of movies including La Femme Nikita (1990) but for some reason I never liked that movie, I don't know why, I just didn't. Or the series which Peta Wilson started it and later in new the series Maggie Q as Nikita. I just don't like those types of bloody movie and series. Those three movies I just counted are really good movies and I love them so much.<br/><br/>Lucy is one of those high-octane films from writer/director Luc Besson that gives the audience a fun entertaining action extravaganza set piece but with a plot that is so far out there that its not so fun and entertaining to relate to, unless of course you happen to be tripping' along with the films characters. Scarlet Johannson, no stranger to the action genre brings her A game and Morgan Freeman's authority shines through but Lucy is as wacky as they come. Human mules may be a dose in reality but one where the in-jested drug makes you become one with just about everything is a little bit bizarre. Either way this one will either thrill you or beg you for a much better 90 minute high. <br/><br/>The only thing that confused me so much of this movie is the ending which I don't get what happened with Lucy on the end of the movie. The end ended with a cliffhanger by the end if you ask me. I like that Luc Beeson tried to do something different than a straight revenge action movie - It was interesting and it kept my attention - I really liked the scene in the hospital when she was talking to her mother:)!!!! It was fairly decent overall. Wish it were a bit longer though because it seemed quite short. I am giving this movie a 10 because of Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman as a science professor he did an outstanding perfect acting performance, he is awesome as always!!! <br/><br/>Lucy is a 2014 English-language French science fiction action film written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla for his company Europacorp. <br/><br/>10/10 Grade: A Studio: Universal Pictures, EuropaCorp Starring: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked, Choi Min-sik Director: Luc Besson Producer: Virginie Besson-Silla Screenplay: Luc Besson Luc Besson Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 29 Mins.

","...but i can't help raving enough on this movie. A lot of action movies fall out short on brains, yet this is top of the line. Whether you like it or not, you have to be attentive and focused to understand. Oh, but don't worry, you won't need to, 'cause you will be pinned down to your seat the whole ride.<br/><br/>The story actually starts simple, but gets complicated as it goes. A girl named Lucy gets kidnapped in drug deal and something goes on about some discussion about how people's brains work and that we only use 10% of it, and some drug that could make people use their brains to 100%, and... you'll know where it's going at. <br/><br/>Simply put, this is one of the best action movies i've ever seen. It tries to merge science-fiction and action, and i think that it's very ambitious. But, sometimes it could come out as a misfire. This one in particular, is not the case. <br/><br/>I found every aspect of this movie perfect. From its' opening shot to the final. Character developments aside, it runs briskly and fast-paced at a rate of 89 minutes. Thrills are on the way from one scene to another. Scarlett Johansson runs the show. She gives Lucy's character to life. I don't even notice that it's even her anymore as the movie plays. The other cast done well with their given characters and although they don't give the movie more seasoning, they don't go down to be obnoxious. <br/><br/>I heard some people really love and trash the movie at the same time. I understand why. Some will dismiss it as downright silly for the everything-is-possible way the movie goes and all the philosophy is total bull***t. But, that's not the reason to go to movies for pure logic and plausibility, right?. You go to them for entertainment. I think this movie is pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Luc Besson has brewed a magnificent, thought-provoking, fun, silly, and sometimes weird and creepy movie. i'm hoping for more like this to come"
"akashimdb","9","18","40","10 August 2014"," Scarlett Johansson's Lucy is a sleak, crazy and extravagant sci-fi
","We all fall for the seductive notion of some kind of superpower, especially if it's just us in the world. That's why it's called superpower. Many writers have played and manipulated this idea with Transcendence and Limitless being the latest consequences. Luc Besson's Lucy is a better culmination than at least these two. The premise being that a human uses less than 10% of his brain.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a regular college girl with an obviously jerk boyfriend who forces her to deliver a briefcase having ""documents"". Suddenly the jolly jerk is killed and Lucy is taken by a drug lord. The briefcase contains a blue drug which is the sci-fi element of the film. The drug is surgically inserted into her stomach and Lucy becomes the courier. But the ravenous minions molest her and beat her up. A recurrent of kicks on her stomach and the drug leaks into Lucy's system, slating one of the most dramatic inceptions of superpower. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is small parallel character. Norman is the best expert on the brain but his theories are a mere speculation since no human has used 20 or 30 or 50 or 100% of his brain. Lucy contacts him and confronts that his theories are right. She has 24 hours before her body becomes incapable of handling her.<br/><br/>Luc Besson had to keep the critics at bay before writing this one. He has knowingly not cared much about the ambiguous existing scientific theories about the brain. But he manages a perfect equilibrium between theories and entertainment, purposely compromising on scientific details. Lucy knows telekinesis. She can control humans, a dozen of them in a second. She doesn't feel pain. She can still remember the taste of her mother's milk, change her physical structure. She can eventually travel in time.<br/><br/>The 90 minutes film is paced fast and is high on adrenaline action. Nobody knows what we can do by using 100% of our brain. So it's better to dump the contradicting scientific theories and enjoy this fun ride with the beautiful lady."

The film was great because everything wasn't fake looking the acting was pretty good and the whole story line was really unique and a new idea that hasn't really been done before. the only thing i wish the would have done differently is that for some reason she doesn't use her powers when it would be more convenient.

When Richard has a briefcase to deliver to the mysterious Korean Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), he tricks Lucy and cuffs her to the briefcase. Lucy has no other option but to meet Mr. Jang, who is a dangerous drug lord that kills Richard. Lucy discovers that the briefcase contains the synthetic drug CPH4 and she is forced to work to Mr. Jang as drug mule with three other men and transport the drug to Europe hidden in their abdomens. However one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen and releases the CPH4 in her body. Soon Lucy enhances her brain capacity and develops her physical and mental capabilities. She uses her abilities to kill the criminals and flees. However her power does not stop increasing and is destroying Lucy that needs to use more CPH4 to stabilize her body. She contacts Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who is an authority in brain capacity, and the scientist becomes her hope to save her. But Mr. Jang wants to retrieve his drug and is hunting Lucy down.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is a pretentious and disappointing combination of action and art film. Action movie audiences are very different from art film ones and that is why ""Lucy"" does not work. The story begins with non-stop and engaging action and Scarlett Johansson is practically unanimity among movie lovers; therefore the beginning is an excellent action movie. Unfortunately there is a twist in the genre and the plot becomes a non- sense and silly rip-off ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with Lucy becoming an omnipresent being. In the end, ""Lucy"" is a mixed unsatisfactory bag of genres that does not please most of the viewers. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Lucy"""

"tsangaridesi","2","19","43","6 September 2014"," This movie is a mockery of human knowledge, intelligence, and understanding.
","From beginning to end, this movie was absolutely ridiculous. Even before I watched the movie, I knew it was going to be a horrible movie, but I decided I'd do it because some of you guys would probably be interested in a review, so here it is. The fundamental idea at its most basic level can bring forth a very interesting concept, such as what the movie Limitless did. What I saw in this movie was an infinitely worse version of Limitless. Luc Besson, the writer and director, took this very simple concept, and not only did he try, unsuccessfully to overcomplicate it to sound smart, but he tried to use a trick on the audience, by introducing a few sciency sounding terms and keeping the viewers interested by their, ironically, lack of knowledge. The path he chose the movie to take, from the fundamental concept, made the whole idea absolutely, and hilariously, absurd. Firstly, the ""fact"" that humans only use 10% of their brain's capacity is a myth. We use 100% of our brain's capacity, just at different times, for different actions. Secondly, the idea that humans, or anything, for that matter, are able to control things that are physically unreachable on a subatomic level, such as time, is just stupid. And for any questions regarding time travel: time travel doesn't work with simply ""moving"" time. You bend spacetime to reach a different destination. You're bending particles with energy; not magically leaping through time. This movie completely disregarded any and every basic law of physics. Moving on to the acting, it was the best acting I've ever seen in my life not really. The acting was actually very bad. I didn't expect much from Scarlett Johansson, and I got even less from her. Since she was basically the only important of the movie, I'd say the general acting was bad as well, seeing as no one else had any significant roles, except for Morgan Freeman, whom didn't have many lines either. The metaphors were completely unsubtle, and pretty much threw themselves at the audience's faces and screamed ""WE'RE METAPHORS."" Also, I'd like to point out that it's literally impossible to portray a character infinitely more knowledgeable in a movie, seeing as the ""research"" put into said movie would come from other sources. So, unless the writer would be the Nikola Tesla of our time, it'd just be a poor attempt, and excuse, for a movie introducing a ""new concept"" which is revolutionary. It's predictable down to the last detail. I'm not even kidding. It's an extremely predictable movie. The director/writer is, from what I gather, not a very intelligent man, and movies like these should be left to people who: a) are intelligent, and b) actually know what they're doing. This movie was just a mockery of human intelligence and understanding as a whole, not to mention and indirect mockery of anyone who thinks it's good."

Although it also has a lot of clichés, it was a pleasant film to watch. It's not often that I see a film of this genre where a woman plays the lead without having to get naked. It actually has a life lesson to teach us and it's not the lesson we are learning which seems to be that sex sells.<br/><br/>This film is trying to teach us that knowledge is power. Not the power that many people want i.e. the power to control others to benefit themselves, but the knowledge to grow, to get further in life.... together!

And every neuron of our brain is capable of controlling each planet and universal system with its development. The most intelligent person may be using just 1/100000th percent of the brain and rest of the brain remain undeveloped and unused. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman very well chosen for the character and played his role very well as he is always best in his characters.<br/><br/>The climax showed is actually a reality which was shown as a fiction, that if we uses complete of our brain, we are everywhere. <br/><br/>Superbly directed and very well acted by this superb female Protagonist and the story-line was well-written and the science aspect was well explained (in my opinion)."

Apparently ""superpowers"" don't always equal superheroes in cinema. That's actually very good. I'm glad that this didn't turn out to be some mindless superhero action movie with ray guns and all that stuff, even if this isn't on the same level with the actually deep, astonishing science fiction movies.<br/><br/>Cinematography was astonishing.

We don't know who she is, we know only small things that are kind of useless little facts.

Mostly because of in the beginning this was a lot of ""White woman killing scary Asian men"".

Speaking of which, Lucy is based on the popular fallacy that we humans use only a small percentage of our brain, about 10%. But I have never before seen a movie that takes full advantage of a fallacy and made it so entertaining. Like Luc Besson's other films, he takes a simple, corny story and executes it so well. I remember seeing it in the theater and how mind-blown I was. The film's lessons and theories about how life evolves on earth and how the foundations of math and science are mere sketches and the capability of the brain. It makes one wonder: what if we could use all of our brain capacity at once? Would we be able to make things move with our minds? Could we change our appearances? Could we teleport?

Neither is it filled with the now popular faux soulful ""scientists"" that more often than not come off as soppy morons. This is a wild ride for the senses of wonder. Like some fun loving reviewers note, it's not at all trying to be scientifically correct - it's heavy on the fiction and demands of the viewer that you let go, sit back and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>I'll quote fellow reviewer thuffman-219-557602 who said it in simple and clear terms: <br/><br/>""Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan 'the man' Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do it."" <br/><br/>I reckon it's natural that this is by the creator of Leon - don't actually expect another Leon though, this is Luc Besson doing something different.

","I liked the film. stylish and nicely tempo-ed, good entertainment. Now concerning the fantasy of obtaining 100% brain activity. I don't think that is possible. first of all, the brain is not purely intellectual. a large part of the brain is controlling hormones and chemical stuff in the body. Lucy says she can control all of that, by changing her hair color and growing the hair long in an instant. How can you cognitively ""know"" when to force the body to produce a hormone ? and Dolphins have a sonar, however they have a large organ to project the waves, humans haven't, at least not that developed ( needs to be investigated !) However to use 100% of your brain, would be a complete burnout of the brain. In the interviews after the film there's a neural scientist that says there are many drugs that are intellectually or cognitive, like Ritalin. however I have seen people on Ritalin. And after a blissful high, they go rock bottom and needs several days of rest, to get back in balance . the drug in the film was a natural pregnancy drug, that seemingly females produce once pregnant. Just like the body can produce endorphin when were in love. I would say that if humans is to use 20 % of their brain, the brain first of all must be double in size, then still use 10% of that double size, that would be 20% of our brain mass. the problem is not the 10% of the brain. but realizing a good idea and pull it off, not being ""afraid"" and impose too many barriers on the natural behavior. I think the movie was good entertainment."

Moving through ""Subway"", ""The Big Blue"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", Besson has become better and better, more spectacular, more refined.

But here I liked them both, very much (secret: good story, good director) And all the other actors are good. Spectacular filming, stunts like I've never seen, fights as I've never seen before, all new and innovative. And, an editing like I've never seen before.

"TonyAtTheMovies","8","4","6","18 March 2017"," An 'amazing story' for today
","Confession time first – I was initially drawn to this movie because it stars Scarlett Johansson, a favourite screen actor of mine who by this time had become enough of a 'star' to help a movie into the listings even (perhaps especially) though the script may be a little outside the usual Hollywood fayre. This movie may be a case in point, the story of a girl who accidentally ingests a dose of drugs which cause her to bring into use the full power of her brain beyond the 'ten percent' of it which we normally call on.<br/><br/>It's worth remembering that this movie is a work of fiction, based very loosely if at all on any real science, rather than a documentary, something which director Luc Besson has himself pointed out in at least one interview. But while it's not something you'd quote in a science paper, this movie is a great piece of entertainment whose pace and increasing scale make for a great adventure. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is found again in the kind of role which she plays so well, that of the bemused 'outsider' who doesn't initially understand what's going on around – or in this case, inside - her. Her journey from this state to one of awareness and growing command of her increasing power gives the film a very strong narrative drive.<br/><br/>During one sequence, the title of one of the old pulp sci-fi magazines, 'Amazing Stories', came to mind. 'Lucy' is truly an 'amazing story' for our day, based very loosely (if at all) on actual science, but if taken in that spirit – as a 'scientific thriller', perhaps - it makes for great entertainment, and is well worth seeing."
"blackmamba99971","10","16","36","1 August 2014"," Oh the possibilities
","I like this new film by Luc Besson. A girl who mistakenly involves herself in a supposed drug deal gone bad. Marred with the notion that she must deliver a package, which was embedded into her stomach she is then assaulted by a group of gangsters who had nothing else to do while they were to transport her to a specified location for the delivery. Instead by her assault the package explodes in her stomach, which then integrated into her system with devastating results.<br/><br/>This result to give her the power of one hundred percent brain capacity, and usage. Now as her predicament heightens to new levels so does her power day by day. From a simple ten percent to twenty, and then thirty, and so on. With each level her powers grow to such a degree that she can traverse space, and time at the same time. Then to see the creation of the universe itself. I thought this was a very original scope of the human condition. <br/><br/>What was even more entertaining was to see Morgan Freeman play a professor of science who talks about that very subject of using all of our brain power. Paired with a French Cop Lucy then has to make it to Paris so she can download all of her knowledge before a group of Chinese gangsters who made her deliver the package in the first place arrives to stop her. This was a fantastic film with a wide range of possibilities. What if? What if the human mind will evolve to this degree? What if our minds are already taking the steps to push ahead? What if.<br/><br/>The only thing that developed in her condition is losing all emotions. Having her cells bombarded by new ones to replace the dead or dying cells with new fresh ones like a domino effect. Because of this revelation Lucy (Scarlette Johansen) knew she would die physically but not mentally or her life force. Besides the body is just a shell keeping our lives intact with each step of time. Luc Besson really came up with a good story. To intertwine with the infinite, and to see beyond our scope of understanding.<br/><br/>Great music, nice effects, and lots of action. Surreal or not. Highly recommended to those ages of 14 and above."

"Harhaluulo54","8","13","28","14 November 2014"," Let's talk about smart.
","Lucy is a very hated movie. I can see why. I also hate a lot of stuff. I like Lucy, though. I don't think this movie is smart. No one thinks this is smart. Yet that seems to be a problem for yet so many. Here is a spoiler; It doesn't try to be smart.<br/><br/>I think the main reason why people dislike this in the first place is that now they actually realize what idiotic means. With this movie, people can finally use their brains and say that this pseudoscience in it is incorrect and false. Doesn't actually work like this, 1/10 etc. That doesn't make this movie stupid, it makes the viewers stupid for not realizing that nearly every movie ever was stupid. This just was in your face stupid because they wanted to make a simple action packet about a girl who becomes god.<br/><br/>I hate most movies. Most movies could be good if they didn't try so hard to be smart. Hardly anyone is capable of smart. But still everyone ever is trying to create smart, so seriously, so vicariously. Idiots trying to create smart. That's our movie industry. Then there are the people who call those movies smart, the average fans. There are basically two options with movies. Either you watch idiots trying to make smart stuff, but actually creating idiotic stuff. Or idiots making idiotic stuff on purpose. Nearly everything that falls under the latter option is a comedy. That's what makes Lucy so original. <br/><br/>How simple it is. Mary Sue doing cool stuff. High cgi budget, some good ideas about visual execution here and there, one of the best pacing in movie history, a mediocre actress, some cool looking Korean villains. And what do we have? Movie of the year. Does every movie work with this formula? No, but this surely does. They could have ruined this by adding tons of details and back stories and relationship drama and some science theories that could actually apply, but they didn't. They didn't ruin this with unnecessary bs like so many do with their movies. <br/><br/>On a bottom line, by not trying to be a smart movie, Lucy became one of the smartest movies I have ever seen. Not in content, not in message, but in making. This was made by smart people, and I can really appreciate that."
"jacob-m-ford97","8","13","28","26 October 2014"," How do you like this Terrence Malick?
","Oddly enough, the best film that ""Lucy"" can be compared to is Terrence Malick's 2011 film, ""The Tree of Life"". I know with confidence that every person's initial reaction to that statement would be a confused question, for two reasons. The first being that you probably haven't seen or even heard of that movie. The second reason being that if you have seen that movie, you think there is no way this action flick starring superstar Scarlett Johansson could be in the least bit similar. ""Lucy"" is a film about an ordinary young woman who unintentionally gets caught up in a drug deal with a sinister Korean gang. After being transported bearing a precious package, Lucy undergoes a phenomenon which allows her to gradually access more and more of her brain capacity, ultimately rendering her a superhuman.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson of course stars as the title character Lucy. The character choices Johansson was required to make were extremely difficult, as she was having to invent a kind of person whom we have zero insight as to how they may be. Some of her choices I did question at times, but they were her choices to make, and in the end they played well. Morgan Freeman also co-starred in the role of Morgan Freeman. His character was some sort of scientist whose name I've easily forgotten, but in reality that's the only role Morgan Freeman seems to play anymore: himself. It's not great for telling a story, but it works, because the world likes him. A lot. Min-Sik Choi and Amr Waked took the only other parts of any significance, but truthfully the characters in this movie made zero difference to the final result of this film. Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" came to the world with a very limited release in 2011, and for a good reason. After seeing the film, the distributors realized that what they hand in their hands was something that is only going to work for a certain type of people. The reason for this being that in this film Malick let his thoughts, emotions, and imagination run wild. There wasn't a story told, there was a message spoken, and that message was about life. Casual moviegoers who saw this film only because Brad Pitt's name was on it immediately hated it because it ventured past where they wanted to go. Most filmmakers and film enthusiasts who saw, however, fell in love with these visions Malick had and somehow put onto the screen. It's the strangest thing, but this movie was the same way for director Luc Besson. This film is clearly something that had been on the mind of Besson for a long, long time. His thoughts about evolution, time, space, human capabilities, and our purpose overflowed in this film in the most beautiful way. When the movie started I expected to see Scarlett Johansson riding a motorcycle being chased by some drug lords with machine guns, not a visual analysis of human evolution and why we do what we do with a beautifully unique score playing behind it. Initially, it took me a while to adjust because from the way it was marketed I didn't know this is what I was getting. But after I came to that realization, I started smiling. My favorite part of this film has to be how we were allowed to see into the imagination of Luc Besson, and how he translated that onto the screen. The visuals in this film were absolutely outstanding, providing a legitimate feast for the eyes. From the animation of the electrical anatomy of the human body, and the visualization of cellular and radio waves, to a perfectly written and choreographed travel through time. There's a brief sequence in this movie where Besson creates a time lapse where we see in reverse the construction of Times Square in New York. This moment sent me to the edge of my seat with genuine excitement. The entire movie provides instances of extraordinary visualizations, which in the end makes the film as good as it is. My only recommendation for this movie is to not expect what the film's advertisements say this movie is going to give. As an action flick this movie falls very short. It has the formula car chase, and one or two scenes where we get to see Johansson kick some butt, but overall there really is not much action. There is also very little story to this film, which is perhaps the biggest surprise of all. If this is realized though, there is only one thing about this movie that remains undesirable. The length. Just as film reaches its ultimate climax that it has been hinting at for the entire 90 minutes, it ends. I have never come to a conclusion whether or not it's a good thing for a movie to leave you wanting more, but here I felt the problem was instead that it didn't give you enough. So as I walked out of the theater, the credits had finished and I still wanted to stay. I give ""Lucy"" an 8.0/10."
"Wuchakk","9","13","28","8 September 2014"," Time to GROW UP
","""Lucy"" (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi). <br/><br/>It should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, ""Powder"" (1995) and ""Phenomenon"" (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while ""Powder"" reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's ""Youth Without Youth,"" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include a remotely entertaining story. <br/><br/>""Lucy"" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Lucy"" includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, ""Lucy"" is stylish and ""hip,"" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizazz.<br/><br/>Some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality. <br/><br/>What's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?) <br/><br/>In regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? <br/><br/>Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.<br/><br/>Less spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, ""I was thinking the exact same thing."" What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge."" Although they're exaggerated in the film they're REAL.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time ""partying"" and pursuing a ""cute guy with nice buns"" (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to ""All things in moderation""? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.<br/><br/>My praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy? <br/><br/>The film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 89 minutes and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.<br/><br/>GRADE: A<br/><br/>Needless to say, I love ""Lucy""!"

This is one of those films that you completely understand while you're watching it but the minute you walk out the door you wonder 'what the heck was that about?????' Having said that, it was a gripping film. Scarlet Johansson played Lucy, a girl caught up in a deal gone bad, and who undergoes a transformation which enable her to unlock the full potential of her brain and pass on her knowledge to other people. Aided by a French policeman and an eminent Professor (played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman), she manages to direct her knowledge in the right direction. Classed as an action/sci fi/thriller this film gives you much to wonder about whilst admiring the superb performance given by Johansson as she undergoes her transformation. Definitely needs to be watched on the big screen."

","this film was enjoyable on so many different levels, as an action thriller,a science fiction epic as fantastic and futuristic as 2001 was in its time , and a homage to empowered women.<br/><br/>If you like to see women kick ass you will love this film. Johannsen's chemically induced superpowers are both hilarious and awesome at the same time. They are also weirdly believable. Although the film begins with some graphic violence it does not seem gratuitous .as the film becomes more science fiction than action the violence although as graphic can be very funny. I haven't enjoyed a film so much for ages. It ticked all the boxes for me."
"snipereve-938-816718","10","13","28","12 August 2014"," To enjoy, REMEMBER, this is a fictional story
","This movie is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>If Oprah, Deepak Chopra, Steven Spielberg, post 2006 David Deida, Roger D. Nelson (director of the Global Consciousness Project) and a dash of Michael Bay got together and created a movie about the power of the mind or existentialism this would be it. I am glad I went to see it despite the mixed reviews it received. The important thing to keep in mind when watching this movie is that IT IS FICTION. This is someone's interpretation of what it would be like if it were true that accessing 100% of one's brain really did unlock ""super powers"". Also keep in mind, that although there are some action scenes, this is not what this movie is about.<br/><br/>This movie provided the perfect visual summary of everything I love reading about in regards consciousness, mind over matter, time and space, etc... I LOVED IT.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about this film is that it didn't go deep in trying to explain where the theories of what she was experiencing came from or even trying to convince the viewers about this. Instead, in the beginning of the film Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is giving a lecture about his theory about brain potential and uses dolphins as an example (there abilities to use sonar), this lecture provides the ""baseline"" for what later in the movie Lucy experiences. The format in which the story unfolded was by displaying on the screen the percentage of brain power Lucy was using, then cutting to the scene and what Lucy was doing. I think this is the type of movie, that you leave the theaters to discuss with your friends, not one that should have a part II.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes that were not my favorites, but I understand why they needed to be included. For example (spoiler) when she is in the car, and wants to tune in to a cell phone conversation, she uses the car's windshield like a touch screen, to move the ""circuits"" around until she zooms into the actual conversation. I get why it was needed, to visually represent what she was doing (focusing on listening into the conversation) and also because it looked cool but Despite this, it's my favorite 2014 movie."

","Before I went in to see the movie, I had high expectations. The trailers were amazing, intriguing and promised a lot. It turned out to be a total disaster. To begin with the premise of the movie is flawed. It has been proved that humans access 100% of their brains every day but not all of it together at any given time. Assuming you choose to overlook this glaring misconception, everything else about this movie isn't that great either. It looks like bunch of clips put together. Story has no flow, the acting is terrible and story, direction lacks creativity. The special effects were copied from matrix and ton of other movies. At the end of the movie Scarlett Johansson hands out a USB drive containing all the knowledge of the world was hilarious. Seriously, that's the best the director could think of! I want my money back. It is baffling how this movie even got a rating over 5!"
"PyroSikTh","9","12","26","26 August 2014"," Substitues Sci-fi for Phi-fi.
","Honestly? I hadn't really given Lucy much thought. I had seen the trailer a long time ago and completely forgot about it, to the point where when it came out in America and topping the box office I was left thinking ""What film is this? I've never even heard of 'Lucy'."" I had, I just hadn't remembered the name. The trailer instantly piqued my interest with it's whole 10%-100% of the brain dealio. I don't care if it's scientifically accurate or not, if I wanted that I'd watch a documentary. Anyway the point is it's a theory that's always fascinated me. If we did only use 10% of our brains, the possibilities we could unlock at 100% are simply unimaginable. Limitless attempted the same theory, but was decidedly bland and inconsequential. Within the first few minutes, Lucy had surpassed Limitless, and maintained it's quality throughout.<br/><br/>Lucy, more than anything, is a philosophical sci-fi movie. It's not about the science, it's about the unimaginable. So yeah, it can get a bit unbelievable when she starts throwing people across the room with telekinesis, but it's the natural path to her destination, which is philosophical in nature and certain to spark debate. The movie, especially early on, is peppered with seemingly out-of-place shots of the order of nature. The scene of various animals getting jiggy with it even made the immature teenagers behind me annoyingly burst into fits of giggles. For me though? It added an extra dimension and weight to the overall themes of the movie. What is life? What's it's goal? Where are we, as a species, heading? The opening lines ""We've been evolving on this planet for a billion years, and what have we done with it?"" speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Another key theme of Lucy is that of humanity and how it relates to the natural order of things. We are the only animals with self-awareness, and by extension a sense of morals. Most movies take the human side by appealing to our humanity and highlighting that it's what makes us unique. Lucy doesn't quash that approach. Instead it suggests an alternate viewpoint; that our humanity is what's holding us back and disrupting the natural order of things. The more knowledge and clarity Lucy gains, the more she becomes disconnected from her humanity; from her emotions. She doesn't feel sad or afraid, she doesn't even feel pain. They're all things that get in her way of reaching 100% brain capacity.<br/><br/>However, this is still a Luc Besson movie, and Luc Besson likes his action scenes. Amidst all the philosophical ideas batting around, we get a lot of what feels like superfluous scenes that don't really add much. And it's true. They don't add much to the themes and ideas at all. They're pretty much put there to quicken up the pace a bit, provide some light entertainment, and to further the plot along, because the movie does still have a plot believe it or not, but I'll get to that in a minute. The more superficial scenes are very well done, as Besson is known for. Who knew a chase through Paris involving only one car could be so hugely entertaining (if a bit over-the-top; cars flipping and smashing into each other all over the place, in the middle of a busy city)? There's also quite a bit of tension early on. The introduction of Mr Jang near the beginning is surprisingly scary, as you can't help but imagine yourself in Lucy's shoes.<br/><br/>The plot is reasonably simplistic. Lucy unwittingly becomes a smuggler of a new drug being put into the market, but a bit of mistreatment along the way results in her suffering a massive overdose of the drug giving her an explosion of cell development (thus the whole brain capacity theory). She escapes and goes on a rampage to recover the other packets of this new drug to keep her mental growth sustained. Feeling lost and confused, she also contacts a scientist who's been researching the theory for decades. Naturally everything comes colliding together in an epic climax worthy of comparison to 2001's Starchild.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson isn't going to win any Oscars for her emotionless performance, but it deserves commendation nonetheless. Now, I've never been a particularly big Johansson fan. I've always found her to be just a pretty, slutty face adding little to no weight to her roles. Lucy is only the second time I've been genuinely impressed by her work (the first time being Black Widow's manipulation of Loki in Avengers). She starts the film as a bit of a bimbo. Not in a cartoony kind of way as is often portrayed, but she definitely makes a point to make this more human Lucy stand-out from her more cold and efficient Lucy later on. Also, while her performance is fittingly emotionless (as is the point), she does manage to bring a lot of weight to the character. The stand-out example here is with her phonecall to her mother, as she relives memories and experiences she shouldn't remember, like a cat she had when she was barely a year old, or suckling on her mother's teet (yeah, that got the teenagers behind me giggling as well). I wouldn't go so far as to call it a heart-wrenching scene, but it added to Lucy's character development almost purely thanks to the emotion Johansson managed to get across. Again, you couldn't help but empathise.<br/><br/>Lucy has been getting a lot of hate, and honestly I can't understand why. It's got a good balance of action and plot, and themes and philosophy. It's 2014's intelligent blockbuster. It's got a little bit for everyone, from a car chase through the busy streets of Paris to the mind-boggling finale, from the tense introduction of the antagonist to the emotional phone-call. Maybe people are just taking the pseudoscience too literally? I didn't and instead I saw the deeper meaning quite unsubtly placed beneath the surface."

It would be good to put in subs when Lucy can understand Korean though.<br/><br/>Cons: The director treats us like idiots. Eg when Morgan Freeman talked about disaster, the movie shows clips of hurricanes and earthquakes, like we don't know what is disaster. Nothing is ever explained There is no motivation for the bad guy Lucy suddenly change from wimpish to brave instantaneously without explaining that the drug will cause her to be immune to pain etc. Movie is too short<br/><br/>Overall, just watch if you want to look at pretty images for 1.5 hours."

However, ones interested in modern philosophy would find the film intriguing, worth of second view for thinking again how Luc Besson presented some subjects.

This is a movie, not a documentary. <br/><br/>Luc did a great job writing and directing this baby of his. The effects are amazing and he did enough research to fully accomplish this film.

","I loved this film for many reasons. It's only fair to say though, that in my opinion, an archetypal cult classic is one of the most difficult types of films there is to make, and they don't happen often. So I it is with the highest praise that i consider this to be an archetypal cult classic. The way that writer/director Luc Besson chose to present this incredibly thought provoking idea, was brilliant. This was some heavy duty philosophy, and rather than try to deliver something that could have easily turned into an over produced philosophical info dump, he borrowed, authentically I might ad, from the world of super heroes, took us on a brilliantly paced, exciting, and original journey that allowed us to follow his thought process and see the potential implications of his vision, through the use of analogy. Of course Morgan Freeman was stellar. The casting was wonderful, and the roles well acted. Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job. Remember, there are not many female roles like this to draw from, since it's only recently that roles like this exist for women. She is a pioneer and I believe she nailed it."

Well, somehow then managed to create characters that the audience does not care about at all. I mean seriously the main character ""Lucy"" had no introduction beyond her name, How am i supposed to care about a character I know nothing about? This one is a PASS! Don't waste the money! You will leave wishing Lucy had died in the opening sequence. That would have saved you the 90 minutes of pure action with no storyline.<br/><br/>Then there was the cinematography.... I was super confused with the opening sequence that was made up of flashes from Lucy to Freeman, then to national geographic footage??? With none of the clips containing enough info to get a handle on the story. Hence the lack of feelings for any of the characters...<br/><br/>I love movies, and I really expected this to be a great summer blockbuster, but sadly even Scarjo and Freeman could not save this story-less plot, and awkward cinematography...<br/><br/>I gave it a 2 to even out the overly high user reviews.

"rajivness","8","11","24","12 October 2014"," U must watch this!! Matrix meets Carrie meets Underworld meets Limitless
","I loved this movie. Let me just get that out of the way.<br/><br/>I was left with a WHoAAAA!!! Feeling - which is kinda rare given the garbage that studios release these days.<br/><br/>Lucy is a movie about an ordinary (dimwitted, think Clueless) girl who's abroad and is partying her guts out and is somehow unwittingly ensnared by some ruthless Korean Drug traffickers who use her as a mule to transport an experimental party drug which is implanted in her belly.<br/><br/>She gets beaten/molested and the drug someone gets into her blood stream and gives her superhuman powers by allowing her to access all of her brain capacity progressively i.e. 15% to 20% to 30% to 40% to 100%.<br/><br/>OK, so this movie is by no means original. Limitless explored the same concept in 2011 through the drama/thriller genre - where a Smart pill allows you to become super-humanly smart and basically able to do anything (like becoming a prodigy day trader or best selling author overnight) - like that 90s TV show - The Pretender (1996-2000). The action in this movie is greatly inspired by the Matrix and Underworld - which also has a female bad ass action hero (Trinity, Selene) as the main character. And yes, because she can access ALL of her brain capacity she has telekinesis as well (Carrie) and can move stuff by just thinking it. It is visually as appealing as watching Magneto movie stuff in the Xmen movies. Makes you think, ""wish, I could do stuff like that"".<br/><br/>You gotta watch this movie. Watch it in the cinemas. Watch it on imax, watch it/own it on BluRay. I give it 8/10 coz the story was greatly 'inspired' from existing material previously shown in other blockbuster movies."

","Luc Besson has always tended towards strikingly different movies - ""Leon the Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element"" being cases in point... strange blue alien woman doing soprano opera anyone? ""Lucy"", both written and directed by Besson, is probably a 'Marmite' (love it or hate it) sort of film, as whilst it delivers a solid sci-fi story it is done in such a quirky style that some may find it distracting and irritating.<br/><br/>Me? I love Lucy! <br/><br/>Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) starts the film as a frightened gazelle-like student in Taipei (for reasons unclear in the film) where she is tricked into a dirty drug exchange with local Yakuza (or whatever the Taipei equivalent is) godfather Mr Jang (Min-sik Choi).<br/><br/>Things turn ugly when Lucy is forced into becoming a drug mule and when things go unpleasantly wrong the drugs have a radical effect on her body, allowing her access to increasingly large percentages of her brain function. Unable to control the process she contacts brain specialist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) to ask for his help (not that he seems to have much of a say in things as it turns out). As Lucy's powers escalate the need for more of the drug causes her to pursue the other drug mules around the world and a collision course with Jang and his henchmen becomes inevitable.<br/><br/>Johansson has been described as a modern day Marilyn Monroe, and you can see where that comes from in her striking curves, bone structure and pouty looks. However (as brilliantly shown earlier in the year in the excellent ""Under the Skin"") she can turn her features to an other-worldly look that suit this film perfectly.<br/><br/>Co-star Freeman has very little to do in this film though, which is a bit of a shame: his lines seem to be rather short and sanctimonious. The words ""spare part"" spring to mind. Amr Waked makes more of an impression as the local Paris police chief who has to protect Lucy.<br/><br/>Also worthy of note is Eric Serra's electronic score, which suits the mood perfectly.<br/><br/>But hats off to Besson, blending '2001' like monkey business with animal sex cut-ins with a journey to the start of creation as a roller-coaster ride of dizzying speed: at 89 minutes, this is another example of 'less is more' in film running times. A brilliant time travel scene set in Times Square is just marvellously done, posing fascinating questions about the origins of intelligent man.<br/><br/>The only disappointment for me was the ending which (no spoilers) I found rather perfunctory. However, Lucy is a mainstream film that is both thrilling, gripping and thoughtful in equal measure. Recommended.<br/><br/>(If you found this review useful please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!. Thanks.)"

The movie had an interesting start, but at a running time of only 90 minutes, the movie can only get so deep. The movie lacked passion, creativity, and to be honest, i couldn't wait to get out of the theater. Not only did Johansson's character fail to captivate the audience, but the film overall was very predictable, and included many unneeded characters as well as questionable plot twists.

"carleemc97","7","12","27","11 August 2014"," Lucy Movie Review
","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Having not seen the trailer before going to see ""Lucy,"" I was unsure exactly what to expect. Ultimately, I left the theatre with mixed feelings about this film, which was both written and directed by Luc Besson.<br/><br/>The film begins with Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, being talked into delivering a briefcase for someone she barely knows. Unbeknownst to Lucy, the briefcase is filled with a synthetic drug which allows humans to maximize their brain's full potential. The great Professor Norman's lectures show the scientific explanation of such things as ""The Big Bang Theory"" and the evolution of the animal kingdom and humans alike.<br/><br/>Near the film's end, Lucy, who was previously captured and used as a human vessel for transporting the drugs, attempts to attach herself to a computer. (The drugs leaked out into her body. While this allowed her to access 100% of her brain's power, the drugs also destroyed her physical body.) By attaching to the computer, she was preserving her journey for Professor Norman, who had been studying the human brain for decades. This is where the film really took an unexpected turn, as it became full-blown sci-fi and very strange (i.e., Lucy is sitting in an office chair in the middle of a body of water with a monkey). While the film revisits the evolutionary process in just under 90 minutes, I feel the film would have been better-served if it had simply ended 10-15 minutes before it actually did.<br/><br/>Great use of music and imagery throughout, coupled with non-stop action and occasional humor, made for an entertaining film. Perhaps this film is not for those who are very young, very knit-picky about facts, or very religious."

","Luc Besson has always been one of the most creative and original filmmakers therefore he has been one of my favorite directors. Besson, known for strong female leads, continues to do his best in Lucy. After Mathilda in Leon we get another woman who doesn't let herself to be kicked around.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson, always delivers an amazing performance. In Lucy she perfectly captures all the ranges of her character. From the scared, clueless woman to the fearless, no nonsense all knowing, all powers possessing ""god"". Morgan Freeman does his standard routine of an explaining professor but there is nothing wrong with that he fits into the story flawlessly. Amr Waked as the policeman Pierre Del Rio, who helps Lucy is a great addition to an already diverse cast. Besson always had knack for attention-grabbing villains and Mr. Jang played by Min-sik Choi is no exception.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the trailers made this film seem like an action ride this film is more than anything a celebration of humanity. The theory that people use only 10 percent of their brain is proved to be false but here it is used as a metaphor. By which Besson is trying to say that we are not using our fullest potential. Imagine, if we really tried hard enough to not be that lazy, to be more creative and to be adventurous. So the film's message is wrapped around a summer action fare but I think that most moviegoers should not just pass this along as a science nonsense and give it a second thought.<br/><br/>I have also loved the use of inter cutting to documentary shots to emphasize the situation the character is currently in. For example the shot of the mouse approaching the mousetrap. By this Besson proves that there still are new and fun ideas how to present an idea. I also love how some films are just definitely written by Luc Besson and you can sense from a mile away. The premise, ideas and action scenes are just so Besson you know nobody else could have come up with them.<br/><br/>In short, if you love Scarlet Johannson, Luc Besson's work, an amazing scifi film with some message to give you something to think about, then Lucy will certainly will be an enjoyable time at the cinema."

And this one was utter garbage.<br/><br/>For some reason, it made me more angry than any movie for a long time. Probably relates to a feeling, that it sees a typical viewer swallowing anything without hesitation (which might not be far from truth, regarding some favoring reviews).<br/><br/>It's like: ""We can add some shooting and a car chase. And all the other standard stuff, you know. And Freeman can preach some stupid pseudo mumbojumbo which doesn't make any sense as we just made it up at the coffee table."" Come on - they don't even try to and you eat from their hands!"
"Robert_duder","4","11","25","17 November 2014"," A fascinating thriller whose style overcomes its shortcomings
","Lucy was one of those films that I really wanted to see during its initial run but kept missing and putting off until it was gone from theatres. Finally I got the opportunity to see it and I'm happy to report that the anticipation did not ruin the film. It was an interesting thriller with plenty of action and it wasn't until long after the film was over I started to think about how ridiculously implausible the entire concept was and yet while the movie was on I never thought twice about it. The story and ideas and visual effects were good enough to make me believe everything it was giving me. I have always been a fan of Luc Besson films and this is no exception though I don't think it has quite the depth or intensity of some of his other work. I think the concept is excellent but the delivery might be just a little bit rushed and perhaps too much is covered in just one film. Still, for a straight up action flick it was worthwhile! My biggest beef with the film was towards the end when really the intensity should be at an all time high it felt like they struggled with ideas to continue the story. When they wrap it up you're left with more questions than answers and a bit of a feeling of being ripped off too.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is a mixed bag for a lot of people. She has done a lot of great films and this was a really good role for her. She spends most of her time as the super-being Lucy but she quickly makes you understand she is just an ordinary girl before it all happens to her. She makes the role believable and she plays it very well. Who can ever say anything bad about Morgan Freeman? The instant this guy joins a cast he adds credit to a film. Its because no matter how big or small the role he plays it well and has incredible charisma on screen. His role is fairly small in the film and I wanted to know more about him but he still was a welcome addition and his scenes opposite Johansson were particularly good. One of the most underused characters in the film and such a typical Luc Besson character (and I mean that in a good way!) is Amr Waked, the French cop who becomes Lucy's unwilling partner. He gives a solid performance in a few small scenes and he's completely underused. I could have watched a whole film with just him and Lucy but there is too much story here. Min-sik Choi is decent as the cold hearted brutal villain but he doesn't get a lot of screen time either.<br/><br/>I guess I just enjoyed Lucy purely for its style. It is lacking in a few key areas and they could have made this really something. But you cannot deny Besson's style and as always his car chase scene was expertly crafted and just different enough to make sure it didn't feel like you had seen it before. He loves action and he loves a story that is just a little bit improbable. At first I didn't understand the ""artistic"" flare of showing predatory animals or flashes of nature but the idea is to make you understand human emotions before watching a human being unlock 100% of their being. To say their brain doesn't really help with their improbable concept. Lucy taps into psychic abilities, mental abilities, physical abilities and spiritual abilities. However, because there is so much there to cover you're left having to fill in a lot of blanks. Still Lucy is fun to watch and while it likely won't stick with you long, it was entertaining enough for the time. 8/10"
"nonowhit2","2","13","31","31 July 2014"," The hype is NOT real!
","Upon seeing the trailer of this movie I was expecting a more kick ass version of Limitless, but what I got was a boring, high budget special effects movie with little to no plot. Personally, I found it difficult to sit through because the action scenes were tedious and there was nothing special about Lucy that the audience could sympathize with. As Lucy unlocked more of her brain capacity, she became more and more robotic and heartless. In one scene she actually killed an innocent patient in a hospital, because he had a fatal brain tumor. Why the hell wouldn't she use her unlimited knowledge for good?! I guess they spent all their money on Scarlett Johansson being in their movie, instead of a good plot and realistic characters. I left the cinema with more questions about the movie than when I came in!<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities were: 1.at the beginning of the movie, clips of ""national geographic""-like footage of wild animals and nature were used to demonstrate evolution 2. Scarlett Johansson y'all! 3. the special effects were amazing towards the end. In all honesty, this movie started with great, unlimited potential. They wasted it on a boring plot, generic bad drug lords and a sexy girl. Why the hell doesn't Hollywood give the audience what they want to see. The hype is NOT real!"

","Let me preface by saying that as a student of Biology and a future doctor, I knew this movie would challenge my ability to suspend belief based on an absolutely idiotic premise which has been discussed to death. I can suspend belief in just about any sci-fi movie but a movie so blatantly moronic I actually felt tortured watching it.<br/><br/>During my undergrad I dabbled in neuroscience and even philosophy. The movie was just scene after scene of beautiful putrid garbage that spits in the face of biology and physics. The greatest issue was that the storyline was thinner than a surgeons scalpel. It was essentially Scarlett acting melodramatic and constantly changing her power levels (which didn't correlate to the 'percentage' whatsoever). <br/><br/>The most adorable thing was the 'writers' attempt to bring up a fundamental existential question. Can someone give the idiot writers a joint so he can at least match the theories of 13yo stoners? I've never actually seen a movie with a weaker premise, I wish I was making that up. <br/><br/>I really can't review this much further, my brain is still numb after being subdued to this (I had to stay till the end because of friends). Please do yourself a favor, if you have beyond high school knowledge in biology and physics stay far, far away. Don't fund this idiocy. Go watch matrix or something."

","If ""Lucy"" is proof of anything, it is that a movie, no matter how good the acting or visual effects are, is only as good as its script.<br/><br/>Unknowingly and unwillingly participating in a drug trafficking operation where the drugs are bagged and put inside the person's body, the bag Lucy holds within her is broken open, releasing a powerful drug which allows her to use more than 10% of her brain. She can analyze problems faster, perform telekinesis, can telepathically see around the world, and control electrical objects. However, when she realizes that without the rest of the drugs her body will not be able sustain itself, she sets out to find the other bags of drugs until she finally reaches 100%.<br/><br/>Roll credits. Seriously, the movie ends right when she reaches 100%. Though some may conclude this to be a film with an open ending, I believe ""Lucy"" to be an entirely incomplete movie throughout. Sub plots are started throughout the movie, but are never resolved or even touched base on after it is started. For example, a cop joins Lucy to find the drugs and he says after one action scene where Lucy easily killed everyone ""I don't think I'm much help to you."" To which she replies: ""But you are. As a reminder."" And then the subject is dropped for the rest of the movie. Never says for what the cop is a reminder for (of what it's like to be human) and the conversation is pointless because it is not referenced at all throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not even going into the concept itself which is taken to the point of being extremely unbelievable to a sci-fi geek like me, and that problem also lies within the script. I think science fiction is supposed to be believable, either based on actual theories we currently use and take it to the next level (Superhero movies, ""Ender's Game"", etc.) or completely ridiculous with its own scientific rules made clear to the audience (""Doctor Who"", ""Star Wars"", etc.). ""Lucy"" tries to do both, but fails. It takes its own concept beyond belief (travelling through time and space with your mind?).<br/><br/>Though well acted and directed, Lucy falls flat with its incomplete story and, at times, rather corny dialogue."
"trollworkout","1","15","37","4 August 2014"," Bad movie.
","I'll make it short and to the point.<br/><br/>1. The premise for this movie is wrong. We don't use only 10% of the brain not do we use 3%, 7%, 27% or any other number. Urban myth proved wrong many times over. <br/><br/>2. Dialogue is often really bad. Really bad acting that breaks the immersion. Overacting, underacting and fake acting pretty common. I counted only once that the dialogue was interesting.<br/><br/>3. This movie promotes dumb urban myth based pseudoscience that has already been proved wrong and from that point of view is not as much a science fiction as is just plain stupid. <br/><br/>4.

","I really liked this film. I'll go ahead and give 3 examples of CONS that made me and my friend say ""what?"" but the majority of the movie was great. The 1st CON was, the villains in the film aren't very intimidating and it made no sense for the boss to still be around by the end. 2nd CON was there is a scene where all these Korean bad guys are pulling assault weapons out of their cars in front of a building and tons of cops are arriving and running right past them. Not one cop said, ""HEY..They shouldn't have assault weapons."". The 3rd CON was how can so many Americans live in another country, try to get employment and not speak ANY Taiwanese or the local language? I lived in Japan and the first thing you do is try to learn the local language. Even the most basic things to say. That was all I really had to say bad. -- I really liked the film overall. They took the time to explain most of the movie for the people of limited intellect that are giving this a low rating. If you didn't get it, you never will. Stick to the Sponge Bob movie. The concept of ""mind over matter"" is nothing new. I really liked how they progressed the film in this capacity. I also liked how they didn't make her play ""Black Widow"" all over again. Lucy doesn't have to lay a finger on you and you can't touch her. Although the movie has lots of action, it's not Lucy punching or kicking people. -- I liked that after 1 week, there was still a pretty full theater going to see it. It's still taking in money."

","This movie starts out slow paced with interesting cut aways and references to life and the human intelligence. Before you know it, tension and drama build and you're sucked into a story that you cannot pull your eyes away from the screen. Luc Besson takes a very interesting and alternative imaginary view into the idea of the human brain becoming fully unlocked. While similar to Limitless, this take on the potential of the human brain goes further into science fiction/action based drama. Can't forget about the quick witty comedic lines that are known best from the mind of Luc Besson. Scarlett Johannson and Morgan Freeman make a great team together as soon as they join together on screen."
"luciebultot","Null","9","20","26 October 2014"," Lucy (2014)
","Lucy is a fascinating action and sci-fi movie by Luc Besson featuring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. They play the role of Lucy and the french professor Norman.<br/><br/>It is about a 25 years old girl, called Lucy, who gets caught by the Korean mafia for smuggling experimental drugs into Europe. By accident, she'll take the drug. <br/><br/>The plot is based on the effects of this drug on Lucy and, on the other hand, on the thesis of the professor Norman who says that the human only uses 10% of its mental capacities. They'll both make discoveries about humans because the experimental drug increases the mental capacities of Lucy and she'll be able to use 100% of her capacities.<br/><br/>I didn't intend to see this film at all but as everyone spoke about it, I decided to watch it. And, actually I did well.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this film despite the fact that there are to many special effects at the end, in my opinion. Even if it's quite unrealistic, the story is shown in a such original and attractive way that we can't not be interested in it.<br/><br/>The storyline is very gripping. The way the drug increases the capacities of Lucy is amazing. I especially enjoyed the comparison between the thesis of the professor and the reality of Lucy.<br/><br/>As far I'm concerned, I'm totally keen on the main actors ; Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. I've never been disappointed by their acting and I found them once more amazing in this film. <br/><br/>I would strongly recommend the film to anyone who loves action films and who wants to experience something new because the way the film-makers have done it is incredibly original."
"my_lost_nebula","10","9","20","11 October 2014"," I guess, either you gonna love it or hate it
","Wow, so many contradictory opinions... I gave this movie 10 out of 10, mainly because it scored so low, and I just don't get why. But that fact put aside, I would've still given it at least 9.<br/><br/>Yes, it rotates around the famously misleading theory that humans use only 5-10% of their brains. Although saying that, I keep thinking about the book ""My stroke of insight"" written by a brain scientist who suffered a stroke in her left hemisphere. What she wrote about her suddenly emerged ability to feel herself united with everything around her... isn't that something very few people among us can tell about themselves? Anyway, away from the book, back to the movie.<br/><br/>This misleading assumption put aside, the movie is unbelievable. If you are ready to tell your internal voice of a skeptic to shut up for about an hour and a half and explore the idea of ""What if...?"", you'll love this movie. The acting is great, the idea is sort of mind-blowing and it does make you think what things actually should matter in your life and how we are just wasting it on things that have no value at all. Well, at least, I felt this way.<br/><br/>I would also like to ponder on one line I read in another review. Somebody was wondering why Lucy cares about passing the knowledge to the humanity, but at the same time didn't care about all those people who possibly died in the car crashes she caused. There was a line in this comment saying that an increase of her brain power and being suddenly devoid of empathy didn't make any sense. Well, it makes perfect sense to me, considering Lucy's line ""We don't actually die"". In fact, we don't, because we pass all the knowledge written in our genes onto our children, and so on, and so on. It's not the life-memory-kind-of knowledge, but it's the knowledge necessary for becoming more and more adapted to the environment, and therefore, having more chances to survive. (I don't even want to dive into another theory saying that, since we are all energy, and energy doesn't disappear but transforms into something else, we don't die but live further in some other kind of state). And what, from the perspective of evolution, can be more valuable than that? It's not about a single human being, because there are so many of us. So, I guess, a super-mind can be devoid of empathy to a particular man or woman, but it does care about transferring the knowledge valuable for the humankind... Besides, maybe, if you ARE united with the universe, and time, and nature, and gravity, and and and... maybe the life of a single human being doesn't seem that important at all? I don't know, and I guess, we'll never know if that could be true. However, I can imagine that it can explain some of the ""irrational"" moments in this movie. All in all, great watch."

The movie was set up so well that i think a lot of people started to view it as ""educational"" and forgot it is fiction. The movie is beautiful and very well done. It was difficult for me to deal with the character personalities for the first 15 minutes but there turned out to be an excellent explanation for that.<br/><br/>It was certainly the most entertaining movie I have seen all year.

","To add to the bibliography, another show in the this genre is ""The Sixth Finger,"" The Outer Limits (October 1963). David McCallum plays a miner with ambition. He volunteers for a process to ""advance the intelligence of mankind."" He is administered drugs, and enters a machine that initially takes his mind 20,000 years into the future, eventually reaching 1 million years of evolution, and a sixth finger. As he advances, he progresses from reading minds to telekinesis, callously stopping the heart of a cook who he perceived as a threat. Eventually he reaches the precipice of human development, prepared to shed his human body and become a creature of pure energy. Along the way, he also evolved from contempt for ""lesser humans"" to realizing total peace and oneness with all life before the simple town girl who loves him brings him back to his ""normal"" state, and he dies an unfortunate death. We'll never know how much he retained from the experience.

","As a scientist I did not expect much after seeing the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, the plot has ideas that are quite possible, some are well-stolen from Einstein, but that is more than enough for the sci- part of this movie. Now the fantasy part is on a par with Luc's previous Fifth Element and maybe even the Space Odyssey. The combination of strong acting by Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi, Luc's brave ideas with little boundaries, and very fast pace makes Lucy incredibly entertaining. This movie will keep you glued to the screen and leave you with some philosophy to think about afterward. The reason why it did not get higher ratings is probably because it could be more scientifically accurate."

","I give it a solid 7. Don't expect to see this title on the academy award list. That said, and I admit to being an avid sci-fy fan, i totally enjoyed it. Fast moving from the very beginning, it hooks you rather quickly and doesn't let up. The story is about a woman forced to traffic an experimental drug in her body. Without giving anything away, the bag breaks and allows Lucy to use a steadily increasing amount of her brain. That's all i will say as you really need to see this without any preconceived opinions. The acting was excellent. What can you say about Morgan Freeman that isn't redundant? What surprised me was Ms Johansson. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance as I am not one of her biggest fans. The supporting cast was solid as well. Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed."
"Floated2","8","10","23","17 October 2014"," Exceeds Entertainment
","The first two acts, however, are compelling and find Lucy playing out the scenario Norman describes, escaping from — and later eluding — the mobsters, first with a gun, then with nothing other than her rapidly increasing brainpower. Johansson plays Lucy's transformation as believably as possible, starting as a hysterical mess and becoming cold, detached, something beyond human, almost robotic as her enhanced capacity takes her far past the capabilities of anyone else. Examining the toll it takes on Lucy allows us, for a time at least, to forget that it's all basically hogwash. Lucy wants to be a cerebral movie, but its smarts, if you want to call them that, haven't the slightest basis in reality and are, along with the budget, outweighed by Besson's overreaching ambition. The director is at his best crafting an action set piece — and he gives us a few of them here — though what Lucy eventually becomes capable of makes the death and destruction left in her wake, including a lengthy shootout between Parisian police and Taiwanese mobsters, seem trivial."

","Lucy does seem like one of those films you'll either love or hate. I personally loved it. It's a combination of action and sci fi that is pure entertainment from start to finish. <br/><br/>There's a lot of great action scenes (car chases, shoot outs etc) especially when Lucy completely wipes out a bunch of people with one move. There's also some pretty gruesome scenes which may make you wince a little. Then there is once scene where Lucy makes a phone call to her parents, this is pretty emotional and allows the viewer to feel more attached to her. <br/><br/>The film is mostly over the top action which is very entertaining and visually looks great. The music played throughout the film made it more atmospheric but at times there would be some very witty one liners to change the mood. There was plenty of cool looking scenes and enough suspense to keep me glued to the screen. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson was superb in the lead role (I think these sort of roles really suit her). Morgan Freeman was a good choice for the professor and the rest of the cast all done a good job too. <br/><br/>The ending was perhaps a bit of an anti climax but overall it's a great way to spend 85 minutes if you want to watch a film for pure entertainment. A very unique film and perhaps one of the most underrated films of 2014 - liked it a lot more than I thought I would. <br/><br/>9/10."

","This apparently isn't the first movie that takes the myth of human beings' 20% limit access to their brains, the obvious comparison to this is 2011's Limitless, but that one uses the concept for only gaining all knowledge from memories and dealing with drug side effects. This movie takes beyond the advantages, it gives a theory that reaching to100% percent might also turn people into some sort of a superhero. Through it all, it's just too ridiculous to take seriously. Fortunately, that is not what the film wants, it just examines every single detail of this absurd idea without hindering anymore subplot. Lucy is just an intense rapid fire set of unrelenting imaginations, while it's pretty dumb, it's still a pretty amazing thing to experience.<br/><br/>The plot is plain simple; it goes from a task gone wrong to a basic revenge thriller. The film has two palpable things to describe: one is the chase sequences that feels like playing Grand Theft Auto, knowing all the cheat codes, and then type them away to get an easy escape. The other is the exposition of the idea that appears to be a wannabe The Tree of Life. This combination of chaotic action and dumb science does come in handy, but it doesn't bother building anything larger to the themes of the story other than explaining the brain and human existence. Even though it's quite preposterous, the film does have a sense of fun. It takes no limits and let Lucy's abilities flow, even if it controls space and time. These sequences are just too priceless: the grandness, speed, and wondrous visuals that display on screen will keep giving you the endless frenzy you'll get in recent memory.<br/><br/>Director Luc Besson is never afraid of showing off these things, no matter how stupid it all sounds and looks. No storyteller could express such ideas like Besson. The action scenes are pure mayhem, from bloody violence to cars crashing like it's not a big deal for the heroes. As the plot goes, it gets dumber and dumber, but that is, in the end, the point of the film. Any argument against it is invalid, stray whatever it has in mind until its package of imaginations explode. The acting doesn't need more than it already has: Scarlett Johannson just do what she has to do. There's human emotion then apathetic superhuman emotion, it's all wondrously effective.<br/><br/>Lucy doesn't really need to prove anything smart, another comparison is this year's Transcendence although both may have different concepts, how they push their limits are somehow the same, except Lucy embraces its silliness, therefore that is its own charm, a sci-fi that recreates science only to let the spectacles get out of hand. Because we don't usually see this much insanity in our gritty blockbuster cinema. Sometimes we do need such enthusiastic guilty pleasure that could blow our minds in a different way."

This sets off a series of events that create an expansion of Lucy's brain capacity. Research says that we use only 10% of our brain, but what if we could ramp it up and be able to use all of it. This would seem incredible but would this be ability that we would really want. Lucy is incredible, fast pace, full of suspense and points to questions, without passing judgment or being preachy. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson showcases her full broad skills as an actress as she transitions from a sex kitty to a genius scientific intellectual in the course of the movie.

If one is prepared to suspend judgement and do this, then the film is intriguing.<br/><br/>This film is as much a test of the viewer's preconceptions about using 100% brain capacity, as it is about the actual events in the film. For example, what moral changes occur in Lucy, and how does this relate to her sensory awareness of the personalities of the people she kills? The moral changes are implicit, and unexplored, but evident from her behaviour.

","Only 8 out of 10 because the author/screenwriter made too many assumptions about the audience. With over 900 reviews posted I don't know if anyone has touched on my point or not. So here goes. Many of the references will only be caught by sci-fi fans over the age of 30 who also paid strict attention while in high school or college. That's not a jab at anyone's intelligence. There are simply not many people who find quantum theory exciting. The movie attempts to give a visualization to this not-so-well understood school of thought. Combining fiction along with real science is not easy to do while keeping it entertaining at the same time. An example reference is with the oversized USB flash drive shown at the end. Did anyone else notice it was ""full of stars""? Not glitter...stars. Yep, that's a 2001/2010 A Space Odyssey monolith reference. The shape of the drive along with the stars was a dead giveaway. Whenever a monolith appears in 2001 it is always followed by a major evolutionary jump. What was Lucy experiencing? An evolution of consciousness. What was Lucy seeing during her armchair travel through time? If you also said ""evolution"" then you are correct. She saw the evolution of life on earth as well as the evolution of time and the entire universe itself. Lucy went a step further than 2001/10 in that it shows the interconnections with ALL things at the quantum level and beyond. This is just one of the references in the movie that kept me entertained throughout. The main problem with these kinds of references is that they usually don't translate very well when shown on the screen. Deeper explanations also tend to bore the heck out of an audience so they wind up on the cutting room floor. Again, it's not an audience intelligence issue. It's an audience familiarity issue. Assuming that the audience is as excited and as deeply interested in the same heavy topics as is the writer will usually make for bad ratings and a ""meh"" movie."
"Terryfan","7","4","7","28 April 2015"," What could have been
","Like many of us who watch the Trailer for the motion picture ""Lucy"" we were fired up to say the least.<br/><br/>With Scarlett Johansson as the lead character you would expect to see a strong female protagonist and being co-star with Morgan Freeman what could go wrong? Well I'm about to explain.<br/><br/>The plot of the film centers around a normal everyday young woman named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) who is forced into a dark deal, however she is transformed into a powerful warrior with knowledge beyond the human mind. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is teaching a college class when the two meet and begin to explore Lucy's new powers. <br/><br/>Now what the trailer shows doesn't show you exactly what you would get when it comes to Lucy. It feels like the trailer was used to set a trap for you to think you would get to see a epic action film but what you get is not that at all.<br/><br/>Now there is some action in the film and we get to see how dangerous Lucy is not only that she gain powers that make her body stronger but also her mind is show to be the most dangerous weapon.<br/><br/>But that's where we begin to have our problems with the film, they try to do too much at once between having scenes we see Lucy and how she gets into this mess to seeing Mr.Norman giving a lecture in a college class about the human mind then we pretty much get a film that had a lot more of a film that try to be I couldn't find the word to match it. <br/><br/>Lucy shows that she is one of the most interesting characters in film history it just the idea of mixing a action film like this with a lecture pretty much is mind blowing on how they thought they could get away. The film does feature some amazing special effects and how Lucy's powers are unreal makes you want to watch the film and just watching the film will make you see why Lucy is not the one you want to mess with. <br/><br/>But I did enjoy Scarlett and Morgan performances they did a good job with their talents on the film it just the film would have be much better if it was just like the trailer said it would have been.<br/><br/>I give Lucy an 7 out of 10"
"cxyabc","8","4","7","16 April 2015"," Good movie for entertaining, and maybe some thinking
","Lucy is not a bad movie if you don't consider it as a serious Sci-Fi movie. Yes, Lucy made some silly scientific mistakes like ""10% of human brain"" or ""Lucy suppose to OD"" and blah blah blah. But if you consider it as a simple movie made only for entertainment, than it is pretty OK. It was a fast paced movie that you can have your mouth full of popcorn with, both Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson did very decent job in the movie and she was incredibly gorgeous as usual. It's true that the logic and storyline is not flawless, but it still movie that worth a rate of B and rate A- only for Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson. Anyway, it's a movie for entertaining only, and maybe you can have some thought about human-being after you left theater."
"stevepat99","10","16","42","29 July 2014"," I love Lucy
","I have enjoyed most of Scarlett's films including her work with Woody Allan and Lost in Translation. One recent exception being urrgghhh Under the Skin. What a come back from that one. Given my love of science fiction films this one was, for me, a grand slam.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was fine, as always, in his supporting role. Special effects also takes a big prize. Visuals galore and even better on our local XD 'IMAX wannabee' size screen.<br/><br/>This is a super FUN, action packed gangster/Sci-Fi film that includes the expected (Paris car chase mostly against one way traffic) and also many unexpected moments. The early raw and violent scenes give way to Scarlett's on screen transformation step-by-fun-step.<br/><br/>From Neanderthals and American Indians to intelligence as possibly interstellar pure energy the movie never stops to take a breath in its 89 minutes (it did not seem that short)journey.<br/><br/>Scarlett owns almost every scene and she does a stellar job. The film tosses a half dozen genres into a blender. Scarlett guzzles it down and runs with it.<br/><br/>The script came up with, for me at least, a perfect ending. In this film Scarlett, Morgan, the Paris 'cop' and ultra-evil villain deliver a truly entertaining film."
"GOWBTW","9","7","15","12 August 2015"," Open your minds
","Luc Besson, the genius behind The Transporter movies has done it again. Only this time, he has the way to open people's minds in ""Lucy"". He's got the perfect stars in this film. Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, and Morgan Freeman is a professor who theories ended up being proved by her. College student Lucy(Johansson) is in Taiwan studying, is later duped by her boyfriend who is delivering a package to a dealer. When he gets killed, Lucy ended up being an unwilling mule. She and other mules have drugs seen into their abdominal cavities. Unlike the rest, she gets kicked and the drugs are released into her body, unleashing a phenomenal potential. She developed powers of the mind which she never used: telekinesis, magnetism, mind reading, etc. Whenever the percentage of her brain is used, the more her humanity seems to be leaving her. When she contacted the professor(Freeman), she demonstrates the potential ability of the drugs that enhances her mind. Making her a genius beyond her wildest dreams. The action is fantastic and phenomenal, I can understand the mind of what it can do. I tend to stay away from people who have limited imagination. Just think. Albert Einstein got nothing on ""Lucy"". This movie is pure genius! 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"khalilard-189-508837","1","7","15","29 May 2015"," Maybe if Besson had taken some of the drug, he would've come up with a better movie
","Well, I have to say I came to this movie expecting the worst, and yet still ended up being disappointed. Even nearly a week after watching the movie, I'm still seething from its stupidity. I'll just highlight some of the things that drove me mad. I'm sure I will not be able to cover everything that was wrong with this movie: 1: for some reason, Besson thinks it is smart to splice in scenes of animals while Scarlet and her boyfriend are arguing about her acting as his replacement in an yet undisclosed errand. The message Besson wanted to convey is that Scarlet was walking into a trap (as if we couldn't figure that out on our own). Since we had earlier heard Morgan Freeman talk about the human potential, evolution, and Lucy, the scenes of cheetahs and gazelles were appropriate. The scene of a mouse approaching a trap was definitely not! It stood out like a sore thumb. I mean do we really need so much foreshadowing? Well, given how dumb the movie is, I can understand Besson thinking the average viewer would have an IQ in the single digits.<br/><br/>2: Many commenters have already pointed out the 10% brain myth that I won't delve any deeper here. Read the other comments or look it up on Wikipedia (or a regular encyclopedia if you so prefer).<br/><br/>3: I was especially disappointed in seeing Morgan Freeman in this role. I mean, did we really need a professor explaining some pseudoscience to a packed classroom? What is that supposed to achieve? Give credibility to the premise of the movie? <br/><br/>4: Scarlett's cells in one scene literally try to escape the inhospitable environment she creates when she sips alcohol (although she was using some 40% of her brain by then. So much for smart). She tries to trap them with her hands... feel free to cry here.<br/><br/>5: After the contents of the bag of drugs seep into Johansson's abdomen, she begins to convulse. That includes her defying gravity and sticking to the ceiling. Her eyes turn blue as well...<br/><br/>6: Although Johannson is in Paris when she begins her travels through time, she suddenly moves to New York to complete her journey. Were the producers too lazy to reconstruct Paris through the ages? However, in order to make a point, Lucy meets a CGI 'Lucy' (as in the Australopithecus fossil) although the latter was discovered in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>7: Scarlet Johannson is racing against time in order to transmit all the knowledge she accumulates to Freeman before she 'dies'. However, after she vanishes into thin air, Johansson is able to communicate with the French police officer through his phone, writing: ""I am everywhere"". If she is indeed everywhere and able to control matter, why the rush? She could've communicated with Freeman through whatever medium she chose after she had achieved omnipresence.<br/><br/>8: I found Scarlet's phone call to her mother especially laughable. She calls her mother to say: 'I can feel everything'. And her mother does not find that weird at all! There are many, many, more offenses this train wreck of a movie makes, but I'm getting a headache thinking about them again. It was bad enough I had to watch it once; I don't want to relive it again. Just avoid at all costs. Or, if you can borrow a copy for free, watch it with some friends (preferably biologists) and have a good laugh. Johansson's acting skills (and morals) have been taking a hit lately. I also am deeply disappointed in Morgan Freeman. Luc Besson, on the other hand, has always been bad. Maybe not this bad, but bad..."

","It is (science) fiction. People who complain about the 10% myth probably complain about how impossible it is for Godzilla to breathe fire. I was entertained by this movie because it had action, some sci- fi, and definitely loved the visuals. In the beginning, I thought this movie was going to be another Limitless, but fortunately it was not.<br/><br/>I feel like it could have done more because I didn't feel anything for any of the characters. What kept me watching was the desire to find out what happens when Lucy reaches 100%. The film doesn't have any replay value, but it wasn't a total waste of time. It's a refreshingly new kind of action film that gets you thinking a little about life's purpose."
"auntbeast64","10","7","15","6 August 2014"," By turns horrific, transcendent, sad, and beautiful.
","Now, my love of everything Luc Besson is well known. I'd watch him mow grass, so do I love Monsieur Besson. And Lucy is very likely my favorite Besson film since The Fifth Element (1997), though other strong contenders include Angel A (2005) and Les aventures extraordinaires d'Adèle Blanc-Sec (2010). In fact, in some ways, Lucy is a reworking of the central theme of The Fifth Element: The appearance of a woman who is a ""supreme being."" Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the title role, and I also enjoyed the performances of Min-sik Choi and Amr Waked. Johansson brings to her role an unexpectedly – for me at least – poignant portrayal of a woman whose humanity is being eroded as she becomes something entirely, unimaginably alien. She actually had me near tears twice. The effects are gorgeous, and we are propelled through time, from 2014 to that ""time"" prior to the Big Bang. The editing, as with The Fifth Element, is superb. And, as usual, Besson works with his tried-and-true collaborators, such as Eric Serra (soundtrack) and Thierry Arbogast (cinematography).<br/><br/>That said, the science is, well, not really science at all. The entire film is predicated on the ""Ten percent of brain myth."" This is, of course, complete twaddle. Also, Morgan Freeman's lectures are replete with errors that would have been eliminated by throwing a few bucks at a poor biology grad student. Or checking Wikipedia. For example, we're told at least a couple times that life appeared one billion years ago, when, in fact, the earliest evidence we currently have of life on Earth is 3.7 billion years old. That's a pretty damn big error. And there was a bunch of foolishness about dolphins. However! Truth is, these problems actually didn't detract from the film at all, in my opinion. I think you have to look at what's happening in Lucy as metaphor, and where it takes us in the end is very near to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I give Lucy high marks. It is by turns horrific, transcendent, sad, and beautiful."
"MCMAYNERBERRY","2","12","30","24 July 2014"," Dumb. And not in a good way.
","Let's get the controversial part of the film out of the way: the science is laughably wrong. We will not gain superpowers by using 100% of our brains. With that said, Lucy isn't even an enjoyable mindless action film. It's actually pretty bad.<br/><br/>Lucy is a hodgepodge of concepts lifted from the likes of The Matrix, Akira, Limitless, etc., and manages to not be awesome. The main flaw of the film has to be the main character. Played by Scarlett Johansson, who by the end of the film seems to just not care about actually acting anymore with the robotic nature of her dialogue delivery, the character is one that is meant to be the person you care about the most. Trouble is, I don't care, as she is basically indestructible, and the antagonists are your run of the mill gangsters. No excitement, so sense of danger, nothing. <br/><br/>A scene that rubbed me the wrong way was when Lucy confronts two taxi drivers and kills the one that doesn't speak English. The guy had nothing to do with her dilemma, and she just killed him. It makes me unable to like the protagonist.<br/><br/>The action was fairly underwhelming, which is shocking considering the director of The Fifth Element, The Professional and Taken was at the helm. But it is what it is.<br/><br/>One upside to this film is that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. It ends and you quickly forget you even saw the film<br/><br/>It's mindless, and probably meant to not be taken seriously, but even then, the only time that audiences could enjoy this is if there is absolutely nothing else to do on the day they see this. Lucy is boring, unoriginal and just plain dumb.<br/><br/>Lucy 2/10"

Attractive choices for locations. But the thing that got me the most is the way Scarlet made her character feel so real. That takes some tight directing. The ending was perfect. Luke hit the nail on the head with that one.The story in a nutshell is about how in one day all questions in the Universe were answered to Lucy by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

What power the Buddha have why he teaches us, ways to practice to get to it...<br/><br/>Thanks to this movie, I see this movie, I see his teachings. Knowledge of oneself, nature, and able to access ones abilities as wish. Able to understanding the power of things matter, life as it is described about the power of the lord Buddha in the ancient text, Tripitaka! With the knowledge, this explains why his teaching is so reasonable, so scientific, and never lead with faith! I think there are some facts in this movie!

"teddaclarke","8","8","18","3 September 2014"," Overall a treat, A truly wonderful take on the genre
","Lucy is not the sort of film you would expect to be so good. It's bizarre concept and fast paced story telling is not the average Saturday night film to be put blankly. Much like many other films it provides a great cast playing the roles in pristine character that really makes you empathize (more with Lucy though) with the characters. I'm not sure if you could call it a superhero film as Lucy is not as such a hero, she is not a villain either, she is super, but not taking any sides. Despite this you find her story very compelling and you want to see her be more of a bad-ass and show off what she can do. Much of this film is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that you could find a lot more believable than iron man or Thor (Don't get me wrong I am all for superhero films like them) and you get to see a bad-ass array of abilities from Lucy. However I do have a few complaints, this film goes very quickly, 1. Because it is good 2. Because it is very short and starts to rush. I think that given an extra half hour this movie could have benefited and made a lot more use of some problems encountered earlier on in the film. And also as much as i loved it I wanted to see MORE Lucy as in, more of her being a bad-ass. I felt also a bit let down by the ending, it is rushed and to be honest I wanted to see a showdown between Lucy and all these guys, It would have been epic. But rather we got a rushed ending that made sense but still was lacking in points, sort of like when you get bored of a book so you skim through the end. It doesn't let you take it all in. And I was also left very confused at the abrupt ending. I could go on but I must urge you to see it and find out for yourself what I mean. Like all movies it has its flaws but truly it is a classic sci-fi film."

I found the script well written & well paced at no point did I feel the director was adding filler to make the film longer. Johansson & Freeman are excellent, this again shows what a talented actress Scarlett is & one who is obviously capable of being so much more than eye candy.<br/><br/>To add to my recommendation my partner who generically hates every film absolutely loved this one, so she gives it a 10/10"

"MereFear","10","10","24","14 January 2015"," stretching the imagination
","Lucy does just what fiction should do—explore new ideas, broaden our imaginations, and enhance our perspectives. Advancements in technology depend on creative, intelligent minds thinking of ways to manipulate our world, and fictional stories like this one do half the work by artistically conveying possible worldly manipulations. Though this movie is based on a myth, it provides an important, vivid and emotional storyline, for it explores one of the biggest questions: How should we use our existence?<br/><br/>Ultimately all of us are lost on this puny planet floating amidst countless other planets and stars and asteroids and comets. We pass on our genetics and have been doing that for years upon years upon years, but what have we really become? This movies encourages you to evaluate our species' progress, something that's needed as we speed through the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>Infinite possibilities dwell in this universe and Lucy stunningly illustrates numerous unexplored ones. On a technical standpoint, the cinematography is beautiful, especially toward the end. Instead of trying to derive scientific fact from this movie, see it as material with which to derive a fresh lens for perceiving the world. Fantasy stories contain mythological creatures like dragons, elves, and mermaids, yet they can still prove captivating—so don't discredit this simply because of the 10% myth.<br/><br/>If you're open-minded while viewing this film, then it will easily entertain you. The beginning events spur numerous questions and keep you at the edge of your seat, and the curiosity it evokes lasts until the very end. The strength and originality of Lucy's character, enhanced by Scarlett Johansson's wonderful execution, renders her exciting to watch on screen. Watching this movie is definitely worthwhile; at the very least you'll have a few more things to think about."
"TheMarwood","2","10","24","5 November 2014"," No brain function was used during the writing and making of this film
","What will happen when Luc Besson uses none of his brain while making Lucy? A film with the philosophical insight of a stoned 14 year old boy and is so jaw droppingly stupid, it's frightening to imagine a major theatrical release that's worse than Lucy in 2014. Metaphors are literally shown to the audience with footage of animals, like a mouse being enticed by bate in a mouse trap and it's either Luc Besson's idea of artistic flair or he thinks so little of his audience that he has to spell out even the dumbest scene. Morgan Freeman's speeches about using more than 10% percent of the human brain, even in fantasy movie land, are so simplistic and silly, an audience of children would be more fitting than college students and adults. For someone that has apparently unlocked all of her brain, Lucy doesn't use much of it and has gotten herself drawn into a really terrible action movie - when she could have used her smarts and about 5 minutes to synthesize the drug for herself, or simply duplicate it with her powers. But no, she has to travel the globe to get a few bags from some mules, because the worldwide theatrical box office would benefit from it, not that a modicum of logic should dictate the story. Idiot plotting; dialogue that's equal parts point at the screen hilarious and roll your eyes into the back of your head bad; villains who are typical stock characters that you'd find in your standard straight to video actioner; a climax that was either cut due to budget restraints or Besson just had no ideas outside of throwing his percentage of brain gimmick into the structure of a D grade action film - Lucy is truly out of this world dim-witted."

The character development of Scarlett Johansson is outstanding, and nearly completely different from her performance as ""Black Widow"" (which is also great). <br/><br/>This is NOT a revenge movie, as it was advertised by some dumb folks.

"webyard","10","5","10","30 September 2015"," A movie which is more than meets the eye
","Lucy (2014), a film by Luc Besson, considered a science-fiction movie which hasn't really received good critical reviews is way more than meets the eye (or the mind). If words can reach its infinite meaning, I will be trying to do this here.<br/><br/>What started as a drama in which some characters were being victims of a drug cartel ended up as a philosophical and, literally, mind-blowing movie – compared only to Inception or the very few similar ones. The main character, a woman named Lucy, is a common woman who is forced to transport, she believed, was a synthetic drug. Yet, it proves to be much more than that when she is accidentally affected by that after some (can you imagine) kicks in her stomach. From here on, she becomes much more than a woman, as the professor interpreted by Morgan Freeman explains in flashbacks through the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>As predicted by him, after human beings (in this case Lucy) reaches more than 10% than the potential of the human brain, they beginning to develop what we call paranormal capacities, like controlling gravity, electromagnetism and so on, including other people. And it keeps increasing until one reaches 100% - in which point no one really knows what is going to happen.<br/><br/>This movie develops in a rapid speed from drama, to action, to (a kind of platonic) romance seasoned with lots of sci-fi elements that many would disregard as silly. What can be done about that, though? It also means that this movie becomes much more than a science-fiction movie (most of them), a philosophical movie (which is also one of the reasons Matrix 1 became such a cult movie after one goes beyond that bullet-dodging moment).<br/><br/>The ending is as amazing, actually, much more amazing than what we hoped it to be, since one big question pops to mind and stays there: what would humanity do with so much knowledge that is impossible to even fathom? I bet nobody really knows that answer, though it reminds us how the Devil tempted Jesus in the desert, with all the knowledge in the world (and He refused). However this is not a religious discussion, just one of the most crucial aspects of mankind taken into consideration.<br/><br/>Therefore, I invite you to watch this movie with open mind (pun intended) and no preconceptions of what some trailer containing the first 15 or 30 minutes can present to any viewer."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","11","28","27 July 2014"," 'Lucy' wastes potential on a dull thriller
","Remember the tiny corner of Marvel's The Avengers that Scarlett Johansson occupied? Well, in Lucy, she IS The Avengers. She has not only the powers of Thor, Hulk, Loki and Captain America, but also the powers of The Fantastic Four, The X-Men, Superman, Galactus and the T-1000. It's a potent mixture wrapped up in a pretty blond package that's easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>It's too bad that all that collective power is presented in a dull Jason Bourne-type thriller in which she races down busy streets while being chased by men with guns. When you have a character who can bend her own metabolism and travel through time, who cares about gangsters and car chases? Johansson plays Lucy . . . just Lucy, no last name given. We meet her on the streets of Taiwan with her new boyfriend Richard (Pilou Asbæk) who is trying to coax her into delivering a silver metal briefcase to his boss, Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). Richard ducks and dodges Lucy's reasonable questions like ""What's in the briefcase?"" and ""Why don't you deliver it yourself?"" but he won't budge. One thing leads to another and Lucy finds herself dragged into Mr. Jang 's office and discovers that he is a powerful Korean gangster with an army of armed men and several dead bodies in the next room. Spoilers ahead, so be warned.<br/><br/>Reasonably Lucy is terrified, but she discovers that the effects of the item in the briefcase are changing and restructuring her brain's higher functions. I'm not giving anything away because the trailers already did that, which is unfair, and so is the fact that movie gives away the contents of the briefcase (I will not) and thus takes away a great potential mystery. What is contained therein is kind of uninteresting, but it might have been tasty to let our imaginations work it out.<br/><br/>What was in the briefcase is something the eventually gives Lucy the powers of the cosmic universe. It helps that the scenes of Lucy being roughed up are interspersed with an explanation from a certain Dr. Norman (Morgan Freeman) that human beings only use 10% of their brain's capacity. Lucy finds that the item contained in the briefcase will increase this percentage over a short period of time, giving her the power to control other people, her own metabolism, and eventually gain power over time and space.<br/><br/>Okay, let's stop there for a moment. Why, in a movie about a woman who can bend time and space, was it necessary to have her running from gangsters? Why did we need chase scenes? Why is she running from bad guys when she can simply dispatch them by batting her eyelashes? This woman unlocks the mysteries of the universe and apparently knows what happens when we die? Wouldn't it have been much more interesting to have her reveal and explore those secrets? Give us a clue to the origins and destination of our evolution? A movie in which she explores those questions might have been brilliant.<br/><br/>Johansson, whose potent screen presence but has yet to get involved in a big-budget film that lets her act. She shows some potential in the film's opening scenes. As she is menace by gangsters who speak a language that she doesn't understand, she is visibly and convincingly terrified. There's a lot of personality there but it unfortunately goes away as soon as she gains superpowers. She spends much of the movie looking stoic and determined. This is disappointing after her triumphant performance earlier this year in Jonathan Glazer's Under the Skin, playing an alien who collects epidermises several wayward men. There, her lack of expression was enough to convince us that she was other-worldly. Here, she just looks bored. There are some brilliant ideas buried inside this canned plot that are only briefly allowed to emerge. What a waste of an interesting idea."

","The movie has packed all necessary action and visual effect. 90mins fly by quickly, story was told in a good pace and intense enough to keep audience's attention. <br/><br/>Some may find the trailer slightly misleading. The trailer showed Lucy, who has been slipped a bag of drug under her stomach and the bag of drug leaked which led to her god-like powers. <br/><br/>However, as soon as you start watching this movie in the theatre, you are going to realise it is a sci-fi movie infused with scientific and philosophic facts. More so to the philosophical size. <br/><br/>Having said that, the movie probably require the audiences with certain level of scientific education or open mindedness in order to understand or appreciate what's going on. Like Prometheus, lots of people coming out of the theatre scratch their head or yelling BS or stupid.<br/><br/>Good job once again to director and writer, Luc Besson.

The ""science"" here is only a poor excuse. The scientific argumentation given by a very solemn Morgan Freeman is just laughable (""go from evolution to revolution"" wow...).

","An intriguing first act, a great lead, amazing sequences yet a very mediocre execution leave this film just at average level. There are sparks of Luc Besson's talent, but unfortunately on the widescpe they are overshadowed by the lazy development of the story.<br/><br/>The film anyways has lots going for it. It succeeds in delivering some of this potential, but fails in delivering the major part of it. Undoubtely the part where it succeeds the most is the first act. It never gave out too much information, but by giving away just the essential it managed to produce a very intense interest in how the story would go. It was also filled with very stylish and kind of strange sequences mixed to it, that I didn't quite understand, yet didn't really mind. Scarlett Johansson is another highlight, she really carried everything along and I didn't realize until later in the movie how much merit she deserved for not making this movie a bore. Her mix of charisma and good skills was key in bringing some spice to an otherwise flat and flawed story. Still on positives, there is a sequence near the end of the movie that was pure brilliance, the CGI involved was flawless and it took me on a short psychedelic journey that I absolutely enjoyed to the bone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that sequence alone is the only spark of visual brilliance that is present in the movie. For the rest there is nothing wrong with the cinematography, but it looks just so average, there isn't one single interesting shot, it all looks as if it was shot by a computer. again nothing wrong because it certainly didn't get me to annoyance, but I was constantly bothered by this flat look. Anyways the biggest flaw this movie has is in storytelling. Firstly, because as much as I found interesting the first act the second and the third just fell into generic action movie territory. Secondly because the logics of the movie are totally bonkers and make no sense what so ever. They manage to produce good filmaking occasions, but their roots are totally out of place.<br/><br/>Lucy fails in being what it wants to be, but it succeeds in giving the viewer 90 minutes at the theater that won't bore him and will flow pretty smoothly."
"djgenesis","3","7","16","14 December 2014"," How can people say this is brilliant?
","Throughout watching Lucy, I face-palmed so many times that my forehead turned red. I started counting the the money I spent to buy this DVD in cents so that I too, can plug into another dimension and forget I ever bought it. The movie is based on the most wide-spread urban legend since the Loch-Ness monster. The fact that 100% of your brain is used (maybe not the director's) is the most classic example of debunking scientific misconception and I am surprised that there are still quite a few thousand people who still believe it. I pushed myself to watch it because I thought that it would be a ""Limitless"" copy but it turned out to be a lot less than that.<br/><br/>Defying the basic rules of the universe is a job for a superhero, and I tried to see this like watching another superhero movie. But the problem is that even superheros have a special ability that arises from exploiting unknown scientific concepts. Whether it is a humanoid for another planet, or a chemical reaction to an uncharted material, or even a smart-eccentric millionaire geek. All of the above have an unreasonable, yet a quite far fetched ""believability"" because they are based on facts you DON'T KNOW. Not on the De'facto KNOW it's not true. Even so, to be able to show a character defy the very laws of nature, there must, in my opinion, be some sort of a far fetched explanation, exploiting the unknown variable. <br/><br/>They might as well replace Scarlet with a talking CGI tree and remake the whole movie. It will make the same sense."

","This movie is not for everyone to properly understand. To existentialists, it would seem like another useless waste of time seeing kid's fantasy movie, but to the people who understand mysticism, transcendentalism, and Sufism, it will be a good eye opener.<br/><br/>The cinema is very short, but the impact of the theory is too heavy. Mysticism and transcendentalism, these two are explored. I know Islamic mysticism does not really bother anyone but if you really are into mysterious things and meeting with The Maker one day, I would say you should read into it. Books of Islamic Mysticists like Gazzali R. on mysticism will give you a proper knowledge of what Sufism or mysticism is. <br/><br/>Anyway, the movie shows you that you can transcend and go beyond the limit of human knowledge if you can unlock the full power of you brain which was given to you at the beginning of your being. Being able to harness the power of your own brain will give you access to the domain of a Superior Existence that we often times talk of. I am not saying that humans can really perform all these but if that Superior Being gives you that power then you can do a lot of things. If you are a Jew then the story of Moses A., if you are a Christian then the Stories of Jesus A., and if you are a Muslim then there is no further explanation necessary to you as you already know through religious scriptures the existence of such domain and possibilities. <br/><br/>What happened in the end is that when Lucy was eventually given the power to unlock the full potential of her brain, she seemed have met her beginning. <br/><br/>The story is short, it has nice East and West combination; and the actors performed very well. Some of the visual elements of the movie were bit redundant and seemed old fashioned. But it is a good movie to watch.<br/><br/>This movie is not like the other blockbusters and it should not really be rated on the same scale as the subject matter is totally different. Those who understand mysticism and Sufism would really enjoy the movie."

","What a mind blowing film.
An independent film 'under the skin' showed Scarlett's Alien side, 'Lucy' shows her logical and philosophical side and 'ghost in the shell' shows her almost human side.
It's interesting to see how Luc Besson brought this film on to the screen after nearly 10 years of planning. Scarlett was the right choice for this project. It's good how she makes Lucy's humanity more Godly yet unforgiving.
One can not help noticing how she talks in a mono tonal voice through out as she appears not to struggle with her emotions, or lack of it.
Is this robotic phase a case where she has achieved immortality and emotions are irrelevant.
Over all I gave this movie a 10 because it is a difficult story to project to the audience on many levels and Besson did a good job.

"Magow-Intermean","9","3","5","23 March 2019"," Lucy Review
","After being beaten up by Taiwanese gangsters, the bag of blue crystals sewn into drug mule Lucy's (Johansson) stomach ruptures and leaks into her bloodstream, causing her brain capacity to surge. But as she enters superhuman realms, her tolerance for human weakness diminishes.
For half a movie, Lucy reminds you why you used to love Luc Besson. Not bothering with the rigours of set-up, we meet Lucy, a partied-too-hard student doing a last lap of Taiwan before shipping back to real life. She's sort of slutty: bottle-blonde hair, hooker skirt, and a week-long boyfriend (Borgen's Pilou Asbæk) who sure isn't a keeper. Scarlett Johansson, milking the contrast with the super-Lucy to come, plays the pre-transformation girl as likably wide-eyed and vulnerable, with just a hint of native savvy.<br/><br/>Cajoled into delivering a suspect suitcase (how many innocent drop-offs include a handcuff?) to a Taiwanese syndicate, it takes only a few slick cuts before Lucy is up to her pretty neck in luridly tattooed wacko-gangsters with a bag of CPH4 - the latest in designer drugs heading for Europe's clubs, albeit one that has bypassed the trial stage - sewn into her stomach lining.<br/><br/>Amid the film's ready supply of screwy science is the news that CPH4 is some kind of atomic-powered growth formula that, in quantum amounts, kickstarts the development of all the bones in a foetus. When the bag splits, in a flurry of CG fireworks, the cosmic cocaine smashes into Lucy's cerebral cortex, upgrading her from pitiful human levels of ten per cent brain usage towards the Stargate-crossing mystical hooey of 100 per cent capacity. In other words, upgrading Lucy from victim of male brutality into superhuman Lady Vengeance.<br/><br/>For a blissful while, the film lands on a hyper-cool fusion of superhero gig and exotic thriller, with Besson mounting a series of divinely amoral, logic-be-damned sequences of lethal Lucy going about her brainiac makeover. Apart from taking out a penthouse of snarling hoods, this includes breaking into a hospital and forcing a doctor to remove the remaining CPH4 without anaesthetic while she uses his cell phone to call home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, leading brain specialist Morgan Freeman (only using five per cent of his total wisdom) expounds on the limits of the human brain and what might lie beyond - by 50 per cent capacity the laws of physics become your playthings. Using the X-Men register, Lucy develops into a slick-chick combo of Magneto, Mystique, Professor X and Quicksilver.<br/><br/>Then, as literally mind-blowingly intelligent as Lucy becomes, the film crosses into ultra-cobblers. From that welcome self-homage to the sleek early Besson of Nikita and Léon, via the ultraviolent revenge-tragedies of Park Chan-wook (Oldboy star Choi Min-sik makes a suitably heinous kingpin), it freewheels into the quasi-philosophical sci-fi burbling of The Matrix as Lucy starts jacking into some higher state of consciousness - like Samantha from Her - and what was silly, sexy and fun becomes silly and pompous, consuming the stylish action in lumps of matter-tormenting CG. By the time Lucy is vaulting through time and space, things comes over all Terrence Malick (yes, you read that right), grandly pixel-painting the Big Bang, the dawn of life, and stopping off to gawp at an angry dinosaur. The last thing anyone wants is for this nonsense to mean something.
What keeps us watching, eager for the outcome, is the always scintillating star turn from Johansson, perfectly capturing the psychological plunge from foolish waif into a luscious-lipped, icy-eyed, femme-fatale Dr. Manhattan, moving beyond the constraints of morality, desire, fear and frailty into superhuman levels of pouting."

","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) starts out as a young nobody who, through no fault of her own, gets caught up with a Korean drug gang. The drug lord decides to use her as a drug mule, and has a plastic packet full of CPH4 embedded under her stomach. Through recklessness by her drug handlers, the packet rips, leaking the CPH4 into her. The CPH4 gradually opens her brain, and she gains knowledge far beyond any human. She is able to see and do fascinating things, but she also gradually loses what makes her human. She has no interest in striking back at the drug gang, as her intelligence has progressed beyond this world. Lucy calls her mother, but her basic message was: ""I love you mom, but I'm going someplace that you couldn't possibly understand, and I can't come back. Goodbye."" <br/><br/>Lucy consults Brain Theory expert Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) on what she should do with all of her knowledge. He suggested that she pass on her knowledge to others, although he was also wondering if mankind could handle such knowledge. The drug lord, of course, is determined to kill her. <br/><br/>By the time Lucy reaches 100% of brain capacity, she ceases to exist as a physical being. <br/><br/>Lucy starts off as a pretty good story, but there are a couple of flaws later on. The big car chase scene, involving multiple car crashes, was pointless. Lucy could have just used her brain to make the other cars stop, and mentally just pushed them aside. Same thing for the big shootout scene at the end. Lucy could have just made all the bad guys collapse. Those scenes were just put in as action filler, but they kind of subtracted from the story."

It's difficult for me to understand how a film like ""Transcendence"", not perfect by any means but enjoyable and intelligent nonetheless, can be damned to obscurity by critics yet ""Lucy"" is being hailed as inventive, exciting summer entertainment. The ""AI"" tone of this movie is by far one of the worst interpretations of that specific idea that I have ever seen in a sci-fi film. Please do not waste your time/money on this film.

There wasn't enough information about Lucy at the beginning and they didn't explain it well enough to be empathetic to her heartlessness, eventually you understand but not quickly enough. I may watch it again, but i wouldn't pay for it in any way. This kind of movie is my favorite type, so this movie was an extreme disappointment and it made me angry at the end. It's simply not worth your money."

First off, the whole ""10% of your brain"" thing is a myth that was disproven years ago. But yet, they shove it down our throats over and over again throughout the entire movie as if it is fact.

"ferguson-6","5","9","23","27 July 2014"," Mind Over Matter
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Luc Besson has a track record of mixing stylistic visuals with more traditional action: La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element. This time he tries to mix those components with fantasy, sci-fi and neuroscience. His hope was that Scarlett Johannson in a snug t-shirt and Morgan Freeman as an on screen narrator would sufficiently distract viewers from the intercontinental drug-muling mess.<br/><br/>We have all fantasized about expanded brain power, and many films have touched on this: Transcendence (Johnny Depp), The Matrix franchise, and Limitless (Bradley Cooper) to name a few. Omnipotence may not be everyone's goal, but it sure doesn't seem to go well in movies. This time around, there is a Korean drug syndicate led by Choi Min-sik (Oldboy) who have synthesized a drug that takes the human brain to a new level.<br/><br/>There are some nice moments in the film, but the pieces just don't fit smoothly together. Circumstances are such that Scarlett finds herself experiencing the effects of the drug - first by dancing on the ceiling ala Lionel Ritchie, and then with the most awkward phone call to mom in film history. Soon enough her telekinetic powers are so advanced, she mows down the heavily armed bad guys with a flick of the finger. If that makes no sense to you, you'll have to follow along with Professor Morgan Freeman's charts and graphs. His lecture spells out the steps that Scarlett will go through and the interconnected scene cuts makes sure all movie goers can keep up ... even those who don't use 10% of their brain.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that if a movie about extraordinary intelligence is to be made, then the movie itself should at least be smart ... or witty. What the movie tells us is that expanded brain access allows us to medically diagnose our friends through a hug, instantly change hair color while strolling through the airport, and create invisible force fields to trap our enemies. We also learn that really smart people drive the wrong way on one-way streets. In Dallas, we typically refer to those people as idiots ... or at least horrible drivers. Evidently the joke is on us - those are the enlightened ones!<br/><br/>This movie should have been a lot more fun than it was. A tip of the cap to Mr. Besson for casting Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen), and for the global trek from Taipei to Berlin to Paris to NYC ... and finally a dinosaur and memory stick. While Scarlett's character remembers the taste of her mother's milk, I expect the memory of this film will fade quickly."

","I actually quite loved this movie. Before entering the theatre, a friend who had seen the movie the night before came up and proceeded to tell me that it was a horrible movie, just incredibly stupid, with a storyline that had so much potential but failed on all accounts. Needless to say, I had exceptionally low expectations when I sat down. <br/><br/>I don't know where all the criticism came from because I thought it was fantastic. <br/><br/>The storyline was well-developed and the science aspect was, in my opinion, well explained. There were a couple of scenes that I thought could have been left out (I didn't particularly need to see animal birth). There were a few things that could have been explained better, but not many. All-in-all, I found it to be a highly entertaining story. The symbolism with the first discovered female was unique, the imagery was beautiful and the directing was a nice change of scenery. There are a lot of movies coming out these days that show this rich storyline in the trailer that is quite lack-luster in reality. This is not to be included in that category. It lives up to the potential portrayed in the trailer. <br/><br/>If the criticism is of Johannson's acting, the dead-pan works with what they are trying to portray in the movie, which is a loss of humanity. She's not my favorite, but she didn't destroy the movie. <br/><br/>All this being said, its definitely not for everyone. My brother sitting next to me didn't like it at all and found it quite boring. The science fiction is not everyone's cup of tea. But I very much enjoyed it."

Subtext clearly a hindrance for cinema-goers, Besson leaves no stone unturned as he dazzles us with shots of animals hunting prey to tell us something bad is about to happen, title cards to inform us what percentage of Lucy's brain she's using, Lucy's voice-over, or indeed, Morgan Freeman's voice-over - which is cleverly disguised as his character's dialogue. <br/><br/>Hopefully they'll someday release an interactive version, which will show the movie's viewers what percentage of THEIR brain they're using, and administer a dose of tranquilisers any time it ventures above zero.<br/><br/>For a movie that wants to explore the impossible, all it really explores are a bunch of hackneyed action B-movie plot devices - which is fine if you're thirteen years old - otherwise, I'd steer clear.

","Lucy tells the story of, Lucy(Scarlett Johansson). When Lucy gets abducted & the abductors mess up her body, by adding a synthetic drug through her stomach. Now, the effects of the drug is that she can use more than 10% of a human's average cerebral capacity. She seeks the help of Professor Norman(Morgan Freeman) who has done tons of research on the particular subject. Now, Lucy will have to control her cerebral capacity, no matter what. <br/><br/>Lucy is a brilliant film. I love realistic action/sci-fi movies. The fact that this particular drug is used on pregnant women in small doses really fascinates me! However, Lucy suffers the same brunt of most sci- fi movies. It lacks an emotionally engaging story. Lucy is way better than Godzilla(2014) & Pacific Rim(2013), but lacks the dramatic elements of Inception(2010) & Transcendence(2014). The action sequences of the movie are brilliant. Be it car chases, surreal mind brawls or fist fights, they never fail to amaze. The special effects are outstanding too. I'm really glad that the movie isn't in 3D, which seems to be the norm for action/sci-fi movies, nowadays. Kudos, Luc Besson. Scarlett Johansson kicks ass as the protagonist. Lucy's lack of emotions has been portrayed beautifully by Johansson. Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Professor Norman. The supporting characters are effective. Lucy is a must watch, just for its concept. The fact that this drug actually exists in real life, gives me chills. God knows what a human being can do with a 100% of brain capacity!"

The main idea has been camouflaged by the face of a loose action movie , which I think it was on purpose , however the director of the film addresses one of the most controversial subjects ""God"". The film is full of symbols like the moment when Lucy touch the finger tip of the Neanderthal. I love also the director statements like the moment when Lucy said"" the pain is the result of our limits"" or that ""the time is the only unit"" and later he contradicted this by showing Lucy's time traveling. The last 10 minutes of the film was intimidating as it shows the source of the creations ,the unity and Immortality. And the last scene where this massage was appeared on the phone of the policeman "" I am everywhere"" Luc Besson called god with a new name. It was amazing"

","**This discusses several events within the movie, some of which may be considered spoilers**<br/><br/>Let me begin by praising the high quality visual effects, music, and acting of this movie. Also, I have to believe that the movie did serve its intended purpose (sort of), as it began a discussion between my wife and I that lasted almost as long as the movie did. Though it was a think piece, and a conversation starter, I doubt very much if it intended to become the genesis of nearly an hour and a half criticism of itself.<br/><br/>We each had opinions, which varied almost as much as we do as people (she and I are nearly opposites on most subjects). But to save time and space, I'll combine both sets, and limit the number actual drawbacks we discussed.<br/><br/>So for starters, I'll begin with morality. Increasing ones potential, would intensify their personality, deepen their emotions, and solidify their sense of right and wrong, not nullify it. This looked like that is what happened, as indicated by her treatment of her friend, and the phone call she made to her mom. (Very emotional and seeming loving.) Then, in contrast, the point of all the horrific murders, (unless it was just to fill time so the movie could be 90 minutes long), seemed to be to underscore just how evil the main bad guy is, so when she chose not to kill him, (or any of the other people that were trying to kill her), it seemed to indicate her own respect for human life. But then she endangered many lives in her car chase, and she couldn't be bothered to protect those who were trying to protect her as she gave instruction to mankind.<br/><br/>If she were as powerful as she was being portrayed in her Lucy to Lucy moment, (lampooning Michelangelo thoroughly), multitasking would have been as easy as breathing. The attackers could have turned on each other, fallen asleep, transformed into flowers, or been dispatched in an infinite variety of fatal or harmless ways. On the other hand, if becoming all powerful bleeds away all humanity, as was suggested by the film, and human kind becomes less interesting than a colony of ants in the grass, why bother trying to educate them?<br/><br/>The nature of the universe, quantum scientists, and micro biologists will reveal that underlying all life and matter, is information. If you're gonna go there in a movie, then why not ask the question... Where does the information come from?<br/><br/>The overall and greater complaint, making the rest of this seem academic, is the end of the movie. I guess they just couldn't figure out how to end it. Even the movie Blazing Saddles, which has one of the worst movie endings of all time, ended better than this movie did.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 3 out of 10. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it had the potential to be so much more. You might even say it was about %10 of what it could have been. ;D"

"lotekguy-1","4","10","27","29 July 2014"," Looks Great, Less Filling
","I'm a big fan of both writer/director Luc Besson (The Transporter and Taken series, among the lengthy action credentials he's racked up since La Femme Nikita) and his star, Scarlett Johansson. Alas, the two have collaborated on a movie that's truly cool and exciting until it descends into stupidity. Besson's directing significantly out-paces his writing in this one.<br/><br/>The premise is familiar axiomatic science. Humans only use about 10% of our brain capacity, leaving zillions of neural pathways, with all their unknown potential capabilities, in storage. What if we could use more, or even all of it? What information and collective memories might we access? What physical and mental powers might emerge - perhaps ranging somewhere between superhero and deity? Those prospects are particularly relevant, since Johansson has played the former, and co-star Morgan Freeman the latter in better movies.<br/><br/>Johansson's character is a college student dating the wrong guy in Taipei. Gangsters force her into serving as a mule for a new designer drug they'll sell in Europe. When the package they plant in her belly bursts, it expands her mind to the max. Payback and other deployments of these enhancements before the drug overwhelms her drive the plot and its hectic pace. Several sequences show Besson at his best, including one in which Johansson drives through Paris like another Jason Statham.<br/><br/>As to the rest, there are two possibilities. Either Besson didn't know how to get his cast out of the situation he created, settling for a jumble of splashy, acid-trip array of computer effects that fail to sync with his title character. Or the upper limit of my 10% is so far below his that I've missed the point and should have given this a higher rating. If you go, the call is yours."
"trublu215","4","10","27","25 July 2014"," What starts off with promise quickly descends into a generic action film.
","Luc Besson has been a filmmaker that has consistently delivered some of the best action films of all time. From Leon to The Fifth Element, Besson has solidified himself as an action auteur. However, Lucy stands as a perfect example of seeing a legend overshadowed by a long and lengthy career. Lucy stars Scarelett Johansson as the titular character, a normal woman who is injected with a super drug. Before the film really gets going, we don't spend enough time with Lucy as what she would normally be. Before we know it, Lucy is soon injected with a mysterious serum that is some sort of super drug that is simply a more amped up version of the Limitless pill and then we slowly stop caring about her character because she is everything short of invincible at this point. Lucy's premise offers a lot of promise but its execution is something completely different. The action sequences are bland, played out and down right ridiculous. Usually that's a good thing for a film of this type, but what makes Lucy the exception is the terrible editing and poorly written plot. For the first 40 minutes of the film, you're engaged in the film. The story takes off immediately, starting with a voice-over from Johansson that proves to be pointless and useless by the end of its brisk 90 minute runtime. This is half a good film, half a really incoherent mess of a film. Johansson's attempt at being a brutal bad-ass collapses right around the time Lucy starts to access more than 50% of her brain. While her performance is commendable and she gets an A for effort, I simply don't buy it. Morgan Freeman plays virtually the same character here as he did in Transcendence and, much like that film, it gets tiresome after seeing it a couple times. The film descends into one pointless twist after another until you finally are asking yourself ""what the hell is going on?"" There are some great scenes of action that seem very carefully choreographed in the beginning along with a car chase sequence that was pretty awesome as well. Despite these two good qualities, it isn't anywhere near enough to save Lucy from poorly written dialog, terrible plot twists and an overall lack of coherence."

","Lucy is one of those films that brings about furious reactions, it is after all a science fiction type action thriller. They always divide film fans right from the off. It's a film that to all intents and purposes needs to be viewed just as a cinematic experience, as a piece of popcorn fodder that may try to be something more cerebral, but ultimately is a daft - but hugely fun - piece of film.<br/><br/>Luc Besson writes and directs a film that sees Scarlett Johansson duped into being a drug mule, with the transportation of drugs sewn into her abdomen. It's a new drug, boy is it a new drug, and when things go belly up and the drugs are unleashed into Scarlett's system, she's a threat - or hope - to mankind.<br/><br/>It can be, and has been, called pretentious et al, such is the science factor, which is perfectly understandable, so any hope of tight science fiction musings will only end up in a crushing disappointment. Undeniably Besson and his backers thought they had something to say, to open up the film watchers' minds to something deep and probable, to be relevant and viable. But unlike the makers we the viewers didn't have access to donepezil, so we sadly couldn't all turn into Bradley Cooper and be limitless in our viewing capabilities.<br/><br/>Personally, it's a rollicking fun film for two thirds, when it's about Scarlett kicking butt, a revenge driven babe, it grips and shakes all the genre compliant cinematic senses. The ending, the grand finale, infuriated me, and by the looks of Morgan Freeman (coasting for easy money), he was also a little frustrated. But I had fun, yet on the flip side if anyone fronted me up and said they hated the film with a passion? Then I would understand and take them home to play with my chemistry set. 7/10"

","Trailer left me in sarcastic mood about ""one more sudden superhero possessing immense power and doing cool looking tricks"". But from the beginning great work was performed by director to entertain viewers: ""wild"" inserts paralleling animal behavior and showing ""real"" level of human mind development, establishing ground for further narration; a bit unusual, but qualitative sense of humor; mysterious behavior of surrounding people, causing lots of questions and thus desire to get answers by watching rest of the movie (even before main character actual disclosure).<br/><br/>Unlike others, author did a work of explaining superpowers' source from nearly scientific point of view. And what is more important he did good ""balancing"" of hero by using ""24 hours before die"" trick. In my opinion story contains lots of illogical mismatches, like need of professor's help, when you are infinite times smarter, loosing of fear and pain, because of intelligence development, but feeling love to parents. Evolution cannot mean deprivation, pain is source of information for body, not burden. Nevertheless, Lucy's behavior is still meaningful: she tries to avoid unnecessary casualties, doesn't waste time on revenge and does everything possible to leave useful legacy. During movie viewers see good amount of qualitative action, as this film first of all exists for watching and entertaining. Author is not obligated to perform philosophers and priests work. He encourages ""proper"" eternal questions to rise in our minds, but leaves for us to find answers. Similar situation with ending - it's still our work to write own story continuation. So, overall ""lazyness"" of authors catches the eye: there are movies were authors performed large amount of work to construct new realities/worlds, completely new approaches, but Luc Besson decided to remain within ours and thus created just hint-movie.<br/><br/>Overall picture (and sound) is rich and ""juicy""; good performance of actors and high-quality meaningful computer graphics are also present. Movie entertains from first minutes and doesn't bore at any stage. Positive and inspiring message saying: ""It's in your hands to become actual god."" also makes good impressions."

Laugh at the thought of 'LSD' mixed with 'Scientific'? Think again. Most disparaging remarks I've noticed deal with how far this goes or how ""inhuman"" the main character seems. I'd argue: That is exactly the point. Best movie I've seen in years."

"victuki","7","6","14","27 August 2014"," Lucy and the brain potential
","The man behind ""Leon"" (1994), Scarlett Johansson in kick-ass mode... Who wouldn't want to watch this film? But as usual, nothing is what it seems, and the question is: is that a bad thing or a good thing? It depends, whether you expect just another sci-fi action packed movie or, knowing old Besson, something else. In the same fashion that ""The Fifth Element"" (1997), ""Lucy"" is not so genre-tight, but it tends to expand, an inside out explosion. Some might like it or not, but the truth is that Luc Besson is a great filmmaker, and it seems he can make a very good movie anytime he wants to. Lucy (Johansson) is a tourist that finds herself in the middle of a drug dealing business and ends up being a mule. To make things even worse, the package she carries bursts inside her, and the consequences are as unexpected as they are cool. In just one day her brain capacity will reach its full potential, unfolding every secret the brain still hides from mankind. Scarlett Johansson (oh Scarlett...) is Lucy, and she turns from bimbo to super-heroine in half an hour, something Scarlett does easily, as well as showing us how with higher brain capacity comes some ""changes"". It is in those moments that she makes her best, though I am not objective here. What she did in ""Her"" (Spike Jonze, 2013) was outstanding, and I am a crazy fan, I must confess. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman are just spectators, and we all just sit and enjoy the Scarlett show. ""Lucy"" is sci-fi, yet it states that we only have access to 10% of our brain capacity, which has been debunked by several scientific studies. That would be unacceptable in most cases, but in this case it is not a big deal, since this film is not hard sci-fi; it is not a superpowers film nor a brain research film, but rather a film about our very existence and evolution. Quoting Pearl Jam: ""I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher (...) It's evolution, baby"" (""Do the Evolution"" from the album ""Yield"", 1998, epic records)."
"videodrome1234","6","6","14","23 August 2014"," Just a good action movie
","Luc Besson is an interesting director. He has unbelievably cool films: like one of my favorites Leon the Professional, but I could also say the Big Blue and the Fifth Element. The there are some of his later films The Family that wasn't totally lame but it wasn't outstanding either. So it's strange that even if he's said in the past that he won't be doing anymore films now all of a sudden he comes out with a new film. And it can be said that it's similar to the later ones. The film's story is pretty typical which makes it fit more with the films he's produced like The Transporter or Taxi. But it's characteristic of these types of directors that viewers are always interested in what they do 'cause their films always have the potential to be something great. When news 1st hit of the film being in the works Angelina Jolie was attached to it as the star and it seemed like the story would be a good fit for her, like her roles in Wanted and Salt. Unfortunately she jumped ship and Scarlett Johansson came aboard. Of course Johansson is a talented actress but these types of action films are only just now becoming part of her repertoire but it's interesting to see her have a go at it. The script of course is credited to Besson, who can be hit and miss with them. But one can hope that it won't end up bad. The film was shot in France with French money but Universal purchased the rights for the States. In any case Besson doesn't usually run into quality problems with his French projects so it was expected to work. But what was the actual result? A pretty positive one. In a world run by the mob, street gangs, drug addicts, and corrupt cops, Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a woman living in Taipei, Taiwan who is forced to work as a drug mule for the mob. A drug implanted in her body inadvertently leaks into her system, which allows her to use more than the ""normal"" 10% of her brain's capacity, thus changing her into a superhuman. As a result, she can absorb information instantaneously, is able to move objects with her mind, and can choose not to feel pain or other discomforts, in addition to other abilities. It's kind of a basic requirement to have a good idea, being that there is something hidden in the far reaches of the mind. So the films story doesn't sound half bad, what causes problems is that all of it is buried in an action film. So then what do you need a good idea for? It gets lost amongst the big and effective action scenes. That's kind of how you can categorize Lucy. It's filled with cool stuff and action. Probably Besson had the idea and thought he is good at doing action films so he'd merge the two. The film does do a good job with the action stuff, it's filmed well, it's has tight cuts, and it's directed well. But the other side is lacking. The film as just an action film works. Scarlett Johansson is surprisingly good as a war crazed Amazon. The film suits her and she suits the film. The other actors are there too. The problem was the film didn't get to be more than an action flick. It's just what I said an average film but a cool and well made action flick. Despite the good acting the characters are kind of shallow and the script could be deeper. Of course that does depend on what you expect of the film. Besson makes me want more. I just didn't get it. It's good work and it's entertaining, but just don't expect to get deeper meaning. If you don't you won't be disappointed. All in all Lucy is a perfect mindless action flick but no more. Though it must be noted that it doesn't want you to think it's more and trick anyone it just wants to entertain and that works. I had fun watching it but Big Blue and Leon well they made me expect more. 7/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog"

","So be it that ""Lucy"" perpetuates the boring ten percent of the brain myth. It's more difficult to accept the ridiculous and unimagitative depiction of a person who extends these ten percents.

Good for her, boring for the audience.<br/><br/>Lucy's development fall in the predictable trope ""higher mental capasity = acting like a robot"". ""I don't feel pain, fear, desire. It's like all things that make us human are fading away,"" Lucy says. But accessing her full brain would logically make her feel even more and make her more human. I'd rather watch an emotional roller coaster ride development like that than robot Scarlett kick Korean ass.<br/><br/>At one point she's about to disintegrate though, Jeff Goldblum style, and that's kind of cool. But in the next scene she's all right again. Phew! For a moment I expected some interesting development there.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is full of pseudoscientific stuff that doesn't impress at all. Like, ""All social systems we've put into place are a mere sketch. (You don't say?!) Time is the only true unit of measure"" is presented as Lucy's revelation towards the end of the film. And what is time, if I may ask? But the film doesn't bother to explore the concept of time. That's too heavy and untouchable for this kind of flick."

","Lucy is interesting from start to finish, just don't expect to feel connected to reality for very long. The acting was jam up, it was very enjoyable to see Scarlett play a lead role, dominating the scenes.<br/><br/>Typical nuances such as multiple languages with no sub-titles, it does allow you to feel just as confused as Lucy did at certain moments which adds to the audience connection to her character. I believe the other languages were Mandarin and Korean.<br/><br/>One of the amazing draws (for me) to this film was the lack of profanity. It brought a sense of appeal to my ears, I personally left the film wondering if even a single vulgarity was used. I know some people have lost their ear to catch the curses flying because it is the norm; to my knowledge there were only 3-4 used... wow. I'm proud to say we can still do that. Ironically, it was a foreign made film, not from Hollywood. That should say something about true filmography... you don't need nudity, profanity, or blood/guts galore to draw a crowd or earn your buck.<br/><br/>I will note that there may be some things children and even the immature audience aren't ready to see, so I agree with the R rating.<br/><br/>If you are ready to taste a true Sci-Fi action, mind-blowing experience, check it out!"

I thought that it would lead to something big, like perhaps she would use her abilities to do great things. However, as the movie continued, it got more weird than epic. The plot started to jump all over the place, ultimately going nowhere. When it ended, I couldn't believe it was over, as if Luc Besson ran out of juice and stopped writing all of a sudden. In my opinion, nothing was resolved and nothing was accomplished.<br/><br/>Overall, I am disappointed because I wanted to see a really creative sci-fi action film with a promising heroic female lead but what I saw was one woman's 90 minute psychedelic drug trip."

The story of a street girl who becomes the smartest person on the planet is entertaining, and the production values, although a bit violent, are first-rate.

"byStevenRamirez","6","2","3","20 February 2017"," Asking the Wrong Question
","SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>(July 2014.) I saw the much-anticipated 'Lucy' last weekend and, before going into my review, I'd like to make a few preliminary comments. First, I am a huge fan of Luc Besson. Ever since 'La Femme Nikita,' I was convinced this guy could do no wrong. Second, I am in love with Scarlett Johansson—don't tell my wife. Third, I'm very aware that no matter what I say here, this movie will make a ton of money. So that said, what's my take? <br/><br/>I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Apparently, 'Lucy' couldn't decide what it wanted to be. On the one hand, it is a smart, funny, bloody sci-fi thriller that doesn't skimp on the action. On the other, it's an vfx- laden treatise on the history of man and his ability to utilize the untapped potential of his brain. Judging by the official trailer, I was promised the former. And I was getting it in all its Luc Besson glory until Lucy finally meets Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman in Paris. <br/><br/>There was an upside to the mindy, spacey stuff that takes us from man's beginnings with the original Lucy to the wonders of the universe. I enjoyed the visual effects— especially when Lucy stops Time with a wave of her hand. Sure, that's cool. And the movie came in at ninety minutes, which meant we weren't saddled with a slow-moving second act. But when the screenwriter stops caring that Lucy is on the lam and an evil Korean guy is after her, and opts instead to focus on her morphing into a frickin' computer made of giant Nutella-like tendrils, that's when you lose me. This is a basic tenet of screen writing. As we've learned over the years, it's the Hero's Journey, people. <br/><br/>So what happened to Lucy? Well, SHE DIDN'T COME BACK! Instead of an arc, we got a trajectory. She never gets to have the final battle with Mr. Jang—that's left to the battle-weary French cop Pierre Del Rio. Once Lucy's brain reaches a hundred percent utilization, she trips off somewhere beyond Time and Space, probably meeting up with an alternate universe version of herself, which is the OS from 'Her.' Seriously? What am I supposed to do with pure energy? I invested a lot of my emotions in this woman, and now she just disappears? And just like Professor Norman, I am left with nothing but a thumb drive with a bunch of ones and zeroes on it. Great. I guess I should start that backup now. Oh wait, she melted all the computers.<br/><br/>The movie already has the elements of a great sci-fi action thriller—bad guys, experimental drugs, exotic locations and a woman who, though she graduated Phi Beta Kappa, starts out dumb as spit when it comes to choosing men. Speaking of bad guys, the only thing better than a Korean bad guy is pairing him with an English bad guy. Bravo, Luc!<br/><br/>As I said before, I was good with everything until the fateful meeting with Professor Norman. Previously, she had only spoken to him by phone or video screen. But once she meets with the good professor and other scientists, we're transported to the Science Channel as Lucy's brain utilization increases and everyone discusses the nature of Time and Space. At this point, I wouldn't have been surprised if everyone adjourned to a nice restaurant and spent the next five hours discussing Sartre or the symbolism behind clowns in horror movies. <br/><br/>Here's my idea for a third act. When Mr. Jang and his army arrive at the university to kill Lucy, she is already starting to lose her powers because the drug is wearing off. That, coupled with a blinding headache and other side effects from the drug, it's a question of whether she can still take out the bad guys before they can kill her. A massive final battle ensues where everything—the university, everything—is destroyed as Lucy battles with Mr. Jang and his men while becoming weaker and weaker. <br/><br/>At a critical moment, Mr. Jang shoots Lucy. Weak and bloody she still manages to send him to hell. Then she collapses as the professor makes his way to her. As the professor examines her, he realizes that she is once again human. How? Well, her irises appear normal. Working fast, he and Del Rio get her to the hospital, where surgeons operate on her and she recovers. <br/><br/>Epilogue. Lucy is standing outside the airport with Del Rio. She's going home to see her parents. He says, ""I guess we'll never know what would have happened had you hit a hundred percent."" Just then, a toddler drifts into the path of an oncoming taxi, his mother running after him and screaming in French. Suddenly, the taxi stops completely, as if Time itself had stopped. The crying mother retrieves her child as Del Rio stares at Lucy in amazement. ""What?"" she says, smiling. Then she kisses the cop on the cheek and walks into the terminal. Setup for a sequel? You bet. <br/><br/>Every great movie asks a question at the beginning that must be answered at the end. In 'Lucy,' the question appears to be ""what would happen if we could access our whole brain instead of just ten percent?"" To me, that's the wrong question. It has nothing to do with a hero's life. What happened to Lucy could have happened to anyone—the conniving boyfriend, the French cop or Professor Norman. <br/><br/>I think a better question is, ""Will Lucy become the person she is meant to be?"""

She slowly evolves into a super-being that makes Supergirl look like a panty-waist. She is able to control all manner of communication, and hooks up with a most learned professor played, of course by Morgan Freeman, in Paris. The Taiwanese ""Mafia"" wants their drugs back which leads to an action film with a very intense appetite for bloody carnage as people are stabbed and shot to death all over the place. Even she kills people. It saves time! She appears to regress back to the beginning of time as her brain usage approaches 100%. Us puny humans only use 10% of our brainpower while dolphins use up to 20%. So she has everything from x-ray vision to the ability to defy gravity and sticks her assassins, helpless, on the ceiling. She also has better diagnostic powers than a CAT or PET scan. She learns Chinese in an hour. She places all her total accumulation of knowledge into a pen-drive and disappears entirely. Some of the digital effects make no sense whatsoever as she ""reaches out"" to the mainframe computer in the University Office. She Tweets back ""I Am Everywhere"".

","I turned this on expecting a Matrix or Desperado type juggernaut of destruction and there is some of that. But, it also has a nice mix of styles. Some Oliver Stone, some Kubrik, some Matrix, some Ultraviolet and a little Altered States tossed in for good measure.<br/><br/>Johannson is competent in a role that tosses emotional content out the window pretty early on. Morgan Freeman acts as both narrator to the beginning and a character later on, a little like Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very interesting and very vivid.<br/><br/>The only thing missing is characters the viewer actually cares about. Lucy commits an outright murder early on, making her alignment very ambiguous. She comes off as amoral and a little scary.<br/><br/>I'm definitely glad I saw this movie."

","Donkey's years ago, ""Star Trek"" began to deal with the issues and significance and consequences of omnipotent beings, and also with normal human beings who became all-powerful. The theme was then returned to repeatedly, given the endless interest displayed by the various reincarnations of ST in what it means to be human, and what the limits and defining characteristics of humanity are. And maybe the effects were creaky at times, but this was Star Trek, so the subject was always handled with sensitivity, seriousness, integrity and as much intelligence as the 1960s (and then later decades) could muster.<br/><br/>So can Luc Besson's 2014 offering ""Lucy"" do better in any way? <br/><br/>Those watching the first 20 minutes or so of this film - and very possibly giving up on it - might well offer a resounding ""no"". For a long time we are not going anywhere much, and are also getting repeated (distracting and annoying) cut-aways to documentary scenes apparently designed to indicate to us what mood is being conveyed by the main current of the film. Thanks a lot for the help with that! Any shreds of plot there might otherwise be are formulaic and unappealing in the extreme, all the more so given an absurd and very out-of-place inclination to imply that there might be something vaguely funny or light-hearted somewhere in the midst of all the violence...<br/><br/>However, those sticking with the piece to the bitter end might be a little more hesitant to write off or condemn, for there is a moment when the titular lead character (played with cool sexiness by Scarlett Johnansson) begins to get a handle on the powers she is acquiring (in the most bizarre of ways) and does what any frightened and overwhelmed girl would do, and calls mum. In that moment, the film finally offers some first more-cerebral and meaningful antidote to the routine gangster offering of astronomical body count that has gone before.<br/><br/>In fact, the bodies keep piling up to the very end of the film, but after the above scene we have (somewhat) more interesting topics to deal with anyway, and the remainder of the plot (such as it is) - beyond what is happening inside our charismatic heroine - takes a very firm second place.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as a scientific expert (or rather hypothesiser) regarding the unused capacity of the human brain helps us cope with the enormity of the developing sci-fi concept, but sadly only a little. Unlike the makers of Star Trek and their characters, the writers on ""Lucy"" do their great co-starring actor no favours at all by foisting many a line of highly unscientific mumbo-jumbo into his mouth, and it will not take more than a high-school pupil to realise that he is not making any kind of sense, try as he might to impart the necessary mix of humanity and gravitas into the role. And that is a pity - given that this is something rather easy to get right - I could readily have done the job myself for a few quid. Not bad compared with the film's (estimated) $40m budget.<br/><br/>Given this accumulation of faults and failings, I am forced to interrogate myself as to why I watched on - all the more so given that the mainline setting of the film is mostly supremely predictable and lacklustre. For this sci-fi fan of very long standing, the only plausible explanation can be empathy with the nicely-rendered Lucy, and the metamorphosis she is going through.<br/><br/>If one really did begin to develop supreme powers, before becoming irrevocably jaded with everything one would of course want to go back in time to see the Flatiron building go up in early New York, would of course want to encounter a tyrannosaurus, and meet (touch fingers a la Sistine Chapel with) Australopithecus afarensis, of which the most famous specimen is of course that other ""Lucy"". And naturally, you would want to see the native Americans living in their pristine lands, and then go back and see the Earth created and the first life emerge. And you would of course try to relive all the dearest and most meaningful memories that you know are locked up in their somewhere, but are still beyond the reach of your puny capacity to bring them kicking and screaming back to the surface.<br/><br/>And these are the spellbinding glimpses of increasingly godlike powers that Luc Besson ""gets right"", and is imaginative and courageous enough to offer us movingly and realistically towards the end of his extremely flawed film. For this viewer at least, it's somehow enough to rescue the work from the trash where it would otherwise most assuredly belong..."

","Usually I discuss older titles, every so often they are long-forgotten movies remembered only by me, or so I often felt (thanks to IMDb I now know it's not quite as bad as that). Today I'm tackling Luc Besson's 2014 opus LUCY, and I am going to kick off by saying that it is spectacular, do see it, you are in for a treat if you do, but as this one is a new movie, I am also really going to blast it plot-wise. Scarlett Johansson is to me what it is all about, so, as far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was the riveting part. You could have kept all the special effects for my sake. The poor little bunny in such terrible distress, Please Mr. Jang, if you can't get rid of the chain, you don't have to chop off my hand... To me, a normal ol' suspense drama would have been much preferred. This bit about unlocking brain potential with the help of a leaking bag of CPH4 sowed in your stomach is just too much, way too much, the much simpler crime thriller that was thrown away in favor of this banal monstrosity really is a sad loss. Anyway, keep Scarlett wrapped in cotton wool, she is a national treasure, still every bit as hot as in THE ISLAND, years and years later, Hollywood living must really agree with her! She has a most beautiful huggable-bunny face reflecting childlike innocence. <br/><br/>Memo to self: Unlock 100% brain power. Open up world of endless possibilities. Enter movie, right there at that bit where she begs him to not chop off her little hand.

I'm no screenwriter but I'm pretty sure film school 101 tells you to just keep turning the dial up.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman delivers his dialogue as scripted literally... like he was reading a script to the audience, I love this actor but he doesn't seem like they paid him enough for his role in this film judging by his performance; it's almost painful to watch.<br/><br/>100% in the review title refers to the ultimate level of brain usage Lucy achieves by the end of the movie, so what happens when you use 100% of your brain? Well apparently you develop the ability to convince the studio that produced the film that special effects should ridiculously cheesy and not even in a tongue in cheek sort of way... like the editor actually looked at these scenes and actually thought they looked good.<br/><br/>Bottom line: 3rd rate special effects, Scarlett is fun to watch, good fight scenes, bad guys don't speak English to a fault, plot-holes, worst performance by acting great Morgan (sad face), good action sequences, good visual relays, disappointing ending."

The film was a grim shadow of the action packed thrill ride portrayed by the trailers. To ice the cake, the ending was a complete let-down that left you scratching your head and asking ""that was it?"". For a film that seems to be an intelligent concept about the intelligence of mankind and the possibility of utilizing 100% of the human brain, the overall feeling of this film is just plain ignorance, and it is yet another experience best saved for the cheapest options like DVD or the cable."

","The topic discussed in this movie is about the world after the development of the human brain. According to the current development of humans, Einstein is said to be the highest, with 20%. This data is speculative and cannot be verified. So it gives people more imagination. Many people say that the special effects of this movie are rough, and the discussion of the topics is not deep enough. This is because human imagination has limits. Basically, the special functions that can be used in Hollywood are all used up. And all the imagination of science fiction comes from human observation and longing for unknown things. For example, we envy birds flying, so superhumans can fly, we envy cats can fly over walls, and cat people appear, and we envy invincible The body, and then Iron Man appeared, taking you to appreciate the high-tech of future armor. In fact, after all, it is a kind of psychological compensation for the audience.
As for Super Body, his important meaning is not to present a movie to everyone. The conflicts and conflicts in the movie are far-fetched and there is no need to exist, such as why not kill the blackboard boss, such as why not kill the chase The gang of gangs will then execute their own super brain plan, all this is just to make this movie more like a movie. Everyone who appears in this film is working to continue the development and discussion of the brain for the director.
The old drama bone Morgan Freeman has been telling everyone about the brain story from the beginning, forcibly making up lessons, and in the end did not participate in the important plot of the story, he is the interpreter in the movie, telling you, you do n't understand Come, let me take you to the theater together, and let me explain to you.
So this film can remove all the story attributes, because he does not affect what the director wants to say. The director just shows you a fresh idea and tells you what you can do if it reaches 20%, then 40%, 50%, 80%, 100% ...
So what is 100%? is God? Because everywhere! It's time, because he is everywhere!
So the film conceived us about the human brain, the infinite possibilities of the human brain. It has nothing to do with the story.
This film is a science and education film in a story coat."

","""Lucy"" is more wish fulfillment fantasy than anything else. Wouldn't be great if we all had God-like powers locked away in our brains just waiting to be released (kind of a metaphysical version of a letter from Hogworts). Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) experiences this cognitive renaissance when she is forced to mule an experimental drug hidden in her abdomen by a vicious Taiwanese drug-lord. The drug, a synthetic prenatal hormone, allows her to vault past human (and physical) limitations and archive 'The Highest Possible Level of Development'. She eventually meets up with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) a pseudo-scientist and expert on the quiescent 90% of our brain while an army of the nattily dressed gangsters search for her. A massive gunfight (borrowing heavily from The Matrix) accompanies a trippy extra-corporal experience (borrowing heavily from the 2001: A Space Odyssey). Energetic and entertaining, ""Lucy"" is best enjoyed using only the right-side 5% of your mental capacity, but if you have read some of the many fawning reviews on IMDB and expect to achieve enlightenment, I suspect that you will be disappointed."

","I love science. Naturally, I didn't like the extremely non-scientific idea at first too. I remember when the movie came out and people were like ""well people do have limited access to their brain so you never know!"". Absolutely hated that. But should my opinion on the movie be influenced my such unscientific opinions? NO! It's a movie for crying out loud! And generally, your opinion should not be influence by who supports a certain idea. <br/><br/>I'm no expert so I'll keep it simple. The movie starts brilliantly. Scarlett proves once again she is not just beautiful. Enjoyed the directing, cameras, etc (with my very limited knowledge).<br/><br/>What I loved about the movie was that it took the sci-fi idea of the ""100% brain access"" (such as Limitless) and shredded it to pieces; there's nothing beyond this, and I doubt there will ever be. Some might (reasonably) argue that the end was too much. Ok, yes it was, but that was the point; no movie will ever be able to take this idea to a more extreme level ever again. Plus, it was the only ending that not everyone would expect; anything ""weaker"" and you'd be like ""pff the ending was casual"".<br/><br/>On the downside, as we approached the end of the movie, it became a bit irrational, even in its own world. Sometimes even forced. Moreover, the constant attempt to make it sound scientifically possible throughout the movie made me cringe. But I guess I should have been more prepared for this."

Please drop me your comments!
I have seen with great interest the movie that was premiered this week (1.12.17)in our nationwide commercial TV movie channel Star that in the very start was marked as U-rate whiCh later was corrected into PG. necessary parental guidance
The movie starts very rogue with unnecessary violence Lucy M was pressed by her boy friend to deliver a handbag with CPH4 a chem. essence inside a plastic bag as a new drug The gang kills him . Among other 4 persons she got a surgery The bag was planted iside her body aimed to transfer this essence to a target .CPH4 was leaked inside her body resulting into an increase of her minds potential first to 20%. and gradually increasing. The boss then wanted to stop her. .. while she wanted to know on what can happen to her life and take revenge against the gang...
Movie was full of action with very fast pacing with many poor visual effects from just typical metaphysics and telecom effects(goof!) to time travel in 100%(possibly not goof .
Very good drama with lots of suspense and very simple plot . Scarlet leads the film wih her good play while Morgan is nearly useless.
Action plot and run4/5
Now on the background :The writer is totally ignorant in basic physics and scientifically full of holes in favor to suspense and action.
The main point CPH4 is a real ingredient in pregnant mothers. There are many sites including Quora that probe these allegations and Benson knows that. Many sites refereed to this ingredient and the facts behind that and the movie.
I have some very good knowledge in radio and limited in metaphysics paranormals and neuroscience that help me to go in depth of the writer's ignorance: Some new researches show that we use our full brain. Lucy with in just 20% learnt Korean and Chinese, fully memorize 6500 pages from a teachers works ,excelled in shooting with a gun, drive without knowledge at her first time as Shumacher (haha!),do telekinesis, deactivate others minds (min control poss. not goof ), read distant people's minds (possibly not goof) but also control radio frequencies mobiles and TVs and map the radio spectrum to identify the communication frequency between the Koreats and then listen to them from the... police transceiver!
Really ? How can she faultlessly drive at so very high speed as the best car racer without any previous experience ? How can she map the entire spectrum? ?How could she decode the digital coding format of mobiles ?showing reach of 00s is stil a wrong excuse. Both GSM bands were digitally encoded using TDM.
And finally in the end of the movie before starting the final experiment, well aware of the gang outside the experiment room and with more than 70% MR e she could really remotely neutralize all of them with just a simple thought or even kill them. Why she expected the police to do that? this proves she is idiot.
And finally Lucy taking the role of God!!! haha...
It is clear that Benson wanted to favour action and suspense at the expense of everything other (logic and some basic physics) and become troll.
In a way to troll against his audience with the 'nonexistent background adn get ridiculed.<br/><br/>Therefore: He had to do a lot more side research before making stores full of goofs.
Scientific Background :1/5 except possibly the paranormals .that get the 1<br/><br/>Anyway i watched it for second time the next day for looking again the goofs. It was recorded as the time aired was too early 9pm the time my 8 yo daughter was playing with her friend in the house. I m sure to watch it several times again mainly for laughing a/o analyzing the movie more ."

","I browsed the reviews and concluded that my taste in cinematic entertainment is not the norm. Harsh negatively embellished comments really fall short of grasping the escape factor from real life/science. <br/><br/>This is a film I watch a few times a year or when I just want the best exposure to watching a highly talented actress play the role.<br/><br/>Plausibility of what we would be able to do using a greater portion of our brain power brings me to Carlos Castaneda teachings; Yogis; Aborigines; Indigenous Shamans; and the initiated to going beyond the very closed mindedness of Occidental (materialistic culture). Thus the condemnation of the film - is the predicted reflex if Occidental perception to psychologically attach to the predominate negative aspect of expression - civilized behavior.<br/><br/>You connect with the universe (expand your self awareness/collective consciousness) you have to cut the wires (neural cortex limitations to enliven the Limbic System) to your Westernized-dualistic perceptions. <br/><br/>I like that Morgan Freedman plays the scientific catalyst. Added credibility to the Darwin theory. We do exist in a prevailing Darwian economy if you haven't noticed.<br/><br/>The drug smuggling thugs is emblematic of society's ignorance and selfish greed. Lucy becomes the monolithic inspiration for us to evolve in our awareness beyond dependency on technology. We ultimately are the technology.<br/><br/>Technically, the script is tight, stands on all fours- smuggling of the drug in ""mules"" is very feasible(ask a DEA agent) and the fetus growing hormone does exist. I Googled it.<br/><br/>Remember, we never thought of using computer laptops 50 years ago or an Internet. Nor using DNA evidence to prove criminal activity and trace our birthright heritage. <br/><br/>As Einstein said, ""Information isn't knowledge."" Knowledge comes from pushing the limits of our minds by daily exercise in breaking through falsehoods-critical thinking - not negation of ""what if"". We know telepathy is fact. Bifurcation is possible.<br/><br/>This film brings awareness to the fundamental prospect of groundbreaking cures being sought after by pharmaceutical induced target specific genome treatment research. <br/><br/>There is still a lot we don't know or just block out - for instance your eyes don't see a rainbow - it creates it in your mind. That's how light and our Ozone bends sunlight. <br/><br/>Perception of reality is ""time"" as stated by Lucy. And Einstein even came to this conclusion: that beyond time is eternal love. <br/><br/>All encompassing is our ancestral past, present and future. That is the perception Lucy attains through mind expansion. We are all basically an energy field tuned to specific vibratory frequencies-according to Tesla. Einstein concurs.<br/><br/>Lucy evolves into the collective universal entity that exists in all of us. Higher States of awareness-people with high IQs are exceptionally brilliant intellectuals-with photographic memories; mathematical whizzes, telepathic. Child prodigy's in chess.<br/><br/>I love Lucy for all the reasons I mentioned and ones to be shown to me each time I watch the film; on my cinematic journey to enlightenment."

While Johanssen may not be an amazing actress, it is definitely not all her fault here. If asked to inflict pain on someone or be involved in an action sequence, she does so willingly as seen in ""The Avengers"", but unfortunately it happens much too rarely here. Instead she speaks strange banter about cortex and brain potential and then goes crazy places in her mind and in the world from electronic devices, to people's brains, to the past where some crazy unevolved ancestors exist and where the Big Bang Theory apparently began.

Lucy would be a good thriller. The opening starts tense and holds for 10-15 minutes and then everything collapses. There's an interesting message film wants to convey - ""the only unit in life is time, the rest is conventionality developed by men"", but this message is covered with a big pile of nonsense which I didn't have interest in digging. All the science baloney Morgan Freeman is spilling out does neither make sense, nor brings a smile. But some moments I was thinking that Freemen himself is going to give under his silly text and laugh out.<br/><br/>From filmography's perspective Lucy isn't in a better shape. Movie starts and ends with something clearly inspired, but much more plain than 2001: A Space Odyssey, couple of poorly produced fistfight and shootout scenes, two minutes of Taxi-style chase and uninteresting sequence of disjointed plot chunks.<br/><br/>P.S.

","Lucy review: -Lucy is a film about Scarlett Johansson, a girl who finds herself caught in a sticky situation with a high class mob, in which she wakes up with a bag of drugs in her stomach and has to transport them. However, when she accidentally absorbs a massive amount of the drug, she is given the ability to use more than 10% or her brain. A struggle for answers and her own humanity ensues as she begins to use more and more of her brain. It's a little like Trancendence and Limitless.<br/><br/>-The film as a whole was very interesting. I did not find much I didn't like about it, but at the same time there was nothing I really loved in it.<br/><br/>-The plot/story/concept was easily the most interesting part as she discovers more and more and makes the audience think more and more about life and everything. There are even some very thought provoking creation vs evolution sub-stories that left me very surprised, I think.<br/><br/>-The cast did well. Nobody was really great but nobody was bad. Morgan Freeman has also totally mastered the 'shocked beyond belief' face.<br/><br/>-The music was odd, but good.<br/><br/>-The effects were very good.<br/><br/>-The content was not too bad. The film is actually rated-R, but could have been PG-13. Some language and violence, but that's about it.<br/><br/>-The thing that is really most intriguing for me is how the film progresses as the can use more and more of her brain. There are a few things they kept around for the sake of the film which felt add-on, like a cop helping her out. Even he admits he is useless, but she tells him that he is to remind her of what it is like to be human. As the film goes on it becomes very difficult to relate to Lucy as a character, which makes sense, but is also a drawback. However, it will make you think. A lot. Like way too much. Yeah it is ""mind-blowing"" to the almost literal sense. Like the universe and stuff. Okay I'm done thinking about it.<br/><br/>-So if you are looking for an average action flick without any depth and too much thinking attached, you might find Lucky a bit disappointing. But if you are looking for a movie what contemplates life and the universe and God and brain power and a bunch of other things that will go totally over everyone's head because they are incomprehensible, it is pretty good. So I would give Lucy a high 7 and say that Lucy is probably worth seeing in theaters, if you want to think that much."

I've seen lots of reviews say that it was proved years ago that human have access to 100% of their cerebral capacity. In my opinion, I think the implication in this movie is that Lucy has access to all 100% of her brain simultaneously. <br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: I would have liked more explanation on why Lucy began to disintegrate in the scene on the airplane. Also, Lucy walking through the hospital with a gun and the 'bad guys' outside the university with automatic weapons and a crew of 25 without anyone so much as blinking an eye is far-fetched. However, overall for 90 minutes...Lucy rocked. Besson could have dragged this out into a 2 or 3 hour movie explaining everything, but sometimes the best movies keep the suspense building and allow a work of fiction to leave some things open to the interpretation of the viewer. Remember 1+1 does not equal 2."

","I like Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and admire several films of writer / director Luc Besson (The 5th Element, The Transporter, District 13) ... but this movie didn't do it for me. <br/><br/>The science aspect, which I usually tend to ignore, bothered me and felt like too much of a stretch. It just felt strange - If we use 100% of our brains, we become like gods?<br/><br/>What happens if a cat or a chicken uses 100% of it's brain? Boggles the mind.<br/><br/>The movie ""Limitless"", which also speculated on using near 100% of the brain, felt more believable and interesting. As the main character increased in power, there were limitations and trade-offs. As such, there was a compelling challenge and catharsis involved. <br/><br/>This movie seemed more like a simple speculation embedded in a weak story."

","I would recommend this film most highly to lovers of thrillers and futuristic science fiction, and write this review without giving too much away because I think it's essential to have no previous knowledge when watching for the first time, let the film draw you in.<br/><br/>This film is very stylish and unique with its storyline, with just a dash of humour, it's not a 'yet another...', it stands alone as the first of its theme.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by Luc Besson, with the quality abilities of Morgan Freeman and Scarlette Johansson, it shows many aspects and parts of the world, literally, the location shots are beautiful, making the movie quite spectacular.<br/><br/>There just might be an overuse of CGI towards the culmination of the story, but that's sometimes the only way to express science fiction. I particularly enjoyed the early half of the film when Lucy was in action mode...very 008 with style! Johansson rocks the part so well I can't imagine anyone else in the role, maybe Sigourney Weaver if it were made 20 yrs ago, but it's not, it's new and futuristic, a great story never before seen in cinema and makes good use of CGI, As I said, maybe a bit much but each individual decides that when viewing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's one of the best films in this category that I've seen in a very long time.

"rehmankhilji","3","6","15","8 December 2014"," Horrible
","Its one of the those movies which i watched mainly for two reasons, its cast and IMDb ratings. Both have yet again deceived me and deceived big time. If you have seen Bradley Cooper's ""Limitless"" this movie is based on the same lines. The difference is Limitless was easier to be expected my a normal brain. As for LUCY one has to be a complete Moran and idiot to believe in such presentation. First of all Darwin theory is nonsense, no matter how much Holly Wood tries to justify it, its completely, utterly nonsense. Further, Limitless was a movie about a guy who take some unknown pill and it enhances his mental capabilities, makes him a smart guy, makes him remember everything and give access to every thought, every memory and everything that he ever experience. On the other LUCY also takes some same kind of drug, well not the same and not the same way but at least a drug. And she becomes a god. Yes a god. She can make people fly, make people do stupid things, intercept phone calls, making the world as matrix, move in her mind to past, even the time of dinosaurs and a stupid monkey drinking water....!! she can do anything. Not to forget the most irritating part.... she transforms herself into a computer, make a usb out of her... (which part of body thats a mystery) and they she is vanished in air...!! o Sorry she becomes Air...!! as if she is some god...!! A stupid movie, i watched for the cast if you love the cast may see it, other wise you ain't missing anything."

","Do not get me wrong, I am a sucker for sci-fi stories, and if there is one person that can overcome disbelief when watching a movie, it's me. I did not care at all for the use of the outrageous notion that we only use about 10% of our brain capacity. It's a movie, I get it. Great. I did not even care that the lead hero of the story is one of the most non-relate-able characters of all time, 'cause, hey, so are many others, and they're enjoyable.<br/><br/>What did bug me a lot, though, is that this movie had a pretty much pointless storyline, that only seemed to serve the purpose of the ending, an ending that was very predictable. The scenario was poor, especially since Besson claims that it took him 9 whole years to make this cinematic nightmare come to life.<br/><br/>I believe that the movie would be far more enjoyable if it was a little bit more character-centered. Tell us about Lucy, y'know, REALLY show us important things about that ~higher being.<br/><br/>It is obvious that with this movie, Besson tried to make an existential statement. He wanted to to make the viewer think. He failed. Miserably."
"thro81","5","6","15","24 November 2014"," Promising at first, but quickly goes bland
","Probably everyone has at some degree wondered how it would be if humans could use more than their normal brain capacity. <br/><br/>This movie provides a glimpse into what would happen if a person could unlock his mind's full potential. The story starts in a middle of interaction between Lucy and a man she has been seeing, where he is trying to convince here to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang. She ends up having no choice and what seems like a simply job gets Lucy involved in a horrible deal where she is turned into a drug mule for and extremely powerful drug. <br/><br/>Things even take a turn for the worse when she is physically abused leading to the drug-bag in her stomach to rupture and a large dose is released into her bloodstream. Only not killing her, this dosage also causes her to be able to access bigger and bigger part of her brain – with drastic consequences. <br/><br/>The featured cast is pretty interesting, as well as the storyline, however after a decent start the film completely loses its grip. Lucy doesn't have to go through any learning process to know how to control her new set of skills and powers – which was a bit of a let- down. Instead her journey thenceforth is a smooth sailing with minimum of emotions and excitement. <br/><br/>There are a number of good looking scenes, but they do not come close to make up for the blandness, hence it is very hard to get invested in the story. Additionally the ending is partly given away early on which further reduces the excitement. This action film includes a strangely large amount of stock footage which really is totally unnecessary. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson puts in a good performance; she has the extraordinary look a person for this role needs and is pretty believable as this supernatural human being. Morgan Freeman's role is a lot less interesting and is mainly used to explain what is happening to Lucy when she is not on-screen. Although Freeman has the look of a professor, he surely didn't feel like one to me on this occasion. <br/><br/>The first part of the film is enjoyable but after that it just goes downhill, being extremely bland and stupid in so many ways (which is kind of funny given the brainpower of the main character). <br/><br/>I cannot recommend Lucy – 5/10."

Lucy is the new Terminator and boy it is damn cool. 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>CineScope: Based on a theory that for ages human beings have been using only 10% of their brain capacity, what if it can be a little more than that, or what if it can operate at the full 100% levels. Sounds simple, but not it is. Lucy briefly refers to the first hominid /ape / human registered in the history, but then the story revolves around another Lucy of the current era - played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. While studying / working as an ex-pat in Taipei and living normal life of a young woman, how she gets trapped, becomes a drug mule and what makes her develop and use 100% of her brain capacity is all about Lucy! <br/><br/>BFB (Bang For the Buck): I was captivated right from the moment I watched the promos in the theater. For the very theme and for Scarlet Johansson, not just for her :-) but for her being in a completely different role from her on-screen image. True-blue Sci-Fi, but from 80s /90s,somewhat like 'The Terminator', and probably NOT from the Matrix era. In short the special effects are minimal and it also tries and covers the emotions while dealing with literally and 'explodingly!' increasing capacity of the brain. No futuristic gadgets, gizmos, or aliens, spaceships etc. but the sci-fi that gets straight to your heart / or probably into the brain :-)<br/><br/>My High! 1. I could relate to the theme (100% usage of brain) as I experienced (need not to be believed though:-)) something similar.

He was recognized as the eminent spiritual Guru in the world. Everyone in the hall attended the session that day, could get a chance to seek his blessings. While he was doing that and I looked at him for a moment, I felt as if he has scanned me completely and knows everything about me and also about every single person in the hall.

"JackRice100","2","6","15","10 November 2014"," Annoyingly bad
","This film is about a girl called Lucy who ends up having to deliver a briefcase to a Mr. Jang. It soon goes horribly wrong where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug this drug leaks into her system and allows her to access more percentage of her brain's capacity.<br/><br/>I thought this film was horrible. Not because of the lack of storyline, character depth or even how ridiculously unrealistic it all was. Its because you've seen this done before so so so much better, hell even if they completely ripped off Limitless it would of been better! First of you get no introduction into who Scarlett Johansson's character is, even if you knew what she was like, even a little bit, you may of been able to care about her, what she did and what she was going through but they didn't. There is one scene were she rings her mum and dad, by far the best scene, for emotion and caring (be it only a little) for Lucy and the situation at hand. Then this gang of Chinese drug smugglers lead by Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) who's character wasn't as frightening as he should of been. This to to me seems to be because of some lazy acting on his part and just being in a really badly thought out film, this happens to a lot of the talented actors in this film sadly. Morgen Freeman plays Professor Norman and as much as I love the guy and I really do love him, he can play this roll in his sleep, its easy for him and it shows. That said he was one of the more interesting character's in the film. One of my favourite things about the movie is during the first half I think it is they cut between whats happening with Lucy and a presentation Professor Norman is doing, explaining all his theories and information about what's happening/going to happen to Lucy. I thought this was a bit of a cheap and lazy way to tell whats going on but it was nicely shot nonetheless. One of the things I wished they did is once she started to use more of her brains capacity we saw what she saw and why she did the things she was doing, they did do this but to see it in a slower pace and more of it would of been better. As you had some shots of poorly looking vain's and this drug entering her system next thing you know, she's a cold hearted killer! So to see her change slowly into this less human more robot like state would of been much better for me. Annoyingly tho by about 20% more she was already moving objects with her mind why did they have to do it so soon?! At 60/70% maybe, 20% is quite a big jump. I will leave how ridiculous it gets later on for your imagination. It is one of the few things you can't guess correctly, not because its really clever thought provoking film work but because its so ridiculous. She soon gets help from a police officer named Pierre Del Rio played rather well by Amr Waked he helps find and capture the rest of the drug smugglers to help Lucy reach 100% this gets her to help Professor Norman with his knowledge of the brain and universe in general. Overall this film was horrible this stems from terribly put together story, that has no character depth or growth during the film. The reason it gets a generous 2 star rating out of 10 is because iv seen much worse performances that unlimitedly were let down by the story and script."

A cross between a tutorial on the progression of cognitive capability, action movie and humanity.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson gives what I believe is an award winning performance. Exhibiting great range in her skills as an actress. Going from a scared student to what she becomes as the movie progresses. The choice of Scarlett goes beyond her beauty, but also helps bring to light the capabilities of the human mind while you watch her transition.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's part is no less critical in the progression of the character Lucy. Showing extreme maturity in acting Mr. Freeman's simple facial expressions add to the profound nature of the topic of the story.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have given Lucy a very low rating, everyone is not capable of appreciating a movie of higher awareness. Lucy is a movie for those that have the capability of thinking!!<br/><br/>Destine to be a classic such as 2001:A Space Odyssey. <br/><br/>Lucy is far more that a Sci-fi filled with endless computer graphics, there are no aliens or robots.

","While the whole 10% thing is scientifically wrong, the path of human evolution to a higher state of being, as is depicted, is quite plausible and could make sense even from a scientific point of view (at least in part). But what makes this movie great, is not the plot, it's that it raises a few important philosophical questions, and also offers some possible answers (quite rare). So while the Sci in SciFi may not apply to this movie,it does offer food for thought, which is the great thing about SciFi movies. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the 10% story was presented in a very serious, academic manner (college course) and could make some people actually believe it is scientifically valid."

","This film is enjoyable if you like the idea of none linear time and of the complexity of actuality being a human construct. Although Lucy draws from and plays with ideas on what is reality, how does that interplay with perception. What does that mean for a person who no longer take micro seconds to perceive be coping with on a emotional and physical level. bridging off of these idea of higher being the film dives into a more fantastical realm and completely becomes fictional. It does not stick to the pure facts of what we know Yet they are using actual theories and philosophical debates. I find the fantasy used to exaggerate these notion to be done well and in thought provoking ways. how does one come to terms with understanding more then ones self, not only that but in seeing past the conjecture of basically everything. This is some allegory of the cave sh!t up in here but there is also the question of if this movie is supposedly what happened to Lucy or if it was just her tripping out on drugs."

Interesting story supported by great images made this one work brilliantly. Don't see many movies as good as this these days. Luc Besson did a bang up job directing it on a par with the best films out there from any time period. Three cheers for this one. I liked the way it was maybe a homage of sorts to A Space Odyssey in terms of some of the images-anyone familiar with that film will understand the reference. Liked the way it cross cut images that were part rock video and part documentary in keeping with the eclectic nature of the times we live in. With one foot in the world of trendy and one foot in the world of science it kept viewers interested in what would happen next.

The storyline is fast paced and gripping, not too fast that you lose your way but enough to keep people engaged.<br/><br/>This film was excellent. There were a few scenes where they seemed a little silly and unrealistic but the majority was a great performance by Scarlet Johansson. There have been a fair few negative reviews and a surprisingly low rating on IMDb. Many because people were led to believe it was a sci-fi film. It did have some Sc-fi elements including levitation people and various time warps; however, what really gripped me with the film was the fact that it introduced true and very relevant facts of the world. <br/><br/>The concept and story of Lucy is very philosophical to say the least, or at least that is what I found.

","Lucy is the name given to the fossil remains of female hominid who lived 3.2 million years ago (the first woman, the movie calls her). Lucy is also the name given to the main character of this movie, the first person to use a greater, much greater, percentage of her neurons.<br/><br/>Lucy starts out as some very ordinary girl who for some reason finds herself in Taiwan and dating some hustler named Richard. He begs her to deliver a case for him to a man in a hotel lobby. She's not interested. He handcuffs the case to her wrist, puts $500 down her blouse. Off she goes to ask for Mr. Jang. Next thing, Richard who has been watching from outside is shot and she's dragged away. Jang doesn't speak English and is suspicious. Lucy is forced to open the case. There are bags of blue crystal drug in there. Jang offers Lucy a job. She declines. Next, she wakes up with a scar on her abdomen. She and 3 other guys have been implanted with a bag of the new drug and are supposed to deliver it to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Lucy is placed in a room where she's abused by some guy, she resists, he beats her up. The bag in her abdomen leaks and she's affected by the drug. At first she gains physical strength and other strange powers. She leaves the place after shooting up the bad guys, goes to a hospital to have the bag removed from her body. She notices how her mind and skills are expanding.<br/><br/>Parallel to this we meet some scientist named Norman who is giving a speech in Paris about what it would be life for humans to use a greater percentage of their neurons. Lucy calls him showing him her skills. She's living proof of what he's been theorizing about. She tells him she'll see him in Paris. As she travels to Paris she develops the skill to control other people, but mid-flight her body almost vaporizes so she has to inhale the rest of the drug she's carrying with her. She also alerts the authorities about the other 3 mules.<br/><br/>In Paris she meets a cop she's been communicating with. They catch the mules and take them all to Paris. She meets the scientists and has no choice but go all the way and take all the drugs and to see what will happen. But, the Asian mobster is also in Paris determined to get his drugs back.<br/><br/>Lucy isn't so much about the action. It's...who would have thought...about the ideas. And who would have thought that it would be Besson to come up with a rich philosophical movie, a movie not even about French existentialism but about German metaphysics. The issues covered include--being vs. having, reproduction vs. immortality, matter and energy, and being and time. The science is a bit hokie, but the philosophical ideas are solid. That said, of the philosophical action movies (The Matrix, Inception), this one is the weakest when it comes to the action, the philosophical ideas also, aren't worked out, just hinted.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed Lucy a great deal. Johansson does a good job. I wasn't crazy about the robot-like acting near the end though. If you catch the ideas and references, the movie gives you a lot to think about. While the movie doesn't quite develop the questions it wants to ask, it comes up with the answer and the answer is indeed philosophically significant."

Lucy herself... well let's just say she makes some strange choices (which is understandable in her drugged state) and yet, to me she's not a really well written character. The special effects are really good and watching Asian mafia in a shootout with French police looks good on that big screen.

"houghtonetet","9","6","15","2 September 2014"," Not so dumb science, perhaps
","Writer/director Luc Besson serves up another entertaining ninety minutes of science fiction, this time based on the (erroneous) concept of the human brain using only a fraction of its capacity. (The brain does in fact use all its grey and white matter, just not all at once). Anyway, that's the dumb science part of it, and the idea does result in a thrill ride across the world as Scarlett Johansson's unwitting victim, the titular Lucy, becomes an emotionless death machine and the nemesis of those who engaged her in their nefarious activities.<br/><br/>Lucy's emotional and mental transformation was as a result of the ingestion of some of the drug she was coerced into transporting. (A nice touch to use Julian Rhind-Tutt as the first surgeon – he played a surgeon in the UK TV series ""Green Wing."") Her mission as an avenging angel was satisfying (no-one likes bullies) as was her willingness to share her knowledge with the specialist she identified – Professor Norman, impeccably played as ever by the excellent Morgan Freeman. There was good support from Min-sik Choi as the Taiwanese mob leader and Amr Waked as the French police captain Lucy adopted as an ally.<br/><br/>The film was heading to its logical conclusion when the science suddenly became a little more intriguing as the film postulated a redefinition of the laws governing all of existence, and not many Hollywood films do that nowadays!<br/><br/>The ending has been done before (in Lawnmower Man), but not before the sum total of all knowledge was donated to Professor Norman by the transforming Lucy. This leaves the possibility for a sequel nicely poised. Will Lucy become a benevolent guardian, a curse on humanity, or a mere observer?<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film. The mobsters were intimidating and convincing, the police were not made fools of, the leads were engaging and believable, the CGI not excessive. Stunts and action scenes were handled with skill. I enjoyed the cool and efficient airport arrests of the other drug mules – beautifully handled.<br/><br/>There were some flaws, the one that jarred with me the most was the timing of moving so many drug suspects across Europe. I am not sure German, French and Italian law enforcement agencies co-operate quite so efficiently, but that would detract from the film's message. A good evening's entertainment and not the disaster many might have you believe – 9/10."
"horizon2008","2","6","15","26 August 2014"," Nonsense and Morgan Freeman.
","Firstly, let me just say that Under The Skin is already my film of the year, and I can't imagine anything changing that position with just a few months of 2014 left. I did not expect Lucy to be as magnificent as that of course, but I had hoped for some mildly entertaining sci-fi to pass a couple of hours at the cinema, alas however, this movie got under my skin alright, but for all the wrong reasons. Luc Beeson has been put firmly in his place by Mr Glazer. . <br/><br/>We begin with some shots of a chimp (which looks absolutely terrible when compared with the Apes movie out at the moment), and Morgan Freeman spouting off pseudo-scientific garbage from a podium being well.......Morgan Freeman. Is it just me, or is anyone else sick and tired of seeing Freeman appear in movies as the ""knowledgeable old black man"" adding nothing to any film he's been in for years, and existing only as a piece of old mahogany furniture as if his mere presence gives a flick some validity? He's been typecast for at least a decade now and surely he must know how boring a character he's become? Honestly, you could take him out of any of the last 20 films he's made and place him in another and no one would notice the difference. What a yawn. I wish he would just call it a day and retire with his ample fortune. But anyway, back to Lucy. . <br/><br/>Once Scarlets character has a package of drugs burst inside her she apparently gets the ability to use more of her brain (does anyone with even half a brain still believe this 10% nonsense? Obviously Beeson thinks someone does), and all of a sudden she acquires these superhuman abilities which even with some amazing drug effects are preposterous (yes we don't see all of the available light on the spectrum for example but that's a condition of our eyes' construction, not something a pill will fix). Then we have several intercut scenes of wildebeest roaming the plains (or was that Fawlty Towers?) and animals having sex, crashing oceans, and other ridiculous tosh that's supposed to underpin the daft plot. If I wasn't cringing at the dialogue that came out of Scarlets mouth I was laughing out loud at the scientific woo I was being force fed. I know it's a fact that America is low on scientific literacy but surely no one could swallow this nonsense? I mean really? It's been mentioned many times too that Lucy is a bit like Limitless, which I agree with slightly, but Limitless was fun and wasn't trying to take itself seriously, while the longer Lucy went on, the more ridiculously ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" it got. Exchanging one pseudo- scientific soundbite for another (sending me off down the proverbial rabbit hole). . <br/><br/>By the end I felt mentally raped of my intelligence. Yes it's only a movie, but I know that somewhere out there people read into stuff like this creating ""alternative"" websites and Facebook memes that spread wacko rubbish all about (like we only use 10% of our brains). But maybe I'm wrong, because when I truthfully look back at my experience of watching Lucy, I get the sense that I was indeed only using 10% of my brain, or maybe that's all I was left with."
"tcbently","9","6","15","23 August 2014"," Superhuman
","Lucy takes the old adage that humans only use 10% of their brains (dolphins use 20% apparently) and runs with it. In fact, under Luc Besson's direction, it runs surprisingly far, and the end product is almost something of a new genre of bio-thriller and is, by my reckoning, at least 20 times more exciting than say the latest Captain America instalment, if only for its emotional reality. I was particularly awed not just by the action scenes but by moments such as Lucy's phone call to her mother, just before she becomes overwhelmed by her new skills.<br/><br/>On the downside, the film seems to reference and even pay homage to, lots of other films, most notably 2001 A Space Odyssey and seems, at times, very similar to Scarlett Johansson's last film, Under the Skin and Besson's The Fifth Element. There are some nice touches and many very violent moments. It seems you can get away with lots of blood and retain a 15 certificate as long as there's no nudity. The furthest Lucy goes romantically is a chaste kiss with a police officer. The violence and drug abuse is fairly graphic but is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction in its wit and style. Everyone acts their socks off and I laughed, cried (almost) and gaped at the action. A lot of the film is derivative and the science is sometimes shaky but there is also a lot of stuff to enjoy in a movie which manages to meld English, French and Hong Kong sensibilities."

It is filled with clichés and simply void of any substance. <br/><br/>All those unoriginal nods (that must have seemed like brilliant ideas--Lucy ""the first human,"" the 2001 & Michelango's Sistine Chapel moment) didn't amount for anything and I kept wondering why can't the most powerful human do something good with all those powers, perhaps find a solution for the destruction we are causing to our planet?

","In short- The movies starts off good and then it's all down hill from there. I didn't even bother wasting my time watching the last 10 or 15 minutes. It was just so ridiculous and absurd. I had no real knowledge of the movie before seeing it, which is the way I usually like it so I have no preconceived ideas. But as I said before, the more I watched, the more ridiculous the movie became and the less I liked it. It's the whole thing, it's Stupid with a capital S. There will be people who will enjoy the movie. Those who can accept the absurdity presented then it will probably be great. But for me some of the concepts presented in the movie were just something I couldn't get my mind around and accept. It became so weird towards the end I couldn't even bare to watch another second. My thumb hurriedly stumbled across the remote searching for the stop key with all the finesse of an elephant on ice skates in an attempt to end the absurdity as fast as was humanly possible."

","People are really going to town on the fact the movie isn't scientifically correct but there's so many myths and uncertainty about the science of such a matter I think people need to relax and enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is full of action and really makes you wish you could do the things Lucy can. With an exciting chase and an interesting view into 'what if we could do these things' Lucy is still a movie you can watch again and again as it keeps you thinking 'wow what if this really happened.'<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson leads fantastically, as usual and well let's face it, is Morgan Freeman ever bad. He's the man that Lucy goes to when she learns what is happening to her to share the information with him and his team.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a good action packed thriller and people shouldn't be bringing it down because of the science being wrong."

I finished the film feeling satisfied and happy with a nice thrill. <br/><br/>I totally recommend this title if you're looking at a nice action flick that has a little bit of depth, a bit unconventional and dark, yet no- nonsense action.

","This movies starts well and promises a lot, the opening scenes are excellent and well structured but the momentum quickly drops away. The storyline itself verges on the ridiculous. Why is Hollywood bombarding us with so much lame dribble with lots of CGI and no substance? The acting is OK, Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansen have to use all of their class to deliver the poorly written script, (which they do very well). There are so many unrealistic scenes, I'm sure the main bad guy was talking a different language to his henchmen. The final 10 minutes were diabolical- about as realistic as a good Bollywood effort! Very disappointing."
"Spondonman","8","5","12","3 December 2014"," Ninety-Nine And A Half (Won't Do)
","Scarlet Johansson seems to like these kind of roles: expressionless and powerful – after Under The Clobber and Avengers I think she's cornered the market. Her face, and by now her persona too lend themselves perfectly to the display of vapid heaviness; personally speaking good to look at but not someone with whom you can empathise. But maybe lucky everyone else in this film is personally speaking ordinary looking and/or ugly. As long as she keeps picking fairly interesting scripts this is her golden period.<br/><br/>In this she unwittingly becomes embroiled as a mule with a terrible boss of a machine-like drug gang in Taiwan and has a literally incredible naughty drug sewn inside her to sell on to the endless suckers in Europe. The story is what happens after she's charmingly kicked repeatedly in the stomach by some pointless nutter releasing the secrets of the universe within her so she goes from 10% to 100% total awareness. In other words, a techno-version of Frank Herbert's 1960's tub-thumper Dune and what happened to Paul and Alia updated for tablet screen-swiping generations. And it is a trip. The potential for the story was vast, indeed almost er Limitless, only what a shame it was allowed to dwindle and disappear into a nonsense computerised climax/vortex, or maybe anus would be better – with the full possibilities of Johansson's heightened awareness unrealised. It may be that in her heightened state she took everything for granted, but that's not much consolation to the hordes of thwarted viewers who couldn't take anything for granted, who saw tantalising glimpses of her kicking ass in various outlandish robotic ways and a car chase almost boring in its proportions. Various people are slaughtered peremptorily throughout, mainly baddies but the one I objected to was the poor random guy whose medical operation was interrupted by her shooting him dead explaining glibly to the surgeon that he wouldn't have pulled through anyway. I could never empathise with an executioner even if they could be right. It's a pretty emphatic if trite end proving to me yet again if I needed it that the way forward is in flash drives; I hope but doubt there's a USB connection to a sequel.<br/><br/>I don't love Lucy however I did 100% enjoy it, the time (as being of course the only meaningful measurement) flew by but I did see the film therefore it must exist. The seediness, violence and lack of humour definitely exist along with the artifice, artificiality and artistry within these mere ninety minutes. So the premise is fiction - yawn - what else can be really expected of a fiction film? They Saved Hitler's Brain was also fiction, apologies if that's considered a spoiler. But look around yourself – look at the mess homo sapiens has made for millennia, is making and will continue to make of our only home, and maybe we should think the 10% human brain-usage could be a 90% brainless over-estimate."
"drjones0","4","5","12","1 December 2014"," Besson misses the mark by a mile. Lucy is a catastrophe.
","CAUTION SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>After attempting to make it through Besson's plodding and seemingly dated and bland flick, 'The Family', a morbid curiosity pulled me towards Besson's latest flick sci-fi action vehicle, 'Lucy'. I had hoped the man who once brought us 'Leon' and 'The Fifth Element' would return to the big screen bringing a weird and fantastical science fiction film with him; however, he misses the mark, not by a forgivable amount, but by a mile. Lucy is a catastrophe.<br/><br/>The film begins with Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), being coerced by her new boyfriend into delivering a mysterious suitcase of what she believes to files to an unknown party located inside a hotel. What could go wrong? A lot apparently. The recipient turns out to be a ruthless Korean drug lord, played by the menacing Min-Sik Choi, who ends up slicing Lucy open and stuffing her full of the drug, 'CPH4′, in a bid to use her as a drug mule. Things go south after the drug leaks into Lucy's body and she begins to gain control of more than than 10% of her brain's capacity.<br/><br/>As Lucy's mental capacity grows, she gains the ability to scare dogs, see through trees, use multiple laptops at once and spook Morgan Freeman by adjusting his apartment lighting, all with her mind! By the time her mental capacity reaches 50% (or whatever it was, I was struggling to focus at this point), Besson breaches the bottom of the barrel and keeps scraping: Lucy now has the ability to extract memories by placing her thumbs on their forehead – Where can I find some of this magical drug?!<br/><br/>I would spoiler this but you probably wouldn't believe me, probably because you're an optimist; when she attains 100% control of her brain, Lucy turns into an organic computer, giving Morgan Freeman a USB stick with the entire history of the world before disintegrating into thin air (It must have been at least a 16gb stick to hold all that information). Unsurprisingly, Morgan Freeman and the other scientists in the room during the scene seemed to be just as perplexed as I was, though I'm not sure what I expected after watching Lucy randomly disintegrate on a flight mid-way through the movie, only to appear in fine in the next scene.<br/><br/>There is a unnecessarily liberal use of what seems like National Geographic stock footage throughout the film, such as a leopard catching its prey is jarringly inter-cut with Lucy being grabbed by the Korean mobsters, or footage of rhinos and other animals fornicating etc. Besson thinks he is creating some sort of grand metaphor or gesture, but this almost literal attempt just comes across as lame, stale and heavy handed. My eyes were continually viewing the back of head during these moments.<br/><br/>Johansson gives little life to her already wafer thin character. As usual, she is unable to emote or draw anything out of the viewer. Besson could have (and maybe he should have) replaced Johansson with a cardboard cutout, I'm sure he would have garnered a greater performance out of it, and perhaps been able to cut the budget in two. More often that not I thought Johansson was reading straight off a teleprompter, though in fairness to her, she wasn't given much to work with.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman dressed as a scientist in his most phoned in performance yet. He is there purely to expel exposition for the audience. It is Min-Sik Choi who takes the cake. His take on a villainous Korean mobster, hellbent on killing Lucy and getting back his narcotics, is probably one of the few redeeming qualities of the film. His talent shows, but it is frivolously wasted here. I truly hope we see him in more films (check out 'I Saw the Devil' if you haven't already!)<br/><br/>Not only is an inherent suspension of belief necessary for viewing Lucy, you must take your brain out of your skull and continuously bash it with a baseball bat until it is in pieces (maybe set fire to the pieces just to be sure). The occasional dab of pretty cinematography here and there, and Min-Sik Choi's performance doesn't make up for this profoundly dumb and diluted glittery turd.

","Very unusual movie with great potential. Some kind of science fiction action, just to see the Luc Besson's writing. I read somewhere that the film is a mix of a Leon Professional and 2001: Odyssey and really would agree with that. Especially towards the end. Scarlett is a real female heroine in the movie and its transformation into the same is to be applauded. For some things in the movie should not be seen as black and white, because technically they are not true, but actually it does not matter so much, just accept that you watch the movie, not real life. As a whole, the film is very entertaining and intense, and he certainly giving thumbs up, but I think it could be a lot better.

"little_nightbutterfly","7","5","12","22 September 2014"," what happens when we use the full hundred percent of our brain capacity..
","I have to start with.. This is my first written movie review, I watch a lot of movies, but that doesn't make me an expert on movies. I have my genre's, but as a reviewer I'll take this to natural grounds and give my honest opinion on it.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is worth seeing on the big screen. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is an student, studying in Korea as she meets the wrong guy. Before she knows it she is bound to a suitcase, which later on contains a large amount of powerful synthetic drugs, called CPH4. Without agreement, she has herself being a delivery girl for the Korean mafia, to take the drugs to Europe. The drugs is hidden in her stomach, which by some violence gets 'kicked' open, integrated into her system with devastating results..<br/><br/>This results leads to her being able to use the full hundred percent of her brain capacity and usage. With the humans starting off with just ten percent usage of their brain, Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) explains in a lecture, held in the university, about what would happen when we would reach twenty percent or even forty. Eventually a student asks him what would happen if we were able to use the whole hundred percent.. Even the professor didn't know.. (Must say something if Morgan Free doesn't even know the answer!)<br/><br/>In the movie we see how Lucy involves by the percents, as she gets more 'gifts' every time she involves. It starts with not feeling any pain and controlling your own body to traveling through time and space, controlling others and even transform matter.<br/><br/>This movie started off great and throughout the movie it developed a good strong story as you can understand all the information that the movie tells to you about the capacity of the human brain. But I have to ask, didn't it go to far? Luc Besson has great movies on his name, like The Fifth Element or Taken. Which both have a good story and The Fifth Element has it's own unique science fiction world around it. 'Lucy' has as well it's own science fiction world around it, but trying to mix it with the action and elements, that seen familiar with Matrix, X- men, Transcendence, Inception and Limitless, it's a bit.. TO MUCH? <br/><br/>But I must say, it's a good movie and I really do recommend it to people even though a lot of people hate it with a lot of passion. I think they are wrong, but hey taste is different from person to person..<br/><br/>I know one thing.. I know what happens when we use the full hundred percent of our brain capacity.. Which I could simply spoil for you, but I wont, cause with that question, you'll enjoy watching the movie. Take it with a bit of salt and you will be fine!<br/><br/>For more upcoming reviews visit my blog! https://demidereus.wordpress.com"

There is documentary, science-fiction, action, power, weakness, feelings, so much question marks and so on. There are pieces from each one and when Luc Besson put them together, here it is ""unity"". <br/><br/>If you have to enjoy this movie you'd better force your imagination. The script has many potential and possibilities and you have the opportunity to complete the scenes in your mind, in anyway you want. <br/><br/>The main problem for me is, we jumped in the story.

"eonbluedan-1","7","5","12","26 August 2014"," Unexpectedly thrilling
","Entering the latest Luc Besson offering, I was cynical, but to my own surprise, the film won me over! Yes, there are logic gaps, a cliché use of Morgan Freeman and perhaps an over-simplification of the idea, but 'Lucy' drives home with visual invention, a notable, pumping score by Eric Serra and sharp, fast paced editing; the effect frequently being that we feel, like our typically tough female lead, as though we are on some mad drug ourselves. Drawing on some of his own best previous work, Besson puts together a film with a feeling, at times, not unlike a solid Manga adaption, ala 'The Edge Of Tomorrow'. Also, a fun little aside that is most welcome, now I think about it, is a not-so-subtle tip of the hat to Korean classic 'Oldboy', with Min-sik Choi himself playing the villain Mr Jang with relish! <br/><br/>It is easy to ignore the obvious liberties taken with the science, because the film is quite clearly not trying to be seen as accurate; you can also overlook the lack of character development, or indeed any real narrative meat, because once again, Besson knows exactly what he is looking to make here. Much like its own thesis on how human beings interpret the universe, 'Lucy' is a big idea scaled down. It is not as original or fresh as one might have hoped, and it does have its stumbles, but once you're over the hurdles, it proves to be a more-exciting-than-expected, well-built, high-octane thrill ride, which is most worthy of ninety minutes of your time."
"yakasil","8","5","12","22 August 2014"," a bold sci-fi thriller that depicts the origin of life
","You could say it starts off as a bit of a joke. Or just a really bad version of a 007 wanna-be- bad ass replica. Even Johannson's acting starts off as a bit of a joke; literally, she seems to be laughing more than crying herself through the first ten minutes of the film. However, Lucy transcends with every passing minute – as if the quality of the film and it's acting were corresponding to the percentage of brain capacity that the protagonist female- gone-super-human android is using. It is one of those films, whose idea clearly surpasses cinematographic capabilities - time, space, gravity, and the origin of cells that build life and our reality - it is one of those films, that you watch skeptically, but are patient and open to giving it a chance. You watch, learn and enjoy, but after that start are all the while still deciding whether this is total guff, whether you have been ripped off at the theater counter, and served quantum-physics starters-pack drivel with some Scarlett glitter on top to cover it up? About midway through, I decided to give it a chance. A real chance. A chance at blowing me away and taking my mind to places unexplored, allowing my brain synapses to dance and go wild, tying together all my theories about life with what I was learning whilst fixing my eyes upon the screen. It worked. The key is, to see film as art. To take what you can get from it. Not to criticize (and believe me there was a lot of moaning and dis-missing going on in the seats around me) but to make the most of it. Yes you CAN. Once this happens (and there have been a lot of films where it just doesn't happen) you are free to go and experience that wonderful world of time, intelligence and purpose of life that is Lucy. Maybe I am an optimist who was fed cyborg-bull crap and went off on it – maybe I fell in love with the idea of being- and playing Scarlett's part, but in any case, I am glad to have seen this film, as it let me exit that cinema with sharpened senses and let me glide into the night feeling alive, thirsting for knowledge, finding life intelligent and beautiful. Each step was beautiful."

But the good ones don't try to scientifically explain/justify it, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. Believing in the force is admission to the star-wars universe. But they don't tell you some story about how consuming only orange food will do that to you...<br/><br/>This movie however is scientifically inaccurate, and does try to justify it with bogus science. Which means that a good portion of the movie you're listening to completely rubbish false science and you'll be going.. ""whhaaat?! no... Thats not how that works...."" I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't go into detail, but I'll give one example: there used to be this myth in the world that humans are only using 10% of their brain. The myth has since been debunked because maybe at 1 time only 10% is in use, but all of it is used at some point. It is like activation 100% of all muscles all the time doesn't make you stronger, but spastic, and will stop your heart because in fact you need to activate and then deactivate the muscles is order to pump.. some muslces are actually creating forces in opposite forces. The same is somewhat true of the brain, activating it 100% won't make you smarter, it will just activate every part of your body and mind, and it will be bad.. The movie makes a lot of big big big jumps from there i wont spoil for you, but if you hate scientific inaccurate EXPLANATIONS, you'll hate this movie.<br/><br/>I really hated someone telling me absolute bullshit for most of the movie. It is as if the whole movie someone is telling you all of what is happening is possible because 4+2=10 and 4-1=0...

But really good sci-fi happens when the shift between the actual science and the fiction operates so seamlessly that you don't even realize you've gone there, and that's how you buy into the story. But here, Besson tries to force the spectator into the fiction while the science was never there to begin with!<br/><br/>It takes forever for the story to set in and for the movie to actually start, and it is boring. Then, the so-called science is a load of CRAP, then more ridiculous CRAP piles up on top of that, and you end up thinking that maybe you don't want to live on this planet anymore. To mention a couple of these things : the 10% brain usage or the synthesized bone growth pregnancy hormones that gives you superpowers (WHAAAAAT?!)<br/><br/>The worst part is, this entire story would have never happened if the main character played by Scarlett Johansson wasn't a complete irresponsible moron. Then yes, maybe that Lucy character, indeed only used 10% of her micro-brain. And afterwards, during interviews, Besson says that he really admires women and respects them... Then WHY in the HELL are you feminine characters absolute idiots?! <br/><br/>To sum up the story : a massively stupid character gets into an even more stupid situation, she ends up being kicked in the stomach and synthesized bone growth pregnancy hormones progressively turns her into a sort of ""mind-Hulk"" who wrecks an incredible amount of property, and makes things float and time stop, and gets a lot of people killed for no reason.

It seemed very sci-fi and entertaining, so I thought to give it a try. <br/><br/>After watching the movie, I'm still a bit confused as to what happened. The character development wasn't the greatest in this film, and for the most part, I thought that the scientific component of the movie was grasping at straws. Of course, it's a fictional movie, but there's a limit to excessive stretching of hypotheses and theories. <br/><br/>The CGI was fantastic in the movie, but the whole purpose of it wasn't explained clearly. At the beginning of the movie, you start off wondering what is going on and what this drug does to your body. There's no scientific explanation for it, and the gangsters that implanted the drug in her body (as seen in the commercial) don't even speak the same language to each other (Korean and Chinese). So right there, you start to see irregularities in the film - easy mistakes that should have been fixed. <br/><br/>Throughout the rest of the film, you see Lucy using more and more of her brain's total capacity, and she completely loses her humanity and becomes a digital being, living in the cyberworld. But to what purpose? I still don't get it.<br/><br/>So my opinion is that it's an entertaining movie filled with suspense and action, but the scientific theories and story development are a bit underdeveloped and exaggerated from the truth. I give it a 6/10 purely because of the entertainment factor."

","Even putting aside the ridiculous premise, I didn't really have that much faith going into Luc Besson's latest. The French action legend hasn't made a truly good film since La Femme Nikita back in 1990. That being said, he hasn't made any terrible movies since then either, and this somewhat dubious trend continues with Lucy. As is the case with most of Besson's work, anyone with half a brain will be able to follow the storylne with little trouble. Lucy unintentionally ingests an experimental drug. This raises her mental capacity to ridiculous heights, effects-driven hijinks ensue. Pretty standard stuff really, and the leaps in logic are so glaringly obvious that ignoring them quickly becomes a distraction (why push cars out of the way you could simply fly over them?). Granted, this fact does not seem to go unnoticed by the film itself, as several welcome moments of self-awareness manage to slip themselves organically into the storyline. But even knowing of its inherent flaws is not nearly enough to save Lucy from its cliched, high-concept plot and bring action."

Under these conditions, Mr. Jang cannot win. The premise of the story, that humans use only a small fraction of their mental capacity, is pure science fantasy and completely unsupported by fact, but for the purpose of this movie, it's as good as any other myth. In her normal state Lucy is harmless, but as her brain power keeps increasing so does her powers which enable her to perform acts that defy the laws of physics. And that too is explained by the movie. But to learn that explanation the movie should be watched. Why spoil an interesting story?"
"ziga321","7","6","16","23 August 2014"," I must say that was ""over the top""
","Human can only use 10% of the brains, but what if they use more? This sci-fi work asks this question.<br/><br/>Throw in The fifth element(1995), add in a guy from a Transporter as a main lead, only this time he is playing a woman, with special superpowers actually a Mix between Neo, from Matrix and Nikita, add the late 90s latest street babble about some new drugs who can seriously affect the brains (in a strange way of course) and a Morgan Freeman as a Serious scientist who is working on some Serious scientific project about ""this stupid humans"", who are only limited around the percent of brains they could use simultaneously and tad of some korean guys as a main bad guys and you will probably get what this movie is about.<br/><br/>The whole story is really so silly and I also believe it was a Luc Besson take on action heroes movies. Watch it, especially if you are light-hearted and never takes cinema anywhere seriously."
"Dalif","4","6","16","5 August 2014"," Eye candy with no past, no present and no future
","I appreciate the suspension of disbelief, when watching a movie. It's important when embracing each individual movie's reality. Sometimes, however, a movie sets up a reality so far removed from the actual reality, that suspending disbelief to accept everything going on, is near impossible. Lucy's premise relies on a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. It was just too ludicrous, and presented in such a manner, that I had a hard time accepting it as truth - even knowing it was just a movie. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie what it is, I found, that I couldn't care about any of the characters. They lacked depth. The movie starts with the fully formed character of Lucy. No background, no way for us to related to her at all. And we're treated to a series of somewhat inexplicably disconnected scenes, with very little actual development. Sequences that were pretty to look at, but had almost no impact on the story or the characters. I couldn't relate to anybody. Or anything going on. <br/><br/>Luc Besson has made some movies that were unique in their own right, and movies I'll always appreciate. But this wasn't one of them. It felt empty, and when I left the theater, I felt like I had wasted my time. Like I hadn't been given what I came for: entertainment and something to think about."
"texshelters","9","6","16","1 August 2014"," ""Lucy"" Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100%
","""Lucy"" Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100% <br/><br/>Most of the best sci-fi movies are about ideas. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Fahrenheit 451, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Inception are examples of this. Then there are those sci-fi movies that have relied more on technology and special effects than ideas. (See Transformers.) However, when science fiction combines both ideas and technology, the genre can be one of the most entertaining in cinema. Lucy does just that. <br/><br/>The ideas in Lucy are no less universal than the purpose of life on this planet and what it means to be human. And like 2001, A Space Odyssey, the film offers no pat answers to these questions. <br/><br/>Lucy gets abducted by Japanese thugs in a fancy Taiwanese hotel and taken to a room where she meets their boss. The gangsters want to know what is in the case her now ex-boyfriend has cuffed to her left arm. Lucy doesn't know, but she learns later what she has. <br/><br/>Some critics question the fact that Japanese business men, mobsters really, don't speak English. The fact is, we don't know if they speak English. What we do know is that they refuse to speak English, and that makes Lucy even more frightened and the scene more foreboding as she is questioned by the criminals. Moreover, the lack of subtitles for the Japanese spoken in the scene helps us empathize with Lucy's situation; we don't know what is happening any more than she does. <br/><br/>Lucy isn't drawn out or overly mellow-dramatic. Scarlett Johansson does a good job as Lucy, a strange and multi-dimensional character even though we have little to no back-story for the character. That doesn't matter, for Lucy's motivation comes from the changes she goes through in the film. <br/><br/>Lucy is what good science fiction can be. It has action, philosophy, and big ideas. What surprises me are all the critiques of the science in Lucy, some from people who loved Inception, Transformers or The Edge of Tomorrow, films with even less plausible scientific under-pinnings. It's as if critics forgot what the phrase ""science fiction"" means. Movies are about suspending disbelief and being carried away. Lucy let's us do just that. <br/><br/>Lucy is not omnipotent like Neo of the Matrix films. She clearly does not have all the answers, and she doesn't have to. Her answers to her existence are more like Buddhist koans, not pronouncements of her divinity. <br/><br/>A friend told me that Johansson is charismatic, that the camera likes her. Wrong, I said, the camera loves her. And I am not just talking about her sultriness. In Lucy, she makes it easy to care about the enigmatic title character. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman is not as well developed. As we meet him, he is presenting a talk on neuroscience and his theories about the brain to a group in Paris. The talk is the weak spot in the movie, although the character of Norman improves as he interacts with Lucy. <br/><br/>One of the most contentious ideas in the film is that ""we only use 10% of our brain."" First, there is no evidence for this, and secondly, there is evidence that over a life-time, 100% of our brains get used, just not all at once. Perhaps the idea is that only 10% of our neurons can fire at one time. The film is not clear on that. I refer you to my earlier statement; it is science fiction. <br/><br/>If you can accept the idea that some people can better access their brain's capacity, i.e. Einstein, Kepler, Tesla, Hawking, and so forth, then it is not hard to accept the idea that perhaps there is more potential in the brain than we realize. Thus, we have Lucy. Bonus: The editing is excellent; it makes want me to become an editor of cinema. I will go out on a limb and say that Lucy will win the Oscar for best editing. The music is interesting but stays out of the way of the movie. Lucy reminds me in many ways of 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially toward the end of the film. After nearly 50 years, Kubrick's classic is still influencing cinema. <br/><br/>Weaknesses: Some of the dialogue is banal. Mostly, it doesn't get in the way of the ideas and action in the movie. Another irksome problem with the film is the lack of explanation of some plot elements, such as why Lucy was studying in Taiwan and how did she get into a jail cell after her kidnapping. A couple of well-placed lines of dialogue could have solved that issue. Rating: Pay full price; see it twice. <br/><br/>Lucy is not a perfect film, and I could nitpick and rate it down a bit. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and ideas and was not in any way put off by the imperfect science. It didn't drag on, it entertained me, and it left me thinking. That's what good science fiction is about. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"ColeMan88","5","6","16","26 July 2014"," Don't Waste Time On 'Lucy'
","'Lucy' is a sci-fi film directed by Luc Besson and stars the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. Johansson plays 'Lucy', a normal woman who is unwillingly brought into a drug ring. During this process, Lucy becomes part of an experiment for this new drug and gets injected with it. These drugs allow Lucy to control her own brain.<br/><br/>I'd like to start off first by saying, this movie served no purpose. The plot is absent and there is hardly anything even decent about it. One of the only decent aspects of the film came from Johansson. Her performance was okay, considering how the entire film played out, but nothing like you would expect from an actress like her. One other thing that this film had going for it was the score. The score served its purpose in certain parts, however in many parts the score was completely out of touch with the movie. The last decent thing about the film was dialogue. There were some short glimpses where the dialogue was good and the rest of the dialogue was bad. About half the movie is in Chinese and there are no subtitles, so it is hard to even tell what is going on.<br/><br/>'Lucy' is a short 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it is so uninteresting that it just drags on. The movie felt very rushed, but I was fine with that because I could not sit through another minute of it. By looking at the trailer, you would probably guess that Morgan Freeman is a main character. WRONG! Freeman is hardly in the film and when he is in it he is shockingly not very good. It seemed as if every five minutes there would be another character thrown into the movie, but there is never any insight on these characters, they are just kind of thrown in there. I actually do not even believe they mentioned the names of most of the characters.<br/><br/>The editing in this film is horrible, very choppy and out of sync. The CGI in this film is horrendous, almost looked as if it were from the Discovery Channel or something. Ironically, due to horrible editing, I felt as if I were watching the Discovery Channel. Morgan Freeman's god-like voice would come on talking about species and space and there would be random nature clips as he spoke.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film may have been the ending. Lucy finally reaches 100% percent brain usage and the way the film is shot and the score is playing, you feel as if something outstanding is about to happen; but it all falls flat. Then the actual ending the the film just leaves you disappointed and feeling scammed. As this film ended the entire theater was in awe of how terrible the movie was. Nothing but negativity coming from the mouths of angry movie watchers.<br/><br/>I really tried to like this movie and think of ways that it could have worked, but there was no possible way. The film was very rushed, served no purpose and I do not see how anyone can enjoy it. My advice to everyone would be to save your money and see something else. I gave 'Lucy' a 5/10 stars, but I was contemplating on giving a 4/10 stars."
"ranzo1974","1","7","20","6 September 2014"," This film is an affront to human dignity
","This movie sends a message to people that are like animals, and that everything was created from nothing. A story without any logic. Trying to rely on Darwin's theory, which itself collapsed and there is absolutely no proof, and what is most worrying all time try to bypassing the Creator - God. The assumption that a human use 10% of the brain is clear lie but director persistently trying to say that is true with special way trying to serve the viewers. Also as the main actress growing percentage of the brain, it becomes all the more a robot and not a man, who would probably need be pure love. Definitely a flop, but only because the director did not want to agree that only God is perfect and everything is managed and that gives the perfect harmony of all things, and crown it all had to be love, not killing. I commend the acting to Scarlett Johansson and scenes."

","One side of me wants to give this movie just 4 stars. It was weird, even stupid at points, but I stuck with it til the end. Certainly entertaining from start to finish, No time was wasted on any part of the movie. explaining how the human mind would work if 20% 30% 50% 90% would work in a movie would be impossible and beyond what us humans perceive to make sense. Which is why the movie could seem confusing and strange. It is suppose to be confusing as we do no yet know what our minds are capable of. I had to watch it a second time to make sure it was what I thought it was. To explain what our mind would be like at higher capacities is not possible. However the writer and director of this film did a brilliant job explaining it. Sure it seems weird, and dream like, but how else to you explain a theory. Especially a theory that is beyond our thinking.<br/><br/>Keep an open mind and know that you are not suppose to be able to make sense of it all. Know it is beyond our thinking and appreciate this movie for what it really is. An entertaining fast paced brilliant piece of art that is a part of propelling us into the future. I have to give it a 10 even though it is not my favorite movie and even though it seemed full of holes, was cheesy and sort of B rated at times. Looking beyond the flaws it was actually well thought out and deserving of 10 stars. its sad to see so many bad reviews but I understand"
"amir_ro88","9","5","13","23 December 2014"," Do not think, just go and watch it ;)
","Dude... This movie got the smokin hot Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman in it. What else do you want in a movie? Seriously those two is more than enough reasons to watch this movie. <br/><br/>I randomly picked this movie and that is my initial thought when I see this 2 people in the movie. Well you guess what? I'm not disappointed. Truth be told my expectation for this movie is kinda low because I do not have any idea what this movie is all about since the title of this movie is very short, consist of only 4 letters; L-U-C-Y. And I never see a commercial or the trailer of this movie anywhere. Its like this movie is magically downloaded into my little brother's external HD or something.<br/><br/>But this movie is more to it than meets the eye as I progressed through the story. Of course the starting of the story is kinda dumb, a guy asked a girl he just meet to deliver a briefcase and she agreed to it as stated in the synopsis. But what happens later is what makes this movie great, thrilling and fun to watch. Lucy in this movie is ain't no bimbo with just pretty face and nice racks, she is a deadly beauty with a brain(tons of it) and has achieved the unthinkable.<br/><br/>Another thing that make this movie interesting to watch is the bad guy of the movie, Mr. Jang. He is not your typical African-American gangsta or Chinese thugs you seen in most movies, he is a Korean gangster with a swagg. Its a rare element in western movies I've seen. This movie touched about many strong issues like narcotics, human trafficking, human evolution, Darwinism and society corruption. So this may definitely not suitable for kids.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is fun, thrilling, mind blowing and enjoyable to watch. An action-thriller sci-fi movie that I would definitely suggest to my friends to watch."

","In the beginning the story seems boring... I thought it was nothing new about a man or woman with magic power, like other movies do. But when the movie finished, I came to realize the director tried to get us across 3 initial questions in philosophy, who am I, where did I come from and where am I going to. This movie answers all of this. This world is about geometry, not physics or chemistry, and nothing is special in the world of mathematics. I just thought about what we would become if we really use all the potential of ourselves. Somehow I begin to believe that we are created by some species more advanced and developed in the universe, considering that till now we haven't find the evidence of the key step of ape's evolving to modern human beings. Maybe all of us have the potential to become much more intelligence and powerful than we could ever imagine, but the balance of nature demands it that we human beings cannot go that far."

The whole movie seems like one of those childhood fantasies that we had wanting to be super-humans and we were doing that in our brains no matter how many physics laws we have to break. Seems like the director skipped quite a few science lessons during his school time. Scarlet Jhonson is the only good thing in this movie with Morgan freeman being his moderate self.

Luc Besson is best known for Leon the Professional, Inception, 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he is also known for the movie Intouchables (2011) which by the way has an 8.6 IMDb rating. One of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Luc Besson did a great job, again as always, and took a simple idea and turned it into a human lesson. That people should use their brains more often and control their desires. I loved the general idea and all the smaller ideas that popped out all over the movie, but only if you had your mind on listening to the dialogues would you know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>I hope it doesn't take Luc Besson another 9 years to manifest another idea as good as this one!<br/><br/>Thanks Luc."
"theblackscythe","2","5","13","10 September 2014"," How could so much talent unite to create something so meaningless?
","I adore Min-Sik Choi. He is among my favourite living actors and blows my mind every time I see him (I implore you all to see Oldboy). Furthermore Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman are actors for whom I hold a great deal of respect for, particularly if given a good script. I also enjoy Luc Besson's work, I consider Leon to be a masterpiece in particular.<br/><br/>So when I heard about film that supposedly combined all these talents into a high concept sci-fi thriller, I was hyped. This enthusiasm barely flattered even after the sub-par reviews came in. I hoped that, despite some rough edges an overall interesting and enjoyable film was still possible. I was very much wrong.<br/><br/>I will start with the film's pacing. It is fairly slow in its first few scenes (the best part of the film) and shows a little promise, however it cranks into overdrive at around the 1/4 mark and doesn't allow for anything resembling character or atmosphere. This seems indicative of a harsh editing process, just like the script. It feels like deep ideas and characters may have existed in some earlier draft of the script, but not here. Everything is so rushed that it comes of as feeling dumb, flaccid and lacking in any punch whatsoever.<br/><br/>Next let's look at the acting. Min-Sik Choi shows promise early on, and does what he can with the material, however he is totally wasted and irrelevant to the films core plot. I almost started routing for him in the end as I was desperate to see him given the material he so clearly deserved. Scarlett Johanson is also clearly trying as hard as she can, in a role that doesn't allow her to show any emotion or personality whatsoever. Morgan Freeman probably escapes with more dignity than the rest of the main cast, as he is basically playing the typical Morgan Freeman stock character, the wizened mentor. The rest of the cast come off terribly, being either annoying, laughable or dull. Particularly Lucy's 'love interest'. His hilariously bad performance almost beggared belief at times.<br/><br/>The films features atrocious CGI, it is particularly damming for a sci-fi film when the effects are weak. This factors into the film's pathetic action, which is largely caused by the film's untouchable protagonist and lack of threat in any of the action sequences. A car chase 2/3 into the film is particularly tedious and features some awful lines from our lead.<br/><br/>Overall, despite a team seemingly capable of birthing this ambitious project, Lucy falls flat on it's face. I was beyond disappointed as I was genuinely hyped for this 89 minute long train-wreck."

The car chase through Paris is quite something. On top of that you have Korean popular influence which is in so many current movies represented here. Liked the look back in time.

"guchrisc","Null","5","13","1 September 2014"," OTT SF film is also a bloody crime story.
","A Universal film. Exciting trailers suggested a film rather like 'Transcendence' from earlier this year starring Johnny Depp, and so it turned out to be. 'Her' (2013), which was screened earlier this year, starred Joaquin Phoenix as a man who fell in love with his computer. That film concentrated on the personal and was rather boring. By contrast, in 'Transcendence', Johnny Depp is plugged into a computer, an event which is exciting and has far-reaching consequences.<br/><br/>In 2011, Bradley Cooper starred in 'Limitless' playing a man who takes a drug which expands his brain-power. 'Lucy' has a similar plot, so it is not an original idea. However it is an exciting film. If however you are interested in this brain-expanding idea, 'Limitless' is the better of the two films. Like in 'Her', 'Limitless' concentrated on the personal, and was rather believable. Writer and director Luc Besson seems to have taken that idea as a starting point, but then via a crime story, has moved into a 'Transcendence' mode of limitless possibilities.<br/><br/>In 1994 Luc Besson astonished audiences with his 'Leon'. Now in 'Lucy' Mr Besson has given us a rather similar bloody and exciting crime story.<br/><br/>'Lucy' opens with some nice graphics to go with the opening titles. However, just like in 'Leon', it is merely the calm before the storm. Some information given out about this film was that the star, Scarlett Johansson, played a character forced to carry drugs, which then got into her system. This seemed an unlikely scenario but Luc Besson makes it a believable situation.<br/><br/>Miss Johansson plays a not too bright party girl in Taiwan who is caught up in the clutches of a gang of violent criminals. Just as 'Leon' opens with a young Natalie Portman scared of falling into the clutches of mad killer Gary Oldman, so in 'Lucy' we have a similar scenario. Miss Johansson stumbles into the clutches of a Mr Jang played by Min-sik Choi. This villainous character makes Mr Oldman look like a pussy-cat. Like Miss Portman before her, Miss Johansson attempts to escape her predicament. However she is unable to. The situation gets worse and worse, the scenes bloodier and bloodier, unremittingly so.<br/><br/>Whilst the early scenes are filmed in Taiwan and are clearly based in Taiwan, the gangsters do not seem to be Triad members. The body-tattooing and Korean language suggest rather that these gangsters are in fact the Japanese Yakuza, who in reality have many ethnic Korean members. Poor little white girl Lucy, unable to speak the language, is terrified by the situation. This is captured well, and we, like Lucy, do not understand the situation. In these scenes Miss Johansson is very emotional and gives a superb performance. As the film develops, so does Lucy, and she becomes more like 'the woman who knows too much', acting accordingly, and again Miss Johansson excels in this character development.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked give good support, but this film is all about Scarlett Johansson and Min-sik Choi, who are the chief protagonists, and who dominate the proceedings, in every scene they are in. Two tremendous performances.<br/><br/>This film is part SF, and part crime story. It is very bloody. If you liked 'Leon' (1994), or 'Transcendence' (2014), then you should enjoy this film. Fans of SF and pseudo-science will enjoy this film, but it is not suitable for viewing by scientists.<br/><br/>Bloody, but good. 9/10."

","When I went to go see 'Lucy' I expected to see a good action film starring the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. I got that. What I also got was a surprisingly intelligent Sci-Fi premise with interesting and creative visuals. Even though Scarlett Johansson is famous for being a pretty face I think her performance in this film prove she is more than that. I suppose I shouldn't have been so surprised considering the Writer/Director is Luc Besson, a French filmmaker that is responsible for such films as: The Fifth Element, Leon: The Professional, The Taken movies, The Transporter movies, and La Femme Nikita (a.k.a. Point of No Return).<br/><br/>I've read around the internet that 'Lucy' is a dumb movie because the ""humans only use 10% of their brain"" premise is a myth. I find it funny considering all the other ridiculous premises that exist in Science Fiction. That leads me to the conclusion that these people don't know what Science Fiction is. It's not a 100% accurate representation of proved science; that would be call Science Fact. Science Fiction takes pieces of real science or things that exist only in theory and explores what that would mean for humanity and our society. Don't think about the premise of 'Lucy' as ""What if we could use 100% of our brain because we only use 10% of it"". Think about the premise as ""What if we had limitless access to all knowledge in the universe? What would we do with it?"" It's an extremely relevant premise, considering we are currently living in the information age and the ease at which we are able to access information is growing exponentially."

As a long-time science fiction fan, I particularly enjoy idea-driven sci fi that crosses over into philosophy or psychology, and provides a different, unusual angle about important topics.<br/><br/>This movie does not only that, but it is also well acted, well written, fast paced, snappy international, intelligent and unpredictable. It certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie has the same appeal to me as Blade Runner or 2001 or Close Encounters. Yes, it's that good. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the cinematography, the music, the various freaky visual treats (eg the changing eyes, the cellular dissolution, the space images, the advanced computer, and much more.) This is a movie that showed me things I have not seen on film before. It enflamed my imagination.<br/><br/>Scarlett is amazing in this movie. Her fear at the start was almost difficult to watch. I was moved when she said goodbye to her mother so profoundly. Her anguish on the plane felt shockingly real. I'm not a Morgan Freeman fan (because I feel he is overexposed), but he was good in this one, too. I also loved the look in Waked's eyes as his hard-cop-who-has-seen-everything witnesses the impossible. Great acting.<br/><br/>The theme has been done before, but this take on it was new and well executed. Is the main premise scientifically accurate? No. Was the philosophizing over-the-top hogwash? Probably. But is it possible to suspend disbelief and go along with it? Yes. The movie has a certain profundity and WTF factor.<br/><br/>Am I right in thinking that both this movie and Gravity (another incredibly good recent picture) were not made in Hollywood? Or even America? <br/><br/>This movie is bursting with action, but it is so much better than the superhero action movies Hollywood keeps spitting out lately. This is the kind of movie I dream of seeing when I'm sitting through yet another tedious Batman or Captain America movie.<br/><br/>This movie attracts a proportionately high number of ""haters"", i.e. reviewers who downvote good reviews and write reviews rubbishing it. Not sure why this movie is attracting that kind of negativity. It might explain the ridiculous 6.6 score on IMDb currently.<br/><br/>This is my second attempt to post this review. The first review ended up being score-bombed by 15 negative voters in one day. Not sure how or why something like that happens. My review was on the first page and after that it ended up on page 15 or something. All this raises serious doubts in me about the accuracy of the IMDb scoring system.<br/><br/>Unusually, I find myself amongst the outlier group that strangely rates a movie 10 when everyone else is on the bell curve. OK, I suppose I can't give it a 10 because it does have a few minor issues. There are (spectacular) car chases and (too many) shoot outs. There is violence and a bit of gore too, but it wasn't graphic enough to make me queasy.<br/><br/>I think this film is going to be a cult classic. Movie world, please make more movies like this."

","If you're looking for a way how to kill 90 minutes of your otherwise boring day, than it's good entertainment. Unfortunately, the movie is just the trailer stretched to 90 minutes by adding some visual filler - Lucy's dull monologue of many words telling nothing memorable, characters that don't seem to know what their role is and a blend of many many short scenes from various documentaries. I wish there was at least a lot of brainless action, but there is really nothing to save it. The trailer is the biggest spoiler - it tells about 90% of the plot. If you haven't seen it, then it is around 5 star. There is some action, a pretty woman and it is not boring until the last few minutes... but not worth the time or money in my opinion."

","Spoiler Alert! Don't read on if you don't want to have any idea of what happens... if you don't care I'll give you my interpretation of this film. Lucy's friend Richard tells her to deliver a briefcase to a drug lord. The briefcase has a new drug which seems to make people smarter. Lucy and 3 others are forced to carry the drug in their bellies to be later removed when they reach Europe. Lucy is beat up and kicked in the tummy by one of her captors which ruptures the bag and she overdoses on this new drug via her tummy. Instead of dying she is now much smarter but only has a short time to live. As the hours go by during the day her brain unlocks regions that were not accessible before, when she reaches 100% no one knows what will happen, but she says she will no longer be alive as we know it. For some reason she allows the drug lord to live while she kills a lot of his crew and finds out where the other 3 people were delivering the drugs to because she needs the rest of the new drug. She gets the rest of the drug pouches and is now being tracked down by the drug lord. She reaches 100% and goes back in time, you see some indians, dinosaurs, stuff in space, then she goes back to the present, the drug lord shoots her while she is then turning herself into the ultimate gaming computer, he misses, he's shot dead by a french cop. She then turns herself into a new type of organic PC which then ejects a 2GB USB stick which is inconveniently long and holds every answer there is to every question that's ever been asked. So you've been given billions of years of life, now you know what to do with it. I'm not kidding, that's what the movie shows. Here's my version: she never made it out of the cell where they were holding her captive before her flight. Once the captor kicked her in the stomach, the bag broke and she OD'd. The rest of the movie was her drug trip, but in real life she was laying there, looking like a crack head wanting another hit, moving her hands as if the world was an IPhone, and then she died. The point of the movie: Kids, don't do drugs! I think Transcendence's version of how someone becomes so intelligent that they can control matter was better than this movie. It seems like they really didn't know what to do at the end. Since we can only use 10% of our brains how could we ever know or imagine what could be done with 100%? So they decided to add dinosaurs and space stuff for the oooh's and ahhh's."

","OK so let me just says this. Luc Besson can still do ""the action."" He does action ""good."" And the film was visually appealing, decent effects, etc. There are some cool things to see.<br/><br/>Despite that, the premise/plot is nonsensical in this particular way. She is being used as a drug mule for a new designer product. And yet this ultra powerful organization (with unlimited goons) never thought to actually test the drug.<br/><br/>The testing would have revealed a metahuman Holy Grail that can transform the average party girl into Dark Phoenix, Proteus, Neo, Galactus, Dr. Manhattan, Tetsuo, Gary Mitchell (Star Trek) or a freaking Vorlon. Just substitute your omnipotent being comparison, because there is no wrong answer. <br/><br/>And when the pseudo-Triad learns of her powers they decide to: A) Reproduce the drug for personal use and gain B) Sell the formula to the super powers? As in China, US, Russia, etc. C) Run like hell. or D) for dummies. Try to strong arm her to reclaim a drug they can reproduce.<br/><br/>Also: How did the French cop pull off international warrants without any credible leads. And why would these nations immediately extradite and turn over the drugs/mules? Why did the French cop team up with a freaking mutant that just knocked out his team like Chris Walken in The Prophecy then telekinetically float baddies like Carrie? That must have been one hell of a kiss.<br/><br/>The flight crew literally sees a woman nearly disintegrate and their solution is not to call TSA or its Euro equal. Forget about an emergency landing. No, instead bang on the door and asks, ""Miss are you OK?""<br/><br/>There is more, much, more, but suffice to say this is a turn your brain way off movie pretending to be deep. Go for the guns and ScarJo. Do not go expecting an actual story."
"jstall20","8","6","17","26 July 2014"," A few holes here and there, but a solid, interesting film!
","I went in expecting to like this film, and I walked out enjoying it a lot! Yes, the premise is a bit silly, and you do have to suspend disbelief. What this movie is, more than anything realistic, is very imaginative. In the Era of uber 'realism' and nolan esque 'everything has to make sense' and alternately the stupidity of Michael Bay, this move had a nice balance, and just had fun with it's insane premise. Scartlett Johannsen did a fantastic job with this movie. She really has a knack for Sci Fi, and she is a top notch talent. This movie was about the right length. If you go into this looking for an art house film, don't bother, it's not for your pretentious tastes. Get over yourself. There is probably about as much real science as there is pseudo science. That is to say it's partially grounded in reality. It's not like the movie makes any illusion about the fact that some of the stuff in it is simply made up. I will say that Luc Besson could be served by hiring a writing consultant. There are some scenes that were kinda lazily set up. It doesn't ruin the film, but it might take a step in the right direction in having his films taken a little more seriously. Also, there is the signature rocket launcher scene (every one of Besson's films has one). This was fun. Go see it!"
"excaliber99","4","6","17","26 July 2014"," Great concept. Too bad it wasn't developed very well
","The concept was very exciting,but a lack of science basis for most of the scenes made it boring and even ridiculous. When a movie is based on science, you better stay true to it. To list a few things I had problem with: 1. NO ONE DEFIES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS. Even Lucy. 2. Physical transformation cannot be possible at that rate. It would be very very slow. 3. Why were the Villains so bent on retrieving the drug? Any reason they have to have it at any cost? 4. She time traveled with the chair? 5. How can she produce all that black stuff? where does she get the mass from? 6. She compiles all her knowledge and hands out a twinkling USB at the end."

If you go into the movie expecting anything to actually make sense, you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>It is a bit of a shame, IMO. there are other technologies and macguffins that could be used to give Scarlett the same powers the discredited 10% of the brain thing.

"johnsmith73340","1","9","29","4 August 2014"," Learn from this movie
","University students will learn a lot from this movie, especially from Morgan Freeman's character. Specifically, they will learn that any ignorant fool can dress like a professor, talk like a professor and act like a professor. As long as he does these things he can sell his ideology to anyone, regardless of how irrational or unscientific it actually is.<br/><br/>This movie is not science fiction. It is not even science propaganda. It is science pornography. It is something that knows it is fictional but still has a serious philosophy behind it. Everyone knows that pornography is fake. Nevertheless, the people who make pornography really do want to create a culture of promiscuity. They really do believe that we would all be better off abandoning commitment and marriage, and embracing hedonism. Similarly, the people who made this movie know that it is fiction; but they really do believe that science will - one day - magically turn them into Gods.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect microcosm of all the irrational philosophies - all those little ""isms"" - that plague our society today: feminism, socialism, atheism, hedonism, capitalism, individualism and (worst of all) scientism: the illogical belief that science will solve every mystery and every problem that the human race has encountered up until this point.<br/><br/>Of course, the main character had to be a woman. Hollywood-Feminist- Dogma would never allow the main character (who eventually becomes a God) to be a man. It would never allow a scene where a man with god-like powers kisses a woman and says, ""You're nothing to me. I just need you for temporary enjoyment. You're my temporary girl toy."" But it is perfectly OK for a female character to do this.<br/><br/>Of course, Lucy finds out- by going back in time - that there is no God. The atheist dogmatists in Hollywood would never dare to contemplate the alternative. Lucy's increased intelligence could NEVER possibly lead her to the conclusion that there is a God. That's progressive heresy. The existence of God is impossible, since the people in Hollywood - uneducated fools that they are - have figured out everything!"
"josebut8","9","8","25","28 July 2014"," Scarlett In the Sky With the Kitchen Sink
","I went into this with the vaguest idea what it was about, having seen the TV ads etc. I thought it was going to be more of a Carrie White goes super-spy type deal and it sort of was. I went to see it primarily for Ms. Johansson. I love her. I think she is one of the most gifted artists currently ""on the scene"". She can sing, she can dance, she can do it all. Damn, didn't she win a Tony too? I've found every single one of her screen performances to be flawless. She makes me believe every character she plays whether that be a Long Island Princess or trained assassin who hangs with a Norse God. ""Lucy"" is no exception. She brings to this performance a depth that it probably doesn't need or deserve; but because she does, the movie is all the more gripping. That being said... This movie requires the suspension of the suspension of disbelief. It is quite frankly ludicrous in its ideas and asinine in its assumptions. It is some kind of ultra-camp. But the execution is sublime. Besson just pulls out the stops with his storyline and somehow miraculously manages to successfully graft a drug heist caper movie onto a sci-fi thriller. Once I just gave in to the movie's preposterousness I was riveted from start to finish. The film excited me in a way that is rare. You know, when you feel you're seeing something fresh when you've seen everything a million times already? I found Lucy to be this kind of experience. Camp, intentional or not, often takes the viewer full circle. From the ridiculous to the sublime and back again. I was also entranced by some of the imagery. One critic said this movie is sort of like ""The Tree of Life"" if it had been directed by Michael Bay (and I'll add Tarantino as producer) and this is an apt description. But in this case, that's a great thing. ""Lucy"" I think is the kind of thing you're either gonna love or hate. I loved it. If you're willing not to take Lucy too seriously...or seriously at all...the strange thing is you might actually find it thought provoking."

","Lucy can be picked apart if you wanted to do it. If...then...really? Why would the character do that? Does increased brain power allow someone to do that? The movie is built around the false premise that humans only utilize 10% of their brains.<br/><br/>So, don't try to pick the movie apart. Just sit back and enjoy it. Lucy is quickly paced; you won't be bored. Scarlett Johansson is vulnerable at the beginning and engages the viewer as being almost pitiful. She turns into a complete bad-ass as the movie progressives. You end up not pitying her character, just glad that your not standing between her and her goal. Johansson reaches the status of Terminator in this movie.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's voice and subject matter has you convinced that you're watching ""Through the Wormhole."" Min-Sik Choi makes a good villain, though uncharacteristically inept at times. Amr Waked plays an Interpol(?) cop who is the closest thing to a love interest this movie has for Lucy.<br/><br/>There is a good mix of black comedy in with the action and violence. A couple of times, the director made heavy-handed assurances through awkward dialog that Lucy's violence didn't cross a line, pointing out that someone had been shot in the leg and that people were asleep instead of dead. There are more elegant, less obvious ways of pointing out things. If the director wants a violent movie (and Lucy can't be non-violent), then own it.<br/><br/>Turn your brain knob to seven and enjoy this summer action flick. Have fun!"

","Doing movie about cerebral capacity usage without any logic, with heavy pseudo science - that's what Luc Besson (writer and director) did here. I can think only that he was high during whole time when made it. Too bad, because he really has gift for film making. Only good thing about this was pace, that's why I gave 2 stars. Actors: Morgan Freeman in another typical role of ""scientist"", throwing another pile of crap to audiences - like that cell will choose immortality in environment without life support :-). Indeed, movie would be much better without that whole pseudo science crap - but it tried to be serious - what is biggest flaw. Scarlett Johansson: probably best cast for this. Cool bitch most of time. Possible that some did not accept role after reading script. Overdone violence, without any sense in most cases: probably worst moment was killing of taxi driver just because he did not speak English. But that driving during Paris, causing death of minimum 20 people was also plain mindless. Couple words about superpowers: how can increasing cerebral capacity bring telekinetic, time travel and other things ? Author seriously lacks some elementary knowledge. But he likes blood on screen. No thanx, no Luc. We don't need such person, who kills brainlessly, lacks any empathy totally to be someone who shows us the new path. You are just lost, and sequel (what I just saw that is announced) can be only even bigger pile of nonsense."
"jerpete-1","3","4","10","10 April 2016"," Even if you suspend disbelief, it's still ridiculous
","The reviews here seem to fall into two camps: Those that point out the flaw of using the old 10-percent of your brain myth, saying this inanity makes the movie bad; and those that say never mind reality, this is sci-fi, so relax and enjoy the ride. The problem is that even if it were true that we only use a small amount of our brain capacity, the storyline here still wouldn't make sense. And it keeps piling more nonsense on top of nonsense. Science fiction comes in all flavors of realism, from ""hard"" science fiction that sticks to the technically possible, to what is really fantasy, like The Fifth Element, where science is really tossed out the window and the movie is just cool and fun. What doesn't work, and what makes Lucy not fun at all, is when a movie tries to present a scientificky undercurrent to the idea but then fails miserably at sticking to its rules. So, consider the following: Why would increasing your brain's abilities give you superhuman powers that extend to breaking the laws of physics? We have way more brainpower than, say, a clam, but we're no more capable than it of defying gravity (except by application of technology that obeys physics). Why would a woman with increased brainpower be so stupid as to leave her nemesis alive, pinned to his chair with knives, rather than just killing him? Why would your brain powers lead you to start disintegrating in an airplane bathroom (and by the way, whatever happened after that? We just see her wake up solid again in the hospital). The brain-capacity fallacy is not the only big science blunder in the film. Its concept of evolution would have Darwin spinning in his grave. Cells do not pass on information they have ""learned,"" they pass on information they have acquired by mutation and DNA recombination. The notion that cells in a ""safe environment"" survive by immortality is way out of left field. The bottom line is, the brain-capacity crap is simply used here as an excuse to give Scarlett Johannsen superpowers. The weak and questionable philosophical message (We can become gods if we apply ourselves? Hard to say)is buried beneath mindless violence and weird special effects."

It's just her character becomes so powerful that she becomes impossible to relate to and hard to empathise to. Morgan freeman is decent in the movie too even though he basically just plays the same thing as always. The villain in the film has nothing to him because he stands as no opposition to Lucy at all. The guy she hangs out with also has absolutely no depth to him and you won't care. The story has absolutely no depth to it at all and you won't care about any of the characters. The tension just isn't there because Lucy has absolutely no opposition in the film at all and no emotion. The script us either cliché dialogue or expositional scientific dialogue that you don't understand. There are some alright action scenes in the film but the style of this film is bold and ridiculous.

But the drugs she is carrying are no ordinary narcotics, they are CPH4, a synthetic based on a substance given to fetuses to help their prenatal development, and unfortunately, the bag tears and all that drug makes its way into her blood stream.<br/><br/>To explain what all this means, the film takes us to Professor Samuel Norman, played by Morgan Freeman. But he's taking us down the rabbit hole here rather than Through the Wormhole (a fascinating series hosted by Freeman), and explaining that the average human only uses between 10 and 15% of their brain, but they could get all types of wacky superpowers if they are able to use more, which Lucy presumably can or else would they cross to this guy?<br/><br/>Johansson slowly turns into a cross between Keanu Reeves from the Matrix, including his abilities to bend matter, shoot with pin point accuracy, see coding everywhere, and not display a discernible emotion; and Yoda from Revenge of the Sith, complete with wise sayings and the ability to knock a room full of bad guys unconscious with one flick of the hand. Johansson is looking for revenge on Mr Jang, (Chio Min Sik) the man who forced her to carry the drugs, with Drug Enforcement Officer Pierre del Rio (Amr Waked) by her side.<br/><br/>Besson has done a good job with the direction, with the film frequently showing cut scenes to appropriate situations with animals in the wild, cave men and transitional apes, which actually do go somewhere in the film's final act. The special effects are adequate and the action sequences, including gun fights, car chases and hand to hand combat, are well put together.<br/><br/>Johansson is solid in the lead role and puts across a believable detachment, Freeman is good as usual, while Amr Waked, probably the most important character in the film as he acts as a conduit for the audience, gives a well judged performance, though is let down a little bit by his character being under developed in the script.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who likes plausible science in movies, give this one a miss. However, if you can look past implausible science providing a film makes sense in its own reality, there is a lot to like here. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it is refreshing to see an action film featuring a female lead where her gender is not the focus. A pleasing return to form for Besson."

","A lot of people appears to have gotten into some hate-mode when watching this movie. I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like ""merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic"" in the blurb  well I got pretty much what I expected.<br/><br/>The movie starts off making you think it is a ""simple"" revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.<br/><br/>Lucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movie and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the ""mundane"". Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I'm in for the ride and it is a fun ride.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are OK although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that ""I am everywhere"" bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick?

She then uses more and more of her brain allowing her to have all these wonderful powers and knowledge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is about all that the movie is about and you get that from the trailer. In a way, the trailer is a damned lie, because after you see the premise of the film and some cool scenes, you are tempted to believe that is just a part and the rest of the film would be building on it. It is not. That's about all you get.<br/><br/>In fact the Korean mafia and the police and humanity in general become pretty much inconsequential after a while. Morgan Freeman's character appears in about 5 minutes of scenes, the violent murders, fights and car chases are there just as a distraction and Lucy herself, the apex of humanity, does nothing more than use the entire existence as a she would a cell phone, spout some existential things that make little sense and look pretty.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If Transcendence really posed some interesting questions about what people would do if granted limitless power, ending with a very philosophical free will choice kind of thing, Lucy is just eye-candy. The only interesting idea in it seems to be that the purpose of life is to share knowledge. Well, there is that, but also another: the elimination of knowledge we don't like. Yet that's another story altogether and probably more interesting than this film."

","If I understand this movie correctly it combines the movie Crank, Jean Grey from X-men, and La Camaleón from Machete Kills into one? With that being said there is nothing wrong with any of the characters or any of the actors in those films and portraying those parts, but this movie did a good job of combining those characters together into one badass female character.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson showed me in this movie that she can play a lead role in a movie very well and should be given this opportunity more often.<br/><br/>Lucy has powers the normal mind cannot fathom, but this is what I wanted from the movie. I don't want it dumbed down just because it is a movie I wanted to see how she sees therefore getting the real story of Lucy. Lucy is at war with this Asian gang of drug-dealers whom apparently are not afraid of catching any blood-born illnesses. She is able to use 100% of her brain power as opposed to the normal humans 15%. Lucy can read minds, change her appearance, move things with her mind, read extremely fast, change her cell structure, time travel and much more.<br/><br/>The funny part I found in the movie was Lucy is able to learn and become extremely smart, but she cannot walk in high heels. It's also hard for me to read the critic reviews and actually think that they really watched the movie. The part where Lucy reads the scientist mind and finds his daughter was in a car crash she was obviously not just reading his mind to convince him of her power she was doing something to him to convince him as well. Just like the part where Lucy kisses Pierre Del Rio for no apparent reason to the viewer. She was using her power to convince him of something. She put something into his brain. This is the director playing a trick on the viewers making them not believe something just because the didn't see it. If you watched the movie you would know what she is capable of and it should be really easy to comprehend what is going on in the movie. There are somethings that are spelled out for the viewers and some that are not. I don't expect a movie to explain everything nor do I like a film that does. There has to be something left open for the imagination and Luc Besson did a wonderful job doing just that. I thought the ending was perfect considering all she learned and what she saw."

","(67%) A spectacularly entertaining sensation with doses of ""Limitless"", ""Under the skin"", ""X-men"" and ""Transcendence"", just to name a few. Johnansson is utterly terrific throughout, and this really does prove that she is more than capable in a leading role in an action movie. While Besson has saved one of his more interesting scripts for himself to direct, and he does a wonderful job with a plot and structure style that could have gone badly wrong. At 90 mins the movie is surprisingly satisfying because the pacing is sublime, and from the very start this is efficiently thrilling. There are a few minor niggles here and there that mostly come from its own high ambitions that it sets itself, but overall this is a summer hit to remember."

","""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale.""<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Luc Besson's work so I was expecting great things from Lucy considering I had read several positive reviews, but personally I was disappointed. And I'm not trashing this film simply because the assumption that humans only use 10% of their brain is erroneous; that wasn't an issue I had here. I just found it hard to engage with the character of Lucy, the philosophical themes explored here were silly, and the entire premise simply bored me. There were some similarities between this film and Johnny Depp's Transcendence where despite some solid visual styles the philosophical themes hurt the overall narrative. Scarlett Johansson delivers another solid performance, but her character really didn't work for me as well as former Besson leading ladies such as Milla Jovovich in The Fifth Element and Natalie Portman in Leon. Perhaps it was all the philosophical and scientific mumbling that ended up hurting the narrative story for me. However I do have to give Besson credit for trying something different and taking risks because the film goes to unexpected places at times. I do feel that comparisons with 2001 are unfair. Some of the CGI didn't really work for me either, especially the one with the Neanderthal during the opening scene. Besson also experimented with the use of imagery that seemed to be taken from a National Geographic channel which overlapped with the narrative serving as an analogy, but those scenes felt forced and they also took me out of the film. This sci-fi film might have taken several steps to stand out from other formulaic movies by not following the standard structure of a genre film, but the result didn't really pay off. I felt as if Lucy was trying to be this sort of profound philosophical film, but it turned out to be fairly silly and incomprehensible. Perhaps it may be that I use less than 10% of my brain and therefor just didn't get it, but for my limited brain capacity Lucy wasn't worth my time or money. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson has taken several risks in the past year delivering some very solid roles in films like Her, Under the Skin, and now Lucy. The risks seem to have payed off considering she is catching the attention of talented directors and I'm glad she isn't going for the easy roles in rom-coms or standard action flicks. Despite enjoying her performance, this film lost me halfway through it. I enjoyed the supporting cast as well. It was great to see Choi Min-sik (better known for his role in Oldboy) play the villain here although I wish he would have been given more screen time. Perhaps my favorite performance was that of Amr Waked who played the officer helping Lucy (or should I say simply riding along with her?). Besson switched the genre roles here as usually it is the other way around, where the male character is the one doing all the work and the female only riding along. Morgan Freeman might just be the weakest link in this film as he is the one responsible for all the scientific and philosophical blabbing going on (my least favorite thing about Lucy). For a film that tries to take itself seriously with profound themes about wasted human potential, there are way too many flaws involved. I understand that most of these flaws were needed as an excuse to introduce some of the action scenes which this film would have suffered without. There are some fun scenes like a car chase across Paris, but there isn't much more to this wacky film. For all the scientific rambling there is very little substance to Lucy despite its ambitions."

","I liked this film more then I expected I would. First Scarlet Johansson  is fantastic, she always was in every film I watched, I remember her  role in a girl with a pearl earring, and other films, she was so  outstanding. Here she shines two.   Acting a doctor fits so well Morgan Freeman, in those roles he is Mr.  Number One. I guess he will be remembered for these types of roles in  the history of film making.  Plot is very interesting and general audience have to use 1 per cent of  their brain capacity (usually they do not use any) to understand what  is going on.   All in all a very entertaining and enjoyable film. I recommend it!"
"pandatiger","7","4","10","6 September 2014"," Great concept, great ideas, however not a great execution
","Really great concept, great acting. Does make you question life and does make you think a lot and reflect, almost the way movies like Fight Club do. I do understand that we don't know how humans would behave if humans use 100% of their cerebral capacities, hence the movie chose to portray the human behavior at that state as supernatural, which is an exaggeration perhaps purposely, as to prove and emphasise the message of the movie. This is a great idea, I understand it, however I'm not too sure why I did not feel as captivated as I should have been. Maybe they went a little too far with the unrealistic aspects of Lucy's behavior. Maybe using an average Joe instead of Scarlett Johansson, as Scarlett is definitely not an average specimen, would have set the mood for a more realistic approach. Whatever it is though, I do admire the fascinating concept and the story's morals. Hence I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10 - gotta give them some credit for coming up with something philosophical unlike a lot other pieces of meaningless stuff out in the cinemas today."

It was a movie meant to entertain - which it did with a fast-paced action plot and a GREAT female lead (I LOVE Scarlett Johansson!)But the main philosophical idea was one that I think about all the time so it really hit home for me. Definitely a lot of Dr. Manhattan from ""Watchmen"" vibes. I feel like a lot of people don't really think about their existence or purpose in life anymore and just go through the motions - working, making money, etc. Well this movie makes you think and I liked that."

The story line is a good idea...but it failed when it came time to produce the product.<br/><br/>I was struck with the fact that folks were pretty much disappointed with the movie, and some even recommended to the people in the outside line to save their time and money.

The rest of us, who expect at least a minimal sign of science or even logic in a so-called science fiction movie, Lucy is a disappointment, ridiculous and a complete waste of time."
"FilmMuscle","6","10","35","30 July 2014"," Tries To Be Smart but Embarrassingly Fails
","Scarlett Johansson has been on quite the roll as an action star as of late, bouncing back and forth between her more expensive (Marvel) projects and more peculiar and experimental ones. Though Lucy might appear to be the former—a clichéd, loud extravaganza of mindless, fun action—from the trailers and the like, the truth is that it (somewhat) belongs to the category of the latter. A Taiwanese mob implants a mysterious drug called CPH4 into her stomach, and very soon, she discovers that access to her cerebral capacity has surpassed that of the normal human being. Apparently, that means that she can now wield ridiculous superpowers that allow her to tap into people's memories and extract any bit of information from whatever object/individual that existed within. It also means that she can levitate anything and anyone, as well as teleport to any location she so wishes. <br/><br/>Right from the get-go, you'll have to get used to the fact that the premise is incredibly unbelievable; the plot will get even more outlandish as it progresses, and don't worry: the movie will warn you with a continually increasing percentage (indicating just how much of the brain she can now utilize) every time events are about to become even more preposterously implausible. Once you get past the utter lack of realism and plethora of plot holes, what you experience is pretty badass. It's heavily stylized with its sci-fi components—it honestly reminded me of something like The Matrix, especially when considering the more twisted acts of violence. Complemented by beautiful cinematography (lavished with appealing colors and futuristic characteristics), this film is a blast—a lightning pace and intriguing set-up. <br/><br/>Everything, aside from the ending, offers an abundance of thrilling amusement, and part of it obviously is due to Johansson's fierce presence. Even though Marvel Studios' rendition of Black Widow is softer and more forgiving, Lucy can be ruthless and calculating just like the original Marvel comics portrayed the Russian spy, Black Widow, as. However, eventually, the narrative takes a turn for the insane as convolution and far-fetched absurdity floods the plot and the sheer power Lucy truly holds furthers into the realm of sheer impossibility. The focus on high-octane, compulsive action is therefore abandoned and substituted with a confusing climax that only makes you wonder about what the hell this film which started out with a gripping basis has transformed into. <br/><br/>So yes, the tale's unraveling heightens in ludicrousness, but at least, it's entertaining and cool. On the other hand, when it comes to the film's attempt to assess the themes and depth to which the idea of an increase in cerebral capacity goes, the arguable failure of this project certainly arises. First of all, this story is centered around a myth (humans only use 10% of their brains) that's already been debunked by guffawing scientists, creating irritation in the viewer as they continue to roll their eyes at the filmmakers' ignorance and clear unwillingness to properly research the subject. Secondly, as I've pointed out, this increase in intelligence—the ability to use more of your mind—does not mean that you'll suddenly turn into some terribly powerful superhero. <br/><br/>If Besson didn't concentrate on producing a Limitless rip-off and simply decided to produce an absorbing sci-fi action film instead, Lucy wouldn't have been as annoying of a film, but if we're incorporating serious topics that beg the audience to recognize intellect in the project, don't expect to hold that compelled audience when you begin betraying realism and truth (of the topic). At the end of the day, Lucy is mostly fun, but it's ironically stupid fun as much as it tries to be smart fun."

It tries to makes a serious statement, but is filled with completely dumb, illogical and unnatural scenes in the movie.

Min-sik Choi from Oldboy plays an awesome antagonist although he was a little under used in the movie. Morgan Freeman pops up conveniently through out the movie to explain the complicated functions of the brain. The film does pose a pretty ancient philosophical question.

","This isn't a film which bears close scrutiny. It appears to have been developed from the mashing together of a few factoids, without any deeper understanding or research.<br/><br/>i, The three million year old skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis named ""Lucy"" evidences the progression of skull size and brainpower in our species' development.<br/><br/>ii, Lucy was named for a song which many believe is about drugs.<br/><br/>iii, The odd idea that seems to have taken hold that we only use 10% of our brain.<br/><br/>Add in a superhero element, some strands of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Christian deity themes of omniscience, omnipresence, and Michaelangelo's Creation of Adam, obligatory violence and a car chase.<br/><br/>As a thesis, it fails utterly. As a distraction, it was enough to keep me watching to the end; a ridiculous end, at that, where Lucy turns herself into graphite powder and a suspiciously long USB stick (as if that's what humans are fashioned from).<br/><br/>There's the usual Hollywood fare of casting an English-accented male as a baddie, zero concern for incidentals who die as a result of the plot, a deep confusion between intelligence and memory, and a professor whose gibberish is eaten up by other academics because he talks slowly and appears to be amusing himself in his own mind with hyper intelligent asides (even though he actually seems to be thinking about some cat videos he saw on YouTube).<br/><br/>There's enough in the film for reviewers to hang a theory on but it's all so incoherent. People will always try to connect dots that really aren't connected; it's human nature. If I made a film about Fred Flintstone, a tortoise, some spam, and Donald Trump's elbow, someone would make a connection. Admit it - you want to.<br/><br/>All that said, the car chase was rather spiffy, and I liked the font used to display what percentage of her brain Lucy was using. The rest was risible.

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","7","8 April 2015"," This movie felt like it was using less than 10% of their brain capacity. It wasn't smart, yet it was outrageous fun to watch
","While, the movie did entertain me: I found the premise to be really dumb. I can't believe that certain people still believe in the myth, that human beings only use 10% of their brains. Everybody should had known by now, that the ten percent myth likely arose from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of how the brain works. If neurological research have taught us, anything, if we did use only 10% of our brains, we will, clearly be dead or in a vegetable state. It's clear, that the other 90% is there, to keep us alive. While the film's very premise is indeed very fallacy, this film wasn't such a headache for me. In my opinion, it was more entertaining to watch, than 2011's Limitless that had a similar concept. While, movies like Limitless kept the increase intelligent genre, somewhat grounded. This movie delivered it, way over the top. Directed by Luc Besson, Lucy tells the story of Lucy Miller (Scarlet Johansson) a young American studying in Taiwan who gets kidnapped by gangsters and force to be a drug mule for them. They surgically implant a parcel of super-drugs inside her, but after the package bursts, Lucy's brain capacity increases at a feverish rate, endowing her with mental and physical abilities far beyond those of mere mortals. Can the mob stop her or will Lucy become a Goddess that nobody can stop? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that the whole god-like capable to be pretty cool. The only problem with that, is that nobody in the film seem like a serious threat to her. If only one of the villains was smart or suicidal enough, to take the drug CPH4, the same way, as Lucy, maybe we would have somewhat of an interesting really cool movie. I really hate that, this MacGuffin is rarely used, by other characters. Scarlet Johansson is alright in the role. It's clear, by now, that she's one of the coolest & newest leading ladies in action films. I just wish, they didn't give her, such silly lines at times. A good example is Lucy's phone call to her mom. It's supposed to feel heartfelt and even a bit wrenching, but it comes across as goofy, and a bit disturbing. Honestly, who says, I can still taste your milk to their mom!? For somebody, who's supposed to be smart; she says some of the dumbest things. After Lucy gets the drug in her system, she expresses little to no emotion for the remainder of the film, only speaking in exposition. It's alright to show that the character is becoming less human, but don't make it too dull and unlikeable. Not only that, she also does a few illogically things that make you, wish it was better written. A good example is her reckless driving through Parisian streets. Honestly, if she was that powerful, wouldn't she just make her, car fly over the traffic? It doesn't make any sense for her to waste time, here. Another thing, I didn't like the movie is the misused of Morgan Freeman. He wasn't really needed, when you think about it. I didn't like that he had to be there to repeat the same exposition or give us, information that wasn't needed. This movie treats its audience as if they're idiots. The movie tries really hard to seem smart, by copying 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but unlike Stanley Kubrick, Luc Besson delivers it's symbolism in such a clumsy way. Honestly, is all the natural stock footage, really needed to prove a point? Did we really need to see laughable footage of animals having sex with each other? Did we need to see a clip of mouse trap to get that Lucy is about to walk into a trap!? Come on, movie. Be a little clever with it! Despite that, some of the stock footage was somewhat, beautiful to watch. I love how he shot his wide frame with colorful cityscapes. The movie also have some sweet action set-pieces with some good CGI effects. The violence gets fairly graphic, with lots of shoot outs and blood splattering everywhere. So heads up on that. It somewhat reminds me of 2010's Inception in some scenes. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen almost all the action sequences in the film. Overall: I have always been a fan of higher intelligent Sci-fiction movie since seeing 1968's Charly & 1996's Phenomenon in a young age, and this movie kinda works in the same way. It's a fun movie that you might have to suspension your disbelief to find, watchable. Mediocre movie with a very undeveloped story."

They did the same plot better. Have you seen The Avengers? Better use of Scarlett Johansson. Even The Lawnmower Man has the advantage of not being so pretentious over this film.<br/><br/>The script is probably my biggest complaint- nothing is natural. Every line is ""on-the-nose,"" and clearly just there to move the story forward, without giving us any reason to care about the characters or to believe what's happening is real. Who is Lucy? We never really know, she's been instructed to act like a robot the whole movie. There's one scene where she talks about her past, but it's so unnatural and sudden that I couldn't care about it. The supporting characters also have terrible lines...Why are they after Lucy? It doesn't even matter, they're only in the movie to give Lucy and excuse to fight them. <br/><br/>The editing and ""symbolism"" of the movie is also amateurish. There is no subtlety in this film- everything hits you on top of the head with a lead mallet. For example, the film starts off by juxtaposing images of animals with people...which was a little cheesy but I was willing to forgive it if the film kept up the motif. Nope. Just some random images of animals in the first 10 minutes and then never again. Why even bother? It's like the film is trying to impress some ""film school"" teacher. Random shots and juxtapositions happen for no other reason than ""because it makes the film look smart."" It's not, though- it's just obvious and cheesy. <br/><br/>There were also no clever ideas or insights to the human condition here...just clichéd messages about life that you can get from any 9th grade biology book. <br/><br/>OK, so before you say I'm taking it too seriously, and this is just supposed to be a popcorn action flick, I will admit some of the action scenes are awesome. However, they're the same scenes we saw in the trailer, or we've simply seen them done before in other films, but better.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this film, at least not in the theater. Rent it or stream it or whatever, but this isn't a film to pay good money for. There are much better films out there about the same idea."

We see that everything we need is really all in our head already. We see that reality is much simpler than we thought it was."

","Well after 10 minutes I could see that this was going to be a really stupid film, and boy was I right. The plot was just terrible and just about all the characters did stupid things that beggared belief, which in turn made me not care one iota about any of them. There is a quite a lot of action in the film, but the majority of it was quite frankly pointless and you were constantly left asking yourself why did they do that, or who the hell would do that. You really have to ask why the so called A-list actors would read a script like this and say ""sign me up for that"", of course only one reason, money, and my god they must have being payed a lot to put there name to this film. The only decent thing about the film was the CGI, which was quite good, but again it was not really placed that well in the movie, in fact it made the movie even more confusing if anything. If you want to watch this film, then wait for it to come on TV is my advice."

The story was so convoluted you forgot about the drug and what it could do.

"Blonde2291","3","5","15","3 August 2014"," Weak story, wooden acting
","It is a common misconception that just by taking big Hollywood stars in your movie, you will end up with a great movie even if you use a weak storyline. This movie, LUCY, is a fine example of this delusion.<br/><br/>Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) accidentally consumes a large quantity of an unknown drug which initiates a sequence of ever increasing brain usage - 10%, 20%, 30% and so on until she starts using 100% of her brain capacity. At every stage, she acquires special abilities - telekinetic powers, ability to control telecommunication networks, transform her body at her will and so on. Viewers may feel at a loss to see that even with such superpowers, she cannot manufacture the drug that initiated this whole thing.<br/><br/>Every now and then, Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) appears on the screen explaining what increased brain capacity can do for humans. In addition, for the benefit of movie viewers, Lucy herself seems to drop unwarranted information about what is happening to her to different people she comes across and who look at her completely clueless. It is not clear why these people would be interested in her brain capacity.<br/><br/>While Morgan Freeman has done his usual good acting in the little chance he was given, Scartlett Johansson has given a slightly wooden performance specially when she talks about the abilities of her increasing brain capacity.<br/><br/>With a very weak storyline, poor direction and at times wooden acting, LUCY is strictly for the hardcore fans of Scarlett Johansson."
"johnjaydrumline","3","5","15","31 July 2014"," Are you kidding me?
","I just finished reading a review from a person who praised this movie and claimed Inception (Christopher Nolan) was predictable. I tell you, that's probably the funniest thing I've ever read. <br/><br/>Lucy, a movie written and directed by Luc Besson, fails to offer any surprises or shocks. Everything that was meant to ""wow"" the audience was put in the trailer. And for the small bit that wasn't in the trailer was incredibly predictable and unoriginal. <br/><br/>The script itself swayed back and forth from intelligent to stupid constantly through out the movie. Now, I'm looking past the fact that this movie is based on a fallacy and I believe everybody else should too. I mean come on, you don't go into transformers thinking that could ever happen. You must be willing to suspend your disbelief every single time you enter the theater. But even so, this script lacked any kind of emotional pull or original violence. <br/><br/>I'll admit that this movie started off strong, and it had my attention. But soon after, it lost me completely. The direction swayed from it's potentially good course, and went the typical Hollywood root. That disappointed me greatly. <br/><br/>Last thing, is the ending. I didn't know what the hell that ending even implied. It was so unsatisfying and awful that I awkwardly stared at my spouse when the credits started rolling as if to say ""what the hell did we just watch"". Now, I've never written a review on here, but for this movie I had to. I really did. So if you're honestly going to compare Lucy to any movie, don't compare it to a movie as complex and original as Inception. That's just ignorant."
"monkeyboxer15","5","5","15","30 July 2014"," Fun to watch if you don't listen to anything and like stock footage
","The film follows Lucy as she gets super powers, kicks butt, and tries to find existential meaning as she unlocks her brain's potential. This sounds fun but the writing was truly terrible. The production value was good aside from the lazy stock footage. The majority of the acting was solid. <br/><br/>The huge issue that ruins this movie stems from writer's steadfast determination to hate google. The majority of the plot is based around super outdated, never actually true info on the human brain. The sad part is the writer could have literally pulled out a smartphone (or the browser on the computer used to type the script) and searched the lines that were written and found out the lines didn't make any sense. <br/><br/>Freeman plays a doctor that tries to convince his peers that humans only use 10% of their brain's capacity and you basically become a god if you unlock more. Listening to his monologue I imagined how silly he must have felt. I'm sure he knew, or at least found out, that the lines were silly and based on nothing. Then this info ended up being the plot for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>If you can get past the whole premise being a lazy shot in the dark, you'll be joined by the most determined drug lord ever. The bad guy for this movie takes part in smuggling drugs if you don't know what a drug lord is up to these days. Spoilers coming: He's using people as drug mules and this ends up going bad because Lucy get's god powers from the drugs. Instead of cutting his losses and buying more drugs that he obviously had access to, he goes to hunt down Lucy himself (along with his cronies). This parts almost believable, but when he starts chasing her around the world and losing men it stops making sense. This guy wouldn't get to be a drug kingpin if he's this terrible at resource management and so silly he's going to attack a superwoman by himself.<br/><br/>If that's not good enough you will get some very generic wildlife stock footage to denote feeding, hunting, and mating and their current relations to the actual scene at hand. I'm fairly confident this was meant as imagery to make the audience 'feel' something, but it was so blatantly sludged in that it felt lazy. <br/><br/>Once you're done digesting the script you will get to enjoy some interesting fight scenes. The special affects and the 'kick-butt' scenes come together well and Scarlett pulls off a convincing god-like being struggling with such traumatic changes to... well... everything. <br/><br/>Overall, plug your ears and enjoy some clever shots of Scarlett being a superhuman."
"kgprophet","5","5","15","27 July 2014"," Luc Besson's Best Visionary Scarlett Johansson
","Some people are hailing this as Luc Besson's best piece of Science Fiction work since ""The Fifth Element"" Scarlett Johansson. A mythology, similar to Neo in the Matrix, revolves around the idea Scarlett Johansson. The wrinkle in this film is the blue pill allows you to see the code behind the 3 dimensional Scarlett Johansson. But for only 24 hours. Morgan Freeman, who appears in every film released, plays a smart guy who knows exactly how the ability to Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>The film starts in a very gritty scenario that resembles his first Hollywood style film, ""La Femme Nikita"". Scarlett Johansson, who you think could be Marilyn Monroe's kid, gets in trouble with dangerous drug dealers. There are shocking moments of terror and violence that Besson has a flair for, and doesn't disappoint here. Feeling a sense of educating the audience as if a National Geographic documentary was directed by Micheal Bay, the frenetic editing wants desperately to make us connect with something deeper. But ultimately the story seems just interested in giving us a series of flashy sequences that feature Scarlett Johansson. Anytime Scarlett Johansson leaves the screen, even Morgan Freeman can't save the vacant space where a more coherent story should be.<br/><br/>It kind of reminded me of the last ""Jack Ryan"" film. The filmmakers have a checklist of requirements for a run-of-the-mill action thriller. Car Chase - check. Fight scene on the walls - check. Slowing down time - check. The audience reaction to the imagery-filled climax was that this supposed deeper imagery came out of nowhere, and didn't really fit what looks and feels like a Scarlett Johansson vehicle.<br/><br/>But I really like Scarlett Johansson. I like watching her on the big screen. The material certainly has potential. But so did Lawnmower Man and Virtuosity and Johnny Mnemonic, etc. The material outside Scarlett Johansson is so weak in it's structure, the slightest puff of wind would cause it to collapse. Does the movie play self-aware and wink at the audience with a ""we know this is silly but just go along with it""? Not if it thinks it can take itself seriously with the animal documentary footage. So, no, not meant to be silly. Did I enjoy myself? Sure OK, this was a flashy but digestible action thriller. But if I had the choice, I would save the money and checkout Scarlett Johansson on DVD or streaming. But you may notice I have mentioned Scarlett Johansson twelve times now. So for some people that is enough to see this movie."

","Freemans speech as a professor begins with the words ""Live starts approximately a billion years ago"". Well, if you look up the Wikipedia, it says right away, live began about 4 billion years ago. So its quite obvious that this film is not a documentary nor a lesson. All the science in this science fiction/fantasy film is clearly and purposefully inexact/incorrect. The science in this film is not meant to educate you but to inspire as you learn it. The movie wants to ignite your imagination and it does an excellent job at it, if you give it the permission to do so. What matters is the crazy adventure, Lucy lives through, as she discovers the world in an understanding but unimaginable perplexing way. She comes from a violent society, grew her new self in little time as a hostage of the Chinese mafia, so in the process of learning frightening facts and mastering a yet unknown task while escaping, she still acts instinctively violent and desperate as she realizes the little time she has to make the best of an experience, she would never have dreamt to undergo just minutes/hours ago.<br/><br/>The story line is completely logical and - more importantly - analogical as it progresses and you find yourself connecting and discovering with jar dropping, dot-connecting Lucy. She has no idea what knowledge she finds next as you do not, following her despite ultrafast learning quite slow enlightenment and stepping into a new and unexpected world of information and the power that comes with its logic and use. Remember: Its the logic inside the films reality, not the logic of our real world. It would be utterly boring if the story dissolved into the disdainful reality we live in every day. We could not discover a completely new world through Lucys eyes. So the fantasy of this movie is not its weakness but its fundamental instrument to let us relive our childhood discovering the unknown world around us and our role in it. This films laws of nature and its science quite similar to ours are meant figuratively, not literally.<br/><br/>Johansson delivers a compelling and solid performance in every way as nearly all actors do in this movie. Special effects are outstanding. Music and sounds are great. Picture is colorful, fast and mind boggling. Cinematography is perfect. The humor is mostly subtle. The story is unpredictable and fascinating. One of the most misunderstood films these days. This motion picture does not teach you scientific fact but lets you watch and study yourself as you learn about and find out how to not only populate but begin to control a new and unknown world as you identify with ascertaining Lucy."

Yes, they could have done a lot more with it, but at least it stayed just barely within the confines of possibility.<br/><br/>Lucy, however, isn't science-fiction, it's pure fantasy. It's Harry Potter Goes Sexy Guns.<br/><br/>But I still kinda enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The 'science' in this thing is pure bunkum, so please don't go in expecting your brain to be massaged - I groaned all the way through it. Unfortunately I can't go into details without spoiling, but basically it's all wrong: incorrect, unfactual, mixed-with-pseudoscience, wrong.<br/><br/>In some ways, it's a shame this tripe-fest got foisted on poor Scarlett - she is an underrated, actually very good actor, and this plot and its details were well beneath her abilities.<br/><br/>But, as a ride, Lucy is quite enjoyable. It has no message, and no internal consistency, and it's based on a load of gobbledegook, but heck... at least it's not boring.<br/><br/>The action is very actiony - the start, especially, is very gripping. (Though there are 'art' cut scenes in a very heavy-handed attempt at metaphor - oh my god, they just have to be ignored.) It promises you that it's going to be some kind of deep, techno-thriller... then it goes somewhere, er, 'else'.<br/><br/>The CG is quite amazing, and for once it serves its purpose instead of boring you to into headache-dodging sleep like the (yawn) Matrix sequels.<br/><br/>Grab the beer and the pizza and a bunch of friends, put it up on the big plasma, and turn your brain OFF - use 0% of it.<br/><br/>Cheers! <br/><br/>- <br/><br/>-- <br/><br/>---"

If you can just turn off that keen eye for detail and just soak in the ambiance of the movie, you will find a rather interesting premise.

","I must admit I did not know who made this film as I began to watch but within a few minutes I flashed on Luc Besson. His signature and range reverberate strongly. Elements of The Messenger, Danny the Dog and integrated mix of his work resonates through Lucy which is a needed break from the Transporter series. Scarlet is rather excellent in this role and delivers her talent balanced on the precipice of Luc's direction. However the writing and delivery of the interaction with voice only Laura D'Arista as Lucy's mother was rich in expression and an artistic reach for Besson that appealed on a deeper emotional level. With the all the mental and intellectual gobbledygook the only real expressions of emotion is the aforementioned scene and a simple luscious lipped kiss. Lucy reveals Besson's ultimate woman who has been emerging since Le Femme through the 5th Element and Colombiana. Enjoying this film requires a stretch in several places but for me the level of disbelief is not entirely broken even in the rather unexplained parts such as scintillating to dust and the unexplained reassembly which is the least I could think of all the disconnects. I hope Luc Besson continues to explore these strong leads, sci-fi and strong, smart female characters."

","I liked the sci-fi aspects of this story but thought it got a little too 'matrixy' toward the end, especially with the flash backward through time that Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) experiences in the latter part of the film. I can understand why a lot of folks consider the ten percent myth to be factual; when I was a kid in grade school over a half century ago, I recall teachers telling us the same thing. Only back then the number was just five percent. I guess inflation has brought the fallacy up a notch.<br/><br/>Actually if you think about it, some of the ten percent business has merit if one considers that you can continually learn more and more throughout a lifetime by reading and studying, thereby accumulating a lot more knowledge than you started out with. So in one's youth then, the limitation is strictly based on the amount of time one has been around. That's why I thought the introduction of the time element - 'Time is the only unit of measure' - was a compelling one.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, some of it's logic falls apart at the finale as far as that gun battle between the authorities and the Korean gangsters. It was already established that Lucy could control the behavior of others in earlier scenes, so there was no need for all that carnage except to satisfy the gore and violence fans. And if she could defy gravity during the initial hit of CPH4 in her system, why remain grounded for the rest of the story?"

The level slowly increases throughout the film, with Lucy getting more hardcore as it goes on. I was a bit unsure of what Lucy was trying to do, but it seemed first trying to collect the rest of the drug from the other smugglers,then find Morgan Freeman. She doesn't seem to care who she hurts on the way, happily causing unnecessary car accidents, hurting people in the way. Oh whilst gaining brain capacity, Lucy's human emotions (e.g empathy!) reduces (which didn't make sense to me!). <br/><br/>I have seen some negative reviews because it isn't scientifically accurate. When watching you need to remember it's not a documentary, its fiction. There are bits that are hard to believe, but I think if you watch this knowing it isn't true and maybe a bit ridiculous, you will enjoy it. <br/><br/>Yes, it is a bit unrealistic and not all the acting is up to scratch (I liked Scarlett Johansson's Lucy though), but I found it fun and easy to watch with a nice bit of action thrown in there."

I do enjoy movies with character development and this movie doesn't have much of that, but given what is happening with the main character, she's not left with much personality. I think that it would be easy to approach this movie with expectations that might not be met; if you take that approach,you may not find what you were looking for with this one. Besides, it has Morgan Freeman and sometimes that's just enough."

What this movie does well, it's starts a conversation about it for everyone who hasn't heard (enough) about it yet.<br/><br/>
My first impression was that 'Lucy' is going to be a really bad movie, just existing so that Scarlett gets to be a Superhero as well, since in the Marvel movies she has no superpowers. But 'Lucy' is actually way more than that.<br/><br/>
Especially the ending was interesting and even if the 10% statement is wrong, the movie could even work if they didn't involve the percentages. In it's state, it is a well portrayed adventure we get taken on and makes you question some aspects of life and your own potential and it's always great when a movie achieves something like this.<br/><br/>

","7 February 2015. Lucy is science fiction based on the reflective speculation of what if a person could access 100% of their brain. Lucy refers to one of the earliest humanoids, who happened to be female, and also the name of the female star, played be Scarlett Johansson. She happens to befall a strange drug smuggling ring becoming the first person to begin to ""revolutionize,"" a term introduced by Morgan Freeman's character. In the process, Luc Besson has developed an sci-fi action thriller evolving mind, space, and time. The pacing is energized and the mental evolutionary conception of Besson is consistently brought to the screen. This is a rare movie in that upon repeated viewings, the power and consistent developing emotive and mental presentation brought to the screen by Besson and Scarlett is impressive.<br/><br/>Thus action scenes sometimes become overly dramatic and fake looking, for the sample the car chase scene, even the initial transformation of Lucy is a bit over the top. Overall it seems that Besson;s attempt developing this progressively leaping mental concept that is satisfactorily captured on film. The Outer Limits' Five Fingers episode (1963) accomplished the same speculative venture in its television spot while Christopher Nolan accomplished a much more creative and meaningful spectacularly looking backdrop in his Interstellar (2014). Overall, Lucy is entertaining speculation that's fun to watch, with decent intensity and thrilling action that's worth to experience. Scarlett Johansson underplayed performance really stood out. Nicely done.<br/><br/>Other classic movies that Lucy follows in the footsteps of Brain Storm (1983), Charly (1968), The Time Machine (1960), Time After Time (1979), and of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and its contemporary, The Machine (2013)."

","Theory of Evolution Charles Darwin twitched his contemporaries with so-called ""compelling"" evidence in his 1859 book ""On the Origin of Species"", presenting counter defense for his theory of evolution. Core of his theory was based on concept of ""Natural Selection"" according to which ""species act to preserve and accumulate minor advantages in result of genetic mutations. Suppose if a member of a species developed a peculiar functional advantage such as wings and learns to fly, its offspring would inherit same advantage and pass it on through process of reproduction. In simple words, natural selection is the preservation of a functional advantage that enables a species to compete better in wild and seemingly inferior and disadvantaged members of the same species would gradually die out.""<br/><br/>Director Before dissecting new sci-fi thriller ""Lucy"" it was necessary to give readers a small bite of theory of evolution which has been inspiring Hollywood directors throughout cinematic history. Director of ""Lucy"" Luc Besson is no different. Luc Besson is the same French director who touched the fame in Hollywood tinsel town with Bruce Willis starer ""The Fifth Element"" in 1997. He has its expertise in telling sci-fi stories but with ""Lucy"" he has gone nose deep explaining Darwin's ""theory of evolution"" with high octane car chase sequences on streets of Paris and same time predicting about possibilities if someone, by chance, gets capability of using 100% of his or her cerebellum capacity. Using 100% of brain capacity does not seem an idea which has never been exploited by Hollywood. Fans of sci-fi adventure movies have already seen similar idea in Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro starer fabulous movie ""Limitless"" in 2011 but in ""Lucy"" Luc Besson has tried to explain similar concept in a grand manner. <br/><br/>Plot The plot of the movie revolves around a blond American girl name Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) who is trapped in the middle of horrific drug deal by his boy friend. She was forced to deliver a case filled with some highly advanced lab drug to dangerous mafia boss Mr. Jang (Minsik Choi – Old Boy, I Saw The Devil). She is further dissected and filled with same drug in her abdominal by Mr. Jang's men to make her a conduit of delivery to his clients. Because of torture during her captivity packet of drug in her body leaks to the maximum level and creates some chemical reaction after mixing with her DNA and results super ability of using her brain to exceedingly optimum level. With her newly gain super power she contacts Professor Norman (Morgan freeman) who has done extensive research on concept of utilizing human brain more than 10% which is the maximum level to date. Mixing of drug in high quantity in her body gives Lucy limitless powers to see beyond the existing and visible world. Due to her possible death in result drug she was advised by Dr. Norman to see and record evolutionary process of human being from single cell to multi-cellular organism. <br/><br/>Performances ""Lucy"" is filled with multi-star cast from Hollywood, France and Korea. As mentioned above main lead has been performed by beautiful Scarlet Johansson. She has brilliantly displayed both shades of naivety and fearlessness. As far as Hollywood reverend Mr. Freeman is concerned, it seems he has become an integral part of every movie with similar concept. Oblivion, Transcendence and now Lucy Mr. Freeman has not shown slight diversion. Along with fast paced action the other USP of the ""Lucy"" is performance of Korean actor Min sik Choi who has given not surprisingly fantastic performance without speaking a single word of English in whole movie. His ruthlessness as mafia boss and drug dealer is worth to be witnessed. <br/><br/>Conclusion Lack of novelty in story is big minus of the movie but unique style of storytelling by Luc Besson, execution and performance of Min sik Choi make ""Lucy"" worth of repeat watch."

","Plot<br/><br/>Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) has the worst boyfriend in the world. He has just forced her to transport a locked briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) by handcuffing the case to her wrist. When Mr. Jang gets hold of her he has her operated on so they can make her a drug mule. As this part of the story is being told Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is giving a lecture discussing what the likely possibilities if someone used more than ten percent of their brain. While he dazzles his audience with his best guesses to what could happen Lucy is experiencing the effects of expanding her mind firsthand because one of Mr. Jang's goons struck her in the stomach and ruptured the designer drug that had been inserted there. Somehow this has sparked a learning curve that has increased her understanding and improved her brain function where she is using more than twenty percent of her brain. With these new found powers of intellect she is able to defeat Mr. Jang's goons and get to a hospital so they can remove the leaking drug bag from her abdomen. It is here that she gleams with godlike understanding that she doesn't have long to live so makes plans to visit Mr. Jang for some answers and Professor Norman for some insight.<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>This wasn't much of a film for acting. There was far more reacting to special effects that weren't there or the physical effects that were. There was a degree of skill from Scarlett Johansson I suppose in how she acted before she got her powers and after. And it was impressive as always to remember all your lines the way that she does, but with a film like this there is only so much talent you can show. Then there was Morgan Freeman who added a great deal of credibility to this science fiction with his tone of voice and presence. I am sure the production team wanted him because he hosts the science show ""Through the Wormhole"" on TV. I don't think that could have picked someone to do a better playing Professor Norman.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>Lucy continues to increase with power, but that is not the same as character development so no there was very little change in any direction. If anything characters began to simplify.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>This was a well told action film that didn't try to be more than it was. The special effects were as good as I have seen anywhere. There is one moment in the film that it looks like Lucy can control time. Just to get to this point is something worth to be experienced. She is able to transport herself to New York City at Times Square and with the wave of her hand she stops time. Then she speeds it up like she just hit the fast forward button. A moment later she rewinds it to the point where Times Square doesn't exist and there are just horse and buggies. Then further back she goes until she comes across some Indians and further still to the dinosaurs. Throw in a bunch of gun violence and a massive roadway chase down one way streets and over sidewalks and along with many crashes and you have quite a spectacle."

"isabelle-frater","1","5","16","5 October 2014"," Crap science, lacklustre action, no real characters
","I'm pretty late watching this movie, but that's because I didn't want to pay for it. Reason #1, the science is bogus. The whole 10% thing had been refuted a while ago. I remember when it was all the rage, I think it was the late 80s, or early 90s, at least where I am from. I was a kid, and we were talking about it during a break at school with my friends. Not really a topic for 10-year-olds, but I was weird like that. What I can't remember is when I knew it was stupid. We now do know, there is no part of the brain going unused, or not up to its potential. I'm not going to go into details here, let's just say that when I saw the trailer of this movie, I found it weird how they could use something so archaic.<br/><br/>The reason why I did watch it was the reviews. They were pretty good, and promised excitement, good acting. I didn't really get either. The story is quite simplistic. Much of it is taken up by Morgan Freeman narrating. Now I like his voice as much as anyone, but the substance was sometimes face-palm worthy. Also, ooookay, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and it just never did. Maybe if I had actually believed that whole premise of the movie, but since I know it's bogus, I was mostly rolling my eyes. It's not that I haven't seen fantasy or sci- fi that had unrealistic elements to it. However, this time, it felt more like listening to some Christian apologist speak in one of the debates I so love. Totally baseless, junk science. I just couldn't let myself get lost in a fantasy. Maybe if the story actually had a story. It was so cliché, simplistic and predictable, the credits rolled, and the first thing that came to my mind was: ""that was it?"" I want to go up to Luc Besson, shake him, and ask him how he could have made something so boring. It reminded my of those sci-fi shorts that were really just introducing a concept, or an idea. However, those are not fit to be made into movies. They're dry. MAybe he was trying to do that? This from the same guy who made one of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time The Fifth Element. I must have seen that one a dozen times. I'll work very hard at forgetting that this mundane thing was also done by him.<br/><br/>I saw praise for Scarlett Johansson. She plays the lead character, Lucy. I guess if you can get points for spending the majority of the film with a completely blank expression, then it's okay. Though for that they could have just used Kristen Stewart. She has that down to an artform. Yeah, I'm being sarcastic, just in case you haven't read any of my reviews for her movies. Morgan Freeman is also on the poster. He narrates. He asks questions. He stands around a lot. He sometimes sits. I don't think he was used to his full potential either. Not that people wouldn't enjoy him reading the telephone book, but really...<br/><br/>So the story is simple, acting is not really required from the actors, so perhaps it has great fight scenes or special effects? No. Okay, there are brief moments when Lucy does something that looks cool. Like make guns fly into air. Would have been a wow moment in the 60s maybe. However, other than some people shooting up a bunch of places without much opposition is about as exciting or visual as this thing gets. I hope they didn't pay someone to come up with those fight scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, I couldn't find any redeeming factor to this movie that would make me actually want to watch it again, or recommend it to anyone. I didn't hate it. Really. Twilight I hated for various reasons. This I was more like shrugging and marking it off the ""to be watched"" pile. Crap science, lacklustre action, no real characters, ... I just don't see a point to what I watched for 90 minutes. I can't give it more than one star. I tried to give two, but really, there is just nothing good about this, I didn't enjoy anything about it. One star it is."

The Chinese were expendable after the intro and so is le capitan.<br/><br/>Secondly, if you expect anything else than Johanson and Morgan from this movie, you're gonna have a bad time.<br/><br/>They took it too far. I will not go into detail but this is not a sci- fi, it's just fi. No science in the movie just fiction. The producers did not really consult anyone in the domain of neurology or biochemistry and might have even decided to forget about the laws of physics. <br/><br/>10 for the concept, excellent premises. 0 for the science, 4 for the horrible development and 3 for the plot. It was just effects, action and Scarlett J. 10 for Freeman and 8 for Johanson (no sexy scenes really).<br/><br/>Worth watching if you have no actual idea about how the brain and neurons work and/or if you want to disregard everything you knew about physics and chemistry (even biology). Otherwise you will cringe. But it is still enjoyable as a movie even tho they cudve done better."

Ultimately, while the movie has some real holes, it tackles one of the great questions. It's about what we don't know, that we don't know, that we don't know. <br/><br/>I mean.<br/><br/>What would it be like for someone to become a god. To transcend. To become, everything. <br/><br/>To exist in an unexplained and vastly expanded and vastly different reality. To control matter, energy, and time with your mind/spirit.

What Besson<br/><br/>The stuff with Morgan Freeman and the mob dudes was almost like window dressing for the real story, the story of Lucy's big, scary, and at the end beautiful dare I say, sublimation. It's all about Lucy, what's happening to her, and what she's going to do with it. Where is she going to take it. WHAT WILL SHE DO?<br/><br/>I believe it's a common enough theme in really creative Science Fiction writing - I have come across it before. But not like this.

"henri sauvage","7","5","16","28 July 2014"," Another Take on a Familiar Theme
","That is, a familiar theme for the director, Luc Besson. Lucy, the protagonist, is very much a cross between Nikita and Leeloo the Fifth Element, with a touch of the anime 'Akira' and Chayefsky's 'Altered States' thrown into the mix. There were some great moments in this movie, but, on the whole, I have to say it wasn't as dark and intense as 'La Femme Nikita', or as entertaining as 'The Fifth Element'.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: Johansson gives an excellent performance, as an initially carefree student who through a very nasty set of circumstances is trapped into serving a drug kingpin as a mule, carrying a surgically implanted packet of a new drug with some ... shall we say ... remarkable properties.<br/><br/>When she resists a rape attempt by one of his goons, this suicidally stupid henchman kicks her in the stomach several times, rupturing the packet. Since unless they just hired him that day, you'd think this flunky should have some inkling of what his sadistic, cold-blooded killer of a boss would do to him if he found out -- and he pulled this stunt in front of another henchman -- all I can say is, the guy must have had a major death wish. Or very poor impulse control. Or the IQ of something from the back of the refrigerator. Or all of the above.<br/><br/>Anyway, through the miracle of scientific-sounding mumbo-jumbo (as tediously expounded by Morgan Freeman -- what a terrible waste of a fine actor!) we find out that the drug which has leaked into Lucy's bloodstream is expanding her consciousness and giving her superhuman abilities. This leads to lots of special effects and general mayhem, as well as the obligatory car chase.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound dismissive of this movie: far from it. Generally, anything Besson directs is well worth a look. There are some marvelously trippy sequences showing the effects of the drug on her perceptions, and some humorous moments, like when her body tries to rebel while she's on an airliner. Johansson deftly manages her mental transformation into something both more and less than human, making her performance chilling and touching, sometimes both at once.<br/><br/>A slight correction to the IMDb blurb: it's true that at first, the drug turns Lucy into a ruthless killer. But as her consciousness progresses to a higher level, she stops killing, even though it would have been easy for her to squash people like bugs.<br/><br/>Not Besson's best, but still a nice alternative to your usual mindless summer blockbuster. Worth seeing."

However if you are looking for the film to stand alone on that premise you will probably be disappointed. If you open yourself up to the main message that suggests we are too wrapped up in our petty first world problems and need to pay more attention to the larger issues we face in our society; this film should be a good workout for the philosophers to mull over.

Also, her character is a hypocrite. While driving the cop's car and he complains about her killing him, she says ""we never really die"". Okay, then if she feels that way why is it so important for HER to survive? Makes no sense. Also she is a killer, as she kills countless people in car accidents that she causes.
In the end, she leaves humanity a giant computer filled with advanced physics, yes this humanity who still allows child abuse, child slavery, decimation of the planet, drug trade, murder, etc. Yeah, we deserve that and will handle it wisely, for sure!!! The movie is kind of a fun watch if you can not scream in frustration from Johansen's jerking head the entire movie through.

Mayhem and much destruction ensue. Besson can do this in his sleep. Some of the chases and fights veer toward self parody. excessive to the point of loosing credibility.

The crux of the story; Morgan Freeman takes on the role of Professor Norman, a friendly sage who helps Lucy. Lucy was inadvertently transformed into the result of the next evolutionary leap in mankind's' development, when she was subjected to a drug that enables her to use one hundred percent of her brain power. This is where the movie rises above its action film format. What would one do with such knowledge?<br/><br/>At one point in the film, the enlightened Lucy proclaims that her partner should not be concerned with the body count in the course of a car chase. she said something like, People don't really die. or, Death isn't the end. I would have liked to have her elaborate on that one.<br/><br/>There is some truly mind blowing concepts presented here. Lucy invents a time and space machine that can take her to any place and time in the history of the world. the Times square backward time travel sequence was jaw dropping. Awesome sequence, worth the price of admission right there.<br/><br/>Besson scores again. Eight out of Ten stars."

At one point Lucy draws on the window of a car to use mental powers. WTF?

","One of the most interesting films I've seen since the Fountain.

Its one of those movies, like the Fountain, that few will appreciate but it is set to become a cult classic in the future. Not a film that suits everyone, as reviews on this site shows. It may be scientifically inaccurate, but it is after all Science FICTION and most films of that genre deal with things that are scientifically impossible or improbable!

There is a serious case of overacting by Scarlet Johansson here. I didn't like her in this one. She is a real hit and miss. They try to use cheap tactics to keep you in it, but it just doesn't work.

","This film seems to be a low rated one. I would have to disagree with the lower ratings.<br/><br/>Lucy explores a normal girl being used as an unwilling and unmeaning experiment. A party girl betrayed by a friend/ex lover is turned into something indefinitely more through the acts of drug trafficking and violence.<br/><br/>She becomes everything that we as humans could be if we were more interested in what we are as apposed to what we do.<br/><br/>The cast seems to be quite mundane in their acting and this is where the lower rating comes into play. Scarlet is a tough bird who has mostly no emotion to begin with and that is even before she starts becoming a ultra being devoid of emotion. She does have a few moments where you see the grace and greatness of her acting shine through which does save the movie. Morgan Freeman does have a few believable moments but the film doesn't really give him a lot of room to develop character. He is, as always, amazing. The other characters you basically care little for.<br/><br/>The point of the movie is the development of the human race and what would happen if we were able to gain control of a larger percentage of the mind.

","I premise that I am a huge Besson fan, seen most of his movies and am familiar with his style. I didn't really know, though I ""sensed"" what I was going to see, and I kind of expected the usual romp, like the professional or kiss of the dragon, but here the director went a step further, tackling with fundamental issues of human existence, and daresay existence in general. I don't want to give out any spoilers inadvertently, so I'll be very general. I honestly cannot understand all the people who saw ""logic"" problems with the plot. Or perhaps it is all down to the fact that everybody has their own way of processing things, despite what doctrinal science might say, science itself is a matter of consensus, everybody does really see things differently, and although many people reacted negatively, there was quite a reaction nonetheless, so Besson was successful in getting people to pay attention, which is already saying a lot. Personally, I found it enlightening.The ending is nothing new, saw the same thing when Dr Strange's the Ancient One died, oh, maybe forty years ago? But that's because there is nothing new other than people starting over and over again each new generation and having to realize the same old truths all over again, which is humanity's curse and bliss, for ignorance is bliss, but so is total understanding, it's the stuff in between, that which we call the human dimension, that struggles. Anyway, in a nutshell, this is what I got from the movie. I'll keep the ""deeper"" stuff for myself. On another note, Besson is the Tarantino of France, and came before him and is still here with his best movie yet. Might we expect the same of Quentin, or was Pulp Fiction really it? I'd like to see him give it another shot!"

I watched this film 7 times in the theater because it caught me off guard just as the original Star Wars film did (I saw that one 16 times the first week it came out). Certain films will entice you, if you really enjoy action films and how they are shown you should really dig this one! It also helps that you can relate to a strong lead woman instead of the traditional male character. Scarlett continues her strong character presence in Lucy and there is so much going on that you need to watch it again just to pick up all that takes place. I prefer to completely watch a film first and experience it for what the director wants you to feel. Then I will watch it for again for everything else.

First part of ""Lucy"" was fun, the second one for me - not so much, because when they have moved to ""Transcendence"" territory it wasn't so much fun because i never buy it as serious stuff. ""Lucy"" isn't sci-fi gem, it's simply action movie with some unusual writing - that's it.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Lucy"" isn't your typical action flick, because it has some sci-fi (more ""fi"" then sci) stuff in action movie that you kinda won't see coming.

","Maybe it's ironic that to enjoy a film about using 100% of your brain capacity you best turn it almost completely off. Johansson plays a woman who gets forced to smuggle a kilo of CPH4 (a new drug) in her stomach, but it rips open and she gets a overdose which gives her the ability to gradually use more of her brain capacity. It all sounds plausible up to here but then it goes completely of the rails. I won't mention the things she can do with her mind in this film, but let's just say that they are not very realistic or scientifically sound. It's all just very silly and ridiculous and you have to just go with it. The film was very successful in the cinemas, my guess is because it's a very international film. There are Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, Koreans and China-men in it. Everybody likes to see themselves in a movie right? The film most resembles a scifi version of the Transporter films which Besson also produced. You could say Chris Nolan makes Scifi with a capital S and Besson scifi with a small s.

"jdesando","Null","5","17","25 July 2014"," The fourth strong sci-fi this summer (Snowpiercer, Dawn of The Planet of the Apes, I Origins are the other 3)
","""That's your best friend and your worst enemy - your own brain."" Fred Durst<br/><br/>Lucy is a summer surpriseâ€”a sci-fi with brains and humor directed by Luc Besson, whose talents I first spied in the strong woman flick, la Femme Nikita. The titular heroine, played by Scarlett Johansson (carrying on from her other intriguing sci-fi this year, Under the Skin), begins as a hapless woman caught in a drug deal, whose drug she is forced to carry as a mule. Spillage gives her brain powers undreamed of.<br/><br/>This drug increases her brain function incrementally until she finally uses all of it. At stages higher than the usual human 10% or so usage, she has insights and telekinetic abilities that neutralize tough guys and engage intellectuals, mainly Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who has been theorizing about the brain's potential for years. The reality of the increased brain usage in Lucy is almost more than he or the world can bear. The super power action could remind audiences of The Matrix's arcane philosophy and action.<br/><br/>Besson deftly plays between violence and humor, the opening sequence the most hilarious when the bad guys corral Lucy, who begins to feel her power and uses it on the Asian thugs, who scarcely can believe this white woman tornado. Intercutting between Lucy's slowly realizing her accelerating brain functions and Professor Norman's lectures on the brain's underused capacity, Besson keeps the film moving at thriller pace while educating the audience on the potential of underused intelligence.<br/><br/>As usually happens in most thrillers, but not always sci-fi's, chases are too abundant, either in cars or on foot. The car chase where Lucy drives through Paris is unusually creative, more keystone Cops than James Bond, but ingenious enough for me to mention action I usually ignore in reviews.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not the guns or the beautiful Johansson that interests me; it's the philosophical contrast between our need to love and our thirst for more knowledge and experience. After all, that knowledge compromised Adam and Eve, and by extension all of us, and Lucy's increasing wisdom would seem to put us in a similar danger. <br/><br/>""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,"" as the saying goes, but what about too much?"
"taboscosauce81","9","7","27","31 July 2014"," A great addition to the random super power movie genre.
","People see trailers for movies like this and have already decided whether or not they are going to movie snob the crap out of it. Some feel that they are so mentally superior that they need to point out how scientifically impossible the events of a movie are. Well, all you Smarty McSmartersons, guess what. This is not a documentary. It is a movie based on fantasy or science fiction concepts. Whether or not the whole ten percent thing has been proved in real life has nothing to do with this movie, because it is a movie. And in this particular movie universe, people only use ten percent of their brains. So let loose your omnipotent grasp on all knowledge that is correct and relax for a couple hours.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed the movie and recommend it. I love movies that focus on one person gaining a usually very specific super power. It falls into the same unnamed category as Limitless, Push, Jumper and Unbreakable. It's a what if story about people becoming more than they are in the real world. I just wish it lasted a little longer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this genre, everything else besides the super power is usually quite mundane. The world looks normal, so people expect the rules of real world science to apply. If you are one to loosen your grasp on reality when being entertained, then you will enjoy this movie. If you are someone who needs to try and make sense of everything or needs to let the world know how smart you are, then you really don't need to see this movie. Just watch the trailer and pick it apart. Your argument will be that same."

Because it's in our nature; What happened after? What ever the parties interests were."
"freeist","4","6","22","25 July 2014"," Better than I thought, not as good as it could have been.
","I couldn't expect very much from a movie based on the myth that humans only used a small percentage of their brains. This notion, harped upon very much by nuns making the point that their students were lazy, was debunked sometime in the pre-mythbusters era. So now it doesn't even make good pseudo-science for a fiction plot.<br/><br/>It's rather startling that Lucy director-writer Luc Besson apparently never got that memo, and its more startling that nobody bothered to correct him before he made a whole movie based on the idea.<br/><br/>If the scientific basis is poor, the plot concept is solid and absorbing: an American woman is captured overseas by a crime syndicate and then is used as an unwilling mule-vessel for some new street drug. She's captured and tortured by a rival gang (I presume, anyway, see below.) While being ""worked over"" the drug packet in her breaks open. This might not be such a spoiler, because it's all in the trailer.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, even considering it's based on nonsense, I enjoyed Lucy. Scarlett Johansson does a good job as the title character. Of course, you can't find many people who look better on the big screen than Johansson. The problem is, after the first five scenes, she's not really a character anymore. She's become more like a force of nature--a monster really. Usually a friendly one, but still not one anybody can reason with or oppose.<br/><br/>That does get to another flaw in the film. You aren't given a lot of time to get to like the main character before she becomes a monster, and she seemed likable. At about 90 minutes, the film felt too rushed. In fact, it almost becomes incoherent at one point. They seem to have over-edited and left out a scene where Lucy is captured and tortured by a rival gang. (I presumed that's what happened. The trailer seemed as clear on this point than the film did, which is to say not very.) The movie has a lot of gun play, of which Lucy is generally not involved because if she's there, she wins. It sports an international cast, including, Chinese, French and Italian. If I'm not mistaken, it probably has a radically different cut in China and Europe than it does in the US, which is hardly an excuse for leaving key scenes out.<br/><br/>Another problem with purported ""underused brain"" notion is that Besson inter-cuts scenes of a Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) giving a lecture on that basis. The lecture parts are dull as any lecture, even with Freeman giving it, and are made duller by the fact that it's all nonsense. Nothing Norman says even touches on the real world.<br/><br/>Besson compounds his error by showing us the running percentage of Lucy's brain usage. In short, you're not allowed to forget the stupidity of the ""underused brain"" myth and just go with the fact that Lucy is becoming mentally more supercharged.<br/><br/>Besson tries to make a deep philosophical point about the nature of existence and time, even within all the shooting and action. He might have succeeded in his philosophical point, except the movie has no credibility due to its basic stupid brain hypothesis. It's the old paradox of science fiction: how does a writer of average intelligence or less write characters of extreme intelligence? Lucy crashes into this paradox like a mack truck into a concrete pylon.<br/><br/>But, if you ignore that, and just accept that she's becoming more and more superhuman, Lucy's not a bad movie.<br/><br/>I would rate it a 5. Despite the lectures, the film kept my interest, and I wanted to see what happened to Lucy. It loses another point, though, due to its major editing error. I don't care how many markets they edit for, in this day and age, there's no excuse for that."

","I'm a big fan of Luc Besson as a writer-director (""Leon"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Angel-A"", ""La Femme Nikita"") and he normally restricts himself to action with a good dose of violence, and only the occasional philosophical hints. In his best films, the focus is often on a young woman who is aided by an older man, and he is true to his methods in this film, although he adds a significant layer of philosophy and epistemology. Some may find this distracting, and for some it may be above their comprehension, but for me it was marvelous, to the point where I actually could have used fewer car chases and a little less violence.<br/><br/>Here is an intelligent script with wonderful photography and music, and a sly use of canned footage that will amuse you. Morgan Freeman is his usual awesome self, and Min-sik Choi (""Old Boy"") is appropriately menacing.<br/><br/>Go see this film, but don't expect the normal Besson film. That's good.

","'LUCY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Sci-Fi action flick written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Scarlett Johansson as an American woman, living in Taiwan, who's forced into transferring a powerful drug, hidden in her abdomen. When the drug starts leaking it allows the woman to use her brain's full functioning capacity, which in turn gives her super powers. The film costars Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik and Amr Waked. The film deals with some interesting theories but it's much more fantastical than intelligent science fiction. Still it's action-packed and pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>Johansson plays Lucy, a young American woman who's living in Taipei, Taiwan. She just began dating a drug mule there, named Richard (Pilou Asbaek). After Richard makes Lucy do his job for him, and he's killed, the Korean gangster he was working for, Mr. Jang (Min-sik), forces Lucy to take his place. A powerful synthetic drug, called CPH4, is sewn into her stomach and she, and three others, are forced into transferring the drugs into Europe. After being beaten, by one of Jang's men, the drug begins to leak inside her. This makes her increasingly smarter; which gives her special abilities. Freeman plays a Professor that Lucy goes to for help.<br/><br/>The theory that we only use 10% of our brain's capacity is heavily explored in this film (although most scientists say it's just a myth). In this movie when Lucy begins using 20% of her brain, and increasingly higher amounts, she develops super human abilities; like telekinesis and mental time travel. She keeps getting more and more powerful, self aware and also increasingly emotionless. This makes her character seem extremely unrelatable; she's still an awesome action heroine though. Besson is well known for doing action flicks with really strong female characters (like 'LA FEMME NIKITA', 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' and 'THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC'). Johansson's character here continues that tradition. As an action flick it works but it's definitely not full of intelligent big ideas. It does try to do something different but it's still highly reminiscent of other recent sci-fi flicks like 'TRANSCENDENCE' and even 'HER' (which also featured Johansson). It's definitely entertaining enough for 90 minutes though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/3AK4roDokJo"
"myheartisbetweenmylegs","10","5","18","25 July 2014"," A film who's reach exceeds its grasp
","After viewing the film Lucy tonight, I feel compelled to give a review of a film I found very ambitious albeit it a bit perplexing. <br/><br/>The film is directed by Luc Besson of Fifth Element fame and stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular Lucy and Morgan Freeman as a university professor studying the abilities of the mind. To start off with, I found the directing to be rather good in terms of economic story telling and the classic show don't tell rule. There is actually far less exposition in this film than in others with similar aspirations of philosophical grandeur. There are some scenes where characters who shouldn't really know what Lucy is doing at a given moment yet they conveniently explain it for the audience but these are plot contrivances and I think over all the screen play is well paced and efficient.<br/><br/>The acting is definitely not Oscar bait nor is it done with any subtly but I felt it was more than serviceable. Scarlett Johansson sells the awkward demeanor of her character pre-powers very well. The problem I had with her performance was her monotone personality after getting her cerebral abilities though I am fully aware this is likely due to the way her character is written. Though one thing I did like a lot was the confidence Johansson was portraying after receiving her powers despite her line readings being a tad flat. She definitely sells she knows she's a bad ass and she pulls off struggling with her detachment from humanity well. Morgan Freeman is pretty much good in everything he does and he certainly sounds like a learned scholar in this film. I had definite flash backs to Through The Wormhole with his performance here even if his science is a tad off. <br/><br/>Luc Besson was certainly adequate form in this film. I found his camera work was lacking in the artistic department but he made up for it in by building suspenseful moments and exciting car chases and action scenes. It wasn't Die Hard by any means, but it was a fun ride watching Lucy execute her powers. A real problem with his directing is the intercut animal kingdom sequences which forces the metaphor on you. There is no subtly here the film tells or shows you everything you need to know and there's not a whole lot of room for interpretation. There's no real ambiguity.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the special effects. I think it struck the perfect balance in terms of CGI scenes showing the human anatomy in real time(think Fight Club but a bit more grandiose in its approach and having real sets and characters. I don't think the effects are grounding breaking or anything but they definitely serve the film well.<br/><br/>Okay, now onto the screenplay. I think this is probably the biggest flaw in the movie outside of plot contrivances because it simply tries to explore concepts I don't think the film is capable of doing. They spend time talking about human evolution by Johansson narrating, the creation of the universe, what in this meaning of life and how far Homo Sapien has come. These are all concepts I enjoy exploring in a film that has more nuance. In this movie it's all shoved into your face a bit too heavy handed though I will say they did show us the connection between this philosophical concepts instead of just telling us how they do. I think that's good story telling but the problem is the film doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an action flick? A chick flick? A female James bond movie? The story moves at an abundantly fast pace but what is and doesn't take enough time to really explore these concepts. Any scene that has these concepts are given just enough time to let us know there is a theme there but it never explores it adequately. It's like the film is shouting ""hey look this is a metaphor for this"" and ripe with obvious parallels. These are great concepts to explore but they need to be more subtle. It's as if the film thinks it's smarter than it actually is.<br/><br/>I didn't even notice the score too much to be honest though I did like the sequence with Mozart's requiem. I wish the film could have had more of that gravitas instead of the subdued score pieces. I have heard once before that you don't remember good music because it integrates so well into the film you don't even hear it. It just puts you in a subconscious mood. If you subscribe to that line of thought then you might like this soundtrack. I perform more bombastic background music to put me into the scene more.<br/><br/>To surmise my thoughts so far; I think it's a film with great ambition that it doesn't have the motivation to achieve. I was expecting to see a fast paced, run n gun supernatural powers type of film so I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or Full Jacket. The film tries too hard to explore huge concepts and it is simply not deep enough to convey those philosophical ideas though it does get the benefit of the doubt for at least trying.... The acting is serviceable, the action is fresh and there are some really heartfelt moments within the film that may touch or dismiss you. <br/><br/>The film feels like it's the ADD, Youtubed instant gratification version of 2001: A Space Oydessy in terms of what it is trying to accomplish. Its theme and metaphor can never match the flawless implementation of the subtext in Kubrick's classic though it desperately wants to be the action version of those philosophical questions. The film doesn't know what film it wants to be and I think that's the crux of why I believe this film is only serviceable.<br/><br/>My final review: 7/10"
"joeravioli","3","3","9","4 September 2015"," A terrible movie with a few good ideas
","Lucy feels like a misplaced mash-up of silly sci-fi and a weird theoretical documentary, spiralling drearily from its boring beginning to its mind-blowingly pretentious ending. Sadly, it fails in both genres, sacrificing promising action for undue intelligence and coherence for unnecessary visual intricacy, eventually creating a film that is so wrapped up in its far-fetched ideas, it cannot fathom even itself. However, there are certain brief moments in the film that are strangely interesting, occasionally even stimulating the mind beyond what is expected of a common Hollywood action film. That being said, those moments are extremely rare, and barely make up for the overwhelming awfulness of this ridiculous mishmash.<br/><br/>The film begins with our hero, Lucy (played by the wonderfully distant Scarlett Johansson), being blackmailed, witnessing the death of the guy who blackmailed her, and crying an awful lot. Even from the beginning, as the dazed lighting, lack of definite setting and deliberately pretentious cuts to random nature shots (which are even more poorly lit) suggest, this movie has a bloated idea of itself, not realizing that it has provided nothing in its initial few minutes to hold the viewer in any way. Even the subsequent scene in which Scarlett Johansson is interrogated drags on for an awful long time, eventually becoming boring and repetitive.<br/><br/>The movie eventually finds a premise: Lucy is exposed to some fancy new drugs which gradually allow her to use an increased amount of her brain, turning her not only into a lethal killing machine, but also an omnipotent goon with a Messiah complex. With all this new brainpower (and also the knowledge that she is going to die within the next 24 hours), she decides to bequeath her newfound knowledge to humanity, choosing a theoretical neuroscientist (Morgan Freeman) to be her disciple. This choice is made without any explanation, but whatever.<br/><br/>Although my interest in the film remained nonexistent up until this point, I began to feel a certain vile hope creep up upon me, that hope manifesting itself as the promise of crazy, telekinesis-fuelled action scenes. The film had finally slithered past its horrible beginning, its ridiculous premise, and now could proceed into passive, violent oblivion. But, unfortunately, the film saw it fit to avoid such action for completely unnecessary visual eye-grabbers, and mundane sci-fi chatting. The action is thin, kept to a minimum, and slightly disgusting. It feels like the product of the mind of a teenager: unevenly paced, poorly filmed, pretentious, and laughable. Even the characters are unwatchable, being either stunningly wooden, evil, or simply boring.<br/><br/>But eventually the film reaches its ending, where Lucy travels back in time and learns everything there is to know. That one short scene should have been a movie within itself. The visuals are breathtaking, but divinely subtle as well, picking apart what we think we know and showing us what is beyond the limits of our knowledge with such ease and fluidity, that it is hard to dismiss it. Of course, it's all unfounded nonsense, but it's stunning unfounded nonsense. Then, as a final reminder of how terrible this movie is, it shows us that all that was just an excuse to make Lucy into God. Huzzah. The End.<br/><br/>This film isn't really sure what cinematic path to follow, and its failure to span two at once makes it entirely unwatchable."

","Viewers can elect the mindset to watch this strange but extraordinarily beautiful (splendid special effects by Philippe Hubin and crew, cinematography by Thierry Arbogast, and music by Eric Serra) film written and directed by Luc Beeson (Transporter series, Taken series, The Fifth Element Taxi, etc). It is a film that pushes our imagination, offers fascinating insights about the possibilities of brain function, and takes a different stance on fantasy thrillers.<br/><br/>Opening in Ethiopia we meet Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) and Richard (Pilou Asbæk) – Richard is asking Lucy to deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). But immediately Lucy is caught up in a nightmarish situation where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug. When the bag she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks, Lucy's body undergoes unimaginable changes that unlock her mind's full potential 100%. With her newfound powers, Lucy turns into a merciless warrior intent on getting back at her captors. She receives invaluable help from Professor Norman Morgan Freeman), the leading authority on the human mind, and French police captain Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked). Watching Lucy's expanding brain power provide extensive insights and control is astonishing and the entire film is enhanced by not only the intelligent words from Professor Norman but also the flashbacks to the beginning of life on the planet, dizzyingly fast forwarded to now and the world Lucy must face. <br/><br/>Try to pay less attention to the plethora of Chinese gangsters and focus on the intelligent possibilities and the film will remain in the back of your mind long after the credits run."

","This movie doesn't follow conventional structure, with a problem, a plot twist, a love story, some action, and a typical happy/tragic ending. The characters don't act as ""heroes"", who do everything just the right way.<br/><br/>No, this movie (and the characters in it) dares to go beyond the notion of good/bad, and beyond the notion of ""death is so sad"". This might put some people off, and I know it felt strange to me, but it's really refreshing actually.<br/><br/>It's based on myths that have not been proved scientifically, but not really proved wrong, either (as other reviews say). Keep in mind that obviously all the parts of the brain are useful, But we have Conscious access to only a tiny percentage of it. Even non-magical exercises like simple meditation let you have conscious access to more brain functions (i.e. accelerating or decelerating your heart rate without moving).<br/><br/>After having watched this movie, I got a nice feeling that life is simple and there's no need to create complicated problems where there are none."
"utgard14","6","3","9","21 December 2014"," Goofy Fun
","A lot of people seem to have a big problem with this film using the myth that humans only use 10% of their brain. Really it's only true of people in Hollywood. Because this is just an entertainment piece, it doesn't bother me much. If it was something more pretentious, like an Aronofsky film, I would have a bigger problem with it. The movie is certainly watchable from beginning to end. I'd even say it's fun most of the way. But it never makes the most of its premise and even seems to give up trying relatively quickly. You have a character who can do pretty much anything but the things they have her do are mundane and the only threat to her they can come up with are angry drug dealers with guns. The ending is the default transcendental trip that every movie about humans evolving since 2001: A Space Odyssey has used a variation of. The most amusing part is where Lucy (Scarlett) meets Lucy (ape woman). But 'space baby' it is not. The use of the animal footage is the kind of stuff film school students do. Maybe it does have its pretentious moments. Scarlett Johansson's entertaining. The guy from Oldboy is fun but the character was really an unimpressive threat. Morgan Freeman's got new choppers. Good for him. Overall, it's an enjoyable but goofy film that shouldn't be taken too seriously."

","It surely is not a documentary about how the brain works. As well, neither one about the philosophical theories regarding time, knowledge, mind and life. But it's blending ideas from both to create an interesting story concept. From the scientific point that, by using more of our brain's capacity we will be able to do unseen things to the point where in philosophy it is explained why someone who would possess such a great power will not use it in harmful ways to humanity, it will only try to help, and mixed with some great visual effects and a few action tricks from master Luc, the journey is quite catchy. But, it is surely not for everyone and surely, as i said at the beginning, not a documentary, so don't treat is as such. Probably would be good to read a few books about how the brain works and have some basic philosophic knowledge about time, space and our minds. Otherwise, it won't make much sense to the viewer."
"seige-hound","8","3","9","22 November 2014"," An Entertaining Film based around a Preposterous Premise
","This film is about a woman turning herself into God.<br/><br/>Really. According to Luc Besson, 100% Cerebral capacity=Omniscience. At the end of the film, after transforming from a naive young woman, to a telekinetic, to a telepathic, to a ultra-computer, she disappears, gives all her knowledge to Morgan Freeman (in the form of a Universe USB) and achieves ascension.<br/><br/>It's crazy, stupid, but altogether fun and visually engaging.<br/><br/>From what I've seen, Luc Besson is quite a master of visual appeal, and its no different here. The film is also quite diverse. The villains are a gang of Triad drug dealers, and the film is mainly set in Europe and Taiwan.<br/><br/>The 10% idea is a complete fallacy, but the script runs with it, caring not for legitimate science, and makes the movie they want to make.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the film is the dialog. Luc Besson is French, and it seems rather apparent from his writing (he wrote and directed this film) that English isn't his forte. Scarlett Johanneson does wonders with the script though, especially at the beginning, where she is practically a different character then what she is at the end. She loses a lot of emotion throughout the film as her ascension progresses, but I think her character arc excuses that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Lucy is an entertaining film that's worth watching, perhaps with your brain at 10%."

","Wow, I really enjoyed this picture. First of all, it is beautifully filmed and every shot is interesting to watch. The actors are great and the story is outrageous and entertaining. Think about it: what would we be capable of doing, if our brains could use not only the usual 10 % of capacity, but 30, 50, 80 or 100? This is what happens to Lucy after she accidentally absorbs a large quantity of a new drug she was supposed to deliver. As her brain gets more and more empowered, the story evolves with lots of action, one of the best car races ever seen on screen, a team of scientists dropping their yaws and Lucy setting everything straight and fighting the drug thugs. And then, her journey to knowledge begins and leads to a grand final that only Luc Besson could conceive. Must see!"

"Baalcebub","2","3","9","26 October 2014"," Two movies and a documentary.
","There are two movies here. One is a sort of sequel/rehash of The Professional, only instead of the frailty of the human condition we have Super Matilda. The other movie is the story of a Buddha-like figure. And then there is a sort of documentary during the first portions of the movie. This three things did not work together. <br/><br/>Maybe it can be done, maybe you can have Super Matilda attain Nirvana while Morgan Freeman narrates, but if that can be done, I'm pretty sure it's not Besson who can do it, he's too enamored with visuals. That overlong car chase? That could have been used for some character development, we could have spent that time exploring how Lucy's brain works in a more meaningful way than with colorful meta human user interfaces. <br/><br/>Perhaps this movie could have worked is Lucy was less of a Mary-Sue, or if Besson had dared to defy film clichés and made her even more of a Mary-Sue and destroy the pedestrian conflict we all could see coming and which is exclusively Lucy's fault by omission, and then include an even bigger and mind blowing conflict latter on, you now, actually challenge the audience instead of pretending to do so with the justification for the premise, which is no challenge at all. <br/><br/>Perhaps it could have been better... no, I'm certain it would have been better if Besson had gone all out Urban Fantasy on this movie. Why attempt to give us such a weak justification for the premise? We don't actually need it, and providing this 10% crap only results in breaking the suspension of disbelief. Just tell us the drug can make her super, and keep on going from there, no further explanation, no pseudo scientific mumbo jumbo; you could have your Super Matilda that way, or even your Lucy-Buddha. Tell us it's magic, tell us she just is the next step on human evolution, tell us not to ask why it works and if the rest is enjoyable, that's all we need. But don't disrespect our intelligence with this pseudo science that will only make us question more of the film. <br/><br/>The documentary part, I don't know, maybe if this was a self aware comedy the mockumentary could have worked. <br/><br/>But in the end this would have worked much better if it had been only one of the movies it tried to be. <br/><br/>I never dreamed of saying this, but taking Morgan Freeman out of this could have only benefited it, since with him in it all we can see is how horribly he's being wasted. <br/><br/>And no, I did not disliked it only because of the 10% thing or because I didn't got it. I got it, there just wasn't that much to get, the final story has been told a lot of times before, and much better. Hell, ""Her"", in which also stars Johannson, deals with a somewhat similar subject and it does it so much better there is no comparison, because ""Her"" knows how to deal with a semi spiritual subject, mainly don't do it head on because it will disappoint. In ""Her"" we don't know how the A.I. was achieved or how it works, and the story is so good that we don't care. No, the main reason I disliked this movie was because Besson forced the story, he mashed his three ideas together and made them fit by pure brute force, and that does not leave you with a beautiful piece, it leaves you with the bloody mangled corpse of a story. <br/><br/>And yet, the visuals are pretty and Lucy is a bad ass, not truly a super intelligent bad ass as she's supposed to be, but a bad ass nonetheless."

","In general, I like Luc Besson's creations I have tried to follow them as much as possible. His distinct approaches and good choices of actors are notable - and Lucy is no exception here. However, there is too much neuroscience, sometimes sci-fi and plain shootings do not match / disturb each other, there are some unrealistic scenes (e.g. person with a visible gun freely moving around in a public institution), and the talent of some actors (particularly Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked) was ""wasted"" in minor and non-elaborated characters. Scarlett Johansson is, of course, great and thanks to her abilities and charm the film's overall value is enhanced for me. Long shootings are car chases characteristic to Besson are present as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film in question is still far above average and the 1 hour 20 minutes pass smoothly, with a few protracted scenes though. But it has not reached the level of e.g. Subway or The Fifth Element."

It touches on various topics like the meaning of life, Existence of God, Potential of Human mind, Origin of the universe, The nature of man and his role in the universe, overcoming the limitations and hurdles in life.<br/><br/>It kind of draws a parallel with the film ""limitless"" in a way. But there is a difference in the message that both films give. In lucy, the main character dwells on the question of purpose of life and tries to think objectively and not subjectively. <br/><br/>The science fiction stuff might have been a little overboard but its a science fiction in the end and has every right to venture in the unknown in order to have us flabbergasted. In my opinion it was not too eccentric. I liked the way the character of Scarlett evolves over time and is able to unlock the full potential of the human mind. <br/><br/>I am unable to understand why this movie has been rated in the 6s.

"ayoreinf","7","3","9","31 August 2014"," Maybe, if Besson could be limited to directing
","I've seen a few of Luc Besson's movies beforehand, mainly those where his obsession with the idea of the reluctant super heroine operating in a male dominated world is clearest. I liked Nikita, though I had some issues with the plot holes that in my mind come to signify Besson's writing. It was even more of a problem with the 5th Element, where pseudo philosophic babbling was added to the mix not to mention tons of pretentiousness. The truck on which Besson's obsession carries him is moving forward always advancing, unfortunately it doesn't advance into good movie making, it's simply gets more pretentious and more dependent on his pseudo philosophic babble. Besson has all the making of a good director. He has a very good visual perception, which he always translate well to the screen. He has a good eye for actors and even more so for actresses Anne Parillaud, Milla Jovovich and Natalie Portman owe him a lot, the last two launched their cinema career on his films. And all his talent as director is getting him into poorer and poorer results, because he insists on writing his own scripts. Many directors do it with remarkable outcome Luc Besson doesn't. He must have someone else beside him to tell him that things don't make sense, someone with an influence. It seems to me that he simply doesn't care about plot logic he might even think his ""philosophic"" bits are deep and meaningful - sorry it's not the case. It rings hollow and pretentious (I know I used this word before - no other word describes it better).<br/><br/>And so, amazing performances by Scarlett Johansson, and Min-sik Choi, and some solid acting by Morgan Freeman and Amr Waked, on top of some brilliant action scenes and some real beautiful cinematography, are all getting wasted because by the end of the film the utter stupidity of it all covers everything else. What's supposed to be deep and thought provoking is so empty and ridiculous I found myself laughing a desperate bitter laugh instead of being excited or thrilled."

","*Minor Spoiler Alert* This movie is fun and addicting. What I liked about this movie is that it's unpredictable and it's fresh. But I also have a few minor problems:<br/><br/>1. We never know if Lucy is really a foreign-exchange student in Taiwan or just an average party girl at the beginning of the movie. It was never really implied. 2. Before the hospital scene, why does she shot a guy who doesn't speak English, even though at the hospital the Chinese words seems to understand her? I will forgive you if she's a foreign-exchange student (See No.1) but no. That part was never explained at all. 3.I still don't understand how CHP4 was created. The explanation is a bit messy for me. 4. Lack of character development. Really, the movie's so short. It's only approximately 90 minutes. 5. The ending. What the heck?<br/><br/>All in all, flaws aside, this a good movie of how the human brain does when it reached 100%. Yes, some of them are unrealistic, but the director of this movie says that the ""10% myth"" is only a theory and the movie shows how a person could be at 100%. And now, my only wish (And hope) is that Mr. Besson will make a sequel for this very kick-ass movie. Hopefully more character development at the sequel.

"mappman728","7","3","9","26 August 2014"," Lucid Lucy
","Highly watchable sci-fi/crime film with pretensions, which would make an intriguing double bill with ""Under the skin"". (Scarlet Johannseen uses her unearthly powers in a fairly negative way in ""Under the skin but puts them to more socially acceptable use - ie killing a lot of bad guys - in ""Lucy"".) The sci-fi elements are more interesting than the crime elements, the latter consisting of Korean(?) drug pushers using naive foreign tourists as mules. As is the nature of these gangs, they have an inexhaustible supply of men, guns and bullets, coupled with an ability to storm public buildings, gunning down everyone in sight at the drop of a hat. No match for Lucy's mind-bending skills, however... The film goes a little transcendental towards the end, but its journey into oblivion includes a sequence in which the heroine experiences Times Square going back into time, ultimately revealing its earlier life as a primeval swamp. Fascinating stuff."
"YJLcool","7","3","9","25 August 2014"," A thought-provoking, fun, entertaining sci-fi action film
","First and foremost, Lucy isn't exactly the typical sci-fi action film that you would expect. The film shares many similarities with Limitless, Watchmen, The Matrix, The Tree of Life, Her and Transcendence. The film has a slightly misleading neuroscience premise that's based on the age-old, silly '10% of brain' myth that most humans use only 10% (or less) of their brain capacity. In actual fact, humans use nearly 100% of their brains in various ways...with many parts of our brain are not accessed consciously but rather subconsciously most of the time. However, humans never actually use 100% of their cerebral capacity consciously at the same time.<br/><br/>The film is basically a story about a woman who is being forced to work as a drug mule manage to 'unlock' her entire brain capacity, consciously at the same time and gain exceedingly powerful physical and mental abilities after a packet of a newly-developed synthetic drug called ""CPH4"" breaks inside of her body. However, her body becomes highly unstable and starts to disintegrate due to the limitation of the human body and she needs more and more of the drug to sustain herself. The film asks thought-provoking 'what ifs' questions that are meaningful, provocative and worthy of our attention: What if the synaptic networks of our brain are so perfectly connected that we are capable of transmit more information at one time? What if we have access to all our motory functions, deepest memories and knowledge in fractions of a second? What if we are capable of using 100% of our cerebral capacity, consciously at the same time (all regions of the brain are pushed to the limits and we are able to control the subconscious regions of the brain)? Most importantly, what would happen if a person eventually gains complete control/mastery of elementary/subatomic particles that exist in the quantum realm?<br/><br/>The film gives some rather clear answers that may seem absurd, nonsensical or silly to many, but some of them actually makes perfect sense if you think about it carefully. However, it is true to say that the film borrowed a few scientific principles (the basics of quantum mechanics and brain functions) and embellished them a bit for entertainment purposes. At first, the person acquires various enhanced physical and mental capabilities: perfect marksmanship, extreme agility, instantaneous reflexes, fast absorption of knowledge, immunity to pain and fear...and subsequently, telepathy, telekinesis, the ability to interpret/decipher/control various electromagnetic waves, atemporal and able to perceive time in a non-linear perspective, clairvoyance, quantum teleportation across space-time continuum and matter or energy manipulation.<br/><br/>In short, the film is actually a mixture of facts and fiction. Some parts of the film do require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief from audiences as the writer/director has taken some creative liberties with its grand and rather ambitious sci-fi premise (Besson has admitted that this film is a lot more fiction than science). Although some of the main lead's abilities look downright silly and ludicrous, they're actually quite new and imaginative.<br/><br/>While all facts are not necessarily 'true'; some fiction are not entirely lies either. Just that the 'world' around us behaves like so, we tend to perceive it like so. This doesn't mean that in other parts of the Universe, the same rules apply. While some people might find it hard to understand, all things, including living beings, consist of matter which has mass and each of them occupy a space-time dimension. We are bounded by the laws of motion and gravity. We are our own observer as time is relative while we're moving through space-time. <br/><br/>Although the film's premise is not horrible or completely illogical, the execution is rather sloppy at places. The film shows the evolution of all living things on this planet by cutting in various shots of nature or Universe. Unfortunately, all these pieces just don't fit together nicely and seems rather out of place. There are numerous plot contrivances to allow characters to perform a certain action just to move the plot forward. There's no character development and backstory. The characters in the film don't have any significant emotional attachment to any other person on the screen.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings in characterization and plot, Scarlett Johansson managed to pull out a great performance to carry the film. Her panic shaking as she cries and begs for her life when she meets Mr.Jang for the first time or even when she wakes up after heavy sedation feels real and truly gives the feeling that she's in peril. Later on, when she is able to access her deepest memories and cry profusely during the phone conversation with her mum, it clearly shows her character's vulnerability. But as Lucy rapidly evolves, her lack of expression shows that she is gradually losing her emotions and humanity. It shows that she has truly become transcendent and no longer has any petty human concerns. On the other hand, Choi Min-sik done a great job as the merciless, frightening Korean drug kingpin, Mr.Jang. His presence on screen shows that he's not the man you would want to mess with. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't have much to do with his character other than delivering exposition for the audience to know more about the premise.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is by no means a terrible film, it's rather fast- paced, thought-provoking and entertaining. The purpose of science fiction is to seek answers for big important questions, to pique your interest or curiosity to further question, to find the truth and making sense of the world around us. This film succeeds in this aspect, despite its flaws. I believe that you'll appreciate this film more if you're willing to make an effort to take a step further to ponder and think, seek answers to extract the facts included in the film.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/08"

","Hard-core Luc Besson fans may be a little disappointed in not finding as much of his signature stylish mayhem as expected. Scarlett Johansson fans will not (be disappointed) because whatever she does, she invariably looks (and, even more so, sounds) sexy.<br/><br/>One critic goes as far as describing this movie as more art house than mainstream thriller. I wouldn't go so far. But there is such attempt at Sci-Fi that the action and violence sometimes do come across as an afterthought. The basic premise supporting the Sci-Fi seems sound: the vast untapped potentials of the human brain. But that is as far as it goes: basic. Don't try to probe any further or you are in for a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Johansson is always the best. Morgan Freeman has had such a proliferation of the kind of role as in this movie that he can do this one while sleepwalking. CHOI Min-sik is terrific as the villain which, unfortunately, is entirely inconsequential insofar as this movie goes."

The whole 'movie' is a confusing and spasm inducing sequence of animal clips and shameless tomb raiding of effects from any movie we know. She smashes cars into innocent people in the streets, kills a guy on the operation table and we are still supposed to believe it is all worth it because she is close to discovering the secret to existence .. which turns out to be scarlet vanishing into thin air and handing her radiant wise self over to the nutty professor in the form of a cheap 1 dollar 50 black plastic usb stick.

Obviously, Scarlett ends up in some kind of Asian ghettos, gets is ill treated and gets kicked in stomach, by accident some of the PH4 explodes within and she attains enlightenment and becomes the grandmother of neo to the extent that she can eat bullets instead of potato chips...HOLY CRAP!<br/><br/>Well you will get the rest...she goes on to find the bad guys so that she gets the rest of the PH4, without which she can't survive..but at the end she becomes immortal after building a Flash USB disk for Morgan Freeman to shove up somewhere!<br/><br/>When I got out of the theater, i had this headache that I never had in my life before....and I never suffered so badly after watching a movie...if you have spare time, do something else...if you have excess money, just save it for the next movie....AMEN"

And so was I disappointed? Not much but how could anyone have shown this idea differently than how it is in the movie. The movie is well paced, documenterish in a way. Now weren't you prepared to see that?? The director was able to mix the stories of Chinese drug gang and Lucy's slow transformation very well. Scarlett Johanson I guess has confirmed her place with this movie as a action character like Angelina Jolie.

","Lucy is a science fiction action movie directed by Luc Besson and stars Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked and Choi Min-Sik.<br/><br/>To be honest the plot of the movie is fresh and realistic but with some loopholes the movie disappoints.<br/><br/>The acting is good and Scarlett Johansson impresses in the role from a frightened drug mule to a super powered human being with extraordinary powers. Morgan Freeman is a legend and knows how to reprise his roles. Choi Min-Sik was marvellous in the role of a brutal drug lord. Amr Waked was also good.<br/><br/>The only problem was the execution and loopholes. Here are the few loopholes. Why the captors started kicking her stomach when they are aware that she is carrying a packet of drugs in her stomach, the drug is shown as very costly and vulnerable? Why did she go to a hospital to remove packet out of her stomach as in the previous scene she had removed a bullet from her body herself? If she was so keen to save the humanity by taking the possession of drugs why did she killed the patient on operation table? and why she shot an innocent taxi driver just because he can't speak English? From a brutal who is killing and shooting everyone to a humble and soft human in the end is something which was needed an explanation.<br/><br/>The movie would've been much better provided more attention were given on the development of a good plot rather focusing more on senseless action."

","The main problem with this film is its classification as Science-Fiction, because the science aspect is laughably awful. The myth of humans only using 10% of our available brain power was debunked a long time ago (although I can understand why it persisted given the terrible decisions most of us make on a regular basis).<br/><br/>That said, the film does have some plus points - production values are high and the acting is generally good. The first half in particular contains some scenes which generate genuine tension - it's not hard to imagine oneself in a situation (like Lucy) where your fate is completely determined by others and your life is of little concern.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the second half of the film is something of a mess, with action and special effects taking the limelight rather than the story or dialogue. It would have been nice to find out a little more about Lucy and how she came to be in this situation.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this film isn't terrible, but I think an opportunity was missed to create an interesting and compelling story.

Lucy (Scarlett) suddenly sees herself as a ""mule"" in a drug business; when the drug breaks free inside her body she undergoes a transcendent transformation, that is, she does not get ""high"", she does not get ""stoned"", she does not die from ""overdose"", she only ""trips a little"" and in due time manages to use all the functionalities of her brain up to 100%... to beat the crap out of the bad guys.

","The most stunning thing about this movie (aside from Scarlett Johansson) is the deep spiritual meaning that comes near the end. Yes, amid all the mayhem, the shoot 'em ups, the science impossible there is something very redeeming about this and it has to do with what it means to be alive and to be human.<br/><br/>What Lucy is able to do cannot possibly come about from taking substances into her system as in the movie. However the incredible power, knowledge and freedom she achieves is something that may be possible for humans some distant day--or rather possible for our intelligently designed descendants who will be cyborgs or something beyond that.<br/><br/>The story itself and the way French born director Luc Besson (""LÃ©on: The Professional,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" etc.) moves the plot along with action that keeps us enthralled amounts to a first rate sci fi thriller. Johansson who plays Lucy and whose countenance dominates the film is wonderful. And I don't mean merely from the fact that her face is mesmerizing but also because she does such a great acting job in a demanding role.<br/><br/>I am giving this film only 9 stars because of the rather lame idea that we use only ten percent of our brains. That idea was disposed of decades ago. Of course as a metaphor it works okay. However it could be better said that we are currently achieving only ten percent of what we could achieve.<br/><br/>I also don't think Besson, who also wrote the script for the film, has the right notion about time. He has Lucy say, ""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist."" However, time like other units of measure really just compares two or more things, in this case events. Many scientists believe that time per se does not exist and is an abstraction, or as I see it time is a mathematical point.<br/><br/>But much of the philosophy and/or psychology in the film is if nothing else interesting and worth thinking about. For example Lucy says, ""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale."" This is true in a practical sense but I believe it is also true in a philosophical and a spiritual sense.<br/><br/>I will be seeing this film again.<br/><br/>--Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is"""

","Difficult one to call, this. On the one hand, the science is absolute nonsense, but it manages (just) to keep your interest to the end. I can't say I was sad when the end came, more relieved.<br/><br/>The worst thing about Lucy is that it takes itself entirely too seriously for a film with this much nonsense in it. I will happily ignore all kinds of BS if the movie is entertaining or pokes fun at itself, or does something clever with the silliness. Lucy does none of those things.<br/><br/>Instead, it tries to be a bit preachy with its humans and nature are intertwined, we only use 10 percent of our brains, blah blah blah stupidity. As a result, it comes across as too up itself.<br/><br/>It's a shame really, because there was a good concept in the story that just wasn't done justice to by the film.<br/><br/>My major issue was with the sudden onset of superpowers all tied to the increase in Lucy using her brain more. Why? How? It basically is saying that, if we learn to use our whole brain capacity, we will become gods! Which of course ignores the fact that we are still evolving and, presumably, our brains will increase in size and capacity over time. So what is special about the human brain at the precise instant in time that Lucy takes place? The answer, of course, is nothing. It's just a conceit of the storyteller to think that humans are special and that all we lack is the ability to use all of our brain in order to become masters of everything.<br/><br/>Lucy walks a very unsteady line between science and magic, if I'm honest, with things happening... because!... and with little attention to consistency.<br/><br/>Lucy herself apparently turns into a soulless automaton as the result of her ""evolution"" (yes, the quotes are deliberate there), making you wonder why anyone would want such an ability in the first place. She kills, she maims, she shows no regard for anybody's life. Yet we are supposed to cheer her on? It is all nonsense and has been done better in a number of other movies already. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Besson butchered this. It probably would have been better in the hands of Michael Bay! All in all, not worth the time unless you like frowning at the screen and saying ""Why?"" a lot, interspersed with plentiful numbers of confused glances with your neighbours at the inconsistency of it.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Utter nonsense trying to be clever.

","'Lucy' is at best a stylish fast paced thriller, well made and brilliantly led by Scarlett Johannson. At worst it is an over the top movie based on a single concept that runs out of ideas and falls down. The truth of this movie is somewhere in between. Lucy has a great opening, with a woman forced to transport a rare drug in her stomach by the menacing Min-sik Choi 'Oldboy'. What happens after that is quite amazing however the plot is too short for a feature length movie so the last half an hour seems to lose track of anything remotely feasible and this spoils the whole feel of the movie. Its a shame really because for the most part this film is a good thriller but even sci-fi films have to remain convincing to be effective, no-one expects a realistic movie with science fiction but it needs to be intelligent.

Either that or the movie was rushed, no focus though. All this while taking itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>But lets not forget the weird moments such as leaving the bad guy alone, two times (Leaving him for dead once with two knifes in his hands, and the other time while he's 30 feet away from you at the airport, seriously? You can feel everything but can't see or feel an angry person 30 feet away from you that wants you dead? Fine, whatever...), making it possible for him to hurt the people around you and possibly causing your ""goal"" to be stopped. Whatever it might be, besides doing the remaining drugs and downloading every bit of information. Which is presented like in the last 25 minutes, yeah... And other than that, how would every bit of information fit on a USB? And wouldn't the ""modern"" computers crash due to the sheer amount of information that it would hold? I don't know, and I also don't know why this film has such great reviews (To each his own) but I don't like it. I find it to be allover the place and too silly while the intent seem to be serious.<br/><br/>But hey, the effects are cool. And Scarlett Johansson is in it, but it doesn't save the movie for my part. So... Yeah, nothing else.<br/><br/>Bye..."

","This comic book story of a movie was a terrible disappointment. The plot line was entirely predictable. The characters didn't get any chance to develop. Scarlett Johanssen didn't even get a chance to show her redeeming features. There are many aspects of the film that are just nonsensical, like the fact that the bad guys live in Taipei but are all Korean, or the idea that this drug is intended to be sold, presumably for human use, yet evidently nobody has ever really tested it before.<br/><br/>The lack of interesting characters and plot might have been tolerable if the science had at least been interesting. From the outset the movie is based on a stupid and false premise (We only use 10% of our brains). The classroom scene where students were asking questions had less intelligent dialog than a porn movie. The main role of the scientists was to stand around dumbfounded at the end, as Lucy achieves 100% use of her brain and, of course, downloads it into a USB key. <br/><br/>I apologize for the spoilers, but they may save you from wasting two hours of your life."

The film is action-packed, races like a rabbit, and is frequently intentionally quite funny. Like many of his films, it features a strong female protagonist, another plus.<br/><br/>My one reservation comes from an apparent continuity laps. As one point, something is happening to Lucy in the restroom of an airborne commercial jet; then, suddenly, she's on the ground surrounded by people in a room far away from the plane (I'm trying to keep this vague). What happened when the rest room door opened? How did she wind up where she did? It's almost like a reel (well, a short reel) of film was missing in the film I saw.

Not only does this movie delve into the BS that is 'humans only use 10% of their brains' garbage, the movie gives Lucy outlandish god-like powers when she moves above 10%. How does having a higher brain capacity allow one to defy gravity, gain telekinesis, understand Chinese instantly without once studying it, able to see a person's plane ticket and hence where they are going without having personally seen it even for a second, change their form at will, search out and listen to phone cells without a device from which to hear it, and move to any point in time? All this wouldn't have been so bad had the movie went for a kind of fantasy theme, but it tries to give itself scientific credibility which only makes the movie more ridiculous.<br/><br/>My other issue with this movie is the conflict Lucy has with the bad guys. How on earth are normal men suppose to take out a god when she can destroy them with a simple thought? There is no tension in this movie. It's all gone when that happens. The bad guys are simply fodder for her. This movie would've been better had they explored deeper into the concept of Lucy struggling with losing her humanity, in fact, you could've made the whole movie about that concept and it would've been way, way, way better, but nope, it wanted to be an action film with pseudo- science, and a dash of philosophy.<br/><br/>I respect Luc Besson as a movie maker. I especially loved Leon: The Professional, and Danny the Dog, but this movie was terrible. I'll give this three stars only because the beginning was engaging but as soon as Lucy started to defy gravity and roll up the walls in her jail cell I was instantly turned off. It defies scientific logic and it loses all its tension. If you want to see a movie about the same concept than watch Limitless, which is much better."

","Lucy has an experimental drug surgically inserted into her abdomen (against her will) by an oriental gang which wants to use her as a drugs mule. The bag leaks its contents into her which stimulates changes whereby she can increase the capacity of her brain to 100% from the 10% which is the normal maximum from humans. This gives her increasing control over her own body, other people, matter, energy and all sorts. But a clock is ticking, and the drug lord wants revenge...<br/><br/>This is essentially a superhero origin movie, in which Scarlett Johansson plays a character who goes through some serious changes, giving her a wide range to play (which she does very well). There is some fun action, sprinkled with decent effects, and enough storyline to hold your interest until the end.<br/><br/>There are also some major flaws, and these may be dealbreakers. They include, but are not limited to: <br/><br/>The 10% of our brains thing. One, it isn't true and, two, the way it is presented in the film makes it clear it isn't true, and the fact that such nonsense is delivered in expository chunks by ""foremost world expert"" Morgan Freeman to a symposium makes this even more laughable. Freeman is there because his ""elder statesman"" persona adds gravitas and, therefore, spurious credibility, as does the symposium setting, but it is all too obvious that this element is there to provide the audience with a) an information dump for the rules the plot is playing by, and b) a ticking clock.<br/><br/>Lucy's changes give her control over her body. We are told this, and we see her doing it. So how come the changes will kill her? Given that she has control of her body on a molecular level, why can't she modify the apparently fatal changes? <br/><br/>Given how ready she is to kill the gangsters who got her into this, why does she spare the gang boss, thus giving him the opportunity to come after her later on? <br/><br/>How come her abilities don't enable her to take action near the end, thus saving many lives?<br/><br/>Having mentioned the flaws, I have to go on to say that I enjoyed the film, I loved Johansson's performance, and I was greatly taken with an audacious, unexpected, but fitting ending."
"TheSquiss","7","3","10","28 August 2014"," A whimsy built on a fallacy. Exciting, but conveniently wrapped up.
","It's been a while since Luc Besson really excited me. I'm going to say 1994, with the sublime Léon. His most recent outings as writer (3 Days to Kill) and director (The Family) have been dull thuds that threatened to overshadow the resounding successes of his hit-man triumph and the likes of Subway and The Big Blue. Twenty years is a long time to wait for something worth celebrating, but finally we have Lucy to admire.<br/><br/>Let's not get too excited, though. Lucy is a curio, an enjoyable return to form from the French auteur (a contentious mantle and one worthy of debate another time), but is a long way from being a classic, despite a solid, central performance from Scarlett Johansson in the title role.<br/><br/>When Lucy is forced to deliver a briefcase to the violent criminal kingpin Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), she winds up with a bag full of a new synthetic drug sewn into her belly. Before she can complete the delivery, the bag bursts and the drug infects her, unlocking the unused 90% of her brain and transforming her into an acutely aware, brilliant superhuman with warrior-like powers and a drastically reduced shelf life on this earth.<br/><br/>At this juncture we should perhaps take a momentary step back into reality. Lucy is a whimsy built on a fallacy. We don't use a mere 10% of our brain. We use all of it (although a look at some people around here does bring that accepted 'fact' into question) but understand perhaps 10% of the brain's workings. And while we're at it, if you cut a worm in half, you don't get two worms, you end up with a dead worm in two parts. Deal with it! <br/><br/>However, facts can get in the way of a good story and so Besson dispenses with them from the outset, not that I have any particular issues with that. For the most part, Lucy is exciting and a thoroughly enjoyable romp. There are plot holes aplenty but Besson bats them away with aplomb, and concentrates on the thrills and the race against time. This is Limitless meets Transcendence with a serious armoury thrown in for good measure. There is much to enjoy as we watch Lucy evolving physically, mentally and emotionally before us, becoming ever more resourceful and violent as she seeks out Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), the authority on the mind and brain function, for help and to impart her knowledge to him.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, though a comforting presence, is unremarkable, playing essentially the same role as he did in Transcendence. His Professor Norman is virtually indistinguishable from his Joseph Tagger and the impression he gives is of a man coasting in his dotage. His performance doesn't in any way detract from Lucy, it just doesn't enhance it.<br/><br/>The presence of the hominid Lucy is awful, however. Didn't Besson think about looking at the make up and CGI created for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or even the Lord of the Rings trilogy? Awful, just awful. And the confusion of travelling through space first and then time is clumsy and implies he is uncertain of his historical chronology and geography.<br/><br/>The principal failing of Lucy is its culmination, which of is largely unsatisfying though hardly surprising. Lucy sets out with high ideals of uniqueness, boldness and enlightenment but is unable to be truly original and has to settle for a rearrangement of old ideas. That isn't entirely the fault of Luc Besson as we must shoulder some of the responsibility. We are creatures of limited comprehension, we cannot truly fathom the infinity of the universe (something has to contain it, surely) and this, Lucy, is no different. We have a need to box things up to understand them and by doing so Besson immediately limits it.<br/><br/>'It', the expansiveness of intelligence and our potential, becomes something tangible for us to scrutinize. Professor Norman states early on that he doesn't know what would happen if we ever harnessed the entirety of our brain capacity. He can only hypothesize; the rest is a mystery. Besson, however, attempts to explain and portray it for us. The bolder move would have been stop short of an explanation, to perhaps watch Lucy's brainpower percentage rise and to fill the screen and auditorium with white noise until the credits cut in, leaving us puzzled, confused, befuddled, just as Professor Norman is, but I suspect Besson feared the cries of outrage from audiences and critics and instead he gives us a convenient, comprehensible resolution.<br/><br/>Lucy needed a visionary at the helm. Whilst Besson is imaginative and delivers a rollicking good ride (on a good day), he lacks the courage to create something truly unique and astounding.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","This movie is another one of johansons interesting recent roles. In these roles she plays a variety of quite bizarre characters, and plays them well. She has matured in her acting ability, and it is great to see a female actor picking both interesting roles and playing in them something other than a mindless heroine, or sex object/romantic partner. The character she plays is interesting as a mix of sensibilities. <br/><br/>This movie is part thriller, part action, part sci-fi, and part philosophical. It has a reasonably artistic style, its philosophy is a little waffley, but still profound, the science is not always accurate, and some of the concepts require _an imagination_ or at least the belief that we do not no everything there is to know with certainty.<br/><br/>But ignoring all that, to sum - it is a fun ride, affecting moments, has stylistic charm, some interesting acting, some fun action, and raises some interesting concepts. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and recommend it - but only if you can a) think and b) come into it without hyper criticism/cynicism - in other words, be open to the experience. <br/><br/>Its a European produced film for American audiences, and this makes it less full of culturally centric ideas, and social stereotypes than it would have been if it was American only which serves as another little bonus."

","A woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. <br/><br/>Lucy is directed by Luc Besson and is starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman. At first sight this film could appear to look like Limitless, which is quite similar. This time again Luc Besson works his magic on a beautiful woman with her gun (Nikita, The Fifth Element, etc.). Scarjo is pretty good at that in the movie, as she quickly turns into a bad ass killer in the first act. Morgan Freeman's character is not that interesting, he has pretty much the same part as in Transcendence except that the film itself is better than Transcendence. Mr Jang starring Min-sik Choi is nothing more than an evil guy, killing people in cold blood, we don't really know more about him. However the movie is looking good, it is very well edited. There's a cool car chasing action scene, several very natural and fluid action scenes as well. I have a divided opinion on this film as on the one hand Lucy has some conventional action movie themes and on the other hand some too unconventional parts; it's dealing with smart things in a dumb way. It's like Luc Besson wanted to make cool things happen in a movie and he did it, but I don't really care about the plot and characters and where the story is going. We can't really like Lucy or relate to her as she doesn't encounter threatening situations, as she can access 100% of her brain capacity she becomes nearly invincible and as a protagonist nothing properly challenges her. It's entertaining but there's no tension as in an actual action movie.<br/><br/>Overall Lucy looks good, there are great action sequences despite the fact that tension really isn't there it's entertaining if you're just seeking that. Prepare yourself; it's different and a little bit more ambitious that you may have thought it to be just by watching the trailer."
"The-Sarkologist","7","3","10","5 August 2014"," I think this film is a little confused, but it is fun anyway.
","If I were to describe this film in a single sentence it would be that it is either a philosophical treatise masquerading as an action movie, or it is an action movie masquerading as a philosophical treatise, but which I am cannot sure. In a way part of it appeared to be little more than a documentary with some action scenes thrown in, and while the concept was good, I found the execution to pretty much flop. Look, it was not that it was a bad film (I still gave it a seven because I did enjoy it), but it feels that Besson's great films (Fifth Element, the Professional) are long behind him.<br/><br/>This is a film about evolution, and in particular human evolution, but the idea that is explored is what is needed to spark then next evolutionary development, and what is it that is holding us back. My immediate response would be that if it took millions of years for things to evolve to where they are now, then it is unlikely that there is going to be any huge spurts in our lifetime. That theory suggests that things change very, very gradually, and as such we are unlikely to see, or experience, any significant changes.<br/><br/>However there is another theory that seems to be espoused here, and that is that evolution occurs when outside forces interplay. That is that creatures tend not to evolve, or change, simply due to time but rather due to the effects of, say, changes in climate. We can see this with diseases because a disease that may ravage one generation may have no effect upon the next generation, which means that for the disease to take effect it must mutate to overcome the resistance of the second generation. We might develop a drug that kills a certain disease, however overuse of the drug will cause the disease to mutate and change and become resistant to this drug.<br/><br/>This film is about a young lady who gets caught up in a rather vicious drug cartel operating out of Taiwan. The thing is that this cartel has developed a new drug which they wish to export to the western countries and to do this they cut the drug mules open and place the bags into their stomachs. However, one of the cartel's thugs decided to beat our heroine up because she won't play ball with him, which causes the drugs in her stomach to spill out. This results in her having a rather strange reaction: she develops psychic powers. For some reason she ends up connecting this change in here with the theories of some university lecturer and tries to find him to tell him what is happening to her and also so that she can pass a heap of knowledge onto him because, well, she doesn't have all that much time to live.<br/><br/>The interesting thing that I found about this movie was the idea of why we are not evolving, and the suggestion is that the reason we are not evolving is because we are simply too caught up with external pleasures, such as wealth and power. We don't necessarily want to better ourselves mentally or intellectually, but rather financially and luxuriously. Also, the very people that could work to advance us as a species, the academics, simply do not want to rule, which leaves us with greedy morons who are only seeking to better their own position at the expense of everybody else."
"Troy_Campbell","8","3","10","1 August 2014"," Surprisingly entertaining and even thought-provoking.
","Less an action sci-fi like the promotional material suggested, and more a cerebral thriller with some kickass scenes thrown in, Luc Besson's movie is surprisingly entertaining and, dare I say it, even thought provoking. The central premise revolves around Scarlett Johannson's put upon drug smuggler, who, after accidentally receiving a large dose of the product, has the ability to unlock parts of the brain previously untapped by humans. The dubious science behind the concept aside, the story progresses in a smart and intriguing manner (if not subtle in its underlying message) all the way to the ambitious denouement, which will have you either scoffing or, like me, completely enthralled. There are also a handful of exceptionally designed action sequences that keep the blood pumping; an early gun-tastic showdown in a hotel with a mirroring, gun-less confrontation in a hospital later on provide a couple of noteworthy examples. The so-hot-right-now ScarJo is fine in the lead role and Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman like nobody else (even when phoning it in), however it is the quietly impactful Min-sik Choi (Oldboy) who shines brightest as the drug kingpin looking for revenge. It has been a long time since the French director scored a hit (The Fifth Element back in 1997), but Lucy has everything necessary to snap that losing streak."

At any rate, in this very creative version of a 'drug deal gone bad' she winds up exposed to a new illicit agent that is being set up as the new 'it' drug to take over hipster-world; however, she is exposed to a mega dose and that has her mental capacities increased ten-fold. In her new, enlarging brain capacity state (it shows her capacities at various stages of increased percentages of neural function) she is capable of feats any super hero would envy. It's just fun to watch.<br/><br/>But please do not expect a biology lesson from Morgan Freeman, who is again brought back in his recurring Hollywood role as The Smartest, Wisest Man on Planet Earth (only his names change) who is a major neuroscientist here with theories that are pure dreck . At any rate, he is given so much bad biology to recite that I winced several times ('we only use 10% of our brain capacity; dolphins use more than humans; cells have two choices: become immortal or divide').

In addition to this, the way Lucy is portrayed in the movie is probably not very accurate.<br/><br/>1) Because Lucy is using a large portion of her brain a lot, she needs lots of energy.

I haven't seen any ice packs on her forehead in the trailers.<br/><br/>3) She would probably need an IV (for fluids and nutrients) and a catheter to maintain her on-the-go, demi-god lifestyle (in addition to a feeding tube). <br/><br/>I'm sure there are lots of other issues with this movie. Personally, I want nothing to do with a movie that insults my intelligence and the audience's intelligence."

","Lucy is a movie about a young woman who, through a series of unfortunate events, is able to access the dormant parts of her mind. She is able to go above and beyond the limits set by nature and discovers knowledge never before imagined by mankind. Her plight is to find a new purpose for herself, and discover what she is suppose to with her new found knowledge. <br/><br/>The film is fast paced with small action sequences throughout, which Luc Besson places strategically throughout the film in order to keep the audience entertained and engaged in the actual purpose of the film, which is the examination of the human condition and, subsequently, life. It bounces back and forth between discussing and analyzing life itself, and interpreting the meaning of life for individuals. Science, philosophy, an a bit of buried theology combine for a truly thought provoking experience if one is willing to leave their preconceptions behind when watching.<br/><br/>Much of the beauty of this film is found intellectually, with little more than average ratings in most cinematic areas such as acting, screenplay, effects, etc... That's not to say those area's were done poorly by any means, as that is not even close to the truth; simply that there was nothing truly exceptional about them.<br/><br/>Either way, whether you dig into the intellectual aspects of this film or not, with a beautiful lead, gunfights, fast car scenes, and an international drug ring to top it off, there's plenty in this movie to keep you thoroughly entertained."

","I think the film Lucy had some great concepts about the human mind, time, meaning of life, etc. However, it is my opinion that these concepts were not made clear to the viewer and not fleshed out as well as they could have been. Maybe I am just too stupid to see the undertones and implications of the writer, but the last third of the movie left me unsatisfied and confused. I did find the CGI and special effects entertaining but much of them were unneeded and seemed more as filler. Towards the end there is a big CGI sequence that I feel the director was trying to use to explain an important concept, but did not seem very clear. Additionally, the characters were terrible. There was no development of any characters, other than Lucy's mathematical progression. As a lover of action and science fiction films, Lucy left me dissatisfied. <br/><br/>I would not view it a second time."

What it really means is, you can only access 10% AT A TIME. You have 100% access to your brain altogether, but you can't access all 100% because your brain is actually quite fragile and wouldn't be able to handle 100% of it being used. The only evidence of close to 100% of it being used is during a seizure, because, as I said, your brain cannot handle that much usage at once. Therefore, the whole movie just has this huge plot hole in it that makes it totally unbelievably stupid. I was severely disappointed when I saw it. I thought it looked good from advertisements, but when I actually saw it, I was completely disappointed. Don't waste your money, folks."
"akshay-ak-kumar","7","3","11","3 August 2014"," Johansson Rocks in this visually spectacular film !!
","I was never a Luc Besson fan. However, he is a director who made some visually breath taking films such as The Fifth Element and Leon. If you think Lucy is an action film then beware its more of a sci-fi film with heavy scenes.<br/><br/>Lucy starts off well. Its slow initially and as I watched the film, it got a creepy feeling in me. But when Lucy starts harnessing her brain as the trailer shows, Besson makes it a visual spectacle. His interpretation of the subject is brilliant and he uses less of CGI to show his mastery. I loved the scene where Lucy goes to meet Mr.Jang. Jang is listening to opera and Lucy is killing his men.<br/><br/>Even the character of Lucy is interesting. Once she begins harnessing her brain, she becomes into a superhuman with some extraordinary powers but never a superhero. She is somebody seeking answers and not interested in providing solutions.<br/><br/>And, that brings me to Scarlett Johansson. I think no actress would bring justice to Lucy's character what she does. She is brilliant in each scene; 1st as the victim and then as a person seeking answers. There are two scenes that stand out; one where is speaking to her mother and the other in the plane where she gets an attack.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does well. Freeman is sidelined in this film by Johansson while Choi is superb as the Korean drug lord.<br/><br/>What doesn't work in Lucy is the last 15 mins. It left me confused and there was too much to think and absorb. Also, there is a some unnecessary blood shed.<br/><br/>If you forget the last 15 mins and don't think much about the plot and scientific reasoning, then Lucy is must watch for sci-fi lovers."

","Lets say i love sci fy and i love fantasy and i love action movies.and im quite capable to suspend disbelief in most movies.
i watch superhero movies i watch space operas.. and when you watch such movies you know this is beyond real life possibilities therefore you can suspend disbelief and enjoy the movies.
this movie however fals into the science category so you as a viewer tend to check the things shown and said of to what you know is known and real in science.
ive seen a movie like this before that i could enjoy and was quite similar even if it also does not check with science.
that movie is limitless.
the premis we only use 10% of our brain is an old one that just wont die but not based on what science says.
however if that is the only thing thats unrealistic i and many others can suspend disbelief and accept it for this movie.
once you do that anything showing immense mental capabilities can also be accepted .
so i loved limitless.
this movie however goes beyond so many things its laughable.
take limitless and throw in . telekineses,telepathy deffying gravity,projecting images on tv screens straight from toughts, changing hair color legnth and shape, hell flying apart into could of dust and reassembling.seeing through walls ground doors. watching lines coming out of cellphones that are supposed to be the cellulalr wirells data lines?? and touching it with fingers and reading it ???
while this is not a mary sue movie. wehre the hero has not gone though growth and hardship before becomeing powerfull. this movie does have links to mary sue writing.
reality , nature and scientific laws are bend for her to succeed.
anything is possible to further the plot.
basicly she turns into a godlike being that transcends all physical laws of this universe.
so here i am watching this movie , and i find it a ridiculous version of limitless.
for the role given scarlet johanson acted well.
the script , well lets just say the forst part wass amazing. up untill the part the drug changed her and she was rolling on the ceiling.
i will watch thif to the end because im just 60% through and i always finish what i start. but lets just say my eyes are rolling so much and sighing through this one its torturous. .
if you haven seen limitless yet. and also this one not yet. and need to choose. then choose limitless.
you will be able to suspend disbelief for real and enjoy."

","Awww... I just LOVE Scarlett, but why oh why did she ever sign the contract to appear in this pile of nonsense? What a waste! I really don't know where to start. The movie is just stupid from the very first moment they say we humans use only 10% of our brain, a myth debunked many years ago, and this is stated right at the beginning (the whole movie is based on that premise) so we start the movie with the left foot.<br/><br/>However, the first scene is quite promising with great suspense and terror: Scarlett is kidnapped and forced to work for these drug mobsters as a mule. Then a moment later, when you see her in convulsions crawling on walls and ceiling as she was a girl from an Asian horror movie you know there is something wrong there. All goes downhill from that scene on.<br/><br/>I don't know why I kept watching, maybe just because I love that woman. Anyway she does not look that good here and her character is so empty and inhuman you just don't give a damn about her after a while. She kills lots of innocent people just because they don't speak her language, or because she needs a surgery, or because she is being late. And on the other hand she doesn't kill the mobsters who put her into this mess. WTF is that? Oh and while killing all those people she was supposed to get smarter! What kind of message is that? You get smarter, you kill people for no reason? Almost at the end Morgan Freeman's character says ""I am not sure if humanity is prepared for this."" Frigging A! Of course, we are not prepared, that woman is the proof! If you use more than 10% of your brain you will become a ruthless killing cyborg, not a human being! In fact, after she receives the ""knowledge"" she even starts speaking emotionless as the Terminatrix from T3. <br/><br/>The movie has lots of plot holes with ridiculous scenes, gratuitous violence, etc. It's so over the top that it's boring. At some point I thought I was watching a Japanese Anime with live actors, a parody or something, but the movie actually is meant to be taken seriously! All of a sudden being intelligent makes you able to morph, time travel using swipe moves in the air like John Anderton did in Minority Report and see ""The Matrix"" everywhere as Neo once did?<br/><br/>I am so sorry about this movie and I can't believe it was made by the same guy who made Leon and Nikita.

He is quickly liquidated and the woman endures all sorts of torture by her Asian captives as drugs are implanted in her stomach. She also assumes tremendous intellectual power and also becomes a female Rambo in trying to extract revenge on those who implanted the drug at her.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, Morgan Freeman lectures regarding cell development and the brain. In her travels, Scarlett eventually meets the good professor to show him the power of the drug and the ""brilliant"" effects it has placed on her.<br/><br/>This is rather inane and a better name for this film would have been ""The Terminal Lady.""

The plot is nice and catchy and the script is full of surprises and theories ... it is a full sci-fi indeed but with a little taste of Morgan Freeman's Wormhole added the element of ""could it really be !!"" question and let's be honest .. always hearing his voice narrating make me feel chill and concentrated in the same time :D<br/><br/>As for the cast , well.. Scarlett Johansson is good , yeah i never liked her but to be fair she's an awesome actress, at the beginning of the movie i had problem connecting with her acting scared ,, like i didn't really feel she was scared of the Chinese gang but her performance popped right up when she(lucy)took the drug ,,, As for Morgan Freeman his performance is spotless, and being there made the movie more appealing and believable in a way <<< the others like Min-sik Choi, Amr Waked and the rest they were all fine.<br/><br/>Overall,, the movie is full of thrill and action ,, makes you ask many question if the idea of taking amounts of CPH4(if it is a real compound << didn't google it yet) could make the body and the mind act out the way we saw ,, but again they went back to idea of ""time is of the essence"" and time is the controller of how our life works >> after all it is a considerably short movie so i hoe you guys enjoy it ."

","There are a few nicely done scenes, that is why I give it 4. It is not the worst movie, but surely not the best science fiction movie I have seen.<br/><br/>But the story is thin - before any basis is done, we jump directly into a drug gang, lots of violence, with absolutely no points.<br/><br/>The only funny part, is when Lucy is emotionless and make comment to her room mate that the person she ask to is dead, and she means it literate, however roommate think he is exhausted from sex. That is the only funny comment in the whole movie - or maybe it is supposed to be funny when Lucy enter the room where the professor is, just as he talk to her on the phone? Violence, just pointless. In the start it is logical, as the drug gang is just like that, but as soon as Lucy can control more than one person mind at the same time, and DO stop the gang once in Taiwan and secondly in France, she doesn't do it permanent and fail to do it a third time, though it would have been much easier and safer than anything else she did.<br/><br/>OK, the extremely bad violent scene at the end, had to be there, because the head of the drug gang had his hands ruined by Lucy and he was mad at her. Clearly, he had to chase her all the way from Asia to France, just to get revenge, by attempting to get the drug back and shoot her.<br/><br/>The last scene where Lucy see the history of human kind, the universe, etc and make an USB stick - boring. And I do not see any logical followup to the story."

","I am no science expert. I really am not. The extent of my scientific career thus far involved my internship at the U of A's chemistry lab. But even I know that nothing in this movie makes sense. The main argument against this viewpoint is that the movie is ""supposed to be fun, not realistic"". To that I will first say, thank the lord, because even its central premise (the idea that humans use only 10% of their brains) is a complete myth. But its inaccuracy is not (only) what made it a bad movie. There is no plot. The entire plot can be summed up in- Hot girl gets a drug, hot girl gets smart (an inaccuracy in of itself), Chinese gangsters try to kill her. Not only his, but the entire film discusses how dumb and oblivious we are, and how the filmmakers are smarter than us, even though there's a scientific inaccuracy EVERY TWO MINUTES! None of the actors are all that great, Johansen is there to be a pretty face, Morgan Freeman is there for a paycheck, and everyone else is just not noteworthy. The best part of this movie was laughing at when a character said, ""The world's first woman was named Lucy"", even though there is no concrete definition of a woman, ""Lucy"" was not a human nor the first hominid, instead one of the earliest discovered ones, and she was not named Lucy until she was discovered, because of a song playing while she was discovered (Lucy in the sky with diamonds). The only way this movie could be good is if it is viewed as a ""so bad its good"" flick. Oh, and the cinematography is slick at times. neither of those factors were any where new enough to redeem this movie."

I thought Lucy was so good for the first hour and ten minutes. I was really shocked that the overall product could be this good.

"MUFCOK","3","2","6","11 February 2015"," Not a bad idea but poorly executed with hollow characters
","What would happen if we were able to use 100% of our full brains capacity? Well according to the movie Lucy we would turn into some sort of Jedi Master who can read minds, control objects and human bodies with the mind, suffer bullet wounds with no pain or weakness and eventually turn ourselves into some sort of spiritual being. We would lose all emotion and empathy; we would walk around aimlessly in a robotic, mindless manner and only be able to communicate using awful punchlines and mundane one word answers.<br/><br/>Lucy is a student living in Taiwan, she meets a man in a nightclub, dates for a week and is then tricked into delivering a mystery briefcase to a man named Mr Jang. Inside the briefcase is a new illegal drug that they want to get into the big European countries, the drug is designed to enhance the users brain capacity in order to develop mental and physical strength. Lucy and several others are then knocked out and operated on, a pouch of this new drug is then inserted into their lower stomach in order for them to transport it via aeroplane. Then came the point in which the story took a massive nose dive into a complete train wreck of a movie. When Lucy awakes she is informed of what is happening and is transported somewhere unnamed where she is beat up and repeatedly kicked in the stomach. This results in the pouch splitting and the drug being released into Lucy's bloodstream. What follows can only be described as one of the most ridiculous concepts and poorly executed stories I have seen. Lucy begins crawling on the walls and ceiling, has inhuman strengths and can read minds. As her brain capacity grows so do her powers.<br/><br/>Lucy isn't a superhero movie and it isn't trying to be but it feels like one but without a hero, its scientific side which it drums down the viewer's throat seems laughable and embarrassingly corny. It is impossible to connect with any of the characters, Scarlett Johansson starts well but then once the drugs kick in she turns into a robotic, dull, mundane shell of a human that merely walks around giving one word answers and really cheesy poorly delivered one liners. Morgan Freeman has wasted his time and effort on this movie, he has a backseat role and does his usual Morgan role of talking slowly and intelligently, which suits me fine if the movie is even half decent. <br/><br/>The whole movie just feels completely pointless, there is no character depth or development, you care for neither and have no back story to any of them. There are some huge plot holes which it seems the creators literally could not be bothered to fill and the meaning behind the story which they are trying to deliver is pointless and pretentious. The movie has no aim, the ending is awful and even as you are approaching the end of the movie nothing is building, there is no suspense or interest in what is going to happen.<br/><br/>To summarise, Lucy starts quite well, it's mysterious and looks very good visually. But the more you watch the worse it gets, things keep happening and when they do you question it all. It all feels pointless and half finished. I don't think the idea is actually that bad and I think they really could have created something decent with it but it was far too poorly executed.<br/><br/>First Half = OK. Second Half = Appalling.<br/><br/>The only credible factor about the second half of this movie is the special effects. Some of the effects look fantastic, a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows. That is honestly the only positive I have for this movie, well that and the short run time of 80 minutes.<br/><br/>3/10"

","It's hard to believe that i'm reviewing this film in February, considering how excited I was to see this film. I would have guaranteed that I would have seen it in theatres. The trailer came out almost a year ago and it instantly became one of my most anticipated for the summer. It's Scarlett Johansson in a Science Fiction based action film, what can go wrong? Especially with the writer director from Leon: The Professional and Taken? It had so many good things going for it, but sadly it was poorly executed.<br/><br/>Johansson still had a great 2014 with The Winter Solider and Under The Skin, and she sure earned a lot of money from Lucy. But I think she has to regret how Lucy turned out. It tells the story of a random girl who gets a drug injected into her stomach, in turn allowing her to access her entire brain. Now I have heard from multiple people that we as humans in fact use much more than 10 percent of our brain. Apparently it's actually close to 100 percent. Even putting this aside the movie is garbage. There is absolutely no depth to these characters. None of the supporting characters are given material for us to care about. Even in Lucy's case, the only glimpse of depth was a short phone call to her mother. I guess I'm just not the audience for Artificial Intelligence films. Transcendence, A.I., and now Lucy. Here's hoping that Chappie can right that ship.<br/><br/>The film also uses several strange cuts to animals reproducing and other tasks. But it's not like it's in an intelligent and ambitious way, because the cuts stop 15 minutes into the film. We don't get any sense of why they chose to perform this procedure on Scarlett or any back-story with this drug or the people behind this deal. It's a really dull film that is saved by Scarlett Johansson's solid performance and some surreal special effects. It was enough to make the film watchable for 90 minutes but I cant see that being the case for any longer. It tries to be much more ambitious and smart than it actually is. I would much rather have seen a revenge type story with Scarlett going after the gangsters, much like a Taken style film. With a better back-story with Lucy and the supporting characters.<br/><br/>+Scarlett <br/><br/>+Special effects & concept <br/><br/>-Strange cuts <br/><br/>-No character depth<br/><br/>-No back-story of the drug <br/><br/>-No likable characters <br/><br/>4.5/10"

It left it open ended so it could have a real ending and actually explain WTF happened. I hope Analeigh Tipton would return for it. My final review is that : it could've been much better, but could have been worse too. I would recommend it for a rental, don't buy it though. It's not that worth it.

This was much better then Transcendence but there was still something lacking to make it totally gripping and exciting. It is very much worth seeing though but temper your expectations.

","I usually only watch movies with an IMDb rating > 7 and initially skipped this one. But then 2 friends gave it two thumbs up and I decided to watch it. Very glad I did. It does remind you a bit of Limitless, but it is still packed with unique action and suspense. The pros are the great cast of actors, Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi. The cons are that writer/director Luc Besson tries to do too much on his own. I'd prefer a different director/producer/screen writer altogether. Most people complain that the end of the movie is a let down, a bit of an amateur ending in every way. One expects a similar ending to what it is, but it could definitely have been done a whole lot better from a sci-fi point-of-view as well as a production point-of-view. It's as if they ran out of money by 10 minutes before the end. Still worth a solid 7 out of 10."

","I really liked the original idea behind movie this and liked how the Korean mafia intertwined into the film's plot. However, they take the interesting concept of enhanced brain power to a ridiculous level that insults the brain power of anyone watching the film. Anyone with even a secondary school understanding of basic scientific concepts will find this just excruciating to watch. It's like the film was written by some 'creative' who watched a couple of TED talks on evolution and then decided to plug the gaps in their knowledge with made-up stuff. What starts off as an interesting science-based plot quickly turns into a X-Men film with Lucy having farcical super powers.<br/><br/>What was really annoying, and just lazy film making, was how Lucy went immediately from having enhanced cognitive ability to being 'all-knowing' at the start of her change. Without any way to gain knowledge in a locked room, she's suddenly a medical expert and a computer programmer. That's just frustrating to watch and where the film was lost for me."

","Form the start I think that the title of the movie was a good choice. It wanted to create the mental image of the oldest human fossils which Lucy.<br/><br/>The movie begins when splitting up cells are caught on camera. Shortly after that we see a chimp in prehistoric times drinking form a lake. Then Scarlett Johansson narrates by saying that is how life begins which was a good introduction.<br/><br/>The movie takes place when Scarlett Johansson is studying in Taiwan and is dating Pilou Asbaek a drug dealer she met at a nightclub. Pilous has a delivery to Min-sik Choi When he tricked Scarlett and cuffs her to the briefcase forcing her to make the delivery her self. Regardless of her options she is forced to meet Min-sik Choi, who acts like a dangerous drug lord who kills ends up killing Pilous. Scarlett then discovers that the briefcase contains the synthetic drug as she is forced to work for Min-sik Choi as drug mule with three other men and transport the drug to Europe hidden in their abdomens. However one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen and releases the drug in her body. Soon Scarlett enhances her brain capacity and develops her physical and mental capabilities. She uses her abilities to kill the criminals and flees. However her power does not stop increasing and is destroying her unless she gets more of the drug to stabilize her body.She contacts Morgan Freeman, who takes the role of an authorized brain expert, and becomes her only hope to save her. But the drug lord wants to retrieve his drug and is hunting Scarlett down.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson who plays the role of Lucy who tired her best to making it look like an outstanding movie. She tired to give her best performance in all aspects on the Lucy's role. Pilou Asbaek had to take the role of an emotional helpless deliveryman which he did a horrible job. I think he could have done a better job if he was given another scene in the movie. Min-sik Choi took the role of a drug lord which he did a good job. Morgan Freeman did a great job on taking his part of the scene regardless of the movie. Amr Waked took the his scene has an officer of the law who ended out on being on Scarlett Johansson side has done a good job regardless of acting as a confused officer. <br/><br/>The things I liked form the movie was how it was collaborated and the performance of Scarlett Johansson, Min-sik Choi and Morgan freeman. They are the ones who tired to make the movie seem real. But there are also some drawbacks after the 30 minutes in to the movie is where there is too much fake science and unrealistic events happen. They made the movie seem childish and pointless. <br/><br/>The lesson to be learnt here from this movie is trust people wisely. Not everyone act like what they look like. People have a different background regardless of their story. Always looks are deceiving no matter what their character is all about.<br/><br/>If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend it for kids from 8-10 years old. Form my point of view this is a horrible and pointless movie ever directed and made. This is the worst Sic-fi thriller movie.<br/><br/>When rating this movie, it deserver's a 3 out of 10 because of its unrealistic features. If they had removed some of the unrealistic features it would have been a great movie given to its storyline.<br/><br/>An undergraduate studying international business form China gave the following review.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","6","30 November 2014"," Besson's latest concept actioner goes the abstract, philosophical route
","For the last decade, Luc Besson has been among the most reliable producers, writers and directors making thrilling, mindless entertainment, which makes ""Lucy,"" a film about a woman accessing 100 percent of her brain capacity, somewhat ironic. In all seriousness, however, ""Lucy"" is a departure from the filmmaker's gritty, revenge-driven track record of late, though not necessarily a noticeable improvement.<br/><br/>Like most of Besson's films, ""Lucy"" is a straightforward, concept-driven action movie: Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American in Taiwan, gets kidnapped by a wealthy organized crime boss (Min-sik Choi, of ""Oldboy"" fame) who stuffs a package of a new synthetic drug in her body for smuggling purposes, but the plan takes a turn when the package ruptures and Lucy begins experiencing its mind-enhancing effects. Consuming knowledge and experience cell growth at an unprecedented rate, she seeks to turn the tables on her captors.<br/><br/>But while ""Lucy"" is a pretty clear-cut concept, the plot is rather messy. As Lucy begins to unlock more and more of her brain and power, she understandably becomes more than just revenge- driven and becomes obsessed with sharing her knowledge with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). The script ends up being 50 percent philosophical and theory-based, and it seems Besson is more fascinated with this idea of humans accessing their full brain capacity and what we would learn about our existence than he is with crafting a compelling story.<br/><br/>What results is a film that talks an interesting and intelligent game but plays out in somewhat dumb fashion. In other words, ""Lucy"" is easily the most thought-provoking film Besson has made in the last 10 years at least, but it ranks behind many of those recent films in terms of being a compelling watch. Eventually, the concept of what's happening to Lucy's brain flies off the handle and we can no longer understand the science or theory behind it. The movie gets abstract and flat-out trippy in a way we haven't seen from Besson since ""The Fifth Element."" At times you have to wonder if he was watching too much Terrence Malick when he made this one.<br/><br/>Johansson, of course, makes for an eternally watchable leading lady. Even when Besson injects a few emotion-driven moments that feel completely out of place, she makes the most out of them, as if somewhere inside the hollow vessel of her character is a multi-dimensional person. Even the casting of Freeman as the professor, who exists exclusively to explain what's happening to Lucy, adds a certain legitimacy to the film <br/><br/>To Besson's credit, he manages to create enough thought-provoking moments to make ""Lucy"" feel like a smart and unique film. There are some big ideas within this concept and though he mostly scratches the surface, he manages to create enough of a hook to pull the audience into the movie. Although it plays out so differently compared to films like ""Taken"" and ""The Transporter"" series, Besson again proves to be innovative as far as surface-level entertainment goes.<br/><br/>It's also tremendously helpful that ""Lucy,"" like most of Besson's films, is short. At less than 90 minutes, it doesn't toil about long enough to let its faults drag it down. For everything it's missing, it's still efficient. That's the kind of low-risk approach that most flawed movies could stand to benefit from and that Besson had proved time and time again to be pretty reliable in delivering.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Ever after the trailers came out I was pumped, this film looked like it had potential, despite the fact it was a complete rip off of Limitless (2011). And somehow it lived up to my standards. I hate to admit I was highly entertained for the majority of the runtime, even though the movie seemed irrational at times for its scientifically inaccurate plot, I must give it credibility for its creative hypothesis. The Action sequences were impressive and the visual effects were stunning but I would of appreciated more of an appearance by Min-Sik Choi as he is my all time favourite actor. The film itself was beautifully directed, decently written and a convincing performance by Scarlett Johansson, Although the film struggles to conclude, the ending felt rushed and crammed up during the last 20 minutes resulting in an obscure resolution."

","The movie is quite amusing if you are into science fiction which this movie fulfills greatly. I hear a lot of people complaining about the science, but that's where the fiction comes in! I think we all know by now we don't use 10% of our brain (Or cerebral capacity if you want to get anal) and I think the people that made the movie also knew this. It's just a matter flicking a switch in your mind that in this reality, in this fictional film, this is true. <br/><br/>The plot was quite simple and compact. Nothing too complicated and it was quite easy to follow. Not a great masterpiece with convoluted intertwined story lines or deep characters. Which made the movie better in my opinion. This shouldn't be your nail biting shoe squeaking adventure. It's good action and just regular old science fiction with a hint of slight sarcasm towards the science field. Somewhere I got the feeling that the main point of this story was that we as a species have become so full of ourselves that we think we know everything as fact.<br/><br/>Scientists usually say they love to be proved wrong but mostly they love it more when they are right. Maybe the point of the movie was to show that we could be wrong about everything."

Some find it fascinating because it satisfy their imagination of possessing super-natural ability. I know this is just for entertainment but at least Luc Besson, can't you do your homework a little bit? Or maybe try to refer to actual scientists?

","Luc Besson has continuously disappointed me, it's almost simplistic how he develops his female protagonists, an terrible or tragic event sets up the revenge, and use a plot device so she becomes a trained killer. I try not to compare this movie to Luc Besson's earlier work, as it makes him seem to repetitive, and he is a good film maker, although it's hard to call his work purely original when the influences are so obvious. I would compare this film to Transcendence, and in comparison, this film has better ideas, however the execution of Wally Pfister was much better considering he worked with Christopher Nolan and Lucy feels like it was made by someone trying to be Christopher Nolan. There are things which Luc Besson does in this film, which are extremely French for a mainstream movie, and certain aspects don't feel right, mainly the percentages which display periodically throughout the film. If Wally Pfister and Luc Besson switched movies, Lucy would've looked the way Luc Besson wanted it to, and Transcendence would have been interesting, with cheesy dialogue which only a Frenchmen would write."
"secondtake","6","2","6","29 September 2014"," Bulging with excess and pseudo-science and effects...all in good fun
","Lucy (2014)<br/><br/>If you take the contents of this movie seriously you are very open minded—because the ""science"" here is total fantasy. It's science fiction in an ungrounded, wing-it kind of liberation. That's why some reviewers hated it (see the one in The Atlantic via Rotten Tomatoes). And I hated that aspect, myself.<br/><br/>But this is a completely cheerful kind of mindless movie on some other level. It's actually funny (laugh out loud funny) in many parts, if you're paying attention (the most obvious is when the American Indians are shown). There are wry comments and a kind of chipper exaggeration throughout that make it all kind of bright, even when crazy and deadly things are happening.<br/><br/>There is also the kind of action-adventure pace, with lots of moving camera (some of it really good) and lots of fast edits (without resorting to montage). There is also plenty of computer graphic excess, and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just self- indulgent and almost boring. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson holds it all together well, playing the emotionless type of character she just played in last year's ""Under the Skin."" I like her! Morgan Freeman plays a scientist, a dull version of his Lucius Fox (from ""Batman""). The rest of the cast is there to prop up these two (and mostly Johansson, who is the title character), but it's worth noticing, I suppose, that there is the common Hollywood pandering to the huge Asian (Chinese) audience it hopes to seduce. There are lots and lots of Korean bad guys (all are men but one, a tattoo artist). And there is lots of shooting, both in Taiwan and in Paris, where the second half of the movie is set. (The movie is officially a French production, but is mostly in English.)<br/><br/>The movie has pretensions, which is its biggest downfall. Instead of just being silly and fun (like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") it has big (empty) ideas to foist on us. The opening scenes of the movie set this up, a kind of fast motion ""2001"" beginning. (Director/writer Luc Besson admits this, sort of.) And the very last moment of the movie makes clear the concepts here are ""big."" And so the trick is to keep it light and enjoy the humor and get wowed by the effects."
"MaximumMadness","7","2","6","18 August 2014"," While it is never quite able to make its silly premise work, ""Lucy"" is still breathlessly action-packed, creative and fun.
","Sometimes a film can be forgiven for a shoddy, silly script if everything else works. Sub-par writing isn't always a death sentence. If there are good performances, solid direction, interesting effects and decent production values, audiences may be able to forgive story lines and characters that just don't quite work.<br/><br/>And I think ""Lucy"" is a good example of that.<br/><br/>It's storyline is a bit messy. It's based on a false myth that has been scientifically disproved. The characters are fairly stock and even boring. And outside of the titular ""Lucy"", you'd be hard-pressed to even remember anyone else's name.<br/><br/>However, the direction is very strong. The effects are quite fascinating. There's some truly unique and creative uses of editing, music and cutaways that give the film identity. And the performances are incredibly strong. So honestly... I didn't mind the weak script, because despite it, the film was just too much fun for me to dislike.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson stars as Lucy, a seemingly normal young woman who is inadvertently pulled into a desperate and bizarre situation after hesitantly agreeing to act as a one-time ""drug mule"" for money. Suddenly captured by the ruthless Mr. Jang (the incredible Choi Min-sik, best known for the Korean version of ""Oldboy""), she is forced to accept a new job smuggling an experimental synthetic drug surgically implanted in her body. However, the bag containing the drugs within her is accidentally ruptured, lacing her entire body with copious amounts of ""CPH4""- the synthetic drug which begins to rapidly advance her body physically and mentally, allowing her access to the previously unused parts of her brain. Suddenly granted increasingly super-human abilities, including telepathy, telekinesis and other powers, she decides to seek vengeance against Jang and seek the help of a scientist (Morgan Freeman) who may hold the key to helping her control her new powers before they tear her apart.<br/><br/>The performances and production are what really saves the film here. Scarlett Johansson excels as Lucy, giving a performance that, while not perfect, really shows growth as her character ""evolves"" and transcends ""normal humanity."" She's perfect for the role and is able to garner a lot of sympathy, empathy and support from the audience. Choi Min-sik is perfect as the ruthless villain. He's a bit one-dimensional, but you can tell he's having a blast just being pure, unadulterated scum. From his casual ""been there, done that"" attitude towards violence, to some amusing moments where he loses patience with other characters during the bizarre scenarios presented, Min-sik is absolutely watchable and compelling. And supporting roles by the likes of Morgan Freeman are all admirably played. (But seriously... it's Morgan Freeman... when has he ever given a performance less than stunning?)<br/><br/>Luc Besson's visual direction is grand. As per usual with his films. No matter what content, Besson always brings vast scope, character and energy to the visuals of his films. And this is no different. He excels and elevates the material. He also makes a fascinating choice of using consistent cut-away shots of footage (both stock and new footage made exclusively for the film), often in most scenes, to emphasize things like mood, character and emotion. (Ex. some scenes may feature cutaways to wildlife, animals hunting, volcanoes erupting, etc.) It does almost feel cheap at first (I thought it was just padding to extend the running length), but as time went on, I realized that it was a fairly carefully planned stylistic choice, and I actually really got into it.<br/><br/>The visual effects are quite spell-binding. And they also help to elevate the material. While it is obvious what is CG and what is practical, the computer-generated imagery is quite unique in its design, and the way it emphasizes the changes happening to Lucy. While they may not be photo-realistic, they are just darned cool on their own.<br/><br/>As I said above, the script is the only real problem. Because it doesn't quite work. But the wonderful performances, great direction, cool effects and other very competent facets of the production are able to make up for it. It's a very watchable, enjoyable film. And that definitely counts for something.<br/><br/>I give ""Lucy"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth checking out for fans of action (and even of Sci-Fi) at least once."

","First off the character Lucy is the ultimate Mary Sue. Immediately after exposure to Plottainium she gets the powers of God. I'm not even joking. She has omnipresence and was able to control things from across the planet immediately after exposure. The second this happens all interest in the character is lost since she is unstoppable. Imagine Neo from the Matrix fighting an army of Paul Blart Mall Cops. To top it off she comes off as very wooden, which makes sense really since nothing will affect her so she might as well not care about anything.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are actually rather forced in. I don't even know how to describe this part of the story. The drug dealers keep going after Lucy, but it doesn't matter since Lucy could fight off the Justice League while balancing the National Budget without blinking. This is an action movie where all action is pointless. Way to go!<br/><br/>I can't even describe the sheer amount of apathy this movie has imbued upon me. Within such a short amount of time I found myself unable to care in the slightest because the main character is invincible and talks in such BS nonsense jargon that she may as well been speaking in Klingon without subtitles for all the good it would do. I can not honestly recommend this movie to anyone. If you like senseless violence with a strong female lead going around to get vengeance on organized criminals, go rent Kill Bill."

The Racism deemed towards Asian People? The Stupid unbelievable powers she has? Or the fact that it made me cry after leaving the theater? Yes. This is the first time I cried after leaving such a abomination that I still can't believe could exist. Months ago, Transdence by Wally Pfishter was critically panned and was a box office failure. This on the other hand, made back its budget to much better reviews. I still can't believe there are people who like this film. This film makes the commercials on TV today look rewarding and intelligent. But everyone has their opinions and this is mine.<br/><br/>We start with a woman named of course Lucy, who in the first 5 minutes of the movie, argues with this guy on who is going to take a briefcase in while a bunch of stock footage of animals hunting and stuff gets cut to every 10 seconds. This leads up to her getting kidnapped by of course, the Asian Mafia who cut a line in her stomach and put some blue stuff (CP4?) in her and later she becomes 'Smarter' and does not emote anything and somehow has psychic powers. Why those she have these powers? Why is she looking like Kristen Stewart? I wasn't paying attention because of the abysmal plot. Now she must get more of the blue stuff put in other people for some reason which leads to the most puke- worthy of special effects ever in a film.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johansson gives her worst performance to date as the title role. Morgan Freeman who also stars in this film, wanders around aimlessly wondering ""Why Am I Here? I WAS VITRUVIUS IN THE LEGO MOVIE WHICH WAS RELEASED THIS YEAR! I DESERVE BETTER!"" <br/><br/>Lets talk about the editing first of all, the cuts to stock footage of animals hunting is pointless and dumb. It does lead to something, but seriously? Why have it in? We would be better off without it. Now lets Imagine I made a comedy film and put in clips from Faces Of Death in it. Would that be funny? NO! So why would they put this Bull in?!<br/><br/>Lets also not forget the high levels of Racism in this movie. Mostly towards Asian people as Luc Besson describes them as arrogant, unworthy, unhelpful, violent and scared people. Just wow. <br/><br/>Are we even suppose to like Lucy? She races down the streets of Paris making several cars crash possibly making tens to hundreds of people either injured or dead. What a freaking b#%ch! <br/><br/>For a movie that is about an hour and a half long, it felt like I was there for three hours. I really wanted it to end, and when it did, I ran and ran and ran until I couldn't see the poster in my sight. <br/><br/>The ending is overwhelming. I can't explain it. I just can't. The only thing I can say is that, people might or will have seizures from the god awful specials effects. <br/><br/>Also, how in the world, can more than 10% of the brain, give you psychic powers? This is the most unrealistic of powers even for a science fiction film. I mean good god, who was with Rob Ford when writing this?<br/><br/>One more thing I will talk about and that is it. I am done. I never want to talk about this movie ever again. The Characters are unlikable. VERY. Some Characters are careless of what happens, Some characters are never given back-story its just all wrong. <br/><br/>Please do not watch this abysmal movie. I spent at least six dollars getting a ticket and that's still too expensive. Save your money on something better like Guardians of the Galaxy and the James Brown movie Get on Up. If you decide to see it, don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>8/100 F<br/><br/>If you did not find this review useful, please send me a private message to tell me why I am wrong or whatever.

","I've read quite a few reviews of this movie, and most of them are negative. I don't understand it. Perhaps, those naysayers are simply too pretentious and caught up in their own ideals of what makes good entertainment to give anything which doesn't fall into their concrete guidelines a chanceor maybe they're just angry that a woman got so much screen time? Eh, who knows. <br/><br/>Frankly, I don't care. <br/><br/>I loved the movie, and here's why: It offers a unique perspective. There have been several ""explore the possibilities of the mind"" movies, in the past decade or so, and most of them are, predictably, entertaining. People are utterly fascinated by, and completely ignorant of, the human mind. Why do we think? Why do we dream? How are memories stored? These are all questions that nobody really has an answer to. (Except one: 42) There are several theories, though.<br/><br/>I watched Inception when it came out, and I rolled my eyes at the end. It's meant to make you think, I guess, and my significant other thought. I didn't. The ending was predicable, as most Hollywood ""blockbusters"" are. Limit was an OK movie, in the same genre, and it entertained. I didn't walk out of the theater thinking that my mind had just been blown, however. <br/><br/>(Spoilers after the break. This is a movie review, so there is going to be discussion about plot-lines and characters.)<br/><br/>Lucy blew my damn mind. Not because of the method in which Scar-Jo's character attained her ""100%"" because that's been done, but with the way she handled it. There was no lust for power, no desire for riches or fame, no drive to explore the world. No. The almost first thing she did was call her mother<br/><br/>She was lost, and she needed answers, so she sought those answers from a leading Neuro-Scientist, ""Professor Norman"" (played by freaking Morgan Freeman, everybody! Woo!). She contacts him and asks what she should do. He tells her, ""Share your knowledge.""<br/><br/>So, she does. The entire movie is a race against time: Lucy's ultimate demise, the Drug Lord and his goons who are chasing her, Time itself. Her goal is to meet Professor Norman, and share what she knows. She gets there, and picks up a ""reminder"" along the way.<br/><br/>There's action, and death, and drug use. The brief kiss could have been left out, but I believe it was put there for a reason, all the samenot sure it's a good reason, but hey. I'm not the writer, here; Luc Besson is. And that guy! He can tell as story. The Fifth Element, Transporter, Leon: The Professional, From Paris with Love, Colombiana <br/><br/>So much awesome under Mr. Besson's belt. He is genuinely one of my favorite story-tellers, so perhaps I went in to this movie with an already biased idea of how good it was going to beor maybe it's just a freaking awesome movie!<br/><br/>This isn't what I would call an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but it's still thrilling. All-in-all, I have to give it 8/10 stars, or whichever method of measurement you'd like. It's a good movie. It's worth the ticket price. It's worth the 89 minutes of screen-time. The ending is  ugh! But, it's still worth it!<br/><br/>Go see it. If you like Science Fictionreal, true, unrealistic, Science Fictionyou'll love this movie!

","Well all I can say about this movie is it impressed me to no end, Luc Besson pulled it off yet again with a likable anti-hero type that despite all forces working against her well, I won't spoil it but Scarlett Jo did a wonderful job portraying this character. <br/><br/>Only hitch I found were the 'bad guys' that were annoying and I only partially understand why they were a continued threat; some other plot device could have been used to drive the story (CIA, FBI, NASA, NSA, CSIS - anything really) - something that would really give governments a cause for concern is someone with powers such as Scarlet Johansson obviously had so except for the stereotyped mafia types chasing throughout the movie everything else was strong.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the philosophical moments, a quiet moment early on when Lucy calls a loved one - the technologies that were displayed, the visuals, the music and score. <br/><br/>I really think this was a strong effort and well, we'll have to see if this becomes a Trilogy.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 9/10, if more attention had been paid to the broader scope someone like Lucy would pose a threat to world governments and ALL forces would therefore make efforts against her I think that would have set the stage for some really fantastic stand-offs. What we got was OK, but not great as it was a bit too simplistic for what was happening in other parts of the movie near the end."

","The year is 2014. I've got a rare day off work, a free movie pass and figure a matinee would be a great way to pass a couple hours. So I look at what's playing and see ""Lucy"". It's a movie by Luc Besson which is good. I liked several of his movie. It's a movie starring Scarlett Johansson that I really liked. And the trailers for it looked interesting so I figured this was my movie.<br/><br/>And like the title says I enjoyed it. There were aspects of philosophy, science, some kick ass fight scenes and then came the ending. There are very few movies in which the ending made me angry and this was one of them. They could have handled it in such a way that would have been better but they chose to end it the way they did. I felt cheated by it because it was such a let down.<br/><br/>The story itself deals with the titular Lucy. She's a young woman who in order to make some money agrees to deliver a briefcase. But that's only part of the deal and she wasn't informed of the rest. Instead she's drugged and forcibly turned into a drug mule where this new synthetic drug is literally stitched into her and will be cut out when she reaches her destination. However one of the bags bursts and she ODs on it. Things get really strange and she starts to develop terrifying mind powers as she races to find a way to punish the people that did this to her and if there's a way to save her life.<br/><br/>We're taken on a ride in which elements of science, philosophy and what it means to be human are explored. A lot of people criticize Scarlett's wooden acting but this is explained as being her having gone ""beyond"" emotion due to the drugs in her system. And then at some point near the end it just takes a hard left turn into something I just didn't care for. I can think of a half-dozen different ways they could have handled it and gotten the same kind of ending but as I said in the end it just fell apart and I felt cheated. Even though the movie itself didn't cost me anything, I still felt cheated.<br/><br/>Personally see it for what it is and understand that the ending is really weak."

"margulanabutrlov","10","1","2","30 December 2018"," Lucy Review
","A fantasy about unlocking 100 percent of the brain's potential that expects viewers to be using just 2 or 3 percent of their own gray matter, Luc Besson's Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi: The powers Scarlett Johansson gains when given full access to her brain quickly outstrip anything one can imagine 3 pounds of skull-bound neurons and synapses being able to do.
Besson's script offers neither the well-drawn character dynamics nor the clear motivations of a decent comic book origin story, and as it is quickly clear that no baddie has much chance of stopping Lucy, action sequences carry little weight. A top-shelf cast and the (fading) memory of Besson's action hits will help the picture at the box office, but word of mouth is unlikely to keep it alive long after a strong opening weekend.
Johansson's character begins as a party girl studying in Taipei whose new boyfriend (Julian Rhind-Tutt) is involved in bad stuff. Thanks to him, she winds up being an unwilling drug mule for Jang (Choi Min-sik, making the most of a role that forces him to speak through interpreters). A big bag of a superdrug called CPH4 is sewn into her guts, awaiting transport to new markets in Europe. But the bag springs a leak when Lucy is roughed up by her captors, entering her system in such quantities (cue fun CG shots of cellular-level transformations) that it activates huge chunks of cranial real estate she'd never been able to access before - like that little-known lobe that lets you turn off gravity when it suits you.
Helpfully, Besson has been cutting between Lucy's story and an academic lecture in Paris where researcher Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) has been hypothesizing about the very thing that is happening to her, making remarkably specific predictions about what might happen if humans were able to use more than the 10 percent we currently use (a myth, by the way) of the magnificent supercomputers in our heads. His ideas, like some of the film's other early scenes, are illustrated with cutaways to nature footage suggesting the ways in which all of Earth's creatures are interconnected, governed by the same laws. Think Luc Besson doing The Tree of Life.
The early stages of Lucy's transformation offer plenty of kicks and even a touching moment or two: After making her badass escape from Jang and his thugs, she struts into the nearest hospital's operating room, shoots the patient on the table - a glance at the X-rays told her the patient's brain tumor was inoperable - and has a surgeon pull out the remaining drugs planted inside her. Forgoing anesthesia, she borrows the surgeon's phone and calls her mother while he cuts her open, describing what's going on in her head. ""Mom, I can feel everything,"" she says as the camera almost imperceptibly rocks; sensations and emotions stretching back to her birth are available to her, triggering what proves to be almost the last human-like response she has in the film.
From here on out, Johansson's performance grows colder and more analytical. Besson doesn't let her become as persuasively alien as she is in Under the Skin, but he doesn't want a human, either. Lucy sets out to round up other batches of the drug and get to Paris, where she can let Dr. Norman see his theories in action. Why do this, one wonders, when in a matter of minutes she has already read his thousands of pages of research and surpassed his understanding?<br/><br/>Plenty of films and novels have envisioned what would happen if we gained conscious control over our entire brain. While most would probably make a real neuroscientist cackle uncontrollably, it's hard to recall one whose ideas were more laughable than this one. We may roll with the film as its heroine learns Taiwanese over the course of a cab ride or sees the electromagnetic spectrum of cellphone calls, swiping through them as if she were reading their conversations on a touchscreen. We may even buy it when she's able to change her body at will - sure, growing a webbed hand would take some time and fuel, but at least a body's cells are controlled by its brain. But the film gives not the slightest justification for Lucy's increasingly godlike abilities, which soon include time travel and levitation. Every now and then, a nugget of real philosophy is dropped into the screenplay, but it's surrounded by so much blather that even a generous viewer has trouble using it to justify what Lucy experiences.<br/><br/>Even more damning in an action film, Besson doles out powers in a way that nullifies much of the drama to come. Once we've seen this woman put an entire room of people to sleep with the wave of a hand, why would we be worried for her when a smaller gang is pointing guns at her? (And why wouldn't she just pull the same trick here, instead of wasting her time with showier and less believable feats?)
The movie occasionally attempts to make Lucy's quest accessible to mortal viewers. Though she doesn't need the assistance of a French cop named Del Rio (Amr Waked), for instance, she keeps him with her as ""a reminder"" of her fading humanity. But the reality-based action (a long, wrong-way trip through Paris traffic; a showdown with gangsters who want their drugs back) feels irrelevant to what the film really wants to show us. Unfortunately, though it concludes with a line suggesting Lucy has finally found all the answers, Lucy never tells us what the question is."
"eichler2","7","1","2","12 June 2017"," More fiction than science but at least it wasn't a horror movie
","Most films that are promoted as science fiction usually turn out to be some other genre masquerading as sci-fi by adding space ships or futuristic settings. It seems like 90% of the time they turn to be horror movies with the werewolf replaced by an alien or the haunted house replaced by a space ship.<br/><br/>To Lucy's credit, it actually tries to inject a bit of speculative science, but in the end it turns out to be mostly a superhero/revenge/action movie, with flashy special effects.<br/><br/>To buy into this movie, you have to accept Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman)'s lecture early on which reiterates the old story about how humans only use 10% of their brains. His theory is that if we could unlock more, we'd develop ""powers"" like mind control, similar to how dolphins developed echolocation.<br/><br/>His theory is proved true by Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) who is kidnapped and turned into an unwilling drug mule by Taiwanese gangsters. They surgically implant a bag of their new, experimental drug into her abdomen. Then one of the stupider henchmen kicks her in the stomach, breaking the bag open and giving her a massive overdose. The main side effect (besides apparently briefly reversing the direction of gravity) is that it starts to unlock more and more of her brain.<br/><br/>As the percentage she can use is occasionally flashed on screen she starts developing superpowers like telekinesis, the ability to alter her appearance, the ability to see and control the flow of digital data, and eventually even time travel.<br/><br/>The bad guys pursue Lucy as she attempts to get more of the drug to unlock more and more of her mind, both so she can get revenge and so she can transmit her new-found knowledge to mankind. Meanwhile her abilities get vaster and ever stranger as she turns into some sort of super-intelligent, emotionless robot-person.<br/><br/>If you can buy into the sci-fi part of it, you still have to believe that most of the characters (including Lucy) can just shoot people willy-nilly with little or no repercussions. For example, there's a scene shortly after she escapes from her captors early in the film where she walks into a hospital toting a big gun, walks into an operating room, shoots the patient on the table, pushes him aside and demands that the doctor remove the remaining bag of drugs from her stomach. She even has time for a lengthy phone call with her mom. Then she just walks out of the hospital like nothing had happened. What, the hospital had no security? No one thought to call the police when a bloody, gun-toting woman came strolling in?<br/><br/>But if you can buy all that, the movie is well put together and a visual treat. And I have to admit that I didn't turn it off (I watched it on TV) because I had to see where it was going and how it would end. The ending is actually pretty clever, although it starts to approach 2001 A Space Odyssey level obscurity for a while there."

","I didn't see this when it was out at the cinema because the posters made it look like a ""medusa touch"" horror, and I don't like being scared. I've just watched it on terrestrial TV, though, and I was sucked in by it after a few minutes.<br/><br/>It starts off quite camp, but the ideas behind it I thought were more grown up, and they don't deserve the dissing that is meted out in reviews.<br/><br/>Spoiler: | | | | \/ The idea that reality is very complex seems to be backed up by quantum entanglement experiments, dark energy conjectures, and variable speed of light hypothesis. We've even got to the point where physicists are claiming many universes might exist, continuously dividing, or that we are all living inside a computer simulation. The idea that the human brain is too primitive to process this complex reality also seems fair. The idea that the human brain constructs a simple model of the world in order to enable it to function in a complex universe therefore seems highly plausible. Some people have even gone as far as saying that time is an illusory construct to stop everything from happening at once. ISTR in the film, Lucy says that time is what gives legitimacy to matter. If a higher brained being did see things as they truly are, rather than in a mirror darkly, is it unreasonable to think that he might be able to smash the illusion, or to take control? I therefore don't think the antigravity, telekinesis, precognition etc is so silly."

"tomsview","7","1","2","13 October 2015"," When Lucy met Lucy
","There isn't a dull moment in ""Lucy"". It starts fast and finishes faster. Just as well really because it doesn't allow too much time to question the plot, let alone the science behind it all.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is that after Scarlet Johansson's character, Lucy, receives a massive dose of the drug CPH4 into her system, her mind begins to expand until she eventually uses 100% of her brain, virtually giving her superpowers.<br/><br/>The scene I love most is when she nears her full potential and meets her namesake, Lucy, our early human ancestor whose evolving brain capacity was apparently part of the inspiration behind Luc Bresson writing the story.<br/><br/>The science of the whole thing is explained by Professor Samuel Norman played by Morgan Freeman – he makes it all sound so believable. One of the cleverest things in the film is the way the history of the human brain and the big concepts about mind expansion are put across with the use of offbeat film clips and old newsreels.<br/><br/>Much of the film's appeal is down to Scarlet Johansson. She plays the part in a low-key way, despite the fireworks all around her, but whatever it is that she projects she owns the screen.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" has been compared to a lot of films including ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Matrix""; most comparisons are with modern day sci-fi epics with great special effects. Oddly however, as I watched the end of the film where Lucy reaches the ultimate state and becomes at one with the Universe, ""I am everywhere"", I was reminded of the finale of an old, classic B/W sci-fi film, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", where the hero shrinks to the point where he realises that the infinite and the infinitesimal meet and become one within the vastness of the universe.<br/><br/>Although I'm not so sure one even needs to use 10% of one's brain to watch ""Lucy"" I'm not overly critical of a movie that is so entertaining, puts across fascinating ideas so well, and has two charismatic stars going full tilt."

"dfle3","7","3","12","7 August 2014"," Silly but entertaining sci-fantasy. 70+%
","Some of the movies that ""Lucy"" recalled for me included ""The matrix"", ""Videodrome"" (or other Cronenberg titles), ""2001: a space odyssey"" as well as, oddly, Aesop's fables (not a movie, but thematically). It's definitely a movie worth viewing but I don't think it really captures the imagination like the first ""The matrix"", for example, nor does it get as trippy as the end of ""2001"". <br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around an American tourist - the titular character, played by Scarlett Johansson - who is duped into becoming a drug mule for a nasty Asian drug syndicate. Due to her being assaulted by one of the syndicate's goons, the drug is released into her body, giving her extraordinary powers. Lucy now has her chance to get revenge on the syndicate. On the level of a revenge movie, the movie also fails to deliver (as it did with its ""trippy"" aspect).<br/><br/>The high concept of the movie is the premise of: what would happen if humans could use more than 10% of their brain? Lucy creeps closer to a figure of 100%, as the screen constantly reminds you. Now, I'm not sure where the figure of ""10%"" is pulled from, but I'll be so bold as to predict that someone attaining 100% brain capacity will...not in any way resemble Lucy's personification of this feat! In other words, her abilities are somewhat implausible and the movie comes across as more science fantasy than sci-fi. However, I do get the impression that the movie mixes actual science facts (or provisional facts, if you will), with just pure, escapist fantasy.<br/><br/>Performance wise, I found Scarlett's representation early on (pre-drug effects) to be a bit ""Laverne & Shirley"" like...although I haven't actually seen that TV show...just brief clips. I.e. she seems sort of working class...Brooklyn (?). Like the movie, I didn't find that she created a sense of excitement for the concept. Morgan Freeman also plays a scientific expert. Again, his performance didn't really grab me. So, from my point of view, whilst Scarlett and Morgan being int he film helped to get it sold, I personally wouldn't have minded had the cast been complete unknowns. Morgan pretty much does what he's been doing for years in these kinds of roles...quietly oh so Morgan. I did enjoy the amusing performance of...- this site bills him as ""The limey""! - Julian Rhind-Tutt.<br/><br/>The movie itself is jokey at times (as with ""The limey""), amusing, dark, violent and fantastic (as in hard to believe). At the start of my review, I mentioned ""Aesop's fables"". By that I mean that the frequent juxtaposition of shots of animals in the movie serve to provide a moral lesson for the bind that Lucy is about to find herself in. Some may be put off by this random juxtaposition of film.<br/><br/>If I had any other issues with the logic of the movie, one might be the scene where Lucy meets her namesake. It made me think that perhaps the world that our Lucy lives in might have been changed by that meeting.<br/><br/>Some interesting titbits from the end-credits:<br/><br/>* Oddly, there is a ""Special thanks"" to Monsieur Hulot! Guessing that the director doesn't take these things all to seriously!<br/><br/>* I enjoyed the music at the end of the movie...was unsure if it was one song or me. I particularly like the song that plays last in the end credits. I thought that that might have been by Blur's Damian Alburn (""Sister Rust""), but it turns out to have been by Roary, with a song called ""God's whisper"", which I'm not sure is even mentioned in the end credits. He's a new artist...not even on Wikipedia yet!<br/><br/>As I say, it's an odd but interesting movie that is well worth seeing, but doesn't have a big pay off if you are after a 'straight' sci-fi movie, 'trip' movie or revenge movie. If you like screen violence/fighting/car chases etc., that's all there too. In fact, on reflection, the anti-climactic 'fight' scene with Lucy up against a bunch of syndicate goons is amusing for the way that it deflates boyish fantasies of revenge."

Once Hollywood actionized and philosophically de-evolved it to it's final form, it was a typical letdown. In nature, my experience is that the higher degree of awareness of truth / environment leads to greater empathy /love. The Lucy character seems to de-evolve in that respect.<br/><br/>The notion that we will eventually evolve into God from apehood was well presented to give it that collegiate and intellectual bimbastitude that is the Hollywood standard.<br/><br/>The new words that I created here for this review will eventually appear in the dictionary once we have achieved 15% brain capacity.

The acting was terrible, and when Lucy became ""super woman"" she also became creepy, with staring blank eyed and no expression. Most of the film was special effects, or too much of the gangsters, car chasing and shooting. When Lucy became that Super Woman she was callous, for speeding a car through a busy public city and causing car crashes everywhere. Reminding one of the ""nobody"" scientists about his deceased child was very sad and pointless. Lucy travelling in time was perhaps the only excitement but then she turned into a massive oily blob at the end, disappeared, and said ""I'm everywhere"". The whole film was just crap.

","LUCY is a French action film that explores the popular concept (some might say misconception) that the human race only utilises 10% of the power of the brain. The convoluted storyline sees everyday Scarlett Johansson accidentally exposed to a new wonder drug which opens up her brain to a much higher percentage and subsequently changes her life in a very big way.<br/><br/>This is something of a mixed bag of a film which was missold by the trailers and advertising as an action thriller. It's more of a thinking person's science fiction film. There are some clumsy thriller elements in the story, namely those including the sinister criminal Mr. Jang (a delightful western role for the fine Korean actor Choi Min-sik), but most of all this is an exploration of the human mind and what it's ultimately capable of. It's much like LIMITLESS in that respect.<br/><br/>Generally this is an enjoyable film that feels fresh and inventive. The early thriller aspects of the story are handled very well with a ton of suspense. Once the sci-fi twists kick in it takes a while for the viewer to acknowledge the change in genre, but from that point it remains philosophical and engaging. The ending threatens to become overwhelmed in CGI but the film as a whole remains fun and the likes of Morgan Freeman bring gravitas and believability to their parts. As with UNDER THE SKIN, Johansson proves herself an actress willing to accept more outre parts, which is to be commended."

Everything is so patently ridiculous that you have to approach this film as an out-and-out comedy.

","You can have too much of a good thing, assuming that intelligence is good, which some people seem to find arguable.<br/><br/>I don't see much reason to go on at length about this computer-generated extravaganza. It begins in an ordinary way, as a decent B-rated thriller about drug smuggling from Taiwan through the rest of the civilized world. Unsuspecting carriers are kidnapped, knocked out, and a pouch of an extremely powerful drug is sewn into the linings of their bellies. What the drug is being smuggled for is an unanswered question. Evidently it doesn't get you high, so it's difficult to imagine a street market for it.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is one of those kidnapped by a band of Taiwanese evildoers who kill everyone who gets in their way or shows any hesitation before they cooperate., Johansson's pouch bursts within her and she absorbs this miraculous substance that boosts her cognitive capacity into the red zone. Thereafter, the quite respectable drug-smuggling tale turns into a bloody explosion of special effects that nobody -- not even some egghead who is utilizing 120% of his brain's capacity -- could grasp.<br/><br/>The climactic scene takes us on a scenic tour resembling the Star Gate episode in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- and if you thought THAT was a little hard to understand, wait until you see this.<br/><br/>It all fails. I guess Luc Bresson, the director, wanted to somehow combine a crime thriller with science fiction but it's like getting a cobra and a mongoose to fall in love. He tries desperately and winds up with Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Not the fault of the actors, all of whom do the best they can with the material, including the biological and philosophical mumbo jumbo. ""We are dependent on time. If time stops, we stop."" (No kidding?) Scarlett Johansson is no longer a teen ager but a fully blown woman of whom more should have been made, so to speak. But what a role she's trapped in! The drug turns her into a kind of robot. She never smiles, rarely blinks, strides purposefully about, and clicks her head from side to side like a mechanical man in a circus. Morgan Freeman as the only scientist who can begin to understand what is happening to her comes off best. He's like a reassuring wild old uncle.<br/><br/>No one could begin to fill in the plot's loopholes. She can feel the roots of a tree. (How do you do that?) She feels gravity. (Okay.) She feels every cell in her body, which might be a lot of fun if she had any human desires. <br/><br/>But although she is able to shut down her nociceptors -- she can pluck a bullet out of her shoulder without wincing -- she's lost her sense of humor. That doesn't keep the writers from sticking in a wisecrack suitable for an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie. She tortures some information out of a guy and leaves him with two jagged knives stuck through his hands, with the exit line: ""Thank you for sharing."" Some of her other lines (""I am everywhere""), well, I think I first heard it from Tom Joad in ""The Grapes of Wrath"", and he stole it from Ralph Waldo Emerson. <br/><br/>There's blood all over the place and explosions and car chases at supersonic speed and everyone's face is splashed with the gore of victims. When there's no overt gunplay we can watch a cheetah catch and kill a gazelle. Meanwhile there are galaxies of whirling colors and bobbing jelly-like phantoms constellating. The kids will love it."

","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) inadvertently finds herself in the middle of a drug ring when she becomes a test subject for a mob syndicate. However, when the drug that she's carrying becomes disturbed when she gets kicked to the stomach, Lucy's mind and body suddenly take on radical changes when she is able to access more than the usual 10% of her brain power. With these super human abilities, she sets about using her newly acquired skills to track down those responsible and make them face the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>For me this film tried to be two very different things; on the one hand it's trying to be an intelligent thriller that explores how an individual MAY behave when they are able to unlock more than 10% of their brain (as highlighted in Morgan Freeman's lectures which is all hypothesis till he meets Lucy). The other strand of the film is sort of like an action thriller whereby we're seeing how an individual ACTUALLY behaves when they're able to unlock more than 10% of their brain. The problem for me is that neither element is covered particularly well - I felt that the hypothesis isn't intelligent or deep enough to have you thinking about it much at the end. I also didn't find it all that exciting or entertaining (it had its moments, but perhaps not enough of them).<br/><br/>I also felt that Besson missed a big opportunity to make the film more suspenseful; when the drug first enters Lucy's system within minutes she's ultra fast and ultra tough - why make her this tough and fast straight away? Surely it would have been better to have seen her gradually get faster and tougher or maybe see her make some mistakes, get caught out once or twice. Whilst it fun to watch Johansson going round kicking lots of butt, I still think it would have been better to show a bit of vulnerability.<br/><br/>I also noticed one quite severe flaw within the script; there's a bit in the film where Lucy has to ask the police Captain where the drugs were that he confiscated? Yet earlier in the film she seemed to have these strong psychic abilities, so if she has psychic abilities or if she's able to read people's minds why did she not know where the drugs were? <br/><br/>I have to admit that I did find this somewhat enjoyable, but I didn't think it was a great film and I'm not sure it's good enough for me to recommend it. I didn't think it was as deep or intelligent as it likes to think it is and sadly it didn't have me thinking much about it when it ended. The set-pieces border on the ridiculous and sometimes make you feel like you're watching a live action comic book. Whilst this wasn't a particularly bad film I do feel that it didn't quite fulfil its full potential."

But even then, nothing was ever really explained or brought into context. So the movie lost me because of it's premise and story-telling. I'm not sure about the performances. I am personally not a fan of Scarlett Johannsson. I don't see the appeal in her, and I think her performance in this movie was especially sloppy. I am a big Morgan Freeman fan, but his role in this movie was so insignificant that it's hard to judge. A few plot holes and the fact that her powers are unspecific and kind of change all the time (e.g. in one scene she takes out an entire hallway of people at once and in the next scene she kind of just floats them away one by one) doesn't better my view on the movie.

The premise for the story is not new and the director hasn't really made any effort to put any imagination into it. He doesn't do much with the characters, instead pretty much leaving them to their own devices. Ordinarily not a bad idea when you are directing two major talents, but all he had to do was watch ScarJo in Under The Skin to see what could have worked better here. What we as viewers are left with is a vapid story which seemingly exists as a platform for car chases and gun fights with stereotypical cops and gangsters. While watching I imagined the director sitting on his couch at home playing violent video games and using those as his inspiration.

"robert-temple-1","8","2","7","21 February 2015"," Some people are different
","Scarlett Johansson does a brilliant job of being different. Well, she is. She is one of those people one can't stop watching without knowing why. And then of course there is the talent, in which she appears to have been soaked like a herring in a brine barrel. Having taken a special drug, Johansson's character Lucy keeps getting her intelligence raised, as it keeps going up by 10% every so often (we are advised of this by a notice on screen) she becomes increasingly dangerous. You see, we mere mortals are said only to use a very small percentage (10%) of our brains. I would point out that the world is also full of people who use none at all, but then that is a sarcastic remark, and doubtless these days would be considered a 'hate crime', as it is no longer permissible to say anything critical of anyone, especially anything critical of brainless oafs such as many of the world's leading politicians. But Lucy is not interested in politics. She has become far too intelligent for that. The genius French director Luc Besson here has been given a whopper Hollywood budget to go over the top, and he does so in superb style. We have all known how original Besson is since his unusual film SUBWAY came out in 1985. ANGEL-A (2005) was one of his most impressive supernatural films. In this cinematic rampage of super-intelligence by the out of control Lucy, we see her taking vengeance on some vicious criminals. So we get the quota of violence which seems to be required to give bloodthirsty audiences their kicks. I wonder if some day someone will make a film about a super-intelligent person who does something constructive. Or would that be too boring for a jaded public of 2015? Would not the world be a bit less violent if films watched by the masses were a bit less violent? And do superheroes always have to show off their prowess primarily by how efficient they are at killing people? Also, is it possible to have a sci fi film made in America which does not contain guns and explosions? Is the subtext of American cinema always going to be one of violent conflict, and must all Hollywood film language be reduced ultimately to the phonemes and morphemes of machine gun bursts? In other words, is it possible for a Hollywood superhero to speak English today, or can he or she only communicate by spitting bullets?"

"rameshchaudhary_np","6","2","7","10 December 2014"," Lucy accidentally gets caught up in a drug deal, but she soon turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human comprehension.
","The premise of film Lucy is based on the theory that humans use only 10 per cent of their brain's actual capacity. Whether it's true or false, it doesn't make a big difference because for now what matters is that it makes an interesting plot for a film!<br/><br/>In Lucy Scarlett Johansson plays the titular character – an innocent young woman forced to work as a drug mule for the mob in Taipei, Taiwan. Threatened with harm to her family and friends, Lucy agrees to transport an experimental substance via surgical implantation inside of her belly. However, when one of the thugs viciously attacks Lucy prior to her flight, the drug packet breaks open – leaking a lethal dose of chemicals into her system.<br/><br/>Yet she does not die, instead realizing that the drug has radically improved nervous response - setting Lucy on a path to unlocking the full potential of her brain. Moving past the 10% (according to the movie) that normal humans use, Lucy begins to discover a host of new abilities - including telekinesis and mind-reading, among other superpowers that defy our understanding of human physiology. Armed with powerful skills, Lucy attempts to round-up remaining samples of the drug – to keep the substance out of malevolent hands as well as blaze forward on her journey of enlightenment.<br/><br/>French filmmaker Luc Besson (Léon: The Professional and The Fifth Element), who has also produced and written a number of successful thrillers (such as Taken and The Transporter) directs Lucy. In spite of its sci-fi action marketing, the film is more aptly described as sci-fi drama with a few stylized action beats. This isn't to say that, on its own terms, Besson's film is a misfire – it just might not be the gun-toting, jump-kicking brawler that some moviegoers were expecting. Instead, Besson delivers an uneven but interesting blend of philosophy and scientific theory that attempts to comment on human nature and our place within all of creation – with subtle and not-so subtle filmmaking decisions to hammer home his message. As a result, reactions to Lucy will vary greatly – while casual moviegoers may find the film's eccentricities to be downright distracting (and laugh-worthy)<br/><br/>Ultimately, as Lucy begins unlocking brain potential and new abilities, Besson is less interested in what the character can actually do, focusing the majority of his attention on how she perceives others as well as what these discoveries might mean for humankind's future. The story is packed with heady sci-fi ideas and Besson does his best to ensure that, as Lucy journeys to 100%, her character evolves along with the plot. However, given that the story is glued to Lucy's perspective, some viewers may find it hard to connect with both the main character and surrounding players.<br/><br/>As Lucy learns more about humanity and the greater universe, she becomes increasingly less ""human"" - and subsequently less capable of forming a genuine connection with others. As a result, most of the supporting players come across as thinly formed outlines, representative of how Lucy views them, little more than cogs in a vast machine. The same can be said for the film's action set-pieces. Each one provides interesting visuals but few carry substantial weight – since Lucy is over-powered and mostly indifferent to her antagonists. After all, if the main character isn't frightened or worried about her life (or the lives of those around her), it's unlikely that the audience will be any more invested or anxious.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Scarlett Johansson delivers an intriguing performance in the lead role – with just enough setup, and one especially touching scene in the opening act, to ground Lucy before she begins disassociating from the rest of humanity. Lucy's indifference works within the context of the film but she's more of a flesh and blood opportunity to showcase the premise than a developed individual - living scientific theory instead of a memorable or particularly likable person. To that end, the actress and Besson succeed in their depiction of a woman losing touch with the very things that make her human but some viewers will, understandably, be underwhelmed by the lead character's overall detachment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the supporting cast does little to help supplement Lucy with humor empathy. Morgan Freeman is charming in his role as Professor Samuel Norman – but the character is almost entirely relegated to providing exposition for the film's scientific theories along with explaining what Lucy is actually doing at any given moment. Similarly, Amr Waked is equally thin as a French police officer that gets tangled in Lucy's quest to procure more of the experimental drug – dedicating his life to her protection almost immediately (without fully comprehending her motives). Choi Minsik serves as the film's primary villain, Mr. Kang – supported by a horde of faceless henchmen for Lucy to avoid/kill/incapacitate. Kang is provided with a memorable introduction but, once he loses control, becomes little more than a hopelessly outmatched fly buzzing in Lucy's heightened periphery.<br/><br/>Without question, action-thriller fans will be underwhelmed by Besson's latest effort – which prioritizes brainy scientific theories over heavy-hitting brawls at every single turn. Similarly, while the filmmaker's choice to directly parallel Lucy's story with nature and evolutionary biology makes sense in context, a number of on-the-nose moments might illicit eye-rolls and unintended laughs from viewers who are struggling to connect with Besson's vision. That said, for moviegoers who are interested in a bookish sci-fi drama that often poses more questions than answers, Lucy could provide a worthwhile, albeit sometimes clumsy, exploration of this central premise.<br/><br/>In the end, many elements that make Lucy off-putting for casual moviegoers will be the same hooks that make the film engaging and believable to sci-fi lovers. Lucy will not speak to a wide audience but those that fall within its target reach should be rewarded with thought-provoking science fiction."

Since I'm no professional critic, I can only say the overall acting, directing, cinematography and incorporation of CGI were fantastic as well.<br/><br/>But above everything, Lucy is interesting. It doesn't MATTER whether the science is correct or not. Besson himself stated that he knew the facts were wrong. But it doesn't make a difference — in the world the movie has created, everything is perfectly logical. It's a MOVIE. Entertainment. Not a documentary, as some people seem to expect. You don't take the concepts from Star Trek and apply them to real life, do you? <br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a fan of Besson's Fifth Element, you will probably like this as well.

Morgan Freeman is great as the professor who examines the premise this film is based upon. But, then again, Morgan Freeman is great in anything he does! Scarlett Johansson does a good job of capturing the character of Lucy, going from being a Waif, to being a Warrior. Now for the bad: the length of the film is only 88 minutes long. In the conventional sense, 88 minutes is right at the end of Act Two in a screenplay. Before I wrote this review, I read that this film was a decade in the making. A decade in the making, and the best Mr. Besson could do is a film that is only 88 minutes long? That's sad. This film needed so much more character development.

","First, the low ratings some people give this film; they might not be able to grasp it, and if so, yes it's a let-down and maximum a 5'er and only because of the acting.<br/><br/>An absolutely incredible film, if you are into science, not necessarily sci-fi. It should have been a 3+ hour movie, which it could easily have been made into. There are things I would have removed, some things I would have changed, but mostly there are so much more I would have added, and when Lucy touches Lucy's finger, she should have transferred her DNA/cell structure. That would have been a far greater ending, returning to present day, a whole different world where there had never been any wars and the human race had evolved into something far removed from what we are today, that would, in my opinion have made it into a sci-fi movie."

","I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago, and i was really excited to see it. I saw the trailer and it looked really promising.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie was really entertaining, made sense and was pretty exciting. There was action, there was emotion and there was complexity. Lucy was caught in a drug deal where the drugs were implanted in her lower belly. She then was caught by some Asian dudes (how they got her is not explained) who then beat her up. The bag of drugs tore and the drugs were released in her bloodstream and she slowly developed powers beyond that of normal humans. So far the story as we have seen it in the trailer.<br/><br/>After that it became really good. More action, more back-story and explanations and more complications. I don't want to give too much away but lets just say that the story developed in a reasonable way and everything still made sense (sort of).<br/><br/>But after that, in the last 20 minutes of the movie it became ridiculous. The whole story got stuck way to far up it's own ass by the time Lucy reached 95% of her brain capacity. Things became just impossible, unexplainable and just straight up dumb. Again i don't want to give to much away, but the story began to defy every law of nature and even time itself. <br/><br/>Overall i found this movie entertaining, that is until the last 20 minutes. Check it if you are into this type of story but be prepared for the weirdest ending since the movie adaptation of The Last Airbender."

","One word came out of the cinema with me. Science. The plot of the story is Lucy(Johansen) is abducted and to be used as a drug mule. The crowd literally put the bag of CHG4 into her body under her abdomen. I didn't care thou for OPERATIONS on screen. Again I repeat, if you want to see that sort of thing, go and look at Grays Anatomy or whatever. The producers shud take into consideration that NOT EVERYONE is into seeing blood or the opening of a body. The amount of disgust and quisy that I could hear beside me etc., Again the I didn't mind it. There's only a certain amount a person can take. Like seeing a body being cut open on camera, and Lucy NOT feeling pain. That is the plot thou. Other than that, I found the film to be of excellent value and education. I was delighted to see the film travelling back in time, even to the point of how the Earth was made. I most impressed with that. Put simply, Lucy was used as a drug mule to transport from one city to another etc., etc., But things went awkwardly wrong, as Lucy(Johansan) was kicked in the stomach, where the stuff, the CHG4 was implanted in her abdomen."
"shawneofthedead","7","2","7","1 September 2014"," Surprisingly smart and enjoyable for a relatively dumb plot. Johansson is stellar.
","How do you like your action movies? Straight-up and balls-out, no brains required? Or something a wee bit more thoughtful, even if the philosophy being peddled is wacky science and hardly substantiated by scientific inquiry? Either way, oddly enough, you should be quite pleased with LUCY, which is a ridiculously fun - if occasionally outrageously silly - action movie, spiced up along the way with some unexpectedly deep ideas about the value of life and love.<br/><br/>Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an exchange student in Taiwan, is a perfectly ordinary girl with perfectly ordinary concerns. (Leaving aside the fact that she looks like Scarlett Johansson, that is.) Sent into the maw of an international drug syndicate by her skeevy new boyfriend, Lucy is forced to become a drug mule. A brand new experimental drug is sewn into her stomach for transport back to America. But no one expects the bag to be roughly kicked apart, or for the hyper-dangerous drug to sink deep into Lucy's bloodstream. Within minutes, she finds that any previous limitations on her mind and body are rapidly being unlocked - which greatly facilitates her quest for vengeance and, perhaps, something more.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is science-fiction of the first order; if you're looking for science-fact, you've definitely come to the wrong place. The notion that humans use only 10% of their brain power has been debunked by scientists but remains stubbornly entrenched as an urban myth. Writer-director Luc Besson relies heavily upon it - and the sonorous, credibility-lending tones of Morgan Freeman as a professor expounding on said theory - for the progression of his story, as Lucy acquires new, terrifying abilities each time she gains access to another portion of her brain. It makes for some quite thrilling, hyper-kinetic scenes, as Lucy moves from manipulating gravity to changing her appearance in a split second. Besson even manages to explore a few weightier ideas tied up with identity: as Lucy's consciousness expands, so too does her understanding of the inter-connectedness of the world around her, and she begins to slip away as an individual.<br/><br/>But Besson does falter along the way - he takes his frankly silly concept so seriously at times that it's hard not to laugh at what he's tossing up on screen. Lucy meets the first primate - a female named Lucy. She gains a soul-changing comprehension of the universe and is nevertheless bent on avenging herself against Mr. Jang (Oldboy's Choi Min-Sik), the brutal head of the drug cartel. LUCY - and Lucy's - final scenes manage to be eerie and ridiculous at the same time. <br/><br/>Fortunately for Besson, Johansson anchors the entire film - even at its flightiest - with a steely humanity that proves absolutely essential in her more dramatic moments. It's sometimes hard to follow the logic of the character (surely Lucy should become more pacifist and less wantonly violent as she gains knowledge?!), but Johansson will make you care anyway. She delivers most of her dialogue with a stony, impassive face, yet somehow allows the great pain and fear Lucy experiences, at least at the beginning, to spill through the cracks of her character. Her few moments of human connection with people who mattered greatly to her in the past - her mother, her room-mate - give this action film more emotional ballast than you'd expect.<br/><br/>LUCY is not, ultimately, Besson's best film - he might well have made that twenty years ago, with The Professional. But it's certainly a nice change of pace and relative quality from the forgettable films he's been overseeing for years - everything from the Transporter and Taken franchises, through to the awkward We're A Nice Normal Family. Smarter than you'd expect, though quite silly as well, there's plenty to enjoy in this high-octane, heart-racing, brain-busting blend of action, emotion, and pop philosophy."
"elfgoose","4","2","7","27 August 2014"," The Fifth Element this isn't
","A colourful movie about a beautiful woman possessed of unusual skills or powers? Must be Besson. But unlike previous Luc Besson films, such as Nikita, or particularly The Fifth Element, this film lacks the storytelling elements that make it fun.<br/><br/>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR LUCY OR THE FIFTH ELEMENT (ALSO, MAYBE THE MATRIX, BUT, COME ON, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MATRIX YET?)***<br/><br/>In The Fifth Element, Leeloo is a powerful, genetically engineered being. Due to betrayal and ambush, however, she is killed early in the film but is cloned. What follows is the journey of a wonderful juxtaposition of omnipotent being with a child's mind. She is powerful but vulnerable.<br/><br/>In Lucy, however, ScarJo starts of as a kind of cocky young woman, but after a mishap she begins to utilise more of her brain and as a result gains an increasingly powerful intellect, and bizarrely the ability to do... well, basically whatever is convenient. There's not really any development of her character and she's pretty fine with her new powers and seems to know what's happening to her or anyone else at any moment. As a result it suffers in the same way as the fights in the Matrix sequels. <br/><br/>In the first Matrix, every time Neo gets into a fight or a chase, he develops a little, learning more about himself and the artificial world he inhabits. After awakening as a nearly omnipotent being at the end of that movie, the fight scenes in the sequel don't really have anything riding on them and have nowhere to go. Lucy is similar, in that she, almost immediately, develops the ability to make whatever she wants happen happen, so no one really has a chance against her, and because she seems to take the development in her stride, she doesn't develop much as a character. Regardless, I was expecting the set pieces to be pretty amazing, but they felt like wasted opportunities, she just kind of makes people and/or their guns float a bit. The only time she seems to be in real peril is towards the end when she needs to concentrate on something and so can't be distracted by dealing with the armed criminals and police storming the building she's in, but this seems so contrived as, based on her actions up until that point, it seems she could literally deal with both groups in about 5 minutes tops and then proceed with the work she wants to do.<br/><br/>There are two other issues I had with this film. The first is the acting. I like ScarJo, she pretty, and tends to come across as kind of spunky, as she did in the beginning of the film, but through the majority of the film she is devoid of emotions. I understand this is supposed to be a consequence of her higher intelligence moving her away from petty emotions, but to be honest she doesn't have the acting chops to pull it off. That's not too much of a criticism of her, it's just very very difficult to play a character free of emotion but to inject just enough emotion to make it interesting and not to sound like a first reading. Mads Mikkelsen could do it along with a handful of others, but not ScarJo. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, has no excuse. He really phones it in, and he doesn't even pretend to give the science any credence, which is understandable as my second problem is with the science.<br/><br/>I'm happy to suspend disbelief, I enjoyed Fringe and Star Trek as well as meatier sci-fi like Primer, but the whole premise of this movie is based on the very outdated, but widely believed notion that humans only use 10% of their brains. This might be true at any one moment, there aren't these massive reserves of power that just have to be unlocked, evolution wouldn't have allowed that waste, for a start. even if we give them this, suddenly having more brain capacity doesn't automatically give you more knowledge, or let you see what happened 2 blocks away from you 3 days ago etc... and not changing your appearance and so forth.<br/><br/>So, I had high hopes for this film, but a boring story line and action sequences, lazy science and concept and poor acting made it one to avoid"
"RyanCShowers","Null","2","7","9 August 2014"," The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERS<br/><br/>Earlier this week I updated my daily attire with new glasses. ""Lucy"" is the first movie I saw since the transition between spectacles. Not only did I feel as if I was watching a movie with new eyes, but the film showed me something that I have never seen before. The undeniable fact of ""Lucy"" is its ingenuity, but be warned, it is a polarizing experience.<br/><br/>Though I hardly find it as trend-setting as some suggest, feminism is embedded deeper within the film than the drugs are planted in Lucy's stomach. The explicit female empowerment almost becomes cheeky satire, such as when Lucy's love interest addresses his expendable nature in the plot, but her response insinuates the best use of his existence is to kiss her while she fights the bad guys. (Women Studies professors across the country will be giddy after seeing ""Lucy"".) It's incorrect to pretend as if females have not led science fiction/genre films before, especially films that acquired a lucrative gross at the box office. Though Johnasson's Lucy is only a descendant of people like Ellen Ripley, this film's success could turn the tide away from the frequency of male dominated action thrillers.<br/><br/>The first twenty-five minutes of ""Lucy"" are unbearable. The film's opening moments begin with calm images over Johansson's voice, whispering ideas emblematic of evolution, but that lasts for only moments. The story plunges its viewer into an obnoxiously directed, jarringly edited, and bombastically scored chaos. It would be acceptable if someone were to walk out of ""Lucy"" during its introductory scenes, even if they would miss the fun surprises to be had later in the film. During the crucial, plot-setting scene, Director Luc Besson interweaves shots of a cheetah killing its prey into the sequence, a pompous move that sinks ""Lucy"" to its lowest point. It's almost as if Besson was testing his audience through endurance experiments during the first 25 minutes, before getting to a film that wasn't actually that bad.<br/><br/>The quality transition from act one to act two and three is one of the most drastic in recent memory. ""Lucy"" began as a discomforting experience, but something happens after the dust settles from the storm of act one. The material is given the space it needs to breathe, Besson takes his dead weight foot off the gas pedal, and ""Lucy"" begins to fly. In the second two thirds of the film, the tone is infused with real emotion, campy fun, and soothing tranquility. Besson relinquishes his domineering approach seen in the earlier scenes and lets the erroneous ideas speak for themselves. The film concludes with a sensational montage that exposes the radical ambition behind ""Lucy"".<br/><br/>For however disproportionate the film itself becomes, the one constant is Scarlett Johansson's drilling performance. Johansson can add ""Lucy"" to her string of hits recently because in this role she shows emotion in the most melodramatic ways I've ever seen from her as an actress. In addition, she builds a grounded, cold state of omnipotence in later scenes of the film, creating a nice emotional range within the movie and the character.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" has ideal pacing and storytelling methods, clocking in its running time at 89 minutes. Sure, the introduction was a bit disorienting in its eagerness to jump immediately into the rising action, but that's a forgettable flaw once the running time minutes begin to rack up. It comes and goes swiftly and pragmatically, and maybe that's something future films should try to emulate, in addition to the female dominance. The more ""Lucy"" stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.<br/><br/>* * * out of * * * *<br/><br/>6.9/10"

I watched the trailer over and over in expectation that this movie would wow me like limitless had back in 2011.<br/><br/>Set in Taiwan this was a different spin on the contemporary setting of the U.S, Europe, China or Japan, it put just a enough of a twist on the situation to intrigue me. The switching from one situation to another in rapid succession never truly left me satisfied with a completion of the story arc in progress.<br/><br/>The overall story has some highlight with excellent action scenes and a touch of humor but the overall movie lacked the quality and the finesse that is expected of this genre. Let us be honest we are not expecting a documentary but even the Sci-Fi aspect was out there even for a huge fan.<br/><br/>I was impressed with Scarlett Johansson to a point. I have noticed in all her latest movies she has lacked a range of expression. Her default expression is repeated over and over again and unfortunately lacks the impact that the director was hoping for a she progresses or regresses to an entity of energy, her lack of facial expression is the same as in Avengers, Iron Man 2 and Captain America 2.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman puts in an O.K performance, the value of him being there is not realized to any degree and I think that the studio and producers were hoping his presents would lend more credibility to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall the movie lacks the quality that is promised in the trailer, my high hopes have been dashed."

","The fifteen first minutes are captivating, it's not so often that a movie brings the thrill so fast and so intensely. Had the movie gone on this way, I'd have given it at least 9/10. Even though the starting idea was already used before, the direction taken afterward is very interesting. Let's even disregard the credibility (of which I could not care less). Unfortunately, the second part of the movie goes too fast over too far stretched features. There are so many good ideas in there, we kind of would like the director to take us further inside those. Instead, the emphasis is made on spectacular aspects which I found out of place. I felt it as an attempt to entertain the widest public. If so, why even bother with a scenario?

If you're a fan of the plot of people ending up with spectacular and dangerous powers you'll want to see this movie maybe once, it's not all that wonderful but it isn't bad. I saw it during a vacation away from Canada, when I was in Puerto Rico, it was something to pass the time. It's better in a theater than at home. The CGI was pretty good, it appeared to be dubbed in English rather than actually filmed in English. In a century where movies are getting more and more reliant on computer effects than an interesting story, this one at least had a half-decent plot.

Which is, coincidentally, the lowest possible for the 'certifiably fresh' stamp.<br/><br/>So the question becomes: What's the value of a review teetering on indifference? Let me explain.<br/><br/>The main problem involves the trailer. Almost all of the good moments are spoiled.<br/><br/>It's been mentioned before, but I'm sick and tired of seeing previews that ruin the movie. This day marks the official beginning to a lifelong campaign against misleading trailers.<br/><br/>If you saw the preview and hopes are high, don't catch this one in the theater. Give it a few months or a couple years before tackling Lucy. Try to let your memory of the footage fade before renting it.<br/><br/>After all, it's only ninety minutes. You're not losing much; even if you hate it.<br/><br/>If you're planning on a future rental or catching it on the big screen anyway, you may wish to stop reading now. There are potential spoilers below.<br/><br/>The trailer isn't the only problem.<br/><br/>An expectation is The Bourne Limitless with a female protagonist. The story doesn't allow Scarlett Johansson to develop a particularly memorable character. Her acting is strong as always, but it doesn't fit the tone of such weak storytelling.<br/><br/>The premise is similar to the Bourne films in terms of being an international action-thriller. A similar plot device to Lucy's CP4 is utilized in 2011's Limitless. The main character, played by Bradley Cooper, takes a drug that allows him to unlock a higher percentage of brain capacity.<br/><br/>But the viewer never feels 'swept up' like one associates with watching those comparable works.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Lucy attempts to accomplish similar goals, but ends up falling short.<br/><br/>For example, all of the combat is spoiled in the trailer. There are no elaborate fight sequences. There's a solid car chase, in which Lucy drives against traffic. As effectively shot, choreographed and edited as it is, it's still illogical.<br/><br/>The editing is disjointed and the story is riddled with plot holes. Lucy leans further toward fantasy, rather than science fiction.<br/><br/>Style abounds throughout, but not in a positive way. Much like the ticking digital clock in the TV show 24, title cards with percentages are utilized as dramatic transitions. All in all, they add nothing to the story and serve as only a further distraction.<br/><br/>Quite a bit of wildlife footage is interspersed, presumably to build tension and create a more elaborate experience. But it just comes off as cheesy.<br/><br/>I truly wonder why such a prolific writer/director as Luc Besson would include the cheetah chasing down the gazelle as Lucy's captured. This is a pinnacle of heavy-handed metaphor. The enormity of the cliché seems almost purposeful.<br/><br/>The montages of various wild animals engaging in intercourse and giving birth are hollow moments devoid of value.<br/><br/>Besson's use of time lapse and montage is clunky and distracting; not to mention it feels cheap. Montages, time lapses and original animated interstitials are in vogue. Such films as Noah and 22 Jump Street make productive use of them.<br/><br/>Lucy does not.<br/><br/>The animation of the CP4 molecules spreading throughout her nervous system is momentarily interesting, but eventually drags on. The footage is later revisited, much to the viewer's misfortune.<br/><br/>The narrative voice is unfocused. It opens with Johansson speaking her thoughts through voice-over. They're not real-time thoughts, more like generalized notions about the beginning of mankind. This transitions sharply into Lucy snapping out of a daydream.<br/><br/>This disparity is heightened by the introduction of Morgan Freeman's voice-over regarding the evolution of the brain and human potential. Later it transitions back to Lucy's real-time thoughts, so the nature of the narrative voice remains unclear.<br/><br/>During the film's introduction, the missing link is featured on-screen. The part's played by an actor in discomforting make-up and is featured several times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Its too bad Besson didn't speak to Andy Serkis, who crafted a simian army using stop motion technology for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Serkis could probably create one missing link without removing his bathrobe.<br/><br/>Besson is hit-or-miss. His early career includes such hits as Leon: The Professional, The Transporter and The Fifth Element, and more recently Taken. These are all great movies, each in their own way.<br/><br/>There's a through line to his pictures, though. They aggressively toe the line between fantasy and reality, asking a lot from the viewer in order to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Take Leon: The Professional for example. Gary Oldman plays Stansfield one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. His drug of choice is less potent than CP4, but it's still a 'fantasy intoxicant.'<br/><br/>The point being: Lucy would be a lot easier to accept if I was still a teenager.<br/><br/>All things considered, it's a good movie that isn't great.<br/><br/>It's ironic Lucy went out the same way as 'Samantha' (from Her).<br/><br/>Hopefully they've successfully avoided Skynet (from The Terminator) now governed by Arnim Zola (from Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and joined the torch-bearing digital people (from Tron: Legacy) in the cyberspace community.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I'm one of the few who haven't seen Transcendence, so I can't include Johnny Depp's character in that reference."

","The title is exactly what I feel after I watched the movie. Also, the trailer sets people's expectation too high, what I perceived by watching the movie is the idea that when it comes to ""passing on the knowledge"" or knowledge itself, everything else can be sacrificed, yes, I mean EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>The ultimate idea may be simple: pass on the knowledge, so the later generations could benefit from it, but the cost of doing so in this movie--enormous.<br/><br/>After Lucy woke up realizing the drug is leaking in her body, she left her ""prison"" carrying guns. When asking a Taiwanese cab driver ""can you speak English"", the driver got confused probably cause he doesn't speak English, Lucy shot him then pointed the gun to another cab driver asking the same question. Later Lucy killed another patient who is going through a brain surgery to treat brain cancer because ""he cannot be saved anyway"", and then drive against traffic in Europe causing countless car accidents behind her because she is running out of time as she only has less than 24 hours to live and she has to ""pass on the knowledge"", not to mention how many people got injured or even died because ""she is in a rush and she has to save time"". Eventually she turned herself into a super computer and stored all knowledge that she possess into a USB disc, thus completing the task of ""passing on the knowledge"". But seriously, is it really worth it? Just look at how many people died during the course, Lucy has evolved into something beyond human, she doesn't feel pain, she knows everything, but in the course of doing it she also lost what makes us human--our humanity, our morality. She doesn't care if other people are hurt or killed because of her action, she thinks that when someone dies the guy is not really dying because the chemicals, the matter that make up a human body is simply released into the environment and will be recycled into something or someone else. If that's true, in the future when we are facing death of our loved ones, should we stop moaning and crying and simply hold on to everything around us--chairs, cars, trees, dogs, because the atoms that make up the body of our loved ones have been recycled and turned into something else that will always be around us? Her intention of passing on the knowledge is good, but the things she has done to achieve this intention, I doubt if it is really worth it.<br/><br/>It is the idea of knowledge over morality that sickens me. By the way the movie has quite some creepy and scary scenes. The action was somewhat cool, especially when she obtains the ability to directly control people, but again if she has those abilities why not kill the villain group then take care of whatever she has to do? It's not like she is not capable of doing it.<br/><br/>One last piece of irony I found is that when she turns into a super computer, one that is supposed to know EVERYTHING, her mind travels through time and she was able to see everything from the time of the big bang to today, but these are already known knowledge--maybe she was able to give more detailed info about the evolution of life?"

For whether she is in the Marvel blockbusters, films like Her, or even films like Don Jon, she not only finds herself in good movies, but also movies where the female lead isn't regulated to solely being a generic love interest. Her roles usually transcend expectations by presenting social commentary; presenting new angles to the love interest archetype; or being a woman who not only kicks ass, but also has a personality. Focusing on Lucy, the best way to think of Johansson in this film is to look at how Angelina Jolie was when she did a lot of action movies.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>From what we can tell, Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is on vacation in Taiwan and has found herself a boyfriend in Richard (Pilou Asbaek) who is a bit shady. So shady that after dating Lucy for a week he asks of her to deliver something to a man named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), of which he won't reveal what she is delivering. And being that she maybe blonde but not stupid, she says she isn't for delivering something she doesn't know the contents of. But, with Richard handcuffing her to the briefcase with the stuff, and only Mr. Jang having the code to unlock the case and give her freedom, she is forced to see the mysterious mobster leading to her becoming a drug mule who accidentally ends up feeling the full effect of the product she was supposed to smuggle. Thus allowing for her to develop X-Men type powers of which she needs Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) to help her understand for as much as her brain function becomes an asset, it also poses as a liability.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>As Angelina Jolie exits being the queen of the action genre, it seems Johansson is more than capable of taking her throne. But while Jolie relied on her fierce capabilities, as much as her sexuality, Johansson as Lucy is more so focused on doing what is needed to survive, as well as understand her increasing capabilities. Of which leads to use seeing her powers which are so extraordinary that you have to give it to the stunt team and visual effects artist for between dismantling guns with her mind, going back through time, and then the fight scenes. Johansson may not be as agile in the film as she is within the Marvel universe, but what she lacks in acrobatic maneuvers she makes up in by coming off as an utter bad ass.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must say the film did contain a bit of humor which had a Marvel vibe to it. You know, the type of humor which sort of feels out of place and just shakes things up so you don't feel as if it is just Lucy traveling, shooting people, using her powers, and repeat.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>As for the story, it tests your ignorance on the brain's capabilities a bit and tries to create this idea where if you used 20% more brain power you would start to become like Professor X, or another mental power focused mutant. Which, again, leads to cool visual effect tricks, but by the end of the film the story does begin to just seem like it is losing its ability to be compelling and is just about ready to veer off a cliff.<br/><br/>Though perhaps the main issue I had was with us seeing the full capabilities of Lucy's powers. If just because some of them just don't seem believable. For example, she somehow is capable of hacking a TV, radio, and Professor Norman's cell phone from Taiwan while he is in Paris; she can touch someone, sometimes not even touching their skin, to read their minds; and yet is so destructive. Which I found to be a sort of plot hole because it made it seem she was selective to use the powers which would make sense. Like, she has high reflexes right, can life things with her mind, and has hacking abilities, so explain to me why she is causing multiple car accidents when she could just switch traffic lights to be in her favor, life cars, and keep it moving? Also, why does she kill people when she has the power to change people minds, much less she could just break their limbs? Then, there is the question of why she let Mr. Jang chase her all over the world and not wipe his memories? And it is just little stuff like that, which you think about after the movie is over, which sort of ruins the experience a little bit.<br/><br/>Overall: TV Viewing<br/><br/>What makes this a TV Viewing film is because it does show itself as something different by not having Johansson simply be some sexy action star, but with that comes her going from this innocent girl to being a cold calculated robot which kills a lot of her charisma. Then, on top of that, the story itself, even if you aren't that heavy into biology, feels like it pushes the idea of what the human brain is capable of past what it likely can do. Add on that her powers aren't utilized in such a way which makes sense and you are left with a film which is good enough to watch, but isn't worth putting on your to watch list. For while the visual effects are cool, and there are nice comedic moments filtered throughout, by the end it the movie loses a lot of its luster and thankfully ends before it fully wears out its welcome. Hence the TV viewing label."
"Nickkford","7","3","14","27 July 2014"," Great Movie, but not what you would expect.
","I loved it. Not only was the filming style and general idea kind of wacky in a refreshing way, the acting and topic was extremely interesting. There were some odd moments for sure, but for the most part, it was an extremely enjoyable movie. <br/><br/>My only issue, and this again, is almost a good thing as it falls within that unique quality that the movie has, is that it is very linear. There is not much beyond what the trailer offers in terms of plot development. Scarlett Johansen did extremely well, especially given that she was handed the role of (apart from the change after she ingested the drugs) a nearly completely static character. It makes sense with the idea of the movie, and what she should be undergoing, but it makes for a movie that is very limited in terms of protagonist development.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed it. It certainly won't be received as a mainstream movie, and for that reason, I would say don't see it in theatres. It is less a movie going experience than a neat idea of what movies can be, in the way that it is quite atypical. Absolutely rent it, or wait for it to pop up on Netflix, but I know that I am one of very few people I know who doesn't regret seeing it in theatres. <br/><br/>Check it out! Much better than what the reviews are saying, provided you take it not as a mainstream, typical movie."
"monstermayhem32","7","3","14","28 July 2014"," The female version of limitless
","For some reason the film reminds rather similar to Bradley coopers limitless in which the character will took some kind of drug that enhanced his Brains capacity to its full potential. The same premise follows Lucy as well but she ends up getting her special abilities through bring a drug mule which happens to be by accident. However unlike the will character who served to be using his gifts for selfish reasons, Lucy seems to use her abilities as a way of gaining knowledge. Her powers include changing her hair appearance, eye color, absorbing large amounts of information, not feeling pain, healing rather quickly and being able to lift propose with her mind. I will admit while Scarlett jonhansson has been doing the action scene for quite awhile playing the black widow character but she does a rather impressive job shoeing the changes in Lucy's character,"
"withoutanynumbers","7","3","14","26 July 2014"," Limitless on crack
","Lucy is Limitless with Bradley Cooper on crack. In both movies, an unsuspecting person is exposed to a drug that unlocks the unused potential in his/her brain. While in Limitless, Bradley Cooper just becomes extremely intelligent; in Lucy, Scarlet Johansson transcends everything and pretty much turns into a god. The story does explore some very interesting concepts, such as humans' unlocked potential, what to do with unfathomable power, and the meaning of life; however, I felt that the writers got lost while exploring these immense concepts and ended the movie there: lost. I give it a seven out of 10 for production value and for making me think, though I have to admit I was hoping for more from Lucy."

"jboothmillard","6","4","22","4 September 2014"," Lucy
","From writer/director (Léon, The Fifth Element, Taken), aiming perhaps at the same audience as those for the superhero franchises, this film was certainly marketed well, I know from the trailer I saw that I was definitely going to see it. Basically Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a twenty five year old American woman living and studying in Taipei, Taiwan, she is tricked by her new boyfriend Richard (Pilou Asbæk) into working as a drug mule, he gets her to deliver a suitcase to Korean mob boss and drug lord Mr. Jang (Oldboy's Min-sik Choi), but she is captured by him. Mr. Jang forces her at gun point to open the briefcase, thought to be dangerous, it contains a highly valuable blue coloured synthetic drug called CPH4, and after killing Richard in front of her she is captured and has a bag of the drug forcibly sewn into her abdomen, along with three other drug mules, all will travel around Europe, but while in captivity Lucy is kicked in the stomach by one of the captors, breaking the bag inside her, releasing the drug into her system. As a result she becomes increasingly powerful and enhanced, mentally and physically, gaining the abilities of telepathy, telekinesis, mental time travel, feeling no pain or discomfort and more besides, she is able to escape, and at gun point she forces an operating doctor at the general hospital to remove the bag from inside her abdomen, the doctor explains the side- effects of the drug. As her brain power and abilities increase she returns to Mr. Jang, killing his bodyguards, and with him pinned down telepathically extracts the locations of the other three drug mules from his brain, following this Lucy uses her newfound high speed to research her condition, and she reads all the work of scientist and doctor Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman), who is researching the potential, possibilities and effects of increasing the common human brain capacity of 10%. Following her conversation with the Professor, and proving the abilities she has gained to him, Lucy next flies to Paris, on the journey she almost disintegrates due to her consumption of champagne, it caused cellular reproduction to fail, she saves herself by consuming more CPH4, and her powers continue to grow. Once there she contacts local police captain Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked), she again proves her abilities and gains his help to find the remaining three men and the packets of drugs inside them, and with the drug recovered she meets with Professor Norman to share everything she knows, he tells her that the main point of life is to pass on knowledge, and what she knows is highly valuable, but Mr. Jang returns and wants the drug too, so a gunfight between the Korean drug gang and the French police ensues. At the professor's lab Lucy discusses the nature of time and life, and consuming the remaining CPH4 she metamorphoses into a black substance that spreads into all computers and objects of the lab, she creates a next generation supercomputer with enhanced knowledge of the universe, and in her own mind she goes on a high speed space time journey back into the past, reaching and touching the fingers of the oldest discovered ancestor of mankind, and she continues further on to the beginning of the universe, until she has truly reached the brain capacity of 100%. At that moment Mr. Jang enters and points a gun at Lucy, but the instant before the bullet strikes Lucy disappears into the space time continuum, leaving nothing but her clothes, she explains that everything is connected and existence is only proved through time, Del Rio comes in and kills Mr. Jang, Professor Norman takes a monolithic flash drive offered by the advanced supercomputer, before it disintegrates to dust, Del Rio asks the Professor where Lucy is, and immediately a text message is received saying: ""I AM EVERYWHERE."" Also starring Julian Rhind-Tutt as The Limey, Analeigh Tipton as Caroline and Nicolas Phongpheth as Jii. Johansson may not quite be the action heroine but she excels as the skilled brainbox, and Freeman adds his usual gravitas being enlightening and incredulous, I can definitely see what critics mean about the combination of Limitless and 2001: A Space Odyssey, I agree it is barmy but equally enthralling, the car chase and fight sequences are gripping enough, and the CGI special visual effects are fantastic, the ending may get you asking a few questions, but overall it is a cool science- fiction action film. Good!"
"nitestar95","3","2","8","10 May 2019"," Lots of shooting & action. Not much of a plot
","This movie suffers from the same things that a lot of other recent films do: reliance on action, CG, and lots of explosive color. However, it fails in too many ways. Lots of foreign language with no way to know what's being said leaves the audience in the dark. Symbolism used but never explained, I didn't get a lot of it until I read the information on wiki explaining it. All this leaves a lot to be desired; the director and screenwriter have failed on a grand scale to tell their story. Any movie that you have to see multiple times to understand it, or need to read the director's explanation after watching it, is poorly written. As this is one of those, it doesn't qualify as decent entertainment as a movie. Perhaps it does as a puzzle. But most people don't want to go view puzzles without the information of how to put them together; in this way, this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle of a monotone piece of cardboard, cut up into a thousand pieces, so you have no way to figure out which piece goes where. Still, the light show was enjoyable to watch, much as a fireworks display is. But it's basically meaningless without knowing what it's supposed to represent."

","This is possibly the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Definitely top 5. I was shocked to see it's been written and directed by Luc Besson. He actually had some good movies.<br/><br/>The good news is this is so stupid, that you might actually watch it as a comedy, if you don't mind a disgracefuly pretentious storyline.<br/><br/>I read some reviews afterwards, and in one of them the author calls it ""unscientific"". He says ""only 1/5 of it is science"". REALLY? What has he been smoking? This movie makes absolutely no sense, it's completely irrational from the very start to the last scene. Don't even try to watch it without good pot."

","This is a god awful movie with a lot of wasted talent. The writing is absolutely ridiculous and has more bad science than a theist trying to use the bible to explain electricity. It is hogwash. It is 100% crap.<br/><br/>Besides the bad science it is filled with fallacies and logical errors through out the movie. Obviously the writers of this story/script/book/whatever were high as a kite when they wrote it. Was this by the Wachowski brothers? No? Luc Besson? Ah, Luc Besson.<br/><br/>The myth about using only 10% of your brain is just that, a myth. You use 100% of your brain but most of it is sub-consciously done. All the fine motor skills, breathing, heart action, awareness, memory storage, etc etc etc, is all done quietly and with out you knowing. So this movie wants you to think that taking some drug would increase your brain power from that 10% and when you reach 100% you can do crazy stuff like turn in to air.<br/><br/>Egad! Stop the suffering now! Turn the damn movie off!<br/><br/>This is a horrible movie and it shows that ignorant people influencing gullible people is a bad combination.<br/><br/>I wish I could give it negative points."

"FilmCriticLalitRao","10","2","8","7 June 2015"," Luc Besson has made an excellent thriller which discusses the immense power of the human brain.
","Philosophy is not for everybody as neither all people are capable of doing philosophy nor are they interested in discussing it. For this reason a complete film about philosophy would not attract large crowds in recent times. French director Luc Besson's latest film 'Lucy' has emerged as a different film as it mixes philosophy especially philosophy of mind with eclectic elements of a fast paced thriller. His film tackles the essential question of human brain especially its optimum usage. One learns many new pieces of valuable information about the brain. For example-dolphins are the only animals who use their brain more than human beings. This film pays equal attention to philosophy and actions scenes that no group of viewers feels the need to ignore any other element. 'Lucy' wastes no time to describe how criminal minds would go to any extent in order to achieve their aims. The highlight of this film is the phenomenal transformation of an ordinary girl into a colossal, brainy intellectual giant who uses her brain to the highest attainable level of 100%. Lastly nobody has to be a double of VS Ramachandran to appreciate this film but a lot of questions related to the human brain especially the manner in which it is used have not been answered. This might be the main defect an astute viewer can find with this film."

In addition, I didn't mind looking at Scarlett Johansson for that length of time, even if she was turning into an android (pardon my scientific inaccuracy). I found the ""what ifs"" fascinating and the visual effects were decent enough. Sure, the bad guys were stereotypical and over the top and the ""heroine"" (no bad pun intended) was ridiculously superhuman and impervious to logic and compassion for others, but people have been gobbling that kind of stuff up in comic books for generations without batting an eye.

","I like the premise, I like Luc Besson, I like Morgan Freeman, and I like Scarlett Johanssen. Just all wasted in this film. <br/><br/>Started off well, then descended into self indulgent drivel that was neither based in any form of fact, not even researched, and utterly implausible.<br/><br/>Someone else has asked in another review, what if it were true. By that I presume they mean using 100% of the brain. Well if it were true, it wouldn't happen like this. I would like to think that if we could use 100% of our brains, we would do more than the totally incomprehensible ending to this film.<br/><br/>If achieving 100% means you turn yourself into a super computer that you have built out of yourself and then download your knowledge into a usb that works on current computers, and finally disappear in a puff of dust, all in the space of five minutes. All this happens whilst a massive gun battle rages, with rpg's being fired. Oh and how come the French police file into a building to do battle with the Korean bad guys, whilst their standing outside in full view, tooling themselves up with guns. Really. <br/><br/>Great film if you have nothing better to do,but instantly forgotten. I am sure Morgan Freeman will want to forget the oh so shocking scene of him and the other scientists standing in a white room look bemused as Lucy goes on a voyage through space and time around the universe. They could have used any aspiring actor to stand there looking dumbfounded. Morgan Freeman looked plain stupid there. <br/><br/>Better luck next time guys."
"dioditto","1","2","8","30 November 2014"," Racist smoking pile of stinking garbage !
","First, I must say, I had high expectation from this movie; the beginning of the movie looks fairly promising - the premise is promising, it looks like ""Limitless"" (2011) set in Asian city with more action. But as the movie goes on, it become quite apparently how bad this stinking pile of turd this movie is.<br/><br/>Before this movie, I didn't know Luc Besson is a racist. In the movie he purposely cast ALL asians as either villains (the korean gangsters, or the triads) or they are the props to be killed for no other reason then for comic relieve. Two instances stands out - when Scarlett Johansson's character shot a taxi driver simply because he can't speak English; and another instance when in the hospital, Lucy simply shot an Asian patient on the operating table in the head simply because she needs the surgeon to stitch her up. Had this being a white patient the plot would had been how Lucy using her vast intellect to cure this patient thus showing how much superior she is - but instead, the plot portrays asians as not worth saving.<br/><br/>And then there is the subtle racism that shows in the dialogue - such as ""Who Speaks Chinese, Anyway?"" and the rest of the drivel that came out of Analeigh Tipton's mouth. The tone of the movie also seems to convey the idea that white people were been victimized and oppressed by the Asian (gangsters). The other one is how Luc Besson subtly portray Taiwan as a lawless city - when you can fire pistols in public and not a single cop is in sight! Scarlett Johansson was simply walking around with pistols in hand and not a single person noticed or a cop in sight to stop her. Taiwan (like most Asian countries) forbid the ownership of firearms - thus a person with pistol will instantly stand out - let along a TALL BLONDE WHITE GIRL like Scarlett Johansson walking in pistols and submachine gun! The SWAT would be all over her in minutes - especially in Taipei as it is the capital with the most police force.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simplistic and predicable. The acting were pretty awful too as Scarlett Johansson's character turn into a robot while the rest of the cast were pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>Overall, 1/10. Avoid this stinking pile of turd like the plague."
"Brie_Zhao","3","2","8","9 November 2014"," I guess 'With great intelligence comes great responsibility' is what this film is all about.
","Honestly, I knew it would not work out. Just like the way I felt about Robocop, the Hobbit, Red 2, and all these crap with those shiny outfits. This disappointment was anticipated so I was not truly disappointed.<br/><br/>At the beginning, when Morgan Freeman first appeared, lecturing, and with flashbacks (of documentary) accompanying this scene, I felt this is SOMETHING. The combination of flashbacks of reality and the film, it can be good. However, as it turns out, this short 90 min film has a 45 min of BBC documentary within the package.<br/><br/>As the med began to affect Lucy's brain and body, the film started to move into a 100% action film zone. In addition, that is when Lucy the Kick-Ass turned into Lucy the Hit-Girl. In addition, she just started to Kill every Bill (AKA these AWESOME mobsters), and every pedestrian. <br/><br/>For the record, I do not really think that with high intelligence means deprived of empathy. However, I heard that God, the saver, the sign of mercy, would eradicate the entire human race just to 'save' them. However, why would you need to kill with super brain? BTW, that Captain (?) with that lovely French accent, what is the purpose of that character's existence? Lucy said something like 'I need you as my reminder'. However, for god's sake, what was he doing there? (Something like nothing?)<br/><br/>And then they just started to do Fast & Furious, something like a more violent one of car chasing scene in the Italian Job （and a more rough one.BTW, I think it's time for traffic police to say 'why always me?' like Droba in European Championship (?)）.<br/><br/>In addition, when it comes to the 'philosophical theories', this film is just a pretentious using all these 'fake theories' casually and try to use these to impress people like Da Vinci Code did (you can't deny that Dan Brown did a great job). Anyway, there was a thing or two that I agree with: time is the only measure of everything; the only thing that humans do consistently is inheriting the knowledge. What I, as an audience, really want to see in a film about this kind of subject matter, is how this complete exploitation of brain capacity can really elevate the human mind and soul. But all this film has ever shown me is: in the aspect of additional 'super powers': there's a 'XXL hearing aid'; a X-ray scanner applied for body and mind; an invisible 50.1 version 'Google glass'; a 'Vampire Diaries compulsion package on sale'; a really cool control and credible anticipation over gravity, body, objects , mind; a super cool limitless ticket supply of time traveling; in the aspect of emotions: no sense of pain, fear, desire These are all superficiality. Nothing was truly not anticipated. <br/><br/>I guess you can say it's something as horrible as the Fifth Element, and I can see why Gary Oldman did not want to work with Luc Besson.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Lucy is composed of 25% BBC Documentary, 25% Gangster Squad, 25% Fast & Furious, 25% Limitless and 100% CRAP."

"benisof","4","2","8","11 September 2014"," Leave your brain at the entrance
","I liked the action and the beginning of the plot, but the rest was just silly. I know someone with whole brain power would be very smart, but to claim it would have power over matter and time it's a level of sci- fi that is not believable (at least for me...) This reminded me of Transcendence. The same phenomenon: you get so smart you can do anything you want.<br/><br/>There are several severe inconsistencies in the movie. <br/><br/>1. Why would superior intelligence imply that you can kill anyone, with no reason, enemy or not? (See the hospital scene) On the other hand, when dealing with real enemies (the Chinese guys), Lucy doesn't kill them, but plays with them. Maybe this is needed to create the stupid gunfight (a la Matrix) between the French police and the Chinese at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>2. If you are super smart and tapped into anything that moves, then why do you need to swipe and zoom with your fingers, like on a phone/tablet. Can't you do that in your head? Speaking of technology, in the scene where Lucy first gets a hold of a computer, after she gets smarter, she opens tons of windows (supposedly learning) and does not close them down. No matter how smart you are, the computer's RAM will run out if you try and do that. It looks good on the screen, but is not realistic.<br/><br/>3. Why would Lucy search and find some researchers to talk to when she already knows more than any of them? It's like seeking advice from a young kid about what to do in life... In the end, a bunch of them are gathered in a room with the sole purpose of looking at her while she reaches her 100% brain level and while the Chinese smash through the police.<br/><br/>4. If she's that smart, why didn't she make the blue drug herself, or find the production site in Taiwan, rather than start a war in France?<br/><br/>5. Why does she travel in the past with a chair? <br/><br/>There are other points, but i do not want to waste my time any further. The movie looked promising, but like Transcendence, it goes way too far in assuming brain power can make you a sort of God, above physics, gravity, everything."

The part that topped off this movie was towards the end when she turns herself into a USB stick.... need i say more!<br/><br/>The film was way too far-fetched for my liking,the whole idea around the need to have ""bad guy"" Chinese people was laughable and pointless. 2 hours of my life i wont get back and the film is very easily forgettable.<br/><br/>If anyone wants an idea on how to compare my rating.. i though ""After Earth"" wasn't as bad as people made out and i would of gave that a 5 or 6/10."
"agmoldham","5","2","8","3 September 2014"," Nothing new in Lucy
","Walking in to watch Lucy I had absolutely no idea what it was about. As the titles rolled I realised that I'd seen a trailer for the movie a few weeks ago. The movie tells the story of what happens if we use more of our brain. Apparently we only use 10% of the brain at the moment. Presumably this is based on fact, but the movie explores what might happen if we use more of our brain power. Without giving too much away lets just say that the difference is quite dramatic.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays the lead role which is also a clunky reference to the fossil Lucy. As ever Scarlett Johansson is pretty watchable with Morgan Freeman providing the descriptions of the science behind what is happening.<br/><br/>You'll probably not remember anything about the movie in a couple of months, but it was fairly entertaining. With the exception of Lucy none of the other characters are really explored. Definitely not the best time you'll have in the cinema this year, but not the worst either!"
"lasttimeisaw","5","2","8","2 September 2014"," Besson needs more brain capacity to make this film shine
","A cinema-going in a newly-discovered multiplex in Cairo inside a half-empty shopping mall, LUCY is another rare triumph of a female-driven blockbuster directed by Gallo-film entrepreneur Luc Besson, whose creativity and clout has been significantly ebbed away after THE BIG BLUE (1988, 8/10), LÉON: THE PROFESSIONAL (1994, 9/10) and THE FIFTH ELEMENT (1997, 8/10). So I have been intentionally steering clear of his subsequent work, however recently the noteworthy career renaissance of Scarlett Johansson intrigues me immensely and I am tempted by the conception of gearing up the the maximum of human's cerebral capacity. But, in the end, Besson overkills the idea since his brain capacity doesn't quite hit the requirement to facilitate such an ambitious project. <br/><br/>The Taipei setting is a treat to my eyes, and it is also refreshing to watch Black Widow acting frightened as a girl in the end of her tether (at least for the beginning 20 minutes) before she can wondrously kick ass again. The montages of an antelope falling prey of ferocious lions are not too subtle to inter-cut with the pretentious and preposterous beginning. We are not watching a Discovery channel while the reconstructed images of the arguable first homo sapiens Lucy cannot be too obvious to state its liaison with our Lucy, brings about a THE TREE OF LIFE (2011, 8/10) otherworldliness, but in a far worse way. <br/><br/>The same out-of-the-place malaise continues until the very end, the flashy progress of the drug flowing through brain cells and the Sci-Fi transcendent set pieces jump in not as eye-opening thrust, but mostly middle-of-the-road scratches. By comparison, the paralleling plot of the vengeful Korean gang leader seems to be even more insignificantly trivial, only to meet the eyes of action fans. <br/><br/>The second-billed Morgan Freeman's subplot is also mediocrely plain, he might as well retreat as a suave elucidator in voice-over; Min-sik Choi, the South Korean mega-star, monotonously designed as the blood-thirsty thug, but against the superhuman Lucy, his one-note villain is pitifully expendable. <br/><br/>Johansson, on the other hand, basically carries the picture alone, but after the tremendous metamorphosis in HER (2013, 8/10) and UNDER THE SKIN (2013, 8/10), LUCY is a child's play for her, she doesn't even have to challenge many stylish action showcases as in CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10). But in any rate, LUCY marks that she successfully repeats Angelina Jolie's victory in SALT (2010), the film is a solid stepping stone to manifest that she is a bankable leading actress who is ready to anchor a Black Widow spin off now, Marvel really should seize this opportunity and right their wrongs in the sexism superhero universe. <br/><br/>Luc Besson, once a French wunderkind with great promise, now it only seems that his ambition oversteps his actual execution. The storytelling of LUCY is arbitrary and reckless, what is in its center notion of any individual human's 100% prowess liberation is clearly beyond his own comprehension, so he has to finish it off in a most predictable approach, it is a too profound test for him to justify the story. Anyway, being the mastermind behind a popcorn flick, he is no doubt a shrew businessman and knows the market pretty well.<br/><br/>One funny thing is the ending could be a suitable preface for HER or UNDER THE SKIN, when Lucy has been transformed into either an omnipresent IOS system, or even worse, a completely different species trying to get some basic clue of the highest life form on earth, if you are a Johansson fan, it is not a bad choice for a double bill."

","Overall, Lucy is a few ideas for a sci-fi movie stitched together, so it lacks coherence and flow. However, it is enjoyable if you have nothing else to do for 90 mins.<br/><br/>The film gets off to bad start with its premise. It is a complete myth that we only use 10% our brain. So its attempt to ground a matrix-style movie in reality falls at the first hurdle. Also, the premise was used in Limitless so the repetition is a bit tedious.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's job seems purely to establish the bad premise and doddering around, not contributing to the story.<br/><br/>People will argue over Johansson's performance over the course of the film but she does a good job with weak material. <br/><br/>Some of the effects and stunts are very enjoyable. Transcendence was better and most people didn't like that. This movie is worth a watch if you are in any way a sci-fi fan."
"RemoteControlled","5","2","8","21 August 2014"," Could have been a fun ride, was a down slide.
","The film starts as a really good dark action comedy with even some witty dialog, and ends about as painfully as my tortured pun above. At half an hour into the movie, everybody's brains get blown away including those of the writers and the director. (In defense of the writers, the movie actually has a philosophically relevant message.) I don't care that the main plot is a scientific fallacy. I consume other fantasy stuff with joy. My problem is with the incessant and badly executed attempts to root that fantasy in actual science and make it philosophically relevant. Yes, X-Men sports ""scientists"" too, but the role of science is usually played down or someone in a funny colored jumpsuit hops in. The makers of ""Lucy"" wrote a professor into the bit, who gets a lot of screen time teaching much too obvious falsehoods in an University class room, deliver the one relevant philosophical line in the flick, and then comment in awe on Lucy's (completely illogical) developments, all the time giving off quasi-scientific babble. And to add harm to insult, they chose Morgan Freeman for the role, to add even more credibility, at least seriously harming that actor's in the process. *** Some small Spoilering ahead*** As already hinted on, I could not get high enough on sugar and popcorn to suspend disbelief enough in the face of so much cringe-worthy pseudo science babble, illogical hero power development, plot holes and really shakily held up tension. The guy with the gun at the end, after all that she had done, after all that she had done 5 minutes after _starting_ to transform, is kind of stupid.<br/><br/>It could all have been a fun ride, Morgan Freeman as a tongue in cheek professor, and a pretty super-heroine slowly going god-mode, all mixed with a philosophical layer and a message that is actually unique and relevant. It was all in there, but drowned in bad execution. It was somewhat painful, but I don't regret watching it."
"teshnair","7","4","23","26 July 2014"," A voyage through unknown territories
","I enjoyed the movie very much. I have seen better movies, yes. I would not rate this as the best movie, no. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie. I liked it for its original idea, its bold courage to explore that idea and make it entertaining enough. <br/><br/>I do realize that the movie may not be everyone's cup of tea. It moves away from the conventional approach; the way how the storyline has been handled may leave some disgruntled at the time spent watching this. I am fairly confident that Scarlett's stone-faced performance of Lucy during the second half of the movie may raise critical views on her acting.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe that her performance in the movie was fantastic. One has to compare her portrayal of the initial fear-stricken, vulnerable, victimized, ordinary Lucy in the first half to the over- intelligent, multi-talented, highly-skilled, all-knowing and calculatingly-cold Lucy in the second half to really appreciate her performance. If the portrayal of the first Lucy was heart-wrenching, that of the second Lucy was chilling to the bones. It had to be stone- faced because at the level of knowledge she has then, hardly anything is of consequence, gratifying or painful. Few actors can stand up to a Morgan Freeman performance, but this movie belongs to Scarlett all the way and she surely outscores Morgan by leaps. The role does not do Morgan much justice, but there are a few actors who could have rendered his 10 minute introductory monologue with such clarity, yet keeping the audience's attention. Apart from that, his talent is totally wasted.<br/><br/>The movie is a good take on the concept of the unchartered territories of the human brain and what can be achieved. The movie has further gone in to deconstructing the fundamentals of existence as a factor of Time. There is a logic to it, for there were no Time, we cease to be. We exist because we measure time. The people and world around us matter because at some level we measure them with Time. The scene where Lucy describes this with a car disappearing at sufficient speed clearly depicts this connection, for it is not that the car does not exist but that it is beyond the measurement of time or known coordinates and hence not visible.<br/><br/>The movie leaves with a thought provoking note when Lucy communicates via text on Capt Del Rio's phone - ""I am everywhere"". A subtle reference, for those who chose to believe, on existence of God beyond our measurable limits of time and space. Why He may be everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. For those who chose not to, it is still an apt ending to the movie, because without a time and space, nothing exists as we know unless it can be proved, even if it is a text saying ""I am everywhere""."

","The plot line centres around a popular myth about the human brain, but fails to make it believable. Instead, the script contains about 15-20 mins of pseudo science lecturing by Morgan Freeman, which should, in theory, bolster the premise, but falls miserably as the actual supporting content is pretty ridiculous if you have any basic scientific literacy.<br/><br/>In terms of scenes, there are a couple of long sequences where nothing really happens. You'd be well advised to use these for your bathroom break. The same goes pretty much for the first 10- 15 mins where everyone but Lucy speaks Korean and there are no subtitles. Don't worry, nothing that critical happens.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, I'm not a great expert, but that film doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would pose a particular challenge for actors like Freeman and Johansson. Morgan Freeman reprised his typical (and probably clichéd) role of an authority figure. If you've seen it before, you will see it again. Johansson, on the other hand, had the more challenging task of appearing confident and unemotional, but also likable. <br/><br/>Overall, the plot was uninspiring and the actual writing does little to make it more bearable. There is some nice CGI and a bit of dispersed action and shooting of random people. I didn't like this film and would not recommend it, but YMMV - if you're not too bothered with the details and are looking for a relaxing action film, this may be your thing."
"lmanhkhong","7","3","16","28 July 2014"," Scarlette Johansson nails it!
","Lucy was a thorough blend of action, suspense and dark humor. At least, I found parts of it funny but I didn't hear many others in the theatre laughing with me. I thought it had enough scenes to consider it in the action category, but most people may disagree and say that it was more thought provoking than action packed. Scarlette Johansson is a great actress and she nails it again with this movie. I give her ten stars hands down. I really wish I could give Lucy ten stars overall, but the ending was just terrible. The movie's emphasis circled around how us humans use only 10% of our cerebral capacity. If only the producers used 20% of their cerebral capacity, they could have come up with a much better ending."

","If there are two thing that are annoying, they are pseudo-intellect and pseudo-science. There's only one thing that can make it worse, and that's when it is shoved down your throat in the most pompous and aggressive way. Sure, we can forgive Star Wars for midichlorians, but Lucy is beyond forgiving. It puts forth every debunked myth like it is the most intelligent thing ever said, such as dolphins being more intelligent than humans. And let us not forget Lucy's cringe-worthy speech about how 1 + 1 does not equal 2. And apparently having more brain activity means you lack the capacity to feel emotions, which makes no sense. And does anyone remember how she suddenly knew how the surgeons should be doing their job out of the blue? Even if she was at 100%, that knowledge came from nowhere. I don't think I need to poke out any more flawed logic throughout the film.<br/><br/>Aside from Lucy being a generally unintelligent pile of filth, it is lacking in any artistic quality. The flashbacks to nature throughout the beginning of the movie were so out of place and absurd that it made me laugh out loud. No, it's not that I didn't understand why they were put in the movie. Yes, I get it, she's like a mouse in a trap, but it just didn't work. Scarlett Johansson's performance was hilariously bad as well. How did she go from ""Her"" to this filth? She spent the entire movie twitching and speaking monotone. The movie had basically no story. It simply existed because the director thought it would be cool to see a person progressively get more intelligent, and that's all that happens. The foundation of the movie is intelligence, yet Lucy never says one intelligent thing in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is only good if you want a good laugh. All the great scientists are rolling in their graves right now."

","Decided to go watch this movie as ""Sin City! A dame to kill for"" was not available. Oh my Lord, I should have just got back into the car and gone home. I decided to write this review to balance out the fact that people seem to be giving this a 9 or even 10 stars, with some going to the extremes to say its the best film they have seen (Really????)<br/><br/>First i'd like to say I've given this film 3 Stars for three reasons, <br/><br/>1. Morgan Freeman. Again the man delivers a great performance, dazzling us with his voice, epic timing and delivery.<br/><br/>2. Special Effects. Which are fair throughout<br/><br/>3. Scarlett Johansson. Pleasing to the eye, does a good job at the beginning but then boring throughout.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the question ""What have Humans done with life on earth"", and you would assume that this is this question that the plot is structured around but in attempting to answer this question the film veers drastically off course. We are lead to believe that Humans only use %10 of our brains and that all we should be striving for is more brain capacity but as Lucy receives more and more brain capacity all she really does with it is destroy every object that gets in her way (including civilians) in a linear mission to some how pass on the information she receives from her heightened brain functions.<br/><br/>The Character development is non existent, as a viewer you feel nothing for the main character. The best that Luc Besson could come up with was a 30 second phone call Lucy has a with her mum about how much she loves her Mum and Dad (This is just lazy film making). This phone call takes place just seconds after Lucy kills an innocent member of the public having surgery on the operating table, then we are led to believe that the doctors agree with the half assed reason for the killing and then help her with her own surgery. <br/><br/>The Film then clumsily takes us on a cheap roller coaster ride where Lucy receives more brain capacity which has unexplained consequences, such as telekinesis and interacting with phone receptions (What???). We meet more boring and unnecessary characters that provide no real interest to the plot and are just more meat for the grinder, before the film finally ends by Lucy hitting %100 capacity and it is reviled what Humans are capable of when they hit this magical feet of evolution???...... What is it I hear you Say? Well i won't spoil the end but believe me that you are just left with an unbelievable feeling that you are expected to believe this ""God awful tripe"" is what Humans should be striving for. <br/><br/>The film ends with some really good special effects but fails miserably to convey its message to the audience.

","Lucy is a good film but maybe a bit over ambitious. Saying that, Luc Besson has succeeded in the past with similar gambles such as Nikita. In this case we have Sci-fi and Nikita mixed together as we count up to an unintentionally drugged up Scarlet Johansen increasing in sensory powers.<br/><br/>Chased by some conglomerate hoods, we have explosions and chases which in the usual Besson way are spectacular and exciting. Our lead is perfect in the role and is smart, sexy and convincing.<br/><br/>However the problem is the story. Okay it's Sci-fi but it just stretches things too far to get too interested. The dialogue helps to give an interesting explanation of the pseudo science behind the film, but you don't need a degree to see the holes which hurts any credibility. The ending in particular seems to have been conjured up in an afternoon after a struggle to figure how to end it.<br/><br/>Overall fine but didn't fully hit its target. Still though you'll enjoy it if you give it half a chance."
"nicolechan916","4","2","9","25 August 2014"," Amazing effects and a great concept but a terrible story.
","Firstly, the main reason why I found this movie terrible is probably because I know that the ""humans only use 10% of their brains"" nonsense to be, well, nonsense. If we only used 10% of our brains, that means we wouldn't even have our basic five senses as the control of these senses are scattered all over the brain. From a scientific standpoint, it is just not logical. And even if we pretend for a second that this is possible, unlocking the full potential of our brains wouldn't allow us to control matter or other people, or feel the world and its existence. This is why I found this terrible.<br/><br/>The reason I say it has a great concept is based on the drugs entering the system and giving her abilities. I feel that without all that content on the brain they could have done so much more if they had just added more to her background. The trailer itself looks really promising, but in reality the trailer is better than the film. <br/><br/>The story had a lot of scientific information added in, but it had a lot of philosophical material in it too which I did not get the relevance. Plus it contrasted scenes of the wild when she was being captured. Personally, I do not like juxtaposition of scenes that are not actually from the film to be in a film. It just emphasizes the fact that what I'm watching is not real.<br/><br/>Even though I did not like this movie, the visual effects were still incredible. The colours were visually stimulating and complimented the movie well. Though the acting was not terrible, I felt it to be a bit dry.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com."

"CowherPowerForever","5","2","9","31 July 2014"," What Happens When You Reach 100 percent?
","Lucy is a film directed by Luc Besson who is known for bigger action films. In the past I have enjoyed some of his film like LÃ©on: The Professional and The Fifth Element, however recently he hasn't been directing much, only writing for franchises like Transporter and Taken. While his films are usually action packed, this film is a prime example of squeezing all of the action into the trailer. This is my review of Lucy.<br/><br/>Luc Besson not only directs this film, but he also wrote it as well. As I just mentioned above Besson has been writing a lot of big action movies lately like Taken one and two, and also 3 Days To Kill. I enjoy all three of those films, some more so than others, but they are generally fun. This film lacked that fun especially in the script. The characters are not developed well at all, and frankly caring for Lucy never really happens. We just want to see action, and instead we are forced an insane plot(nothing wrong with that in a film like this) and far too much useless banter. With a short runtime, this film suffers even more. With lack of character development and such a short runtime, its a wonder we understood anything Besson wanted from this film. So in the writing department Besson gets a below average rating.<br/><br/>Now onto the directing, also done by Luc Besson. While Besson has taken some time off from directing action films, he generally knows how to do it. The same can easily be said here. While his script fails to bring in much action at all, when the action does hit(mainly towards the end of the film) it is filmed amazingly. The acting that Besson helps guide on the screen is not bad, but not great. Scarlett Johansson as Lucy and Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman lead this cast with some fine secondary actors like Amr Waked and Min-sik Choi(who plays a fantastic bad guy). Sadly as I mentioned in my comments about the script, the characters are so poorly progressed that caring about them never really happens. Jonansson delivers a nice performance and I will give her credit for that, and credit as well to Besson for leading her in the right direction with this film. So, overall Besson does a passable job directing as he leads a nice action scene towards the end of the film that looks amazing, but sadly the action is almost not there minus a couple very short scenes.<br/><br/>Eric Serra composed the score for this film, he has previously scored such films as Arthur and the War of the Two Worlds and The Lady, both directed by Luc Besson. This score is generally forgettable. When the action heats up(it happens so seldomly that don't expect much) his score gets much better, and is passable. As a whole the score is nothing to brag about though.<br/><br/>Overall if you were expecting a bigger action film, then you will be disappointed. If you were looking for a film with at least a somewhat good story, then you will also be disappointed. The film however is really short(just over eighty minutes without credits) and moves by pretty quickly without much drag, so if you feel the need to waste some time, then this film may be worth it.<br/><br/>5/10"

","After spending 24 hours reflecting on ""Lucy"":<br/><br/>I've seen some movies in which monsters become heroes, and some in which heroes become monsters. I've seen many movies with characters that are both heroic and monstrous.<br/><br/>I think ""Lucy"" is the only movie I've seen in which we're asked to accept a monster as a hero even though she is consistently monstrous and never once heroic.<br/><br/>The only theme I can find in this movie is that, in the fight to survive, might makes right and the lives of less gifted or less powerful people are disposable. The monster becomes immortal at the end of the story, which is ambiguous at best - on the one hand she is no longer rampaging through the city streets endangering public safety, but at the same time she has never shown any ethical concern whatsoever for anyone's well-being but her own.<br/><br/>We are told to likewise pursue individual immortality, apparently with utter disregard for the needs and integrity of others. Immortality in this case is defined entirely in terms of biological and intellectual information - moral and emotional information is completely neglected. In this light, the ambiguity of the ending is terrifying. This could be a very successful monster movie if writer/director Luc Besson had given any indication at all that he was aware of the terrifying moral and ethical implications of his story. Unfortunately he seems to think Lucy is far from being a monster, but is in fact an ideal woman: smart, beautiful, powerful, and devoid of empathy or righteousness.<br/><br/>6/10 for its depth and deftness of storytelling"

","Lucy has cool story to build. It has potential but it failed largely.<br/><br/>Lets Talk About the good things. The action is good. There is a scene in the plane for 3 minute with Lucy's body skin coming off that was cool. And another scene with Lucy Driving that was fantastic. <br/><br/>Now with the negative things. This movie Starts Suddenly and in the start there is a scene with a mouse going towards a mouse trap for 3 seconds only to give us a hint that Lucy is going into a trap. And through Out the next 1 hour they are showing us this type stuff. <br/><br/>Lucy got the ability from the drugs which is put inside her belly to transport. while he is in the captive of the drug transporters despite knowing that she has drugs in her belly they kicked her there didn't care about the drugs or transportation and Lucy got powers.<br/><br/>These Powers started as believable but as the movie goes by became totally unbelievable and over the top.<br/><br/>The dialogues are cheap some times. Even when the character of Morgan Freeman comes to know that she has the ability to unlock the brain potential 100% with drugs his reaction was just sympathy to her that's bad script writing and that's through all over the movie.<br/><br/>She did things which was believable if it is shown to us properly but instead of that things just happens and Lucy is in her 100% and She travels through time.At the end she described things which seems and feels totally over the top.<br/><br/>In the Lucy Is nor horrible neither good. Its A flat movie with great concept but feels over the top concept because of bad directing and script....5/10....."

","I recommend this one, not because it's *good*, but just because it is so completely bonkers, I couldn't help but enjoy it. This movie is not ""everything but the kitchen sink"", this movie is everything *and* the kitchen sink, with some dinosaurs and shootouts thrown in there too. Johansen plays a tourist caught in a drug smuggling operation, forced to be the drug mule, and carry the experimental new drug out of the country, hidden in her abdomen. When the packet of blue crystals and goo burst inside her, the fun begins. <br/><br/>From then on, her character's IQ skyrockets, she reads people's minds, and the film becomes a series of explosions, shootouts, and wild chase scenes, as Morgan Freeman basically narrates (in this most ridiculous musical montages(!)) what, theoretically, happens if a human could access 100% of their brain, and while Scarlett Johansson's character basically becomes The Terminator.<br/><br/>Bright and colourful, with good effects work, and a hilarious car chase, filled with stunts and car flips, and sexy Johansen in the lead make this fun and watchable, but its lead girl is unsympathetic and robotic, its logic is absurd, and its villains weak.<br/><br/>One of this movies that can be fun if watched in the right frame of mind, but also one of the oddest films ever made."

"goldencut","4","1","3","9 November 2015"," Cola and popcorn
","I started watching this movie with no idea what's it about or even what genre it is. The beginning was quite promising although the clips with animals seemed somewhat clumsy or inelegant way to get ideas across. I still expected a decent, adult movie. S. Johansson's acting seemed bad and I wondered if she was chosen because of her looks or because of her fame, but as the story progressed it all started to make sense. It's a teen movie, a typical Hollywood superhero flick for paying masses who JUST want to eat candy and popcorn and drink carbonated sugar water while being lightly entertained. Although IMHO the movie is not very entertaining... A sci-fi movie doesn't mean that viewer has to automatically suspend all disbelief and there's nothing more to expect than special effects and two-dimensional superheroes. Just take ""Perfect sense"" as an example - there can be layers, thought and so on. In contrast this one just had some stuff sprinkled on it that made it look like it might have some thought and ideas behind it, but at closer look there's nothing really there. It's like the snacks and drinks sold in the cinemas that taste and smell like something edible but are mostly artificial and not really good for you. Despite being fake they sell and bring in the profit, and my guess is so did this movie."
"floatingpolarbear","6","1","3","8 November 2015"," A bizarre, sometimes interesting mosaic
","The only interesting parts are the ones dealing visually with the theories about increasing intelligence and powers. Thankfully these occupy most of the movie. The rest is some gangster filler with good actors that have nothing to do but look gangstery and punch and shoot. The movie goes philosophically beyond reason and abruptly stops wowing as a result. Also it does not deal with the obvious issue that this compound is now imminently available and many people can be like Lucy so now what, complete human crisis. It also bothered me that it's in the same vein as Ocean's 11 and Bourne Identity, rich people making movies about multiple luxurious foreign locations as if we've all been there done that. Most people are paycheck to paycheck and this jet-setter international shooting location style is something that is revealing about the ultra rich lifestyle of the movie-maker and his milieu rather than something necessary to the story."
"freshclean-66-318608","6","1","3","17 March 2015"," A Bit Far-fetched.
","I'm going to keep it real. The main reason I picked this movie up was Lucy wasn't the best of films but it wasn't bad. It started off pretty good actually, with some nice action and suspense, it kept me kind of interested. It was when the movie got towards the end when everything for me got kind of far-fetched. From the beginning, this film could have easily started a creationism vs evolution debate. That's one of the things that made this film start off pretty good actually. Morgan Freeman's acting in this film was awesome as usual and Scarlett Johansson playing a kind of super hero in this film was great as well. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is caught up in a drug smuggling deal that accidentally turns her into a super human then goes after her captors and is aided by Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). Like I said earlier, it starts off pretty good but towards the end it gets kind of far-fetched. Now I'm not a neuropsychologist but I think there are some feats that are impossible even if you actually used 100% of your brain capacity. I know you might say well it's a science fiction movie, but even if I'm watching a science fiction film I would still like for the laws of physics to be respected."

","I saw this movie last night with some friends. I must admit the first 30 minutes of the film were simply fantastic. The pace and promise showed initially had us all very involved in the film and excited to where the film would take us. Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman were exceptional for this opening act.<br/><br/>The reason I gave it a 6 was pacing. The story proceeds much too quickly in the middle 3rd and Scarlett Johansson become almost robotic. The loss of human qualities proceeds much too quickly. This caused me and my group to care very little about her fate. Morgan Freeman was noticeably absent during this portion and his exceptional acting ability was sorely missed.<br/><br/>The final 3rd of the movie was simply OK. Some will like the ending while other will abhor it. I will not give any spoilers but my opinion is that the writers and directors tried to be too clever and failed to deliver an ending worthy of the cast."

"alistairc_2000","1","2","10","20 September 2014"," Sexist BS fromTransporter producer
","Lucy The new movie by Luc Besson. Luc is both good and bad as a writer/director. He has made many fine movies in the form of Leon, the fifth element and Nikita. In his career he has made well over 10 movies but has wrote and produced far more. Taken was great but Taken 2 was just a watered down version of the first movie. Lucy is the same Nikita plot item reworked yet again but as this is now an SF movie can he do it justice?<br/><br/>No. It certainly looks the part and it has Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett gets to wear an adorable black dress and that for me was the highlight of the movie. The problem is the plot and the way it needs certain characters to drive the plot. Scarlett is a dizzy blonde who gets sucker punched into delivering some drugs to cartel. She later wakes to find them sown into her. After she is brutalised further by her captors the drugs leak out and she becomes a super woman. So what does Scarlett do? She goes back and bumps off the underlings of the cartel but leaves the really evil ring leader alive. Is this an intelligent move? No but it is needed to give this creaky plot a driver. Scarlett knows she is going to become the star child (out of 2001), the zenith of the human race. She will be at once the most intelligent woman on the planet and perhaps the stupidest. Well this bosh was written by a man. What do you expect? <br/><br/>So she is going to have a brain the size of a planet (and in Marvin the paranoid android territory) what does she do with it? Very little really. She is going to evolve in 24 hours and she needs all the drugs sent from cartel to evolve to the 100 percent mark. She devises a cunning plan and gets every guy she speaks to to do her bidding no questions asked. Though they are French so this might explain it. She arranges for the drugs to get sent to Paris but they are taken to the most unsecured hospital known to man. So when a load of Chinese rejects from Reservoir dogs turn up no one bats an eyelid. Lucy gets to the airport and then has to drive quickly to hospital. Cue the total unnecessary car chase through Paris. We have seen the Bourne Identity so we know how to get it right. Also Luc has tried the endless car chases with his turgid Taxi and Transporter series. Now there could be some sly digs at women being useless drivers in this part. She drives down all the one way streets. Causes loads of crashes. <br/><br/>Then we get to the part of the movie she is going to ascend but wait what is this the ring leader of the bad guys has got to Paris first? Wow. He is going to get Scarlett one way or another. Blah blah evil terrorist blah blah. This bit of the plot is telegraphs right from the start of the movie. Scarlett aka Lucy turns into various things but ultimately wants to help the human race. If it was my last 24 hours on the planet and I was going to ascend I would get Christopher Lee to get all the great heavy metal bands on the planet to play for me whilst he narrated over it. It is a better ending than this tosh.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a Luc Besson movie in the vein of his opus Transporter. Trashy, cheap and ultimately very UN fulfilling."

In many ways it is reminiscent of the Matrix, Johansson does her Keanu Reeves impression throughout and there is even a white-space scene at the end. There are gunfights and superhero kung-fu, there is also some reality bending pseudo science. However the matrix was pleasant philosophical plausible suspension of sanity where Lucy is just a Michael Bay style lobotomy of reason.<br/><br/>You can almost see the conversation which spawned this movie: Luc Besson being told to make a Superhero Movie because 'Everyone wants Superhero movies now'. Luc saying that he only has a stock gangsters/drug deals and car chases movie ready to go and then they just stick the superhero stuff on top of the stock gangster schlock with no one realising that the two genres make each other look bonkers.<br/><br/>...We are never even shown a downside of this substance.

In order to have plot holes, some sort of vaguely feasible plot is required. No such effort was made here.<br/><br/>What on earth was all that wildlife documentary footage about? OK, yes, the prof's lecture was boring and verging on insane but did the editors really think that sticking in film of big cats mating would hold our attention better?<br/><br/>Special effects developed for Inception at least made sense in Inception (not that that movie made much sense) but were distractingly and bizarrely out of place here.<br/><br/>Similarly, the power of the mind to pin people to the ceiling and stop bullets made internal sense in the logic of The Matrix, but stealing the effects and imagery and bunging them in where they make no sense at all.. why?<br/><br/>I am sure the references to The Matrix and 2001 were conscious homages rather than just theft and I confess I did enjoy the whole 2001 redux bit in the last reel.<br/><br/>What mildly bothered me but seriously upset my female companions was our ""superhero's"" total disregard for human life and suffering.

"blossoms-733-387580","5","2","10","23 August 2014"," More Psychopathic, Murderous Asian Bad Guys
","The biggest problem that I have with this movie is its portrayal of Asian people. Really, Mr. Besson, do you hate Asians this much? Every single movie that comes out of Hollywood these days seems to show evil, murderous Asian people. A white woman can be the good guy, an African American man can be the good guy, but other than Jackie Chan, Asians can never be kind and decent. Thank you, Hollywood, for your unerringly racist depictions of Asians since 1914. That is one thing we can always count on from Hollywood--its consistent manipulation of public opinion to support US foreign policy goals. The current one, if you haven't noticed, is to depose of the current North Korean leader. Isn't it interesting that while this film is shot in Taiwan the bad guys are Korean? Another upcoming film starring James Franco and Seth Rogan will feature the two actors attempting to assassinate the current North Korean dictator, Kim Jung Un. Is it mere coincidence or does Hollywood want to manipulate your opinions and turn them against Koreans? If they manage to convince you that all Asian people are bad, it makes selling the idea of invading North Korea to you much easier and it makes hating all Asian people easier. I guess that as an Asian American no matter how good I am at speaking my native language (English), no matter how many of my family members risk their lives to serve our country in the Navy, no matter how long my family has been here (since 1960s), no matter how many times I volunteer at local homeless shelters and soup kitchens I will always be seen as either a socially awkward geek or a crazed, gun-toting psychopathic gangster. Stop participating in the hate, Luc Besson. Whether you despise a foreign leader or not, whether you want him to step down or not, the United States does NOT get to decide who will run a country or who won't. Unless it wants a more powerful country to arrive on its shores one day and start attacking the nation's capital. Don't think it's OK to make a movie about a couple of nincompoops trying to assassinate a foreign leader and think the same won't be done back to you! Do unto others as you want them to do unto you."

It kind of worked and it kinda didn't. <br/><br/>I can't figure out for the live of me what is up with Johannson. I have to laud her for taking roles that aren't designed to favor any acting skill but then, maybe she only has a pretty face. Maybe disembodied is what she really likes to play but she can't find a good zombie vehicle, <br/><br/>This movie, like ""Transcendence"" tries to be a thinking man's film directed by Jackie Chan. The Chinese/Korean or amorphous Asian gang runs around popping caps with alarming disregard for anybody stopping them. OK, the French are a bunch of frog-eating pussies but they're just not as feckless as presented in this movie. French soldiers have been heroic and French angst is legendary. <br/><br/>This kind of movie would have worked better without the Asian gang and some real thoughtful examination from so called scholars who are about as inquisitive as a mosh pit participant. Luc Beeson is a talented director but none of that was on display here. This is comic book action, plot and dialog with a storyline that could have been really soul searching but since there are no souls, why search?<br/><br/>The scene where Lucy outlines the meaning of life and the unity of the universe is so badly acted that even Morgan Freeman's prodigious acting skills couldn't save the scene. WTF? Time, which doesn't really exist is the only thing that exists? Puleeeze! What universe are we living in? Oh wait, it's comics without the Valkyrie-like breastplate but with the terrors of a big brain. It's ""Donovans Brain"" or ""The Brain From Planet Arous"" but a brain inside of a delectable package. The brain is not all disembodied and yucky. <br/><br/>According to this movie, we only use 10% of our brain but if, by magic, we could access say 20% we could stop being Muggles. At 30% we could make other people act like puppets without strings. At 40% would could move inanimate objects around with ease.<br/><br/>But how to we get that brain working? Superspeed that is the same color as the crack cooked in Breaking Bad. The evil cartel has somehow got a bunch of this evil stuff and turns our hapless Lucy into a drug mule by sewing a packet of this super stuff into her body. Then one of the thugs decides it's a good idea to kick her in the stomach when she won't give him a blow job. The bag bursts and Lucy survives a massive drug overdose to become the smartest little hottie who can't drive since Cherry 2000. Oh wait, Lucy can't drive but in a nod to French director Claude Lalouch who hooked a camera onto a Ferrari and had a buddy, who happened to be a formula 1 driver, race at 140+ though the streets of Paris, she jumps behind the wheel and drives like a pro. And why does she do this? She does this because they are late. Oh My. The rabbit will not be the last. <br/><br/>OK, enough. In ""Under the Skin,"" a previous non-acting role we at least get to see her nude. Here, we just get to see light come out of her mouth in what must have been a nod to ""Coneheads."" <br/><br/>Of course, at 100% of brain usage, she disappears and becomes one with everything after letting us know through images that everything happens at the same time and that there is no time which is the unifying factor in the universe according to ever so thoughtful Morgan Freeman. <br/><br/>The movie is lost in itself because neither the writer or director have any idea of the subject matter. It's not even speculative in the Sci-Fi sense and there's absolutely no drama in this drama. It's La Brea tarpitty kind of oozy stuff that supposedly is a new computer and it melts, gosh, everything while Lucy absorbs it all with the aplomb of a supermodel at a Hollywood party: Drunk and stoned but looking great. <br/><br/>M 3 At least the assistant to the Asian gang leader was entertaining.

(Or it's wrong?)<br/><br/>The movie is undeniably entertaining with a nice fast pace, and great cutting. The tension is kept through the whole film and if you like Bessons style you will appreciate the little jokes and comically crushing police cars.<br/><br/>On the other hand if fantasy and magic is handled like science with life changing philosophy you get nonsense out of it, and if the script in addition is full with logical loops, then the whole gets annoying. The more you think about it the more annoying.<br/><br/>It usually doesn't come out well when the director can't decide what movie he wants to make and as his attitude changes, some scenes are of a thriller, some of a comedy, some of a comic movie and we get clips from Morgan Freemans own Through the Wormhole with the man himself. Sometimes Besson wants us to believe and think hard (with rhetorical questions like ""What did we archived as a civilization so far?"" then in the next scene he wants us to forget all sense and just watch as our heroine dissipates ""because under undesired circumstances cells choose immortality"" (Simon says what?) or crawls in agony on the ceiling like a possessed bat because of a synthetic version of a natural hormone like stuff. It doesn't work like that I can't switch it on and off that fast! I won't believe to Morgan but get angry on the nonsense!<br/><br/>And of course onto that come the loops like: - Really no one figured it out so far that the blue drug makes you superhuman? - When it became evident, no one else think it would be nice to try it out as well? No one is concerned of the widespread of it, though it is well known from homicide-forgiving surgeons to undereducated mob leaders. - If she can control time, matter and her cells at a molecular level like an X-men all-star, why the worry about anything? We got a god. At least she is safe. - And of course no one makes a big deal of cops dying anywhere or cars crashing, random massacre in a hospital or university. Just our friendly detective is concerned a bit, while fighting with his best pals against a horde of equally expandable Chinese gangsters. (who don't have silly get out plans just want to kill the girl and/or die trying) - Oh and I forget to mention, the whole way Lucy get into this does not make any sense. I don't want to spoiler much, but but if you start asking simple questions like Who? or Why? then it comes out that its all senseless.<br/><br/>It's not the first time a film is tried to be made on the concept of an average-Joe (Jane) gets super-intelligent, and we face the problem that the creators didn't have any of that serum. In Limitless they at least stayed sober and tried hard, here they just substituted it with other hallucinogens...<br/><br/>Enjoy the result!"

","Lucy is about a young woman who ends up with a special drug inside her body that let's her use more than 10% of her brain. A lot of people have stated this film is a ""smart"" film and that regular summer audiences didn't like it because they didn't understand it. Just because a film deals with science doesn't automatically make it a ""smart"" film. To make a movie a ""smart"" film it actually has to have some intelligence put into it. The title character never seemed to evolve. Sure in the beginning she was a party girl and she progressed into the unstoppable machine but ultimately we only see two sides of Lucy the party girl and the ass kicking girl. There is never a happy medium. That leads to another point. As the film progresses Lucy begins to get stronger and stronger ultimately to the point where she's unstoppable and that's where the movie begins to get boring. Sure there are car chase scenes and shoot outs but if the main character isn't in danger then what's the point? Sure you have supporting characters but we never see them get fleshed out so we are left with no one to really care about. Th film also doesn't benefit from a 90 minute running time. I honestly think the film could have been slightly better with about 20 or so minutes added on of character development. The most redeeming quality of this film though is Scarlett Johansson. Mrs Johansson has a very bright future ahead to become a huge female action hero and a very great actress in general. From the very beginning you believed this was Lucy never for a minute did you feel it was Scarlett Johansson playing Lucy. She turned from normal party girl to badass in a snap of the fingers with the utmost poise.

Also there was enough for the more intellectually oriented to think about and contemplate some of the scientific fantasy sci-fi aspects as they as well enjoy the movie for what it is. <br/><br/>Do not expect the movie to be based on solid proved current scientific understandings with its premises or how such events come to occur; that is why it is a sci-fi fantasy. Saw so many complaints in reviews here and other sites about it not being 100% scientifically correct etc. Tralala...<br/><br/>Too often many adults seemingly lose imagination and become rigid as they get stuck on technicalities and are only able to relate to their understandings which often is what they find comfort in and/or seem to just seek to show they know better and basically fault find in a seeming sad attempt to prove their intellectual superiority instead just allowing the mind to stay flexible and enjoy such genres as is. There are many free documentaries and as well free college lectures widely available on the web if you are seeking such; this genre if for enjoyment by many demographics with varied interest and skill levels.<br/><br/>Not being mentally locked in is why kids often make profound observations on things about a issue that have been right before us but we adults seemingly have missed or can not see. This is why kids often have uncharacteristic insights that we adults often miss because we have lost contact with our own imagination or ability to look at things from differing perspectives and points of view as we have failed in keeping and nourishing an open imagination into and throughout adulthood. Guess that is why many new ideas, technologies or re-purposed old technologies and as well many key scientific discoveries occur by young people, if child or adult. That is why we must keep open flexible minds, learn to listen and not just hear and be open to what youth notes and support their understanding without causing them to lose their imaginations and creativity. Easier said than done, I know.<br/><br/>Just enjoy; it is a sci-fi movie which is for fun as well some thought provoking aspects if you so choose to allow such or wish such. This movie is not going to win a Oscar; but hey it was okay and not a total waste of time and many seemed to enjoy the movie in the audience I was in from what I observed.<br/><br/>Thanks and lets be nice to each other; life is cruel enough without any help from us in making is more hurtful, of which we should know better anyway..."

","The core premise of ""Lucy"" is fundamentally flawed. Lucy is inadvertently given a drug which allows her to access more than 10% of her brain, giving her superhuman powers. For the record, it is NOT TRUE that humans only use 10% of their brain. If you replace the phrase ""unlocked x% of her brain"" with ""unlocked x% of superhuman capability"" or something like that, it's much more bearable. Further, the movie presents itself as a thinker movie, when in reality it is more of an abstract expressionist movie. It doesn't give you literal or realistic explanations for things (anything, really), instead it gives you flashy visual effects designed to give you the sense of what is really going on (which are, admittedly, really cool and very well done). The acting is solid, though as an actor I'd be thinking ""this is bullshit, but I'll say it anyway"". Luc Besson's wacky and weird style with a laser focus on small details remains present, but he has done and could do better."

","The issue with this movie starts with the plot being so mushed together that you find yourself not caring what happens to the main character. The movie itself struggles to establish any kind of continuity and switches from shooting up people and car chases to thinking about what the future holds for mankind. Lucy herself isn't really a likable character as the viewer is thrown into her life being a hooker to being a part cyborg like human with no real likable qualities. As for Morgan Freeman. I'm not sure why he agreed to be in this movie. His character is under developed and by the time he meets Lucy, there really isn't any point to the interaction. She simply could have created the flash drive without him present. The visual effects of the flash forwards scenes were good. That being said it wasn't enough to save this movie. The French police Captain served no purpose and was introduced so late in the movie I found it hard to believe that all the sudden he cared for Lucy and she somewhat cared for him. The ending felt forced and left me saying ""Is that it?"" Wait and Netflix this movie."

","This movie has a lot of movement for most of the story. But suddenly, the end just falls flat. It doesn't totally, but the ending in no way measures up to how you got there.<br/><br/>Scarlett/Lucy is a nobody in Taiwan with a loser boyfriend. She gets involved in this drug deal and next thing you know, the ride begins. This movie is ultra-fast paced, and seems to accelerate as Lucy's powers expand. There is a lot of blood and violence here, so be warned. The story is good, it keeps you guessing where this is going. The French policeman, Del Rio, is superb - he knows how to act, and how to let Lucy do her thing. Morgan Freeman plays the wise professor who is somewhat shocked to see his theories live before his eyes.<br/><br/>There is a lot of killing and somewhat over the top bloodletting. Many chase scenes too, one of the best taking place in downtown Paris. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as Lucy. She has this look of, well, you don't know what I'm going to do next, but I know I'm capable of doing whatever I want. Kind of reminds me a bit of Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill series, without the swords.<br/><br/>However, you are ramped up to reach the end, and then, splat. It falls flat. You could hear the audience sigh....that's it?? Yep, that's it. At 90 mins start to end, that's at least a tidy pace. But I think Besson could have taken the last 15 mins, shortened it to 5, and spent that extra time adding a bit more depth. Leaving a movie at the end with a --that's it?-- feeling is deflating.<br/><br/>I still give it a 7/10 because for 95 percent of your time, you are glued to you seat. It's worth a look, but it really could have been better with a better, more well-thought-out ending. That's it...enjoy"
"heatsink98","5","2","11","25 July 2014"," Great visuals but missing a solid plot.
","Short Version: Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, is a student/party girl in Taipei who hooks up with an unsavory character, Richard. Richard locks a briefcase onto Lucy's wrist and sends her to make a delivery. Lucy ends up as a coerced drug mule and is exposed to the drugs she carries, which naturally give her super powers. Lucy spends the rest of the movie tracking down the other drug mules to ingest the chemicals they carry, while evading the gangsters who initially grabbed her. She plans to use the drugs to push herself to 100% brain usage, because that's when the magic happens, apparently.<br/><br/>The film has a decent initial hook which plays out like an origin story for a regular superhero, but things don't go anywhere after that. Lucy chases down the other drugs, but her character rapidly becomes unstoppable, which doesn't lend well to showing a character struggling to succeed. There are plenty of gunfights and Matrix-like scenes of digital weirdness mixed with reality, but the show is just a veneer with no substance underneath.<br/><br/>The science espoused by Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman is a mishmash of facts bent with fiction, particularly the main premise of the story about the percentage of brain use in humans. Lucy's speech and demeanor become more robotic as her brain usage increases, but many of the characters have wooden dialog as well that is way too on the nose.<br/><br/>Verdict: The movie is missing a true struggle by its protagonist, and the ending goes nowhere. It's worth buying a ticket if you're just looking for a shallow film with flashy gunfights but not much substance underneath, and you can tolerate sketchy science."

","Prepare for a review from someone who uses more that 1.0% of his/her brain capacity. Scary? It should not be so. This movie, while being based on an interesting theory claiming that humans do not use more than 10% of their ""brain powers"" caters to the usual, common audience that hardly uses 0.001% of the thinking power given to them. First of all, I do like Luc Besson and Scarlett Johansson, so I have nothing ""personal"" against them. I DO hate all those endless close-ups of Morgan Freeman. All he does is this: he speaks decent English SLOWLY while keeping a serious face. All of his roles are like this. The idea behind this movie? Is there one? Aside from a metric tonne of rather inexpensive SFX, there is this poorly hidden ILLEGAL DRUG PROMOTION that is intended to make one think the following: ""IF ONE OVERDOSES ONESELF ON SOME UNKNOWN, OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL BUT PROMISING-NAMED SUBSTANCE, THEN ONE MIGHT JUST AS WELL ACHIEVE SOMETHING LIKE GOD'S POWERS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE"". As far as anyone who is NOT ALWAYS on drugs thinks, this is the idea that is being promoted by this movie. Really, unless you are an uneducated junkie or an underage fan of a cheap movie visual SFX, then you might probably figure out that no matter how much of your brain capacity you manage to control, it would still NOT make you a god of some sort, it would NOT make you capable of controlling anything else short of your own ability to memorize, analyze, and learn. THIS IS IT. The rest is nonsense. Unless you start abusing illegal drugs and find yourself being capable of controlling the court, the jury, the law, the space-time continuum, it all ends when the drugs are out of your system and you are in jail. So, in short, just SAY NO TO DRUGS AND TO THIS MOVIE!"

","A synthesized chemical gives our protagonist a way to use his brain beyond his normal share. With that, he becomes popular and rich. Wait, that's the plot of Bradley Cooper movie 'Limitless'. Well, in Lucy, synthesized CPH4 makes our beautiful Protagonist practically ""GOD"". It means, she is like Neo without sentinels or Superman without Kryptonite. Yet, her decisions takes this movie from a mere 30-minute story to 90 minutes movie. Lucy is an action,Sci-Fi flick directed by Luc Besson, whom once I admired because of the movies like Leon and Nikitha. Fair enough, he made an entertaining flick, still a head-scratching, exhausting one.<br/><br/>Even before I decided to watch this movie, I read about the criticisms it was having due to some inaccuracies about some scientific facts. So, I left my scientific curiosity out of the hall. Still, I couldn't betray my logic when I was going through the movie. Take it, CPH4 makes a person invincible. It gives her x-ray vision, agility, even ability to time travel.Hell, I even adjusted to the idea that Lucy is the mother of us all, and she is everywhere. But, why would someone, who is willing to kill a number of henchmen in split seconds, left the only person who will give her a threat alive at the first place. Then there is the instant Chinese translation. At one point she shoots a guy in the legs because he didn't speak English. In the next moment she can actually read Mandarin from nowhere.<br/><br/>Granted, visually Lucy is a promising watch, and have some appreciable philosophical undercurrents. But, when a movie tries to play with a lot of cards inside a specific circle, the results will be more misses than hits. For Lucy, it was really a miss, which could've been better. As a final word, Limitless, even though shares a similar environment, was a decent watch. But Lucy here, makes Limitless an instant classic."

The premise of the film (we use only 10% of our brains) is total wives tale BS. If you know this going in, like I do, it makes this thing even more absurd because of the crap they attribute from 20-100% brain function as an excuse to brazen their special effects weirdo ""mind-blowing"" visuals and existential concepts.<br/><br/>If that were not enough pukable storytelling in itself, the film wreaks of gratuitous unaccounted for carnage in human life and property to make you, oh yeahpuke! Our heroine's car chase through city streets cause ginormous crashes and carnage realistically involving hundreds of innocent adults and children in car seats and are totally ignored as if no real people inhabit this make believe world. If you're a first person game shooter, then this is not an issue for you. In one scene our heroine actually shoots some innocent nobody on an operating table in an Asian hospital just to make room for herself! The morality of this action is not even a twinkle in the storyteller's eye and is not presented to take away an iota of sympathy from our heroic Amazonian babe.

","Luc Besson, the director responsible for Leon the Professional, Nikita, and the Fifth Element, crashes and burns in his latest film ""Lucy"".<br/><br/>For such a brilliant director, I was expecting so much more from a film that seemed interesting but ultimately lacked enthusiasm, with special effects on the screen to wow the audience in a bid to distract them from the lacklustre storyline.<br/><br/>What could we do with 100% brain capacity? That is a very interesting question, but the question is never answered in a fully satisfying way. Scarlet Johansson does a decent job as Lucy, but the wasted opportunity of the movie was Min-Sik Choi. A fabulous Korean actor, who was given a role which had no depth or purpose. He was a villain, but was never a match for Lucy and her new found powers, which took away all tension and threat that the film had going for it, brilliantly, in the first few minutes (before their meeting).<br/><br/>I cant help but feel extremely disappointed! Visually its a stunning film, but you would come to expect more purpose from a director who has achieved so much better in the past."

Lucy becomes a mix of The Matrix special effects and Residential Evil Video game story line. How can Lucy have god like powers from using more of her brain? Too much for the audience to believe/absorb. Second half, Lucy fights with video game special effects, which is a lazy way to end a story, which had no ending.

"Al_The_Strange","8","2","12","31 July 2014"," Lucy Review
","Popular scientific myth claims that human beings only use ten percent of their brains. Modern research tells us that we really use every part of our brain in subtle ways. And yet, isn't it remarkable to consider the possibility that there is room for human consciousness to become something greater than it already is? In this film, Lucy is an average person who unwittingly becomes the next step in human evolution, who uses more and more of her brain capacity in a struggle to survive and evolve. As she exponentially grows in power, she becomes able to control her mind, her body, other matter, energy, space, and ultimately time. Which, of course, is completely ridiculous and unbelievable, no matter how many neurons Lucy fires off. But it does make for a whimsical ""what if"" scenario, doesn't it? <br/><br/>The movie's biggest selling point will be in watching Scarlett Johansson kicking a lot of butt with wild superpowers! And there is plenty of action scattered all about: the movie is pretty evenly-littered with big-scale shoot-outs, car chases, and off-the-wall mental powers. However, butt-kicking is not really the movie's primary focus; it's more about chronicling Lucy's journey. Moments in between the action slow down a lot, but it's rarely dull; the film dishes out a plethora of intriguing situations and implications. In doing so, the film will lay out a ton of exposition, which may bore the most critical of viewers, but engage those with a more open mind. Regardless, I found the picture to be trim, to-the-point, and it has just enough momentum to keep it rolling smoothly. I felt it struck the perfect balance in terms of pacing and structure.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the story is an interesting affair, but falls short in numerous ways. The science behind the film's premise is totally unfounded. Other observations are interesting on the surface, but they amount to a few simple messages that audiences may or may not care for. Personally, I was intrigued by the way the film juxtaposed scientific lecture and imagery next to the events. As far as the plot goes, it's a short and simple affair, but with plot holes to be found. The film jumps right into the events without much background to the characters or events (seriously, who manufactured CPH4 to begin with? Who is Lucy and why is she in Taipei to begin with?). A few good scenes keep the characters from becoming total cardboard cutouts, but the film becomes increasingly whack as it goes along, until it reaches a really absurd ending. It leaves off with a rather blunt and empty message.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film is as slick as they come, with superb photography and editing. Acting is swell: I loved watching Scarlett Johansson, even when she does become monotonous. Morgan Freeman pretty much phones it in, serving the same role as he did narrating Through the Wormhole. The various cops and gangsters are decent. Writing is rather unrefined and blunt, but it gets the job done. This production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Special effects look good in some scenes and bad in others. Music is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Lucy is a pretty neat ""what if"" scenario. It's not quite as big of a rip-roaring actioner as you might expect, but it's also not nearly as intellectually challenging as top-tier sci-fi pictures. However, as a crime thriller with a scientific commentary, I believe it's a blast.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Marginal | Film: Very Good)"

","Lucy, as we know, is evolving and quickly becoming able to use more of her brain. The interest in what ideas the writer's may come up with to take advantage of this catchy film idea, keeps the watcher attentive. Unfortunately, as most movies do that just try to push scientific evolutionary theory as the 'main-Sell' of the movie, it ends up lacking in the human-relationships side of the plot. Although there is some romantic interest in Lucy, there seemed a lack of believability in some of the other characters relational-side to humanity. Visually, it is a very Matrix-esc display (Even though it could have used some of that Matrix Sci-Fi-ness to enhance the plot). Great special effects, time stop-motion filming. Good camera effects with zooming, panning, and meshing with computer animations. The down-side was an extensive amount of B-role footage from yesteryear. A lot of time lapse photography/videography, and history lessons that look as though they came straight out of the Encyclopedia Britannica CD ROM collections of a decade ago. They would've been better-off to show more of their A-List actress, Scarlett Johansson. She played the role very well, not overly emotional (as the character dictated) and not so understated that you miss her. Co-staring actors left something to be desired. Johansson is a real up-and- coming film Icon. Her role in Captain America gave her widespread fame amongst a diverse audience. Her audience for Lucy will be considerably smaller. Although doing well at the box office, because of the content and MPAA Rating, Lucy has a lower ceiling for success. However, with Johansson's talent and current appeal to American (male :) action movie audiences, I see Lucy doing very well. I was pleased with the non-stop pace it started with and took right up to the end."

The contents of said case holds a new designer drug that Mr. Jang wishes to distribute throughout Europe using ""volunteers"", Lucy being one of them, as mules by surgically implanting bags of the stuff in their intestines. Lucy's bag ruptures inside her and the drug circulates through her body with unexpected results; she has the ability to access more of her brain than any human has ever before.<br/><br/>What follows is a high octane pursuit of the remaining bags of drugs. Lucy wants them for herself, Mr. Jang would, of course, like his merchandise back. As her brain power increases, we are updated periodically with screen shots informing us of the current percentage of her brain being used. Unfortunately this is where the movie loses it's focus. It becomes a mix of questionable science and gunfights with an ending that is ""The Lawnmower Man"" meets ""Transcendence"".<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned Mr. Freeman yet. His talents, I'm afraid, are wasted here. As Professor Norman, he serves only to inform the audience of the ""science"" involved. <br/><br/>In the end, I feel this would have been a better movie if they stuck to Lucy simply enacting some revenge on the drug lord who enslaved her.

The protagonist was able to utilize 100% of his brain. There were a lot of similar types of subplots as well, but this movie went one step further and tried to sell the scientific aspect of the theory, which is where it became a tad slow. <br/><br/>Obviously a drug alone, cannot and will-not ever help us to reach those cranial heights of power, however the imagery was still unique and creative.

She improved as this film progressed, but during at least the first 30 minutes or so, I would say she was rather poor.

Scarlett plays a girl that ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time, because of her sleazy boyfriend. Min-sik is a drug dealer that enlists Scarlett's unwilling assistance in smuggling a new designer drug through customs-it is surgically implanted into her stomach. After a mis-hap, the drugs get into her system and starts changing her metabolism. It increases her brain usage capacity-most people only use about 10%-and keeps increasing it, so that she gets smarter and smarter and starts developing heightened senses, telekinesis and even a little mind control. Morgan plays a scientist that just happened to be an expert in the human mind, at least 10% of it, and has written papers on what would happen if a person could use more that 10%. So of course, Scarlett wants to meet him and talk shop with him. Amr is a policeman that befriends Scarlett and goes along for the ride of his life.

","Now, I love movies and I have seen plenty worse than Lucy but for some reason this movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I found myself getting genuinely mad as I watched. This movie stars Scarlet Johanson as Lucy who, early on in the movie is kidnapped and used as a drug mule for this drug that enhances people to use 100% of her brains capacity and, after it gets into her bloodstream, it allows her to do all kinds of supernatural things. Plenty of people have a problem with this premise and I don't really. The film Limitless deals with a similar subject and (although Limitless handled it better and more realistically) I could suspend my disbelief for this premise. And after this moment the movie begins to fall apart. First off I was baffled by some of the director's choices in this movie. A situation would occur and it would suddenly cut to a 'symbolic' show of a similar situation happening in nature like a mouse walking towards a trap or cheetahs stalking prey. And it just seemed so... Pretentious. I get what's he's saying but there was not a hint of subtly in this symbolism. And the whole script just seems so convinced it's being new and groundbreaking it forgets to be any of those things. Stuff just happens, it'll display some impressive visual effect with no explanation of what, how or why and you can tell we're supposed to be amazed saying ""what does it all mean?"". I'll tell you what it means: nothing! There are plenty of other annoyances in the movie, Morgan Freeman's inclusion is pointless, the ending just seems preachy and uneventful. It seems like we're watching everything unfold with no stakes or consequence, and that brings me to my main complaint. Lucy is boring and empty because there are no stakes in anything going on. As soon as she gets these powers there is no conflict or competition. People chase her with guns and try to fight but none of it matters, she can just knock out a whole room without any resistance. We are never told her limitations because she has no limitations, she has no threat. Resulting in her character being boring, undeveloped and leaves all the side characters on the side line because there's nothing they can do in this situation. She's so powerful she needs no help and has no competition resulting in the side characters useless and all of the action scenes are boring and unsuspensful. Lets also not forget how Lucy is a terrible person once she takes the drugs, before she was quirky, Scarlet Johanson played her well but as soon as she becomes a god she is just dangerous. She shoots an innocent cab driver in the leg because he doesn't speak English, drives recklessly and even kills a man while he's being operated on because he apparently 'couldn't be saved anyway'. Nice protagonist writing there. And the ending... Oh my god. The ending. I won't spoil anything, mainly because there's nothing to spoil. After all of the efforts and 'conflict' in this movie amounts to nothing and the movie ends as if it's taught us something so deep but all I learned I wasted two hours of my life watching NOTHING If I were you, I'd skip this one but if the premise interested you I recommend Limitless starring Bradley Cooper.

Very little of this story makes sense, especially the second half of the film which is almost entirely action and violence.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing for me is how Morgan Freeman is wasted in a role that could have been filled by anyone. Ultimately his presence brings nothing to the film. 'Lucy' is garbage and will probably only satisfy the die-hard sci-fi fan."

I mean who would want to make an action sci-fi film about Scarlett Johansson who plays Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe a freaking computer system? Scarlett shouldn't even be in these crappy sci-fi action films and just stick with being just Black Widow in the Marvel movies. Of course she was fantastic as Kaa in the CGI live-action version of the Jungle Book too. Seriously the director of this film needs to rethink this so that way he can sleep better at night."

I have no problem with the premise - that humans don't use full potential of their brains, and it would certainly be intriguing to try and construct what would happen if that changed. But why so linear? Why so predictable? There's no intrigue, no conflict, no development. And why equate higher intelligence with emotional impotence? It is a contradiction in itself. Besides, if Lucy was totally emotionless, why would she try so hard to pass her knowledge, which is the sole reason for everything that happens in the movie?<br/><br/>Finally, resorting to dinosaurs for me is a sign that creativity has reached rock bottom.

"anchoreddown","8","1","4","8 May 2016"," It works, if you think you're just human,.... ;-)
","Seems like a film like this should stand out along with the line-up of films from 2014. Either that, or it's seriously underrated. This film works on multiple levels, due to the science fiction side of the story. Your interpretation will swing one way, or the other on what the script-writers deliver to the storyline. There really is no need to develop many of the characters for something like this. You can, but that will either draw out the storyline too much, or enhance the tone of the film depending on the viewer. No, a standard 90 film length is perfectly fine for this plot. Why is it that we only use about 10% of our brain?? The real answer is simple and hard to understand, depending how you process it. The funny thing is,....the plot decides to leave God out of the equation, therefore, you're going to fall back on a more humanistic approach. This film is man's attempt to find the answers,.....but isn't that the REAL definition of 'religion'?? If you go back to what Lucy says about time and space, she specifically said that we are all subjected to time, the day were born to the day we die. We can't change that, therefore, we can't look at our lives in the viewpoint of a 'timeline', so to speak. In this sense, Lucy becomes like God. Does this mean we're destined to be gods?? The Mormons seem to think so, but that would mean we would create our own worlds, so to speak, and they wouldn't be as inclined to overlap to create the 'environment' we live in. The real reason why we don't use more the 10% is because knowledge gives power to do things. In a perfect world, no one would want to 'test the limits', or have the desire to 'sin'. It's temptation being removed from the equation, but in the 'world' we live in, the sin and temptation do exist. Where's the balance?? Wouldn't it then make sense to answer to the deity than ignore it?? Again, I go back to the idea that this story is about a world 'without' God in the equation. It's fine on its own, but to say that the material presented in this movie is real, would go back to the 'evolution' idea. Of course, what you see on the film isn't real. Everything that is linked together is purely fiction."

","i like ScarlettJohansson but This movie is terrible, plain and simple. It starts out as a fun action movie set in Taiwan. Scarjo is in some really cool scenes and is acting amazingly. This is cut with shots of Morgan Freeman having a stroke and blabbering one-liners about life that wouldn't impress Jaden Smith.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was completely useless in this movie. Lucy knows everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%. Telekinesis? Why is he even doing ""research"" on some weird hypothetical. This movie is literally better if you cut out every Morgan scene. <br/><br/>This movie is way too pretentious for the few good action scenes it has.

","Bad Reviews of this film based on the fact that it avoids moral questions are legitimate bad Reviews. The film does avoid moral problems.<br/><br/>However, the film does explore the human mind and the intersection between Morgan Freeman making a speech and the action taking Place is much in the same way as Henri Laborit making his speech in ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"", the film by Alain Resnai. It does not disturb me at all - on the contrary! The question of what happens if humans would access more of their brain capacity does resemble a parable of what happens if humans became God. This might have been unintended by the makers of this Movie but it is nevertheless a fair comparison that can be made.<br/><br/>The action scenes with all the killings and whatnot are for pure Entertainment, of course, and brings a relaxation from the very Heavy topic here concerned.<br/><br/>Therefore, it would be unfair to dismiss this Movie as bad. How many Movies today pose philosophical questions. Matrix did for sure but how many more? A similar Movie with morals being the central issue would, of course, be most commendable but could such a Movie be made and would it be financed. Probably not, since it would rip our capitalistic World into shreds and leave nothing of it to be salvaged and who would finance something like that? So far, we will have to be content with that there are films being made that stimulate our thinking and hope that this take us to the journey towards absolute material equality, the very basic of all morals as far as we now can detect."

I pondered it, dreamed about it, and have thought about it many times still, over the years. Yes, I am no longer young.

"bob the moo","Null","1","4","27 March 2015"," Has the gloss and nice structure, but ultimately lacking in forward motion, sense, and thrills
","It is to this film's benefit that it barely touches the 90 minute mark; not only was it this factor that made me watch it in the last 100 minutes of a long-haul flight, but it also means that it has a very short distance to go, and doesn't have to worry too much about not being able to keep up a fast pace all the way. This does cover up for a lot and to a certain point it did make the film work for me by virtue of it moving forward with slickness and material that offers some interest. It also benefits from a nice structure which has a lecture interspersed in the beginning, plus quickly edited clips and images, all of which add pace and variety.<br/><br/>This approach is complimented by a slick presentation, a good sized budget, famous faces in the cast, good locations, and all the trimmings one expects with such films. Unfortunately, these aspects mostly serve to mask some of the inherent problems with it, rather than lift an already strong film to be stronger. The writing is probably the root of most things and in this case it is weak, trying to engage and expand but also trying to service an action thriller – it doesn't really do either well, even though in the broad sweep it is quite daring in where it goes. That said, by failing to really engage the brain, the daring place it ends up, actually comes over as pretty silly and ultimately makes for a weaker ending than it should have been.<br/><br/>The action is a mixed bag since at times it is well executed whereas at others it is lacking in memorable set-pieces and tends towards genre cliché and standards. The slick style does cover this up, but generally the action doesn't thrill as much as it should, and combined with the so-so material, I did find myself just ""looking"" at the screen, rather than really being into the film. The cast try hard and are part of the slick presentation; Johansson is not really used well, however she does her best in the style, and has some elements of performance about her. Freeman plays himself – and is best when detached from the action, not so much in the second half. Likewise Min-sik Choi is stylistically very much a key part of the film, but at the same time could have benefited from doing that within a better film.<br/><br/>Lucy does fill its time well, and does it with a style and pace that at least will distract, but not much more than that. The action needed to be sharper, the ideas needed to be smarter, and although the destination is a good idea, it is poorly executed and ends up more silly than inspired."

I wish we could be get a more insight of what she really is thinking, the moment the drug kicks in its like we are represented to a whole new person, and we don't know nothing about whats going thru her mind. Surely, we are told how she feels, or that she does not feel, but i wish there were more details around that ""what if"" scenario. To be honest, i find it hard to put the finger on this film, but what I do know is that, there should have been a lot more focus on the ""what if"" scenario. The photography is great, i loved it.

(Incidentally, we already use 100%, so the entire premise of this film is absurd.)<br/><br/>It's quite clear that whoever wrote this film has no understanding of intelligence or the human brain. We aren't superheroes waiting to happen. An IQ of 200 doesn't give us the ability to (literally) telepathically control other people (figuratively, perhaps, but many folks with IQs near 200 tend bar for a living) *or electrons*. An IQ of 400 won't make us telekinetic. An IQ of 1000 wouldn't suddenly permit us to dissolve into a sludge of matter that can somehow mesh with computing hardware (or time travel, incidentally--time travel isn't a real concept, nor is time, despite this film's simplistic notion that it's everything).

","The simplest way to put it is this: As Lucy got smarter, the movie itself got dumber.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was okay, although it could've done a better job at setting up the backstory of the characters and why they were where they were when they were introduced. Despite that, the first act of the movie wasn't bad and definitely holds your attention.<br/><br/>However, later on in the film (about the time that Lucy finally contacts Professor Norman), it begins to get just plain ridiculous - and not in a good way. For one, the inserted title screens dictating the percentage her brain usage has reached seem completely arbitrary in timing. While the movie's suddenly saying ""70%"" you may not even be seeing a chance in her abilities. It's just randomly put there to make you think there's been a change, when in reality the progression of her cerebral development is very unclear in the movie. Also, when there are noticeable changes, they don't even seem to have anything to do with the mind. The movie really stretches the boundaries of what the brain controls, and what's just straight using the Force or something.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending of the movie was just awful. The amount of effort put into the story continued to go downhill as the amount of money put into special effects continued to go up. It's hard to even call it a climax - more like a demo reel of special effects than anything. So in summary, as the movie goes on and Lucy gets smarter, the actual story gets dumber. If you're looking for a well thought out sci-fi thriller, this is not the movie. But if you're okay with a subpar storyline in favor of seeing cool special effects, Lucy's still worth a watch."

","Lucy, directed by Luc Besson (critically acclaimed for directing La Femme Nikita and Leon – The Professional), has not been very highly praised internationally but apparently turns out to be a good entertainer, especially given the dry spell at bollywood since last 3-4 months. The story is about a young girl Lucy who accidentally becomes part of a dark drug deal in Taipei. She is then put on a high-power trial drug by cutting her stomach wide open; the drug has ability to increase human's brain usage capability significantly. An average human uses 10% of its brain but with the help of this drug, humans can use almost 100% of its brains. Lucy is transformed into a super-power warrior followed by a series of merciless encounters with her captors. Medical conditions makes Lucy fixated to the drug- use and eventually her brain usage starts increasing from 10% to 100% over a week's time.<br/><br/>This 89 minutes runtime movie is fast paced and filled with action, suspense and science fiction. Many of us would disagree with the movie's science fiction/ backdrop if we go by textbook, but then this is a work of fiction and not science."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","4","27 January 2015"," Pseudoscience has never been so much fun!
","Let me start out this review by saying that I freaking love The Fifth Element and The Professional. Luc Besson was killing it in the 90's, and while he may have lost some steam in the 21st century I still couldn't help but get excited over his newest explosive action exploit, Lucy. Scarlett Johansson stars as the titular character, a girl who inadvertently gets mixed up in a drug smuggling ring that isn't smuggling any old drugs. She is forced to smuggle a new drug that heightens a person's ""cerebral capacity"" and when she is exposed to the drug she starts gaining all sorts of crazy abilities that she rightfully uses to kick ass and take names. Honestly I don't really know what her actual goal was, but plenty of people get to die in cool fashions along the way, and that makes for an action packed 90 minutes of super powered ScarJo, so how can I complain? <br/><br/>Now, this movie centers around the idea that humans only use about 10% of their brain and it speculates what a person would be capable of if they could unlock all 100%. There had always been controversy over this theory and shortly after the movie came out, hell it might have even been before its release, this whole theory was disproved and smashed into fictional conjecture oblivion. Thus, it's really hard, nigh impossible, to take Lucy seriously. It takes a lot of scientific liberties and its attempts to explain things for the sake of the plot are mostly laughable. There is some seriously nutty pseudoscience being bounced around here, and at times it seems like they're making it up as they go along. But once you separate yourself from the silliness of the plot and just accept the absurd foundation on which this film is built, you'll start to have a lot more fun. <br/><br/>It only takes Lucy about seven minutes to kick off the action so if you like explosions, gunfire, or martial arts then Lucy will have your attention pretty quickly. Besson might be a bit older and a bit less on point, but I can't deny the sonofabitch still knows how to put together a badass action sequence. Lucy gives us the smart, tension filled action set-pieces reminiscent of The Professional. It reminds us that we go to the movies to enjoy ourselves and not everything has to be so serious all the time. And for that I have the utmost respect for Lucy. <br/><br/>A film based around such flimsy science is bound to have a swathe of issues, and Lucy is no exception. But the issues here you can really just chalk up to the conceit of movies. Sure, the dialogue is cheesy, transparent, and comically expository at times. The performances are good, but you have to take them with a block of cheese. Johansson is fun as the super powered ass kicking femme fatale, and Morgan Freeman is pretty entertaining too, even if his character's only purpose in the film is to explain the plot and give us back story. But these issues are passable things that don't stop Lucy from being a riotously good time, and it's wacky story actually plays out in a really satisfying way. I was prepared for a really stupid ending, but what I got was actually pretty awesome and something connections that I didn't see coming were drawn out by the end.<br/><br/>As far as action movies go Lucy is great. Its loaded with ass kicking and jam packed with wicked special effects. The film is a nonstop roller coaster and the ending certainly goes off the rails, but in an age where action movies draw out for far too long, what with our superhero and fighting robot movies clocking in at almost three hours half the time, Lucy with it's cool 90 minute run time is short sweet and to the point. It doesn't dwell and it doesn't over complicate things. If this movie's one goal is to entertain while not taking up too much of your time or too much of your cerebral capacity (hehe) then I would say it's a huge success."

","I'm giving this a 7 because there's a good cast, good production, and I love sci-fi. Unfortunately there is very little real science in this movie. Writer & director Luc Besson stated that ""he admitted that he knew that some scientific assumptions were erroneous, e.g. that humans use only 10% of their brain. Nonetheless, he said that such assumption would be a great start for a sci-fi movie. Well, no that's not a good starting point if it's based on well known erroneous beliefs, in which case it classifies more as fantasy than sci-fi. I knew that going into the movie, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief on that, but the nonsense just kept getting piled on. Like when the drugs first start leaking into Lucy and she begins her ""transformation"", suddenly the laws of gravity are just thrown out the window and she's floating around the room? That's just dumb. I mean you can't even say that she was harnessing the power of her mind at that point, she doesn't even know whats going on. And it just goes on and on. Yet somehow its still worth a watch I think if you just accept that its fantasy based on very little actual science. Special effects and acting are top notch.

","I guess disappointed is the word I would use. Possibly from the previews that were shown, possibly from my own expectations. I saw the cast list and figured if it had the first few actors listed, this would be a reasonable movie. I was let down with the clichéd story line, acting by the A-list actor, action scenes. The acting was not the best by the two lead actors, seemed shallow and almost forced at times. Story line was clichéd, it has been used so many times, this variation didn't do the movie any justice. The action scenes were a definite let down, I expected more, possibly my mistake in expecting more. Some scenes were good, some good special effects, the idea of the story was different, not a total loss. I would wait for it to come out on cable or satellite TV, I don't think I would suggest paying to see this at the theaters."

She did a decent job given the horribleness of the plot. The movie is littered with scientific inaccuracies, border-line pseudoscience and perpetuates general misconceptions within the script. <br/><br/>If you can set aside your appreciation for knowledge and science (if you have any) for the sake of a movie, you just might enjoy it, if not- you've been warned.<br/><br/>Overall: decent acting, horrible plot, brutal inaccuracies accompanied by alright action scenes.

","Actually the film surprised me a lot more than I actually thought it would for an action movie. I do admit that I really could never anticipate how the ending would be. The story makes a lot of sense and doesn't seem out of proportion. Scarlett is incredibly beautiful in the movie -; savage, cold, distant [...] and the acting is quite good overall.<br/><br/>However, my only grief comes on the fact that the movie follows a good logical track until somewhere around the end where it becomes actually quite difficult to really follow or understand in the grand scheme of things. Kind of like they didn't really have any idea of what to put and came up with this. It then turns into some sort of very cheap sci-fi. The movie would have definitively deserve a much better ending than what it actually got.<br/><br/>Overall though you really do ask yourself if this is factually possible. Certain things did look a little bit unrealistic but I do understand however that no one knows what the mind would be truly capable of if it used even 50% pf its abilities. This is a good proposition by Lucy to this eventuality.<br/><br/>All in all though, interesting and very pleasurable movie which really surprised me knowing the mentality with which I came to watch it. 7/10 represents for me limit to (semi) greatness and a movie would have to be exceptionally great to go beyond that."

This is light mixture of Matrix and 2001 O.i.S., not bad but not good either. Scarlett in this film played solidly, but we must admit without those of her sexy lips half of the film would not be good. All in all, a fun movie that will entertain in less than an hour and a half, and those younger or less intelligent left in doubt what are they actually watching. Although the film itself has a lot of voids and familiar Besson's visual images, Freeman and Johansson make this movie interesting. As for the end of the film, the message is: live your life, it is worth and the only thing that actually makes it valuable, paradoxically, is time. So take the time and the knowledge that you have, grow and enjoy in life. But remember - without our human feelings, without love we are monsters."

","To be honest, throughout the duration of the movie, I was unsure of whether to continue watching or simply walk out of the theater. It was entertaining to watch, as an action movie, as long as you ignore the unrealistic 'scientific' explanations. <br/><br/>It is a fictional story and the lack of accuracy in terms of science could be overlooked. However, I was totally unable to ignore some scenes and situations in the movie. <br/><br/>There was a scene where Lucy/ScarJo walked into a high class, expensive hotel through the front entrance in a bloodied hospital gown with two large guns in both her hands. How the heckles was she allowed into the hotel without being noticed and stopped? At this point, she had not yet been able to mind control people, so I don't see how that would work. <br/><br/>Also, why on earth were these Korean drug lords/mafia creating a drug that would increase human intelligence and try to sell/promote it to junkies? Their initial plan was to smuggle it over to other countries so that they could introduce this new drug to the market, but I don't get why people in clubs and such would take this substance, considering the fact that it doesn't give you any type of high but instead, makes you smarter. It would make a ton more sense if their plan were to sell it to some crazy scientists or someone who actually wanted to become smarter rather than to try and push it onto junkies just looking for a high. <br/><br/>All that said, it was still highly entertaining to watch if you can ignore the scientific parts of it as well as some scenarios. It is not an overly lengthy movie to watch, so it wouldn't kill to catch it, but I would not encourage paying to watch it. If you are interested, watching it online would be make more sense."

Limitless however, has a more firm footing in reality and takes a more humane approach. <br/><br/>Lucy has very little if any character development and scientific justifications.

"tanranreiki","7","1","4","24 November 2014"," Enjoyable, Worthwhile, and a dash of real science thrown in with sci fi
","I enjoyed this movie. I took psychophysiology in graduate school and the movie helped point to the higher potentials of the brain, even on a quantum level. It is grounded in some science and then leaps into some far out speculations on what the science could mean, but then that is what sci fi does best.<br/><br/>I did have some reservations about the movie. One is that editing from scene to scene is a bit choppy. It juxtaposes between a professor lecturing at a college and a beautiful female shooting drug cartel goons with a single shoot each coming from her emerging super intelligent brain. Then there are flashes of the percentages of her brain that is being used that come up at every step of the movie. This kind of editing reminds you that you are watching a movie and makes it a little harder to track the narrative flow. The plot presented is pretty basic super hero in one sense, with the bad guys getting it in the end.<br/><br/>But behind the choppy editing and the superhero plot line are some interesting extrapolations of the brain's possible evolution and its potential is harness by the heroine to get out of trouble and further evolve herself. I do think Scarlet Johanssen does a good job acting and making the character both interesting and believable as she goes through the fantastic rapid mutational changes that she does. It made science come a little more alive and relevant to me.<br/><br/>I think that whether or not one enjoys the movie will depend on how the editing works for one, whether one likes sci fi in general, and whether or not the brain evolution speculations feel relevant to oneself. If the science that is thrown in makes the story relevant, then I think a person will like the movie. If it feels like poor scientific extrapolation and an unusually choppy narrative flow, then it will be a kind of C minus superhero movie, and will not compare favorably with the flicks where the storyline and editing run more smoothly and dynamically.<br/><br/>I almost quit the movie because of the choppy editing, but was glad I waded through the first 15 minutes and could finally feel how the drug cartel story was used as a foil to develop the deeper brain themes. It hooked me in then and I enjoyed how it unfolded. It was, still, a little gorier than I like a movie to be, but on the gory index of modern movies it is still less than a lot of them.<br/><br/>All in all. I felt it was worth the watch."

I found the constant flicking from Lucy story to the hack ""science"" story very irritating.

","""Human beings using 100% cerebral capacity"" is a nice concept to make a movie and the movie is just satisfactory. <br/><br/>It talks about using the intellectual capacity and shows far more than we can imagine (One thing I liked was, being able to control human and things around the person. How come we never thought about that? We can only think of having control over self). But then, I don't think 100% use of cerebral capacity will provide the access to the past unless the person studies about it or has experienced i.e. if it was already in the brain. <br/><br/>However, if 100% capacity in the movie was used for exploring unknown rather than recollecting the known, it would have been the best Sci-fi. But here, it's a more like fantasy/superhero movie. <br/><br/>The main concept is good. So is the performance and visual effects. But I find the story someway out of track.

Lucy is a joyous exception in which the plot becomes increasingly ridiculous without ever breaking its internal sense of drama.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS FOLLOW* The plot itself is about as vacuous as you could ask for. The main character immediately becomes unstoppable *and* super-intelligent. For the rest of the film the enemies pose no threat and she does not require any assistance. She does encounter some companions but the limited dialogue between them only amounts to discussing the movie's ""evolutionary superhero"" premise. Which is also helpfully explained by powerpoint.<br/><br/>The premise and the explanations in the film are as dumb as you could imagine, and the rare instances that isn't the focus of the dialogue it still managed to remain clumsy.

","All round entertaining flic. But You can't help but to compare it to Limitless because the entire premise is based on the same concept. And, if you saw Limitless first this movie will be a little spoiled for you, or vice versa. Actually I think Limitless explores the synthetic brain enhancement drug theory in a much more realistic manner. Lucy goes a little over the top. Lucy becomes essentially godlike, using her super power of psionics, stretching space and time to deal with her adversaries, whereas I really would have liked to have seen her just reason things out with superior intellect (yes like in Limitless).<br/><br/>Also the heroine, becomes a callus cold blooded killer. Thinking of nothing but herself. Killing a taxi driver because he was in the way. A person in the middle of a surgical procedure was dispatched with equal nonchalance. This characterization change did not work well for me.<br/><br/>I will say the beginning really draws you in. The opening violence, the innocent victim, Lucy in her moment of disappear was really played well by Scarlett Johansen. The come by chance reason for her getting dosed up on an intellect enhancing super drug was constructed well and really draws you into the story.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","27 August 2014"," First hour great fun
","Flamboyant French director Luc Besson has a penchant for making movies featuring strong young women - think Mathilda (Natalie Portman) in Leon, the titular heroine (Anne Parillaud) in ""La Femme Nikita"", and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) in ""The Fifth Element"". A similar idea of a youngster turned into a fighting machine was offered us in ""Hanna"".<br/><br/>This time, we have the eponymous Lucy - a great role for the beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson - who is an American in Taiwan who suddenly finds herself ingesting a new super-drug than enables her to use progressively more and more of her mind with ultimately universal implications. If this sounds a bit like the plot premise of ""Limitless"" where NZT has been replaced by CPH4, then you can count on Besson for taking the notion further, much further, too far in fact. What starts as fun and merely fanciful finishes up as metaphysical nonsense. There are echoes here of all sorts of previous films such as ""2001"" (there are stargates aplenty) and ""The Tree Of Life"" (there is another dinosaur) and - inevitably - ""The Matrix"" (remember Trinity?).<br/><br/>The work is visually stunning with an eclectic collection of images ranging from wildlife to cityscape to biology to cosmology and, since I saw it on an IMAX screen, at times I was close to hallucinating. The soundtrack adds to the atmospherics with use of Mozart's ""Requiem"" and contemporary songs (don't miss the one used for the long credits sequence). And the cast is very watchable with the Korean Choi Min-sik as lead bad guy and the ever-cool Morgan Freeman as lead scientist. Unusually for such an ambitious film, it clocks in a mere one and half hours and I would have been happier with a second hour in the vein of the first. But, heh, it's never boring."
"MostlyVirtual","7","1","4","24 August 2014"," My take on Lucy
","Taipei. I feel like the director is trying to tell me something. The message doesn't seem to come across. Everything feels weird and out of place, more so than it should at the beginning of a movie. Ah, the action begins, or does it? There is a lot of chatter in a language I don't understand, and apparently neither do the characters. Yes, bring in an interpreter, that will help.<br/><br/>Very soon after that, the plot of the movie is revealed, but not completely. It will take a few more tries before delivering the essence.<br/><br/>The subject. A drug that allows you to unlock 100% of your brain. Haven't they addressed this in ""Limitless""? Maybe it was a bit different, but I can't help comparing them. The resemblance with Limitless ends here though, as the movie takes a completely different turn of events.<br/><br/>We get to see a lot of Scarlett Johansson's eyes throughout the movie. Is the director trying to tell us that the eyes are the window to the soul? Maybe, or maybe she has lovely eyes, so why not showcase them ?<br/><br/>Originally, I thought Morgan Freeman is in this movie just because he is Morgan Freeman. I still think that, but that doesn't mean that he didn't deliver the role as well as he usually does. Oh no, he was Morgan Freeman alright :)<br/><br/>Wasn't the fact that we use a limited amount of brain power debunked as a myth ? Ah who cares, the action begins. Lots of shooting, fighting, kicking. Just what you would expect, and what you knew was going to happen if you watched the trailer.<br/><br/>Now, to the way the subject was addressed. I actually think there is no great way to address this subject. Many movies have tried, including Limitless recently, but I'm happy they took a different approach.<br/><br/>Conclusion ? Well, I personally think the movie was very well made. They clearly went with the ""ridiculous approach"" while still trying to maintain somewhat of an informative feel. I think that the balance was right where it should have been, and while I wouldn't watch this again anytime soon, I would feel comfortable recommending it to my friends.<br/><br/>The main characters were played very well, despite not understanding what some of them were saying half of the time. Miss Johansson tried just a little bit too much at times, but you hardly could tell. Perhaps this was the way it was intended, because of the ridiculous note of the movie?<br/><br/>Enjoy."

Its nice to see how the director has managed to convey the idea of what the mind can do when fully utilised. The film builds up well & just when you think is gonna get even bigger when the story moves to Europe(Paris) you are disappointed. There that 1 car scene but compared to the magnitude of the plot the action is diluted. Also the shootout between the Police & the Chinese is also pretty ordinary.<br/><br/>There is not a big storyline here rather its the creative visualization that impresses.<br/><br/>The Toast Lucy gives to herself in the flight shows the intention of the creators but not sure if they manage to execute it on screen.<br/><br/>Acting: Its a Scarlet Show all the way, There could not be a better voice than Morgan Freeman to explain Evolution. Amr Waked has nothing good to do than a 2 second kiss to Lucy. Min-sik was average certainly not menacing or a person of character to take on the God Like Lucy. Pros : Fast Paced Movie!

"homdeb1058","6","2","13","31 July 2014"," Writing and Directing Could have Benefittted from Brain Enhancement
","For me this movie failed to deliver on several levels. It was neither as smart and slick as the brain enhancement movie Limitless nor as in-your- face kick-butt, (and slick) as Resident Evil's superbabe Alice. The opening scenes in which Lucy is being coerced by her loser boyfriend into making a questionable delivery, becomes annoying and tedious instead of building tension. The director uses cutaway scenes to wild animals stalking their prey to (hint, hint, nudge, nudge) suggest what is fixing to happen to Lucy--as if we couldn't figure that out for ourselves. Even the scenes in which our superbad drug lord forces Lucy to be a mule for his high tech drugs were slow and unconvincing. Morgan Freeman's brain utilization lectures were long-drawn and unimpressive as well. For such a short movie, there was a lot of waiting-to-get-on-with-it moments.<br/><br/>That being said, if you can make it through the slow, uninspiring beginnings, the movie does improve after Lucy's brain enhancement begins. For a 3:00 matinée showing the theater was surprisingly crowded, and the movie did manage to elicit a number of chuckles and laugh out loud reactions from the audience. There was a lot of whispered discussion going on as well, so maybe others were finding the movie more enjoyable than I. I found the subject matter intriguing but the delivery lacking focus and direction. See it if you have nothing better to do, but I recommend seeing it without great expectation. I give it a 6 out of 10. Could have (and should have)been much better."

","There often comes a movie which is based on a ridiculous premise that is somewhat entertaining. Lucy is one of those.<br/><br/>There's no formal introduction of the character of Lucy except that she's living in Taipei. How she got there, who she is, what she does for a living are all left to the viewer's imagination. She somehow gets mixed up in affairs that led her to be a victim of CPH4 (blue crystals) ingestion in large quantities. (We're told by Morgan Freeman that CPH4 is produced by a pregnant woman's body in small quantities to help the foetus develop bones).<br/><br/>The more CPH4 gets ingested, the higher percentage of brain she uses and unfortunately, the more ridiculous the movie gets. Lucy uses her enhanced brain usage to free herself from the captors and ""gather"" information about whereabouts of the other victims as her body is now craving more CPH4. She can now see the inner workings of trees and people and manages to diagnose her friend as well. She then ends up in France and makes allies with a cop to track down the other victims and contact Morgan Freeman, all while bad guys are trying to hunt her down.<br/><br/>The visual effects and action sequences are good but they can't salvage a poorly scripted movie. One of the ridiculous moments is a call Lucy places to her mother. Any sane mother would have asked ""Are you high or on drugs?"". I don't know how other audience members kept a straight face through that. Plus there are numerous other hilarious metaphors.<br/><br/>The final moments are over the top where Lucy becomes an all knowing all encompassing monster as she devours all the remaining CPH4, while the cop is trying to fend off bad guys and Morgan Freeman and other neuroscientists are watching in awe. And then as Morgan Freeman suggests, she manages to ""pass on"" her information.<br/><br/>Scarlett's decent acting might be the saving grace for this movie. If you like movies like Crank, then this might be good entertainment. Regardless, remember to use only 10% of your brain while watching this."

","You'd think this was going to be an action flick, based on the trailers. It could have been, but it wasn't. This is especially odd since Luc Besson is usually pretty darn good at action flicks.<br/><br/>Instead, we get...something that wants to be a deep philosophical film about the nature of humanity but lacks pretty much everything necessary.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johanson does as well as can be expected given almost nothing to work with. Her work in the first half hour is great, but after that...not much you can do when your only direction is apparently, ""You're no longer human, you're a computer. Think The Vision with less personality, that's what we're aiming for!""<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, used as exposition to give the audience the world-view necessary to make the plot work. It doesn't have to be true or scientific or proven; it's science fiction. The Force hasn't been proven and isn't based on solid science, but the Star Wars series is some pretty awesome sci-fi. Yet that first movie used a few lines of dialogue by Alec Guinness to set the stage; here we get Morgan Freeman pontificating and giving us far less than Obi-wan's explanation of The Force.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is it lacks any form of sense or internal cohesion. Okay, using more of our brain gives humans power. Not a bad premise for a sci-fi flick.

The audience putting up with the pseudo-science-spirituality garbage has the right to expect that Lucy will spectacularly kick the bad guy asses at the end. But, noooo.

","How best to explain 'Lucy'? I'm not really sure - my best bet is 'Limitless' crossed with 'The Matrix', but without the best bits from either! Basically, Lucy (Johansson) gets involved in a drug ring in Taipei and it just so happens the drugs 'unlock' the full potential of her brain. The biggest flaw of the film is right there - it's based on the urban myth that humans only use 10% of their brain power. We may not always use 100%, but we certainly use more than 10% for the majority of the time!<br/><br/>The best bits are the amazing car scene in Paris, the intercut footage (cheetahs, dinosaurs and other bits of nature) and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, that's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the film struggles to make 90min, has a lack of actual action/excitement has a huge cop-out ending and Johansson acts like a robot, which is apparently what a hyper-evolved human would be like?!?<br/><br/>Considering Besson made 'The Fifth Element' - one of the more fun, inventive Sci-Fi films of the last 20 years - it's a shame this film is neither fun, nor original.

Why? To fabricate a pointless conflict so we can have DUH SWEET ACTION SCENES, since there would be none otherwise as Lucy is god and can kill anyone at will. The ending is even worse, as she is even more powerful but *conveniently* occupies herself while the army of Chinese mafia raid the building.

","I'm a big fan of science fiction movies of all kinds. I also have a lot of time for Luc Besson; even if his output is decidedly hit-and-miss it is usually quite entertaining. So ""Lucy"" should have been right up my alley.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong about that one.<br/><br/>Right from the start it is clear that we're dealing with one of ""those"" films. One of those that will eschew all explanations for what's happening and jump straight to the cool shots. Who cares about internal logic when you have gunfights, car chases, beautiful women kicking ass and suit-clad villains walking menacingly in slow motion right? Where did the briefcase come from? Who made the contents? Is there more of it? Who shot Richard (and without breaking the window too - classy shot)? Why didn't Mr. Jang know what was in the briefcase? They don't even attempt to explain stuff like this, or build a credible back story. They try, feebly, to lay down some ground rules for what would happen if we utilised more of our brain power but most of it is totally nonsensical. What little there is of internal logic is ignored throughout. Apparently, by using 20% of our cerebral capacity we can defy gravity. Who knew? The biggest elephant in the room is the very existence of the synthetic CPH4 drug. Seriously, if someone can make this stuff and it has the effects shown in this movie then it would lead to a major evolutionary leap. It would change mankind completely. An interesting film could be made about this, but ""Lucy"" isn't it. It's far too pre-occupied with cramming in cool visuals to have time for intellectual discourse.<br/><br/>And speaking of which, the dialogue here is absolutely atrocious. I felt real pity for Morgan Freeman trying to sell the stupefying pseudo-science he was tasked with explaining. His introductory speech was cringeworthy. Cells decide to survive by immortality if in an unsafe environment? Really? Who wrote this crap? By this point I was getting angry at the filmmakers for wasting my time and insulting my intelligence. I guess the joke was really on me as I kept watching until the end.<br/><br/>A special mention to the wildlife scenes interspersed throughout. A visual tool so blunt that I'm surprised to see it used in a professional production.

"RepublicofE","5","1","5","6 April 2016"," An effective piece of propaganda
","This movie caught my attention because the trailer seemed like it was inspired by Elfen Lied, a favorite anime of mine. I wasn't the only one to think so, but after watching the movie, I think some things may or may not have been derived from that anime, but this movie is still very much its own thing and not a ripoff.<br/><br/>That's not to say I like it. I don't like its message. I'm just saying it's an effective, and, as far as Hollywood blockbusters go, creative film. I also don't really like it even ignoring the politics of it, but that's largely because it just isn't my taste, not because the film is done poorly. Like I said, I wouldn't likely have even given it a second thought if it wasn't for all the people comparing the trailer to Elfen Lied.<br/><br/>The movie is, if not actually a part of, then at least inspired by the transhumanist movement. It also seems to be a propaganda piece for the Neil Degrasse Tyson/Bill Nye/Stephen Hawking/Carl Sagan/Richard Dawkins, etc. movement of making science a religion, even more so than it has been treated as a religion in the past, while merging, and in some ways confounding, science and philosophy.<br/><br/>Full discloser: I am a religious person and I have a serious problem with transhumanists. But this movie didn't offend me. The thematic elements aren't anything we haven't seen before in various movies, Star Trek episodes, etc. This movie just expresses those themes really well as far as major Hollywood pictures go. It's no surprise that Morgan Freeman plays the male lead. Morgan Freeman has expressed a sort god-complex, saying humans are a sort of god, we just need to work to evolve to our potential of being god, or something. The movie ends with ""Lucy"" transforming herself, through sheer mental energy, into a godlike and nearly all-powerful being, just by reaching ""100 percent"" of her brain capacity, and then donating her godlike knowledge to humanity with a flash drive. It is implied that all people have this godlike potential within us, we just haven't been able to tap it.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that a film so obviously intended for those who regard science as a constant war against the ridiculous fantasies of religion and superstition relies entirely on a fantastic premise, plot, and climax to get its message across. Again, I'm not offended, I just find it somewhat ironic. Transhumanism, really, is the religion for atheists who find all the worldviews normally called ""religions"" too mainstream.<br/><br/>Over all, if you adjust your expectations for the flaws that all Hollywood blockbusters tend to have, then this isn't a bad film at all. I just think it need to be recognized for what it is."

","Luc Besson has a unique idea her in Lucy, but it ultimately gets lost the further the movie goes on, just like with most movies that attempt this type of narrative. With this type of movie (becoming omnipotent), it's hard to have a profound conclusion/3rd act, and this movie is sadly no different. Everything in the first half of the movie is certainly entertaining and thought provoking, but in the end, the writers write themselves into a corner.<br/><br/>It's intriguing to see what type of powers she possesses early in the transformation, slowly gaining new abilities and fighting off her foes. But the movie makes the cardinal sin of making her too power, too soon. Way before the movie reaches its climax, she has to powers to basically stop any type of threat opposed to her, which, of course, ruins the ride too soon. Once Lucy gets to around 60% power level she is undefeatable and all the excitement goes out the window and we just have to sit back and see where the writers want to go with this.<br/><br/>Omnipotence is probably something writers and filmmakers should avoid for the time being, it's a tricky subject that almost never pays off.

When all someone has to do is use their mind to drop all the bullets out of a gun or throw someone aside there is absolutely no interest to be had in any action sequence the film throws our way. The movie tries to be a lot more than what it really is. It tries to be thought-provoking and intelligent but just comes across as a mess of ideas, with the audience insultingly trying to be convinced this is all possible. <br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly how we are supposed to feel about the character of 'Lucy'. To me she's nothing short of pure evil. She will kill a completely innocent person without giving it a second thought and then in the next scene spare the life of a vicious drug-dealing mob leader who will consequently go on to take dozens more lives. She's portrayed as being the heroine we should root for but when you actually give it some thought she's no better than any of the villains. I had this same complaint about writer/director Luc Besson's other film 'Taken 3' as well. It seems to be a real flaw in his writing of late that he needs to fix. Overall it's a messy film that even Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson's star power isn't enough to save.

","""You only know up to 20% of your potential""<br/><br/>I believe in this quote very strongly for years. Unfortunately, majority of people didn't meet up to knowing 20% of their potential because they threw away tremendous amount of time on procrastinating. Thanks to tons of pointless television shows, movies, video games, and entertainment such as watching sports and involving fantasy sports. (F*** me, I'm probably one of them) Only people were being effective for lion's share of time know up to 20% of their potential. <br/><br/>It's probably why adderall, cocaine, and molly are very addictive drugs. These are shortcuts to push people's capacities of excel for short time. The more they recognize themselves being effective when they're under the influence, the more frequently they'll want to take them until the point where they begin to forget about their well being, and likely to go into destruction. Or rather to say deep in the rabbit hole. Everyone knows the famous self- destructive patterns. We were educated by the DARE program, parents, and many while we were growing up, and yet, many of us still fall in a rabbit hole at some point. Thanks to the high expectations of ourselves or whatever the other reasons. <br/><br/>Lucy is beyond a successful movie by looking at the price of making this movie. Took just 40 million bucks to make this movie and earned over 450 million bucks. Yes, Luc Besson is a famous director, thanks to Leon the Professional and The Fifth Element, but I bet he didn't expect this net worth. <br/><br/>Movies like Limitless by Neil Burger are very intriguing to us because we are craving to maximum our potentials. That's why we read many self improvement books and articles. The numbers of self improvement books and articles expanded by double in every month. Smart people acknowledge that. They set their own harvest of money by selling to us like we are running and jumping around without a brain. In fact, almost all the self improvement books and articles give the same advices, and we read them repeatedly even though we were born to know what's to take our potentials for the best within our heart. Funny sh*t, I know. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I'm just stating why this movie had a higher number of audience than what it's deserved. Yes, very informational movie because it suggested a great idea of maximizing our potentials. Taking drugs, and whoa, I own this planet. That's the reality of everyone's dream. Although, I gave it a low rating because of the plot itself and supporting details to the main theme are very fragile. I awarded four extras out of ten because I absolutely love the idea of this drug. It can become realistic within 100 years from now. At that point, possibly regard it as a classic film. <br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to comment what's it all about. It stars Scarlett Johansson (you know her) and Morgan Freeman (I probably don't know him as much as you do because I'm deaf and I know his voice is a fortune cookie). Scarlett is a lucky one who's selected by a resourceful clique. They instilled a drug inside of her stomach to put her in test. Oh wow, thank you guys, and now she's killing them and ran into Morgan Freeman who declared his theory of maximizing brain capability. Oh my god, it's real sh*t. You're right, Freeman! I'm the evidence to your theory. Oh, oh, hurry, record them all in data set now! <br/><br/>Pretty much that's it. And I learned about the ten percent of the brain myth. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.

The bag of drugs is planted inside her body but when it breaks open it begins to give her full access to her brain's power and soon she's a deadly machine.<br/><br/>LUCY is certainly director Luc Besson's best film in a very long time but I must admit that I think it's best that you turn your brain off right at the start of the picture. I'm still a little confused as to why Lucy didn't die of a drug overdose but, again, logic isn't going to be your best friend in a picture like this so it's best just to sit back, put your feet up and enjoy the various visual styles and performances.<br/><br/>Besson has always known how to structure an action scene and he certainly brings a lot of flair and style here. The action scenes are all extremely well-directed and there's no doubt that the frantic chase through the streets are exciting and full of imagination. Another plus for the film is that it has some stylish gunfights including one between the mobsters and the police towards the end.<br/><br/>Johansson also deserves a lot of credit for her performance. From the early stages of the film where she's basically playing a crying wimp to the scenes where her brain eventually evolves, the actress is certainly believable every step of the way. I was really impressed with the actress during the scenes where her brain is at full functioning mode as the actress really makes you believe she's this intelligent creature. Morgan Freeman gives the typical Morgan Freeman performance but it's always fun to see him. Min-sin Choi and Amr Waked are both good as well.<br/><br/>Again, LUCY is a pretty strange movie and it's not all logically there.

You would (hopefully) cringe every time that fact is mentioned in the film.. and that is what will happen to you when you watch Lucy. Enjoy Cringe Enjoy Enjoy Cringe Cringe Cringe.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, consider the John Travolta film, the Phenomenon. Lucy could easily have borrowed the concept of brain hyperactivity without going off the rails as it did.<br/><br/>As a saving grace, Scarlet Johanssen looks as good as she ever has, and she single handedly carries the whole movie.<br/><br/>In short, watch the movie ONLY if you are a fan of Scarlet Johanssen, the woman I would gladly have given up my life to be a slave of, were it not for the fact that she found it acceptable to undertake a movie with such a rubbish script."

The package contains four packages of new drug CPH4 which Mr. Jang has sown into the bodies of four people, including Lucy, and tells them that if they fail to deliver it to their home countries their families will be targeted. Shortly afterwards Lucy is attacked and her bag burst releasing a huge dose of the drug into her body. These scenes are intercut with scenes of lecturer Professor Norman as he tells students in Paris that human beings only use ten percent of their mental capacity before hypothesising about what would happen if one could access more as the drug starts to take effect Lucy starts to find out first hand. Using her rapidly increasing abilities she escapes her captors and forces a taxi driver to take her to a hospital where she forces doctors to remove what is left of the package. She then researches the brain's capabilities and learns of Prof. Norman's work; she contacts him and tells him that she will see him in twelve hours; she also alerts the French police and tells them about the other three couriers. By the time she arrives in Paris the other couriers are all in police custody but whatever she plans to do won't be easy as Mr. Jang and his heavily armed goons are also there and they want their product back.<br/><br/>Whether or not you can enjoy this science fiction thriller is largely dependent on whether you can ignore the fiction of the science. If you can this is rather bonkers fun. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as she portrays Lucy's transformation from a fairly average young woman into a god-like being and Min-sik Choi, best known as the octopus-eating protagonist in 'OldBoy' is suitably menacing as Mr. Jang. As one might expect Morgan Freeman does a fine job as Prof Norman; the sort of role he has virtually made his own. The premise is very similar to the 2011 film 'Limitless' but the execution is quite different; Lucy doesn't just become far more intelligent; she also gains telepathic then telekinetic powers before ultimately gaining power of time and matter. Much of the action is fairly gritty but there was also the stylish action one would expect from a film by director Luc Besson.

They are in an Oriental city and the crime lord has the contents of the case inserted into Lucy's abdomen. When she is brutally attacked the contents spreads and allows her to increase her brain activity. First thing she does is goes for revenge. Second, she seeks a professor, played by Morgan Freeman who has given seminars on the issue. This is all great so far until the third act comes loose like a wheel sending the material smashing into a wall. The third act is corny, somewhat confusing, and totally moronic. It is like director Luc Besson was having too much fun visually and forgot to add common sense. He previously made a great film called Leon: The Professional. He seems to have drifted from what previously worked for him and just settled for impressing viewers with visual images. The special effects are lively and creative sending Lucy into strange parallel illusions in her mind. This is when the actors suffer the most. Scarlett Johansson is a fine actress and she handles the confusion of Lucy like a pro until a third act that mutates her into a flash drive. Morgan Freeman plays his usual knowing monotone. Choi Min-Sik plays a promising villain reduced to graphic action clichés. Amr Waked plays a bland French cop. The result is a film that comes off like puke after a night of heavy drinking.

","For a film predicated on an oft-repeated (and debunked) popular myth, LUCY is pretty entertaining, if a little ridiculous. Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy, a young woman is pulled into being a drug mule. However, interesting things start happening to her when the drug leaks into her system. Among the complaints one could lodge against LUCY, the biggest one is how thinly written the whole thing is. We are given precious little information about Lucy, and most of the other characters don't do much but further the plot along or provide exposition. Morgan Freeman is probably the most interesting of these, a scientist/professor whose field of research happens to coincide with what Lucy is experiencing. Still, the film seems to be aware of this and wastes no time in getting to the point. It follows a very fast pace, and it becomes almost a game to guess what powers Lucy will access as her cerebral capacity gets closer to 100%. There's also some real-life footage of animals and cool visual effects sequences of cells dividing and cosmic-level events which one will either take as profound or pretentious. I took it as somewhere in between, but leaning more towards the latter. I didn't really get the feeling that the film was going for a particular message, but the idea that wonder is part of what makes us human is an interesting one, as Lucy becomes less human the more knowledge and brain power she acquires. There also seemed to be the idea that knowledge makes us god-like. Altogether, it waxed fairly philosophical for an action film with a threadbare plot. Time will only tell whether or not I really love it, but for now I'm content in saying I liked LUCY a lot. Luc Besson's films have never been known for being particularly deep, but he seemed to be having a lot of fun here creating something that does make you think a little, even if it's based on an incorrect idea. For all it lacks in plot or story, LUCY has plenty of gumption when it comes to philosophical and visual ideas."

","It's hard to watch ""Lucy"" and not feel the need to compare it to ""Limitless"" which had the same basic concept. ""Limitless was a great movie, but ""Lucy"" is an excellent movie - limitless in almost every way.<br/><br/>Brilliant performances from all the actors, mind-blowing stunts and action sequences, and not to mention the outstanding and memorable car chase scene which is an absolute must-see for everyone! Nevertheless, the film may come across as somewhat higher grade. So if you are one who prefers ""My Wife and Kids"" over ""The Big Bang Theory"", ""Lucy"" is most probably NOT for you. Although the opening scene is very strong and gripping, the seemingly far-fetched, documentary-esque inserts of hunting cheetahs might puzzle some audience. How is it related to the film? It really isn't. Metaphorically, yes it is. But could they have done without it? Most definitely.<br/><br/>The big question: will you be satisfied; is it worth your hard earned money? Certainly. However, the ending might leave you wanting more and feeling as though something is missing. The film is basically one long metaphor open to free interpretation. Everyone might have a different opinion of what its actually really about. None the less, best movie I've see all year!"

","Of course the premise is wrong, though I couldn't think of a better way to move the story along. Much easier to say her mental ability has gone from 10 to 20 per cent of full potential than her IQ has gone to 10000 or so. Suffice it to say that I know high IQ people who didn't make much of their life anyway. There was one goof that the goof checkers seem to have missed. In the movie, the original Lucy is as tall as Scarlett Johansson. In reality, she would have been around a meter tall or about three feet. Story well done otherwise and entertaining. The bad guys are really bad and much deserved to get mowed down. Scarlett is impressive and fun to watch as she changes from an ordinary young woman to a tough no nonsense avenger. I liked the bullet in her shoulder idea. I wonder who got the idea of a bullet hitting her after ricocheting off a wall. Good thinking! Morgan Freeman has always the ability to sound credible, no mean feat considering his ridiculous lecture at the university. Fun movie with good action and pace. I only wish it would have gone on a bit longer somehow."
"skepticskeptical","8","1","5","4 July 2015"," Philosophical Matrix-esque Sci-Fi
","I watched Lucy twice, in part because I wanted to write a fair review and make sure that I understood what actually happened. At the end of the first viewing, I felt that the final line that ""now you know what to do"" was a bizarre non sequitur. That has not changed. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I find that the concept was creative enough and the cinematography excellent. The philosophical message strikes me as rather nihilistic. Basically, the drug which transforms Lucy into a kind of cyborg creature before she ""dies"" (becoming akin to God!) is a version of the ""performance enhancement"" meds being used liberally in modern Western societies. The people who take Provigil and Adderall, etc., all maintain that they function better and more quickly. In reality, they are just doing what they did before only more of it faster. In other words, these drugs do not transform an average person into a genius. Rather, they cause people to believe that they are brilliant, when in fact they are no different than they ever were. Who cares if you can carry out a mundane task ten times faster? That just means that you have become more efficient at producing whatever nonsense you were producing all along. A thousand times zero is still zero.<br/><br/>In this film, the ueber-performance enhancement drug accidentally ingested by Lucy grants her the capacity to make new neuronal connections so fast that she is able to process data like a computer. In fact, she really becomes a computer--losing all human emotions and qualities in the process. In some ways, Lucy harks back to the Matrix. There are plenty of other film references here, too, including the incredibly annoying and shameless theft of the opening of 2001 A Space Odyssey. (Was that legal, I wonder? I presume Kubrick, may he rest in peace, was not consulted.)<br/><br/>Lucy is filled with lots of death and destruction, so it probably sated the action-adventure crowd even while posing some pretty deep questions about the meaning of human existence and offering up a pretty dismal diagnosis that we are going nowhere and doing nothing. Indeed, if not for time, the film explains at some point, we would not even exist! The person who wrote this script obviously never studied the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, according to whom time is a category imposed on reality by the human mind. We run into a serious chicken-egg quandary, if Kant is right...<br/><br/>If there is any significant ""message"" here (which many reviewers deny), it is something like this: Knowledge is power, but only incomplete knowledge generates the need for power. Once knowledge is perfect, then power can only implode on itself. The take-away? Ignorance is bliss. In other words, one might read this film as advocating that human beings revert to simple hedonism and give up the quest for information accumulation, since it will eventually lead to their ruin. Is this message depressing, or is it liberating? <br/><br/>Will anyone be seduced into believing the arguably nihilistic subtext of Lucy? I doubt it. Most people will just roll with the corpses and crashed cars."

","The beginning is promising - female is tricked by selfish male friend into a rather horrific chain of events in typical Luc Besson fashion. As in the Fifth Element mayhem is released in abundance, in many unlikely places and in many unlikely ways, but it is watchable, likable, and an entertaining couple of hours or so.<br/><br/>Perhaps the sci-fi facts are loosely (should that be lucily?)interwoven but it is tightly directed, well paced, and, in places, inventively shot. Scarlet Johannson does everything she is asked to do and more, is almost well supported by the rest of the cast, and the cinematography and sound are up with the best.<br/><br/>Not a film to be taken too seriously, for, as Morgan Freeman tells us, ""it's only theory"", but taken on face value it is worthwhile cinema.<br/><br/>Watch it for some light hearted thrills in one of Mr Besson's better films."

The plot was pretty good with some minor holes. Despite being predictable, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"auberus","5","1","5","28 May 2015"," Has ""Lucy"" any cinematographic merit?
","Lucy, a woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal is forced to become a drug mule. But when the bag of synthetic drug she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks she transforms into a merciless warrior evolving beyond human logic and she undergoes unimaginable changes that begin to unlock her mind's full potential.<br/><br/>The plot is far for being the most stupid plot ever in cinema (not the sharpest as well). Basically ""Lucy"" is based on a simple question: can we be more than what we are? ""Limitless"" from Neil Burger had the same approach by the way, brain evolution was also triggered through use of a specific drug. ""The lawnmower man"" from director Brett Leonard touched upon the same subject. Even director Wally Pfister with ""Transcendence"" explored that same line of questioning. ""Lucy"" goes a step further as the brain evolution comes along body change and implies the next evolutions (plural) of humanity.<br/><br/>So the problem does not reside in the promise of the film but more so in its delivery. The film is entertaining enough and did not deserve the bashing it got especially in France where I guess critics associate box office success with mediocrity in an almost systematic manner. However there are several problems in the films that makes it play in the rental category or a nice candidate for downloads (obviously legal ones). In short the film does not deserve a 10 bucks ticket.<br/><br/>Primo character development is badly done. The main character Lucy interpreted by Scarlett Johansson balances between a blonde bimbo and an emotionally void cyborg. This binary mode does not help understand how knowledge could impact our humanity, development that could have enriched the movie and provide depth to an otherwise boring character. Having the percentage of brain use informing us of the evolving state of Lucy did not help much as there is no real logic in the progression of Lucy's powers. Eventually the treatment of Lucy's character is rather a misogynistic one despite Besson's claims about respecting women. Then comes the professor Norman portrayed by Morgan Freeman who re-prised his clichéd role of an authority figure. There is little to say except Besson needed an actor like Freeman to force on to us pseudo-scientific evidences delivered with very little conviction. As a result Morgan Freeman is severely walking thru his role and comes across as a slacker. Korean actor Min-sik Choi from ""Old boy"" completes the main roles trio. His one dimensional interpretation of an Asian Drug Lord allows him to swing between extreme calm and ultra-violence and what could have been an opportunity to confront different type of humanity ends up being a collage of grotesque caricatures. <br/><br/>Secondo the treatment of Asian people in the film may be questionable. Most if not all Asians are either cast as villains or as props to be killed for no other reason than comic relieve. Scarlett Johansson's character shoots a taxi driver simply because he can't speak English in Taiwan. In the hospital scene, she also shoots an Asian patient on the operating table in the head simply because she needs the surgeon to stitch her up. I am passing on the irrational behavior of someone getting more and more intelligent but acting in erratic ways or the fact that a tall blonde running with guns and killing everybody don't trigger any SWAT intervention. Honestly those scenes make me uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Tertio the overall structure /editing makes me wonder if ""Lucy"" was not a 15mn short that Luc Besson extended to the last drop. The film is 89mn long and is a succession of video clip like scenes cemented by a very cold ""art direction"" and action scenes that appears as fillers not bringing anything much to the overall plot. A more organic feel would have been a perfect bridge between a kinetic world and a more immaterial one. Basically I would have preferred a more ""Cronenbergesque"" point of view. Unfortunately the film resembles more of a glossy straight to DVD attempt that was green-lighted for the big screen in extremist. The end seems rushed and uses too much of this none organic CGI that really lower the artistic value. It's true that ""Lucy"" is still packed with some creative ideas like the flashback to the dawn of universe and humanity. Some will definitely see the homage to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but even this was not acknowledged by Mr Besson. The conclusion of the film was also very disappointed; basically using 100% of our brain turns us in some omnipotent god who likes to appear as a USB flash drive, really?<br/><br/>Well I am maybe too demanding. Here is my advice to you: use only 1% of your brain and you'll get a higher percentage of entertainment, which percentage exactly is up to you."

However, there is room for praise due to the overall feel of visual quality and cinematography employed.<br/><br/>This would have been a much better film if the underlying message it was trying to portray, could have been treated in a more academic manner; and without the violence, and gratuitous car chases.

The best rating this movie got was when the people in the cinema just started laughing at the absurdities which kept coming one after the other, eventually bursting in laughter at the end when she turns-into-a-f***n-USB (!). And no, it's not about the believability, or the science, or the brain functioning myth, it is simply an awfully bad movie, from the random animal footage at the beginning, through all the illogical plot failures, to the said USB transformation in the end (it really deserves to be mentioned twice).

"bowmanblue","7","1","5","29 March 2015"," Hardly highbrow, but enjoyable enough
","'Silly, silly, silly.' So said 'Graham Chapman' in Monty Python. And that's about the best summing up I can give 'Lucy.' It's completely daft and hardly intellectually stimulating, but – what the hell – sometimes you don't want films that make you think. You just want mindless entertaining fun. And Lucy does the job.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays the titular 'Lucy' – an average sort of girl who ends up accidentally being given a powerful new drug which allows her to use powers no human has ever had before. And, like I say, it's a fun film to watch. It's not perfect though. It starts off a bit 'arty.' There are clips of various 'unrelated' events (like a cheetah catching its prey) interspersed with the main narrative. But these sort of get dropped about half way through the film, leaving you to wonder why they were included to begin with.<br/><br/>While Lucy is busy killing those responsible for her new powers, we also have Morgan Freeman – the scientist who just so happens to be an expert on 'expanded brainpower.' His story sort of runs in parallel with hers, although he's basically there to explain what's going on (in the final scene he almost completely 'narrates' the action – it's quite funny!). He tells us that the average human uses about 10% of his/her brain. Lucy is on her way to use all 100%.<br/><br/>Expect killing. Expect kind of cool action scenes with Lucy using her superpowers to destroy all those who wronged her. There's a bit of science thrown in there, courtesy of Morgan Freeman to add a few concepts that might make you think. But it's not a long film. It's pretty condensed and everything flows from A-B quite nicely.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is about how humans only need about 10% of their brains to function. And you certainly won't need any more than that to understand and appreciate Lucy. Grab the munchies, allocate about 8% of your brain to the film and just enjoy."

","WARNING: This review could contain spoilers, continue reading at your own risk.<br/><br/>The basic premise that humans in particular do not use full brain capacity is an extremely fun story idea. The bounds are limitless. However, this film took humanity and turned it into some computer (man made). It just broke the whole notion of our existence and reduced our lives to a tribal nothing. We are either reproducers or searching for immortality and I think that is a broad category to toss everyone. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson's acting turned from mediocre to robotic after the first 20 minutes. Probably because she was bored with the part considering it's almost the same premise human and machine or human turns machine, or machine turns human storyline that we suffered through before in 'Her"" albeit with only Johansson's voice. <br/><br/>The idea was great but the rest really turned out hokey.

"bradwk","6","1","5","6 March 2015"," Only for ridiculous-sci-fi nerds
","This is a fantasy-sci-fi concept/action movie. It has a sequence of actions but no plot, and no dramatic tension. The characters are just sketches. The only people who will enjoy it are individuals who enjoy such: those of us who still like to visit the 12-year-old boy inside. My girlfriend sat with me for this DVD but mostly surfed the web.<br/><br/>I went in with very low expectations after reading so many bad reviews, and thanks to that I was surprised to still be entertained. It has enormous flaws to be sure. Some of the acting by, and dialog for, the extras is terrible: I'm pretty sure I could do better as her mother's voice on the phone! The sci-fi is quite preposterous. The cut-scenes of animals felt very old and cliché. The ""wise words"" coming out of Freeman's mouth are careless insults to your intelligence.<br/><br/>Lucy's character becomes robotic fairly early in the movie. This doesn't make sense (ever notice how humans are actually *more* expressive than the lower animals, not less?), and it is annoying because it makes for a necessarily boring performance by Johansson. And as Lucy acquires new abilities, I felt like asking ""Why wouldn't she just...?"" increasingly as the movie went on.<br/><br/>So what's to like? Mostly it's just a fun concept to nerd-out on for 90 minutes, complete with lots of effective CGI. And some of the action is fun, though some is not worth noticing.<br/><br/>The real puzzler for me is why Johansson and Freeman would have agreed to take part in this movie, since it did not require much of their acting ability."
"TxMike","Null","1","5","5 March 2015"," More intrigue from Luc Besson.
","Luc Besson has written and directed such movies as ""The Fifth Element"", ""La Femme Nikita"", and ""Leon the Professional."" So it comes as no surprise that ""Lucy"" follows in that general mold of mind-bending concepts and an abundance of action.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is Lucy in China and her boyfriend of sorts tries to convince her to deliver a sliver aluminum briefcase to a man in the hotel. Lucy isn't stupid, even though she only uses a small fraction of her brain, she asks what in inside. When he tells her he gets $1000 to make a delivery, she knows something is fishy and wants no part of it. But he slaps handcuffs onto her arm, attached to the briefcase, so she is forced to go in. That is where her adventure begins.<br/><br/>In a parallel story Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman is an expert in human intelligence and over the years has formed theories about what would happen if humans could harness a greater percentage of their brains, say 20% and beyond? As the movie moves along Lucy and Norman are destined to cross paths.<br/><br/>This is all science fiction, and lots of people, good guys and bad, get shot and killed. So take the bad with the good, in the end it is a clever, entertaining movie. And Scarlett Johansson is very good. She is an intelligent, well-educated person and her character and lines are genuine, within the confines of the fiction.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: It turns out a very powerful drug is in the briefcase, a synthetic form of what a pregnant mother produces to allow a fetus to develop its body structure. The bad guys are kidnapping people, implanting a kilo of the drug into their abdomen, sending them back to their European home cities, to be met by an agent to remove the drugs. But when Lucy spurns the advances of a bad guy, he hits her and kicks her in the abdomen, inside the plastic bag breaks, the synthetic drug begins to leak into and be absorbed by her body. This triggers fantastic improvement in her mental abilities, so she is able to hunt down the bad guys and the drugs, help eliminate them, and fuse with Norman's computers to transfer and preserve all the knowledge and wisdom she has gained before she dies shortly.<br/><br/>Edit: Feb 2018 - Watched it again, it all seemed very new to me, still enjoyed it as entertaining Sci-Fi. March 2020, ditto."

","There's a lot of mixed reviews for this movie some good, and some just out right horrible. So for the people who are still on the fence, wondering, ""Is this film is worth watching?"" Just take a few minutes to read this review and your questions will be answered.<br/><br/>Okay, let me inform you I am not a Sci-Fi fanatic but since everyone was raving about this movie I decided to give it a shot. OK now to the movie, the picture quality, one word Awesome! Great graphics and visual effects throughout the whole movie. It makes you feel like you're actually in the movie, like your looking through the eyes of Lucy herself. Which was one of the stronger points of the movie. I'm going to be completely honest in this review this movie had its good points and it had bad points but I definitely think the good out weigh the bad by far. Let's be honest have we ever watched a ""perfect movie"" a movie that you wouldn't change a thing about it? Not one thing......... doubt it. Lucy played by Scarlett Johansson is tricked into a awful deal where she is giving a mysteries briefcase and asked to deliver it by her new boyfriend. Lucy then find herself in a very bad situation not knowing the briefcase was filled with a rare synthetic drug , she's captured by a mafia kingpin and used as a drug mule, but when a bag of the synthetic drug erupts in her stomach she then experience unimaginable changes within herself. With the drug in her system it gave her great powers and abilities (physically and mentally) she goes from using 10% of her brain to using 100% of her brain. She then becomes unstoppable. She's on a mission and will stop anyone that jumps in her path, but will the drug who created her also be the same drug to destroy her? <br/><br/>The first few minutes of the film will have you sucked in, anxious to know Whats going on? and whats going to happen next? . As soon as the movie starts I guarantee you will be intrigued. I personally like movies that makes me think and this movie does just that. Although this movie is fiction it really does have positive messages within the storyline that most people didn't even catch onto. Sometimes in movies we are so into the action and suspense that we tend to miss a very important message for instance a quote from the movie: for example ""Time is the only true unit of measure, it gives proof to the existence of matter, without time we don't exist."" another: ""Its funny, I use to be concerned with who I was and what I wanted to be and now that I have access to the furthers reaches of my brain, I see things clearly and realize what make us ""us"" "" <br/><br/>Even though the film is not factual it does make you realize how interesting the human brain truly is. The thought of allowing your brain to sail into another world, another way of thinking,another way of life that's not our own. Its quite fascinating. Some parts of the movie are so far fetch that it becomes comical. The false scientific and philosophical information stated all through the movie is a little ridiculous, but keep in mind it is a fictional movie it never claims to be anything other than that. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I do believe Lucy is a good movie and I do recommend it. Just remember it is not a documentary. So yes this movie is filled with false information however don't let that be your focus point throughout the movie sometimes the best movies are the ones that take us away from the factual and drifts us into a fantasy."

This is a movie about a woman who can use %100 of her brain's capacity (Assuming, we ourselves, can only use %10). Unfortunately, the woman that is blessed with this ""insane"" percentage of brain usage... is a complete moron. <br/><br/>One reason I say this is, without any spoilers, is she doesn't kill the main antagonist right away. She gets the drop on him. She's crazy smart. He is unaware of her prolonged existence. But she doesn't realize that he is going to be a major threat to her. Really?! I, supposedly, only use %10 of my brain. & my foresight was strong enough to see his actions coming.

","Lucy was directed by Luc Besson, who is also known for two of my favourite films: La Femme Nikita and The Professional, the latter which launched Natalie Portman's career. In Besson's new film, a woman is again the main character. Scarlett Johanssen plays Lucy, a young woman who is contaminated with a new drug that allows her to use up to 100% of her brain's capacity. The movie posits that most of us only use 10 to 15% of our brain's abilities. As the movie progresses so do Lucy's capabilities: she starts to control matter and move things around with her brain. Morgan Freeman plays the friendly science professor-researcher who want to access Lucy's new acquired knowledge. If you want pure escapism for 90 minutes, this is your film. It's silly-serious fun. If you decide to accept the premise of the film, you will be entertained by the incredibly fast editing, beautiful earth and space images, and crazy metaphysical ending.

","I think, as an action movie, it's an entertaining film. It is exciting and thrilling with some fantastic visualization, and also refreshing to see Scarlett Johannson in this kind of character. Adding to that, it has a thought-provoking message about how it would be like if human can evolve so far as to use a 100% of our brain. It talks about how we would no longer see trivial things of life as a big deal, how we would use our psycho power so effectively, how we could remember far back into our birth moment, remember far back into the beginning of human evolution and understand the whole journey of humanity as a whole and then we no longer need to be in this world because in the end we will transcend it.<br/><br/>Yes, I believe these are truthful and it's nice to have such food for thoughts, something reminding us that we don't have to forever be this way.<br/><br/>However, I completely disagree with a few things that the film convey: - Once she is transformed to use more of her brain, Lucy was very cruel and merciless, she killed and killed. If we evolve higher and higher, I believer there is no way that we will be more violent toward each other! No way! We would have so much sensitivity and so much knowledge and wisdom to have deep awareness of how much life is precious and how much we all are connected to one another. It is bad to present Lucy in a form of heartless killer, although she only kills the bad guys.<br/><br/>-I think in reality there is no medicine that could make this kind of evolution happen to us and we shouldn't try to produce anything like that. Meditation of the right kind can make some people use their will power and travel back and forth through time just as fine. It is a matter of mind, spirit and soul, not much of brain.<br/><br/>But anyway, I'm glad they present something thoughtful and new in an entertaining way. At least it gets many people to think far beyond this body, far beyond our current level of existence."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","7","1","5","8 January 2015"," Compelling and promising start to original science fiction film, gets cliché at end
","Can I leave the film Lucy in the oven for a bit longer? Such a strong start to the movie, it just needs to cook a little more before it's ending is done.<br/><br/>Luc Besson's original creation of Lucy tells of a woman thrust into the dark drug world of Taiwan, forced to be a drug mule. When the synthetic drugs sewn into her belly leak and are absorbed into her system, her mind's ability is expanded. Lucy turns her new-found potential and magnified powers back upon the mob boss responsible in the form of revenge.<br/><br/>The story of Lucy is told seamlessly from three different perspectives simultaneously. The main perspective is through Lucy's experience, the secondary complementary perspective is through the lecture of a neurology professor and the third is spliced imagery similar to National Geographic footage interwoven relevantly to the scenes it mirrors. It is a unique, risky but ultimately effective directorial vision.<br/><br/>Luc Besson takes the interesting belief that humans only access 10% of their brain function, aware it is an old wives tale and misinformed, and uses this as a jumping point for an enthralling movie. He assumes completely creative control and takes several liberties with his direction for purely artistic purposes. Lucy examines evolution and human brain function as well as the impact of the inherent human nature on the world environment in a purely hypothetical and exploratory manner. Besson also explores the concept of time in relation to human existence. All in all, the thought provoking views examined by Besson are decisive in opinion and well conceived.<br/><br/>Eventually the film gets a bit monotonous, veers away from its initial design and becomes rife with action sequences. Certainly cool as a film, I wish Lucy had invested a more thought for a more complex conclusion.<br/><br/>Lucy is a science fiction thriller and novel premise for a fictional action film. Note the word ""fictional"" for scientific proof and legitimacy won't be found here. Don't let that detract from the experience because Lucy is an entertaining and novel movie experience.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full."
"peterp-450-298716","6","1","5","23 December 2014"," Despite the nonsensical content , an extremely fascinating movie.
","""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it."" <br/><br/>Is Lucy the result of a scientifically based theory or should she join the club of ""by chemicals mutated superheroes"" like Spiderman, The Hulk and Captain America? We can remove the first item of the list because the theory of us only using 10% of our brains is complete nonsense. That would mean that there's 90% of unexplored territory for grabs in our upper chamber. The risk of brain injury shrinks. And would our skull not be too big for that small part? Isn't it true that evolution slightly adjusts things so that there's an optimum use of certain features? The second item comes closer to the phenomenon of ""Lucy"", just that no startling changes were made. No flashy superheroes costume or superhuman attributes such as web spraying additives. Besides the fact that Lucy turns into an emotionless and soulless highly intelligent being who assesses situations in a rational and logical manner, there's nothing of substance that changes her.<br/><br/>The beginning of ""Lucy"" however, is highly entertaining and intriguing. The fact that Lucy is the victim of a cunning devised Korean plan with tourists used as living containers for transporting a chemical drug, was really original. That the drug, with the not so sexy sounding name CPH4, ends up in Lucy's bloodstream by harshly violence and increases the rate of usage of the brains, sounded plausible. Certainly the statement of an expert in that field (Lucy had at that time not enough brain power to know that) helps with that. The synthetic drugs seems to be the same as the substance which a pregnant woman produces for the fetus,so it will have the energy to build up a bone structure. ""For a baby it has the force of an atomic bomb"" he claims dramatically. You can imagine what that cocktail of CPH4 does to Lucy's body.<br/><br/>Not only it is a pleasure to look at Scarlett Johansson but it's also fun admiring her acting talent. She demonstrates a whole palette of emotions : from innocent, frightened and distraught to ruthlessly calculated and cold-blooded. In ""Her"" it was her sultry voice that enchanted you and in ""Lucy"" her natural beauty enraptures you. ""Beauty is the purgation of superfluities"" as Michelangelo quoted. In my opinion Johansson purged a lot of superfluities for sure. And in this film, it's not only her looks that makes men dizzy and their head swoon. One look is enough to knock them out. Morgan Freeman just plays himself again and guides you through the story with the full explanation of the phenomenon that we are witnessing, complete with pictures from the animal kingdom and a prehistoric hunter as illustrations. Again a minor contribution to the greater whole as in ""Transcendence"". What a pity ! And those are the two protagonists whose story lines go together in a parallel way. The audience is thrown back and forth between those two story lines.The old wise man, a role to play by Morgan, and Johansson as übermensch on the other side of the world.<br/><br/>Strange but true, as the percentage counter increases and Lucy supposedly uses more of her brain, it's up to the viewer to gradually reduce the use of brain cells, because the evolution Lucy undergoes becomes incredible implausible. Becoming more intelligent is automatically linked with the development of paranormal abilities and the reducing of emotional values. The phone call at the beginning of the film still had a high emotional value because the drug wasn't working yet at full power. The development of psychic abilities however, sees to it that the entertainment value of the action-rich parts become valueless. What's so exciting being confronted with an invincible person whose abilities seem almost alien ? Beside the thrilling car chase through Paris, most scenes were pretty somnolent. A snap or a glance was enough to take out the opponents. And the denouement is pretty surreal, with the comprehensive knowledge being summarized on a USB-stick. Apparently that universal knowledge wasn't that big of a deal.<br/><br/>Despite the implausible and nonsensical content sometimes, it's still an extremely fascinating movie. Especially the Tarantino-esque fragments that occur here and there, were much appreciated. Like a patient who gets a few bullets in his body after Lucy made a quick analysis of his health state. Coarse, shocking and gross, but also absurdly humorous. However, I never want to reach that level of intelligence because it will cause loss of deep human feelings like emotion, pleasure and joy.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"
"ahegde3149","5","1","5","1 December 2014"," Interesting premise but flawed execution
","I never knew Lucy would turn out to be a nice superhero film. All I knew about it was that a woman Lucy breaks the barriers of human brain capacity reaching its maximum. Now the idea that having such a brain capacity will give you the ability perform telekinetic, mind control,control of electromagnetic waves and what not seems a bit too far fetched but it was fun and engaging to watch up to a level. I think that's how you might like the film, ignoring the science aspect of it.<br/><br/>The movie begins with man tricking his girlfriend named 'Lucy' (Scarlett Johansson) into delivering a package to some drug-lord in Taiwan. Then it turns out it contains 4 packets a powerful drug called CPH4,one of which which then Lucy is forced to deliver by placing the packet in her belly along with 3 other people bearing the remaining 3 packets. The packet leaks when the buyer hits Lucy hard into her belly and the drug mixed into her blood gives her the ability and power the whole movie circles around. Well now intentions are to go after the drug lord and find the other 3 packets before they are misused. <br/><br/>Once the search for the drug lord and drug sets in the action pumps up. We already have seen Scarlett in action as Black Widow of Avengers but here she shows the emotional depth of her character quite well too.Attaining such brain capacity and knowledge Lucy seems to be losing her humanistic ideals (which is again questionable) and she is having hard time digesting such power. Scarlett does it all with ease. Morgan Freeman is also there playing a professor expert in neurological science. He also adds some scientific and philosophical ideals into the film in the first half which was good to watch. Also some thought provoking questions about our existence of life, death,time,emotions and about being humans are raised which really boosted it in sci-fi department. But all this falls apart with an over the top climax going far beyond its reach. Also many of the action sequences become illogical due to Lucy's powers itself. She can hack into any system in the world yet the bad guys reach the destination earlier than her, you know just ensure there is final face-off.Actually Lucy gets a chance to kill the drug-lord for good early in the film but he is just kept injured so that he meets our heroine again at the end. Also it goes into full on '2001:Space Odyssey' mode at the ending which is supposed to wow us but up to the point things had become quite silly to accept any seriousness in the story despite the good visual effects and CGI.<br/><br/>There some points in the film where it is better to keep doors of your brain shut and not think too much about what is going, it will help to enjoy this one more. Lucy is weak on story and script, also tries to reach the stars beyond its capacity yet despite its absurdness Lucy is somewhat an enjoyable ride and watchable action flick. Main credit goes to Scarlett who carries the weight of the film with a fine performance.<br/><br/>RATING:[2.5/5]"

","I had hoped for more than this movie delivered. It had a few big stars, the story may have been interesting, and at the least it could have had some stylized action and good music. Unfortunately it failed on all fronts. Perhaps when the plot was adapted to film, a lot was lost. There were so many scenes that were put in just for a corny cheesy joke. I could have lived with plot holes that were left up to the imagination, but they went into too much and the very weak plot required far too much of a leap. This was worse than junk science, it depended on the viewer to actually be stupid. The action scenes were very anti-climactic. If you don't believe me, just watch the scene where she hits the ceiling in a rotating room. There is no good explanation for this and it's embarrassing to watch. The music was not synced well to action scenes, the actors played mediocre roles, ugh. There is nothing redeeming about this film at all. NONE of it was believable. I'm not just talking about the brain stuff. The belief that a Korean cartel would deploy that much firepower in a foreign city over such a small amount of substance... c'mon. Totally ridiculous film. Waste of time."

","Though it's a sci-fi movie and we use to see some crazy events in these kind of movies, this film just trying to save the day with overrated acting. Lads, for the sake of god, working with someone hot and blonde and making her the unusual hero or heroine of the film, DOES NOT make the movie awesome. This stereotype of movies just gain the undeserved and overrated attraction of the off-grade audience. Yes we may have some action in the movie (though it's cheap and again overrated), but there is no way that any of these action scenes (blow-up scenes and hair changing, light speeding, turning into a black stone or liquid) turning into logical back-grounded parts. All we hear about background is human evolution and hey here is a bloody review for you guys: It's not enough."
"warren-levin","4","1","5","22 November 2014"," Good start, long stretch and fail miserably
","The main plot line is interestingly a fallacy. Throughout the movie, there is some philosophical gibberish buffered to the viewer in order to anchor the main plot-line.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it starts well with Lucy getting forced to do a deal for a ""boyfriend"". Johansson is good at simulating a terrified woman at the prospect of getting killed by Korean criminals.<br/><br/>After this good part (like 15-20 minutes in the movie), it all goes to sh*t. The movie doesn't make sense anymore : ""Let's shoot guns and kill everyone in the path of Lucy!"". You get a looong stretch. Lucy lose all empathy, there is no more character development. It all gets boring seemingly fast. Only good thing : some specials effects are not that bad.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, she gets to unlocked bit by bit the capacities of her brain. The writers just give Lucy whatever powers comes to their minds ... Like controlling signals, telekinesis, mind reading, mind control, time travel (wtf?) or even synthesis.<br/><br/>If you've got 1h something to lose, that a good movie for it.

Suspension of disbelieve, fine. Except they continue to ask for more suspension of disbelieve when they involve telepathy, telekinesis and ultimately abilities that transcend time and space.

","So the movie is based on a character (Lucy) who is kidnapped and has a sachet of drugs inserted into her stomach, the sachet leaks and the drug takes over her brain which allows Lucy to gradually reach 100% of her brain capacity. I enjoyed this movie but may not watch it again, not because it's rubbish just because it's one of those films. I thought it was a smart film which left you thinking at the end. Scarlett Johanson acting was great... better then the avengers ( she annoyed me in that). Scarlett was a bad-ass in this film which put her up in my estimations. The ending of the film was sort of like inception. A ending which leaves you on a cliffhanger wondering what happens to the character. It was a satisfying interesting movie which I would recommend."
"emjaypeps","3","1","5","11 October 2014"," A Poor Man's ""Transcendence""
","You need to watch the trailer for this. It's rather exciting. But don't bother with the film. I won't spoil the movie (any more than Luc Besson already has)with any plot giveaways because there really wasn't one. A plot, that is. I kept waiting for the movie to start. Kept waiting, kept waiting, then I realized it was about to finish. <br/><br/>There is certainly a good idea lurking in here somewhere, but I couldn't find it, and neither could Monsieur Besson. Honestly, I was bored. There seems to be a real division in the reviews between loved it and hated it. The lovers, in my opinion, are far too easily pleased by shoot-outs and the notion of supernatural powers. And it was just a notion; there was no depth to anything.<br/><br/>Contrary to some other reviewers, I thought Scarlet Johansson was terrible. I assume the woeful overacting in the first few scenes was her paranoid attempt to make sure no one thought she couldn't act when she became the emotionless automaton for the rest of the movie. And Morgan Freeman ... WHAT were you thinking? It's a good job he had to look thoroughly bewildered most of the time. I think he was. It's a paycheck, I guess. <br/><br/>The ending ... uh ... yeah. Ripped-off echoes of ""The Time Machine"", and even the creeping black stuff looked like it was done by a first-year computer graphics student.<br/><br/>Monsieur Besson, please re-watch your classic ""Leon"".

"Kroshe","9","1","5","11 October 2014"," Enlightenment ...
","First of all this is a Luc Besson movie, so probably half of the reviewers here will hate this film while other half will love it. You guess which half is with 5% brain capacity.. :) <br/><br/>I found the movie intellectually stimulating as Besson has done an excellent job of presenting the panoramic sight of the modern secular enlightenment, combined with applied mathematics, physics, bio-chemistry, and a little pinch of technological singularity. Other than these, it is also a fast moving action flick with a well-written scenario keeps you wonder what will happen in the end.. So I think it is safe to say that Lucy can satisfy the intellectuals as well as the common action-addicted-movie-goers, if the audience knows how to anatomise it.<br/><br/>I personally think much credit must be given to any film that even attempts to touch such an intimidating topic: where the evolution is taking us.. And trying to do this with a high-speed-action film is a very good/smart choice for a director. Besson provokes the audience and makes them think about the concept of human potential and the probability of improving on brainpower. At least, it worked on me..<br/><br/>This is a good movie to watch."
"jmcanoy","6","1","5","4 October 2014"," Little below expectation
","A little disappointed even though I kind of expected it will not turn out to be great as expected. The only appeal to me about this movie is the story line about 10% brain capacity being used by humans. Similar to the Limitless movie but with differences in the plot --- should be or else there was no point re-creating a relatively new movie.<br/><br/>On the quality of the effects, I think it was great overall! Although, even with my untrained eye, there was an obvious special effects mishap. During the first of series of special effects, right after Lucy was kicked and got contaminated by the drug, I could give a good guess how they did the trick. I think it was a moving sort of box that rotated and make Lucy move from one side of the room to the other and make her dangle. This was really obvious when you focus your attention at the chains while she was on the ceiling of the room. The chains were hanging towards the ceiling not towards the floor. Only gravity makes that happen. It then suggests that the room has to be upside down to make it appear she was on the ceiling but actually now lying on the floor. The chains gave the trick away.<br/><br/>Sorry, the second part was being nit-picky about it. Just sharing so that they will be aware not slip up something so simple."

","I watched the movie at Bashundhara Cineplex Bangladesh with a great expectation. I must say the movie had a very weak story with an excellent making. Certainly Scarlett Johansson was the main attraction of the movie but she also could not do any better than this with such a poor plot. The making of the movie was great. Overall a good movie but could not meet up the expectation as it gave the notion of a great plot without a justified conclusion at the end. The acts of a person who managed to use her brain 100% should not have been like this. What she did could have been done by a strong woman of any kind. I am sure there will be many more movies in the future made on this plot but the initiator failed to meet the expectation. Thanks to Scarlett anyways for keeping the audience at the theater for the full time!"
"Drive-in_Zeppelin","5","1","5","2 October 2014"," A solid sci-fi action film that fails in its attempt to be something more
","Now what you need to know about Lucy, is that it stars Scarlett Johansson (The Avengers, The Prestige) as the title character, and Morgan Freeman pops up as yet another role where he essentially says some things and fills space in the movie. Amr Waked, from the film Syriana also shows up to deliver a good supporting role as Pierre the French cop.<br/><br/>It has a silly story that tries too hard to transcend the 'big dumb action-sci-fi' title, but more on that later. Lucy gets forced into a shady deal with some Koreans while living in Taiwan, and ultimately becomes a pawn in their drug trafficking scheme when her and a few other diverse foreign nationals have what looks like blue crystal meth surgically implanted in them for smuggling purposes. Instead of it being Heisenberg's famous recipe, the drug is actually some synthetic chemical similar to what fetuses get in their sixth month of pregnancy that is apparently extremely potentor something. It's not really important what it chemically is supposed to be. What IS important is that she gets kicked in the stomach and her little blue baby starts to leak and is absorbed into her body. <br/><br/>The blue magic ultimately starts to change her physiology and starts to supercharge her neurons giving her an unprecedented mental faculty. So she periodically begins to unlock new superhuman abilities as her brain fully turns itself on. The premise, as explained in complementary scenes by Professor Norman (Freeman) is that humans by nature only use a very limited fraction of their brain power – something like 10%. His theories are that if a human were to ever unlock more of this processing power, they would be subject to unthinkable (pun definitely intended) abilities that are beyond our human scope of understanding. He is posed the question by one of his students what it would mean to use 100% of your neurons and responds 'I simply don't know'. <br/><br/>Well that's the gimmick for the film. Lucy steadily increases her brain power until it inevitably reaches 100%. Additionally, the blue stuff has a pretty short half-life so if she doesn't keep ingesting it, her cells start to disintegrate. Ultimately she has to team up with Pierre (Waked) to find the other blue stuff before the Koreans get to it, and at the same time she has to unravel what it is she's becoming through the help of Professor Norman. Now I can't fault the movie for its story as it is vaguely original, albeit silly. I found it pretty interesting to think what would happen if mankind started to transcend space and time and suddenly have a completely alien understanding of the universe from what we currently know. It reminded me a lot of reading Dr. Manhattan's personal dialogue in the graphic novel version of The Watchmen. <br/><br/>Where I see this movie primarily failing is that it was trying too much to be a clever film. It's trying too hard to project a meaningful message in a big dumb action movie. Yes, despite the silliness of premise, I will admit I was entertained by the action and visuals (namely Ms. Johansson) , but there was this subtext the movie kept trying to convey about mankind living in ignorance and self- absorption. It was distracting to have stock footage spliced in every few seconds of animals, natural disasters, and mankind's achievements that were obviously supposed to parallel and add some deeper meaning to Lucy's transformation. I'm sure you could find something more profound in the Big Bang Theory intro than in Lucy, as in this film it just comes across as a jumbled mess. When your premise is that a beautiful blonde suddenly develops the ability to interact with all of time and space, you don't cheapen it by trying to some implant some pretentious rigmarole like in 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br/><br/>The Bottom Line: This movie makes a decent attempt and ultimately touches on a lot of interesting and thought provoking topics in science fiction. The visuals are occasionally creative and well delivered – sometimes hokey, but they don't have that cheap feel to them. Unfortunately for Lucy, movies aren't just the net score of their individual components. It looked dumb going in, and it felt dumb after leaving but that's what an action film is. It isn't meant to pontificate the nature of humanity or indulge in some nihilistic view of the universe. Action movies are gun-battles and car chases and beautiful women with mind-powers. If it had just stuck to that definition it might have worked, but unfortunately it tried too hard to be something more. <br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on DriveInZeppelin's website"

","Critics weren't overly fond of this movie...and moviegoers seemed to be divided on it general. That being said, it made a ton of money at the box office, becoming a hit in the process. I was mixed on the movie overall. For such a thought-provoking premise, they didn't delve nearly enough into it. Luc Besson had a ton of unique material on his hands, but i'm not sure he fully knew where to go with everything. I usually don't like it when movies are two hours long, but this one definitely could have used a longer running time. Honestly? the first 45-50 minutes are well done and very entertaining. The second half is when things begin to unravel and become overly silly. The ending felt like a rip off! It ended very abruptly and very anti-climatically in my opinion. I wouldn't say it's filled with action, but there is certainly enough to satisfy the adrenaline junkies. The acting is fun, I'll say that. Johansson is fantastic as the lead! She's forced to become monotonous for a lot of the movie, but I felt it added to the atmosphere. She put her all into the role and I thought she did an excellent job! Morgan Freeman is OK, but doesn't have that much to do. We all have bills to pay! This was clearly a paycheck role for him. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say this was worth watching in theaters, but it's worth a look on DVD or Blu-Ray. I was never bored and the first half is especially good. It's too bad the second half got way too silly. <br/><br/>6.4/10"

","""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale"" says Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) by way of summation of the insights she has achieved under an accidental overdose of a new and powerful synthetic drug.<br/><br/>This is to date Johansson's best performance, full of tight close-ups on her face as her character nonverbally radiates a dimensionality seldom seen on the screen. I suspect that Evan Rachel Wood's Dolores Abernathy character in ""Westword"" was influenced by Johansson's take on her title character. Both characters drift seamlessly in and out of a distanced robotic mindset. Especially remarkable is Lucy's overseas phone call to her mother.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is a philosophical film being marketed as science fiction - action adventure. Since it worked for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" back in 1968 I guess they thought it would work here. But the mismatch has caused ""Lucy"" to miss much of Luc Besson's intended audience and to disappoint those looking for Scarlett doing a ""Leon"" inspired ""Kick-Ass"" number in tight shiny ""Black Widow"" latex.<br/><br/>The mismatch between the film and its promotional campaign is my only major criticism. A minor criticism is the poor quality of the digital effects (the car chase doesn't hold a candle to the old fashion way, insert 1998's ""Ronin"" here). Given the budget limitations, the POV, and the transforming mental condition of the title character; the film would have been far better served had Beeson substituted expressionism for realism. Cinema greatness was there for the taking.<br/><br/>As in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" the existential theme is not anti-God (or even pro Übermensch), but anti-ego. With a character slowly losing their connection with humanity, finally connecting with the infinite at the moment they become infinitesimal.<br/><br/>""Man's task in life is the paradoxical one of realizing his individuality and at the same time transcending it to arrive at the experience of universality. Only the fully developed self can drop the ego.""

","One of man's perennial questions is 'what if we could use 100% of our brain capabilities' and this is the main thrust of this film.<br/><br/>Since it is based on a scientific assumption, this is a science fiction movie that treads on a rather thin line. The truth is we don't know, empirically, how much of our brain we use and neither can we tell what it would be like if we reached 100% so the makers of this movie took a huge creative leap with rather mixed results.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong on the whole, it is a decent experience, well made, and at times rather intense. Nonetheless its story has holes on several levels.<br/><br/>It doesn't get off on a promising start due to a prolonged incoherent dialogue between a guy and a girl where somehow the girl is forced to make a delivery unaware of the significance of the importance of the content she delivered. Now, you get a gang that invests a lot of money to develop a unique mind enhancing drug, so how come they decided to test it on a random girl rather than in a controlled environment?<br/><br/>From the moment Lucy is caught up, the story flies off from there with several gaps which rather grow that get covered culminating in a very bizarre climax.<br/><br/>Concluding, this is a theme with plenty of potential but goes nowhere near reaching it.

","By now, this has done OK at the box-office. By now, everyone who went to watch this with 2 things in mind, 1, being the hot Scarlett Johansson being front-left-and-center and 2, being the completely misleading trailer, that perhaps promised Black Widow Pro in this Luc Besson flick, who's also known for having strong female characters all through, in works as diverse as 'Leon', 'The 5th element' and 'Joan D'Arc' (Angel-A as well, but that's for another post), really, really hates this.<br/><br/>My verdict? It definitely ain't all that bad. Sure, quite a bit's lost in translation from the way it all begins, with metaphors telegraphing everything that's happening to the lead character, to the ingenious use of sub-titles signifying the lead's ignorance in the beginning, and having become self-aware towards the eventual denouement.<br/><br/>Still, with this epic scope in mind, Besson, once again, is in a hurry to wrap everything up neatly. He evokes everything from 'The tree of life' to 'Transcendence', even having Freeman pop-up (don;t think that was a coincidence), but falls completely short of making this coherent when one leaves the cinema. <br/><br/>The relationship between the leads is less-than-perfunctory, as is the relationship between the mob-boss-overlord and his minions, and the choice of CPH4 for distribution. I am not a fan of the Michael Bay school of exposition, but this one goes completely the other way, and people willing to give this one a chance and suspend their disbelief were just going, 'huh'? Moi aussi. <br/><br/>He takes enormous advantage of the aspect of this plot where the audience has to suspend their disbelief completely, and stretches it to ridiculous lengths. <br/><br/>Still, as a fellow reviewer put it recently, if this did not have Johansson in the lead, it might've all been for naught.<br/><br/>A lesser effort from Besson, as well as from Johansson. They should've done more, and done better. For what it's worth though, it's 90 minutes of partially-ponderous fun, that's let down by being in-your-face-unsubtle holier-than-thou."

","It's only fair to have high expectations from a new Luc Besson film. After all, he made ""Leon"", ""The 5th Element"" and a few other classics.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" starts off well, as a promising action/mystery mixed with dark comedy. The protagonist gets infected by an experimental drug and gradually becomes superhuman.<br/><br/>While I don't mind a guilty-pleasure sci-fi, the story here went overboard with existential speculation, special effects overkill and pretty shallow characters. I somewhat cared about Lucy, but only in the first 30 minutes or so.<br/><br/>I expected more subtlety from the writer/director, and ended up watching something that's on the same level (or lower) as some films he produced: ""Danny The Dog Unleashed"", ""District 13"", ""Taken"" or ""Taxi""."

","Coming from Luc Besson I expected some fast paced action with a good story line. And though the movie had this potential, the story contained far too many holes to be credible. The topic is difficult, but nonetheless it could have been far better. The acting is pretty good and Scarlett Johansson (so very nice to look at!) shows she can really act as she not only puts down two very different characters in one movie, but also holds her own against Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately that doesn't save the story. The chapter division is nicely thought of and is a plus.<br/><br/>Concerning the action, there's plenty, but somehow it does not satisfy the viewer. It feels ""limited"" considering the almost ""limitless"" power of the heroin. <br/><br/>The end will leave you with a feeling of ""what?"". It is somewhat predictable, but also ""weird"".<br/><br/>conclusion: It is an entertaining movie, but nothing more than that."

"benoit_03","6","1","5","23 August 2014"," Mish-mash, ridiculous-at-times plot, but an enjoyable action flick.
","Luc Besson - director of such hits as Taken, The Fifth Element and The Transporter - offers us another slice of action in thriller, 'Lucy'.<br/><br/>The story begins in present day Taiwan, where the titular character finds herself unwillingly forced into becoming a drug mule for a new synthetic drug. Expectedly, trouble soon begins, as after a kick to the stomach, the bag containing the drug splits inside her, entering her blood stream and allowing her to use the other 90% of mankind's theoretically 'untapped' brainpower.<br/><br/>The plot begins well, with Lucy discovering her new abilities, with some good old fashioned Neeson-esque gunfight sequences, but halfway through things start to get a little ridiculous. Whereas 'Taken' was somewhat possible, Besson has taken a more science fiction route this time, which unfortunately may lose some people along the way, but no spoilers here.<br/><br/>As with the director's many previous movies, there is no shortfall of action. Gunfights galore, martial arts mayhem, and car chase chaos litter the Paris streets during the final act, with our female lead leaving a path of pile ups in her wake. Her new abilities also allow for some interesting sequences.<br/><br/>Praise goes to Scarlett Johansson for her portrayal of Lucy. Her acting is one of the best female action leads there has been, and you do feel like you are taken along on the journey with her, providing you can follow the plot. Morgan Freeman, as always offering soothing baritones that help set up the film's premise, but more screen time for him would have been well appreciated.<br/><br/>So, Lucy does leave you with the film's thought-provoking message of 'what really could happen if we were to use more than 10% of our brain?'. Unfortunately, for those who like a little more realism and substance in their films, that's not enough."

In some ways it is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in years. Some of the dialog could be better. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Other than that, it was an okay film, and I would recommend that people watch it. Riveting from the first frame to the last."
"j-madej","6","1","5","17 August 2014"," ""LUCY"" is more of an intellectual film discussed as an action film
","Back in late 80's and early 90's Luc Besson burst on to the world cinema scene as one of the few directors who were able to combine the depth of typical intellectual french cinema and action sequences in almost poetic way. His early movies ""The Big Blue"", ""Nikita"" and ""Léon: The Professional"" to just a name a few, were great testament to his unique way of story telling as well as directing style. The characters he creates, being also a writer of the scripts for most of his movies are usually loners who care about themselves until something or someone changes their life irreversibly. <br/><br/>Smart Hollywood producer once said that directors are like pitchforks for a while they are in tune with what is hip and top quality, but after while they loose their tune and they never come back to the time of an excellence from their youth. Well that is one man's opinion, because everything is cyclical so something that was in fashion many decades ago eventually will comeback in to fashion again. We often use the technology that helps us to achieve the final product that is theoretically improved. In reality we recycle old ideas and it is very hard to not give them our own individual twist. Mostly for directors it is almost impossible to top the success of the movie that brought them fame and recondition. You aways will be judged more harshly now then before, because more is expected of you. But to be a great director you need a life experience and that comes with time. <br/><br/>""LUCY"" is one of those movies that you will either like it or hate it depending on if you like Besson's narrative style. <br/><br/>""A woman (titled LUCY played by excellent Scarlett Johansson) is accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic.""<br/><br/>In this straight forward premise Besson is hiding deeper meaning to what otherwise would have been predictable and unoriginal story. There is a lot of intellectual information delivered in a coded way by using so called cut aways and fast montage that illustrates the parallel between the story of the main character and the evolution of life on our planet as we know it. This at first might be quite confusing for the viewer but eventually you understand subconsciously what Besson is trying to tell us. By choosing symbolically the name LUCY he points us in the direction of understanding that Scarlett Johansson's character is a first human being to ACCESS 100 % of the brain capability paralleled by a sorry of the first 3.2-million-year-old ape ""Lucy"" who was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton discovered by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray on the November 24, 1974 on the coast of South Africa. <br/><br/>Those of you who expect an all out action film might leave the cinema disappointed. ""LUCY"" is more of an intellectual film discussed as an action film, if that makes sense. Scarlett Johansson is excellent specially in the first act of the film as a ""stupid blond"" that gets mixed up with the wrong kind of people that take advantage of her innocence. She is super emotional and as an actor does some great technical work with tears coming of one or the other eye which is not easy. The slow transition from victim to the empowered super human being that eventually can control the reality of time and space is done gradually and is symbolically plastered over the screen with the big number of the percentage of how far of the transition she is in. Morgan Freeman as usual, brought his depth and amazing voice to play Professor Norman that Scarlett Johansson's character comes in contact with. The third act might not be as good as the first two which for a big Hollywood movie might be a bit of a letdown but the intellectual message passed on to us is in itself is full of depth on the intellectual level. I do appreciate what Besson was trying to do here even if he didn't quite succeeded, but at least he chose to challenge himself and us intellectually and I will always like the director who puts first strong intellectual narration over visual content.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

""Lucy"" is one of the most foolish movies in the history of film. At first this flick is easy to understand, but as the film continues it becomes more complicated with the double-talk and the false belief of why humanity exists and how humanity was brought into existence. This movie is all over the place, it's promoting Darwinism, Evolution, and the ten percent of the brain myth (which has never been proven, even scientists cannot prove this myth). As a strong in faith Christian, this film is basically like a comedy to me, with very good special effects. I give this a 4/10 rating because there are still some positive elements (no pun intended) there are some very decent performances, I like Scarlett Johansson as an actress her performances are always very well-acted in whatever role she plays, there are some good action scenes, and as someone who loves film music, the Score is fantastic, the mixture of electronic experimental and orchestral is different and is worth adding to a Playlist.<br/><br/>If you still haven't seen this flick, I recommend it if you just want to be entertained, but if you are someone who is looking for answers as to the why when and how of the existence of the human race, then I don't recommend this movie, it will just lead you astray."

She was supposed to use her brain more than ever but has nothing to do with power. In an another scene, she removes a bullet from her shoulder without feeling any pain, means if you can you 70% of your brain you will not feel any kind of pain. Seriously? Then, she can see all the mobile waves traveling in the air with naked eyes and can even zoom it. The screen writer thinks you can do anything if you can use 100% of your brain. You will literally become God.<br/><br/>Another dumb scene was in which Lucy explains to the scientists that numbers are just creation of our mind and does'nt physically exist. Like all those scientists are dumb and not already knowing that. And how come Lucy has gained so much knowledge. Brain capacity and knowledge are two different things .
This film is far, far away from Logic ."

If it hadn't taken itself so serious it might have worked. Now it's just a failed attempt at making a good philosophical sci-fi action flick. It was so bad that me and my girflriend repeatedly asked each other what the hell this movie was trying to be. Laughable and forgettable."
"Aloso","4","1","6","5 November 2017"," This movie tries desperately to be philosophical, but it fails.
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>The movie starts off great, with good acting and a plot that makes sense. Then, after ~ 40 minutes, the main character turns into a zombie and the movie becomes lifeless, predictable and boring. Admittedly, there are some good action scenes in the 2nd half of the movie, but they are of no importance to the plot.<br/><br/>So, what is the plot? Lucy is accidentally given drugs, which enables her to use more of her ""cerebral capacity"" and ultimately turns her into God: When she travels back in time, she touches the finger of the first man, just as God does in Michelangelos fresco.This is no coincidence; this very fresco is shown earlier in the movie. At the end, we hear Lucy saying,<br/><br/>""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it.""<br/><br/>Does Luc Besson want to tell us that we should try to become God, too? This makes no sense, since Lucy never wanted to take the drugs and become God. While becoming more and more godlike, Lucy loses all her social skills, her empathy, her emotions. During only one car ride, she probably kills hundreds of people, just because she is in a hurry. Does this mean that God is cold-hearted, without empathy and doesn't care about life? Lucy says, ""we never really die"". Even if that is true -- does that legitimate to destroy hundreds of lives? One death affects more than just one person.<br/><br/>The other characters were absolutely irrelevant. Lucy reads all of Samuel Norman's ""research"", but after that he is of no help to her whatsoever. His philosophical words impress no one, Morgan Freeman is wasted on this role. The only thing he does is tell us at the very beginning what is going to happen in the movie. He tells us that, when we unlock more cerebral capacity, we gain control over us, then others, then matter. A student asks,<br/><br/>""But what if, for some reason we ignore, somebody unlocked 100% of their cerebral capacity?""<br/><br/>My first thought was that we would become God, since it is almost the only thing left. I was very disappointed to find out I was right. There were no plot twists and no surprises. There was no character development, only character degeneration. At the end, Lucy becomes transcendent and ubiquitous, the ultimate step of becoming God.<br/><br/>Close to the end when the environment turned white, I realized how much this movie resembles The Matrix. Sadly, this movie can't compare to The Matrix in ANY way."

","I registered at IMDb just to write this review. I usually read others', but this time I did really feel I had to tell mine.<br/><br/>So, like many other movies, the idea, the concept is fine, even great, considering I'm a science fanatic, despite all the bullshit about using the x% of our brain and such. Few points that sum my opinion.<br/><br/>1. Random wilderness footage at the beginning is really random and weird, especially considering they have no direct linking to the happenings and, after two-three scenes, the idea is totally discarded.<br/><br/>2. Something that should start from epic karate skills suddenly turn out to let Lucy levitate, like if she's somehow possessed by a demon. What's the point?<br/><br/>3. What's the real point of the whole movie, besides explaining what happens when brain reaches 100%?<br/><br/>4. Why should she keep all the drugs for herself? So that they won't fall in the wrong hands? What could be ""wrong"" hands if she, herself, kills directly and indirectly hundreds of people to accomplish this?<br/><br/>5. Luc is a really bad director, we all know that, but even kindergarten children would be disappointed to find out when she's at 20, 30, 50% blatantly flashing in your face instead of slowly discovering themselves how escalading is the brain of Lucy. Very, very, very wrong move, mr. Besson...<br/><br/>6. When Lucy start disintegrating herself, no explanation is given: what and why is that happening? She basically can manipulate the matter but she still can't keep herself altogether.<br/><br/>7. The final scene clearly explains she created a pendrive containing all the human knowledge she, as a 'goddess', could gather throughout her space-time traveling skills. Why rushing like this, if she clearly states 'she's anywhere' and therefore can do this later or in any other, simpler, fancier way possible?<br/><br/>Definitely a great idea condensed in a poor, sad, low-cost, b-movie film. It was just like giving all the knowlegde to cure cancer to a fish entrapped in a glass bowl. Hope to see a remake by someone else, like Mr. Nolan."

Further, let's put aside the fact that this same professor, who admits his ramblings are just hypothesis (""based upon what observations"", anyone with two brain cells to rub together would be obliged to ask), is stumped by the question of the specific nature of what superpower utilisation of 100% of your brain would gift you.

Even Inglorious Barstewards only barely tops Lucy on my list of movies so stupid they're actually offensive, and that movie was actually TRYING to be offensive.<br/><br/>I set my expectations as low as they would go, and they just weren't low enough. I cringed every time Morgan Freeman appeared on-screen with the certain knowledge that when he opened his mouth, he would say something more stupid than the last time. It was the only manner in which the movie failed to disappoint - it continually exceeded my expectation of stupidity.<br/><br/>There is nothing redeemable about this movie. Nothing. It would be a more noble pursuit to dedicate your effort to developing a heroin or crack addiction than to entertain the notion of watching this movie (let alone to actually do so).<br/><br/>I feel more stupid just for having watched it.<br/><br/>I have made arrangements, at the time of my demise, for this movie to be played int he presence of my corpse in the hope that I might finally be capable of meeting it on an intellectual level. However, I still expect to find the writing and direction awful - every element stands apart from the premise as independently and undeniably poor."

I felt the start was good but happened quiet quick that she gets drugged with the stuff and then just starts killing people.

She becomes so smart that she just shoots innocent people with no explanation, and everyone is just cool with it. The police back her up.

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 1.5/5 stars<br/><br/>Besson is falling further and further into doldrums; whether it be his recent and even not-so-recent directorial or scripting efforts. ""Taken"" and ""District B13"" aside, and to some extend ""The Family"" (and two of those were only scripted by him), none of his projects in the past 10 years or so even past muster, and ""Lucy"" is yet another massive blotch on his repertoire.<br/><br/>The film is beyond inane - it's flaws, plot-holes, and downright absurdity are so vivid, and so many, that it would be a herculean task even to list them. Part farcical-scientific treatise, part messed-up action movie - a film that oscillates between rambunctious disorientation and complete boredom in a heartbeat. And, for a movie that worries about most of humanity wasting its potential, it's ironical that ""Lucy"" is riddled with so many nonsensical scenes. Even though the titular character may find her brainpower exponentially increasing as the film's run-time moves forward, chances are you'll feel your IQ levels diminishing and your intellect being assaulted just as rapidly.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is more or less the same kind of illogical gibberish we've come to except from post-2005 era Besson. Is this really the same talent that gave us classics like ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", and ""La Femme Nikita"". Right now it's sad to see that he isn't even a reflection of the man who penned crackerjack scripts such as ""Taken"" and ""District B13"". Oh...how the might have fallen!"

The inciting incident is actually kind of stupid (kicking), considering what happened before.

Some scene, especially the phone call with the mother, are really convincing and Scarlet Johanson does a great job. Maybe the initial transition from defenseless and naive girl to unstoppable force of nature is a bit too quick. Anyway it's an enjoyable movie, with too much focus on action scenes and not enough on the implications of the main subject. Too much useless stuff and there are some plot holes, like the fact that SPOILERS at a certain point se has control over matter but she cannot replicate the drug and go directly to 100% without all the hassle of get it back. It would have been interesting to add an element of disturb, as she is basically invincible, I was especting one of the Chinese guys to be under the drug and capable of fighting her, but I guess they didn't want the Dragon Ball effect or something like Man of Steel.

"lilianeforever","6","1","6","23 August 2014"," A very good idea poorly exploited
","Lucy, by Luc Besson, is yet another example of movies relying too much on FX effects and not paying too much attention to the story development. As far as Lucy is concerned, it really is a pity. As a Besson fan, I was especially disappointed, as I was expecting stronger character development such as in 'Leon the professional' or 'La femme Nikita' style. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie begins beautifully. Scarlet Johansson does a good job as Lucy, a terrified student 'hired' by drug dealers as a mule to transport a new brand of drug. There are a few plot holes (how come the drug lord does not know this new drug is coming his way), but the action is fast-paced, so it does not really matter. After a violent interaction with one of the drug dealers, the drug bag breaks into Lucy's body and the content start to transform her into an evolving being. So far so good. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, trouble begins with the second half of the movie, as Lucy increases her brain capacity. It looks like as if the director, since he does not know what a brain using 100% of its capacity looks like, decided to provide the viewers with an experience à la '2001 Space Odyssey'. Images of time travel, space, body transformation are thrown at us and they do nothing for story development. I mean, a face to face between today's Lucy and her prehistorical alter ego? Come on! Lucy's pairing with a French police officer looks ridiculous at best. Morgan Freeman looks too much like he is on the Discovery channel discussing the universe expansion.<br/><br/>Overral a decent effort, at 90 minutes running time you don't have enough time to really get annoyed with the movie. But if you are used to Besson previous superior work you are likely to be disappointed with 'Lucy'."
"Myusersnameiscoolokay","7","1","6","17 August 2014"," Discard the rubbish. Enjoyable film made for the big screen.
","Sci-fi blockbuster Lucy follows protagonist and leading heroine Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) in a fast-paced ride to gain vengeance, drugs and self-actualization. Directed and written by Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element), Lucy delivers drug-fueled driving chases, visually breathtaking SFX and metaphorically significant stock footage. We meet Lucy, with a series of quick cuts of her partying. Lucy converses with her cowboy-hat wearing friend Richard, after a long night out on the town. He's bad news. Outside a business building, they chat about nonsense. Richard states he needs Lucy's help to deliver an important briefcase to Mr. Jang (conveniently, he's waiting inside that same building). ScarJo declines this task for the comforting embrace of her bed. Out of the blue, scummy Richard pulls out cuff-links and attaches her to the briefcase. Then all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>While this is going on, we cross to Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) as he presents his hypotheses to his peers regarding the limited 10% capacity that human beings supposedly make use of (*cough* bullshit *cough*) and rattles off the multitude of cool powers obtained if the capacity were to increase. Of course, this happens during the pivotal scenes, where the bag leaks, gets absorbed by Lucy and she transforms from absorbing the super-powerful drug. <br/><br/>Lucy, an innocent bystander, gets taken away by a bevy of Asian baddies following orders from the supposed drug lord, Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) and gets all tangled up in a drug smuggling ring as a drug mule. It all happens so fast. A bag of a new crystal blue designer drug is surgically placed into her stomach while unconscious. One of Mr Jang's cronies (an English guy, The Limey' played by Julian Rhind-Tutt) threatens Lucy and the other luckless mules that they must do as they're told, or it's all over for them and their loved ones.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>Special FX. It's the meat and potatoes of the entire experience. Watch it for the effects and do so on a mammoth screen. The visual effects crew earned their pay checks for this project, that's for sure. <br/><br/>Super human abilities. Lucy becomes smarter, stronger and more bad-ass as she reaches her brains 100% capacity. <br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>It's a jumbalaya of sorts. Get a pot and just add a bunch of movie ideas and motifs. Obviously, comparisons that come to mind are Limitless (2011) and slight resemblance to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) . Okay, so that's a minus, but it's all been done before anyway. <br/><br/>Overacting. More specifically about the scene after Lucy gets kicked in the stomach and the bag leaks. She's transforming into Lucy 2.0 by shaking uncontrollably, you might say? Whatever happened to fade to black! Morgan Freeman's peer conference had a bunch of extra's hamming up their minuscule parts. Keep an eye out for the one of the professors in the audience nodding profusely and embodying an overenthusiastic portrayal of what a professor is supposed to act like. <br/><br/>Illogical story-line: So, either the policeman became infatuated with ScarJo or is scared witless, it still all remains a mystery. He gathers up his police pals to protect her in the end, after she killed a couple of people and drove recklessly in order to get juiced on her drug of choice. He sure was smitten with old ScarJo. Also, Lucy's choice to let the drug lord live when he was defenseless and a breath away was illogical and served only to further the 'run away from baddies' subplot. <br/><br/>You'll need to disregard science altogether and get comfortable with fiction. The premise of humans having usage of only 10% of the brain's capacity is a (popularly?) debunked myth for a while now. <br/><br/>Don't get bogged down in the particulars of the story and enjoy the visual feast."
"fred-287","Null","2","19","31 July 2014"," OK, so now what does Luc Besson do for an encore?
","From ""La Femme Nikita"" onwards I've been a big fan of his, in fact he's the only foreign director I can think of whose name alone would pull me into a movie theater. I've been trying to put my finger on just what it is that makes his stuff so capital-W watchable; maybe it's his ability to combine an innately playful (even zany) quality with gut-wrenchingly brutal violence and cruelty into a seamless whole; add to that an aura of inevitability that maybe one just has to be European to be able to render, the moments of joy in the face of impending doom. Being French in particular, he can't help but ponder deep philosophical issues amidst the gun battles and car chases, and with Lucy he's decided to ""shoot the moon,"" try to capture the entire essence of human nature and potential. As they supposedly like to say in New Orleans, ""Let the good times roll...."" Your reaction to this movie will depend entirely on how well you think Scarlett Johansson carries off the title role. I have to 'fess up that before this I of course had heard of her but had never actually seen her in something. As per the late Siskel and Ebert, thumbs up for me. She plays the significant other of a shady sort called Richard (who wears a straw cowboy hat for no clear reason) who lives in Taiwan and works for a mysterious kingpin called Mr. Jang. He insists she carry a briefcase into a hotel lobby for him but won't tell her what's in it, and when she shrewdly resists, he literally handcuffs her to it. Her latent terror combined with desperate hope that all will turn out well is exquisitely manifested by Ms Johansson. It turns out that she and a few hapless others have been designated by Mr. Jang to be human mules for some super-synthetic drug which she accidentally ingests into her system. This gives her a ""brain boost"" (to borrow a term from ""Forbidden Planet"") resulting in steadily increasing superhuman abilities. Much wackiness ensues as the action shifts to France involving gangsters and cops and also the apparently immortal Morgan Freeman as a professor whose function is to render arcane scientific concepts digestible for most of us movie viewers. There's a lot here that can fairly be described as derivative; one nay saying critic referred to half a dozen titles he saw as influences for ""Lucy"" (I'm surprised he missed ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). Certain plot holes can seem like black holes, such as the sequence where she seems to be disintegrating inside an airplane restroom---which by the way must be one of the most gorgeously ominous things I've seen on screen---next thing we know, she's bodily intact again. But these quibbles, while valid, seem to be missing the point, which is to let oneself get swept along for this ultra-Bessonian ride with Ms Johansson the ever calmer rock upon which we can position ourselves. This may sound corny, but by the time Lucy finally surpasses the need for corporeality but informs us via someone's cell phone that she is ""everywhere,"" I personally found that reassuring. Kudos also to the other actors, in particular Min-sik Choi as Mr. Jang; he is quite possibly the best actor on the planet---okay, a bold statement, but catch him in ""Oldboy"" and his other Korean flicks--in fact, ""Oldboy"" alone should do it for you. (I didn't even dream of contaminating my memory of ""Oldboy"" by watching the American remake.) Also very nice use by Besson of various pieces of stock footage, it all fits right in. Great evocative music too, I may even buy the soundtrack CD. So bottom line, don't worry if this movie is ""cool"" or not (seems to be doing okay at the box office). It'll be dark in the theater, no one has to see you enjoying yourself...."

"ivko","4","1","7","20 February 2019"," this is your brain on drugs
","Far from being just a ridiculous, terrible movie, this movie is an exciting view into the vast world of stupid that humanity can dream of. Putting aside that 10% of your brain myth underpinning the entire plot that has long since been debunked, there's just so many logical inconsistencies in this film that it's a little baffling that someone didn't catch at least some of them during the process of making a major blockbuster like this. But the real tragedy here is that I think there was a better film hiding underneath it all that could have been in more capable hands.<br/><br/>Consider the start of the film, for example, wherein Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy unwittingly becomes entangled with a criminal syndicate. This is my favorite part of the movie because Ms. Johansson plays the role with with such visceral emotion. Her terror at finding herself suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a life or death situation is compelling. But already here there are some problems, like the absurdly public and unnecessary violence of the criminals. Of course, criminals can be violent, but even the most violent crime lords do their dirty work in the shadows or in guerrilla-style hit and run attacks, not brazenly on their front doorstep. Working that way would inevitably bring conflict with authorities (at least in first-world, developed nations) and spur public outrage, forcing even a corrupt government to confront the issue. But more than that, it isn't needed. Lucy is already oozing palpable tension and fear; the violence, if anything, relieves the tension by giving a face to her fear instead of letting the nameless dread wash over the viewer.<br/><br/>The movie goes downhill really quickly after that. Basically, Lucy gains godlike abilities before we're 30 minutes into the film. This completely blows any tension or concern for her out of the water. She's become unstoppable, so why should we be concerned? Instead of gradually building her self-confidence and powers with us along for the ride, we watch her seize to be human in the first act. How can we relate anymore? The director seems to think that watching her plow through endless armies of bad guys will be entertainment enough, and maybe for some people it was. But I suspect most people would have liked to go on that journey of self-discovery with her, even if we had to worry about her well being a little along the way.<br/><br/>Another major problem with the movie is that in a very real way, after Lucy is exposed to the magic smart drug--well, actually it isn't described as a smart drug at all but rather as a concentrated energy drug produced in limited quantities by pregnant mothers to give babies energy to grow; no explanation is given for why a super-powered Monster energy drink would make you smarter, but whatever. Anyway, after she is exposed to the drug, in a very real way we watch Lucy die and something else that only looks like her inhabit her body. Her personality is completely different. Before her exposure she's shown to be expressive and empathetic. After her exposure she is emotionless and cold, coolly executing many, many people including an innocent bystander who, she explains while dumping his body on the floor, had a terminal condition anyway.<br/><br/>The audience is encouraged to believe Lucy is still the movies heroine, since most of her victims were bad guys. And I'm not saying that a hero can only have a batman-esque philosophy of no killing ever, but such a bloodless attitude towards what our society would describe as murder is far more indicative of an antagonist than a hero. Frankly, the movie would have been far more interesting if the focus had switched to destroying this man-made monster with unfathomable motives instead of worshiping a super powered sociopath. But it was the simple acceptance by the other characters of her actions that gave me the willies. Particularly since it is implied that Lucy is us evolved into some future, ideal state. What kind of messed up future do these writers dream of for humanity?<br/><br/>Another problem I have with the film is this idea that the laws of physics and space and time really only exist, in some sense, because we believe they do. There is no level of intelligence that disables gravity or lets us push our fingers into someones skull and extract their memories. Yes, it's their universe and all that, but it just feels like such a lazy tool. They're not trying to create a world with magic, they just needed a way to show how her increased mental capacity allowed her to overcome all of these obstacles. And since they couldn't think of a series of actions that would accomplish that, they invented some magic mind powers to create a shortcut to their goal. It's lazy and stupid.<br/><br/>Speaking of, I also have to take exception with their depiction of academia and science. In between Lucy's adventures, the movie also cuts to Morgan Freeman's character giving a presentation at some academic conference about the brain. He starts with that 10% myth, moves on to a complete non sequitur about cells and their environments that seems to be there only so the movie can make a callback to it later in reference to Lucy, and finally starts talking about what happens to humans accessing 20% and 40% of their brain (while also accidentally debunking his own speculation about what happens by referencing how dolphins already access 20% of their brains; where exactly are their crazy powers?).<br/><br/>Now, I've been to a few academic conferences in my time and they can indeed be a forum for the free exchange of ideas and even some educated speculation about future possibilities. But here, when he just pulls these very specific notions out of his backside about what happens at each level of attainment (that sound more like a description of what happens when you level up in a video game than scientific research), the crowd just gazes at him adoringly and accepts his confession that he just made it all up without any follow-up comments. I guarantee you that would not be the response. Academics are a competitive, hard nosed bunch who almost relish the opportunity to pick the unprepared apart. Make a claim like that and then admit you just made it up and you would be in for a deeply unpleasant inquiry from your audience.<br/><br/>Ok, I need to bring this crazy person rant to a close. Believe it or not, this is actually the much shortened list of my complaints, but I need to save something for my friends and family to really make them regret answering the phone, so I'll stop it here. Obviously, I didn't care much for the film, but I'll say this much: if you like Scarlett Johansson and enjoy special effects laden action films and don't care too much that it all make sense, then I suppose you could enjoy this film. Ms. Johansson does as much with the script as she can, I think, and the cinematography is quite good, as are the special effects and fight scenes. Also, I think I could see how some people would enjoy it as a kind of revenge film, particularly since one thing they do depict pretty well is the misogyny of the villains. But if it's the idea of a smart drug that interests you, I'd recommend Limitless with Bradley Cooper as a much better alternative."

Studies have linked the presence of such endocrine disruptors to serious threats to human health, including a diminished intelligence in descendants. Even if only part of these fears turn out to be true, then we're facing a health crisis of stupendous scope and gravity, for which thousands and thousands of innocents will be paying the price. And while we're at it : a general lowering of the IQ is precisely the thing that causes the collapse of a civilization. <br/><br/>As a result we're talking about an existential threat.<br/><br/>Now here's the strange thing : if you go to a major studio and say something like : ""I dream of making a big budget blockbuster, with stunning stars, about the link between environmental pollution and human health and about the danger to our children's intelligence"" there is every chance of being laughed out of the office. In fact, there is every chance of you being escorted from the premises by security guards. And yet there is money and interest to be found for random nonsense such as ""Lucy"".

Seems to me that having so much brain boosting power coursing through her brain she'd simply flame out. Thank goodness for good old Morgan whose narration saves this terribly boring film. Scarjo seldom speaks with any clarity. Clearly if one wants to explore the human brain's capacity in a scientific way the Chinese mob should not be brought into the laboratory.

So if you are seeking sheer in-your-face entertainment, your time may be better spent giving yourself a nose bleed. <br/><br/>Though knowledge is perceived through clever diction, it is countered by the notion that ignorance is nothing more than knowledge aligned with an ideal.

For all intents and purposes, that's what it is, plain and simple- er... wait, let me revise that because this movie is anything but plain and simple. This movie does for Limitless what Crank 2 did for Crank or what Transformers 4 did for 1987's Batteries Not Included. In essence it cranks it up to 11 and breaks the knob off! It's basically the same setup as Limitless with Scarlett Johansson playing the helpless shlub, albeit a smoking hot one, who accidentally ingests an highly dangerous drug that increases her mental acuity 1000 fold. The movie is both visually astounding and pretty well acted but unfortunately, the story lacks any real sense of suspense or a menacing threat to the main character and things get rather unbelievable pretty damn quick for even the most willing audience. All in all its an OK movie to watch but to be honest, I was getting really bored with it after the first half hour which for what this movie started out as, is a major disappointment.

Student becomes drug mule becomes superhuman when a package of drugs leaks into her abdomen allowing her to eventually access all 100% of her brain power. The film tracks her path to 100% in chunky blocks and at no point does the audience ever question why she doesn't need the ""skills"" she is yet to acquire in any of the early altercations with the angry drug mob! The film becomes even more absurd when Lucy decides to use her new found brain power to benefit the human race. She contacts a professor who has lectured on what he ""guesses"" will happen if humans evolve and gain access to increasing percentages of brain power. She says she wants to give him access to all that she has learnt. How? There isn't a computer big enough! No problem Doc! I will build one!!<br/><br/>OMG!

"evaminos82","5","1","7","9 September 2014"," Drugs + Science = Dangerous Intelligence
","Luc Besson's new release takes us into a dystopian future where a common young woman (played by Johansson) becomes an extraordinary being due to drugs intake that exploded in her body, hence changing her completely and utterly.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is promising as the viewer expects the theme to be linked to drug mules/ gangsters, and reminds the audience of Maria Full of Grace (2004), although this time there are no huge grapes to swallow but the drugs are actually placed inside the young girls stomach! Technology obliges.<br/><br/>Audiences will rejoice to see Min-sik Choi from acclaimed Oldboy (2003) on screen again as the leader of a Korean drug mafia this time. Johansson plays her usual role (girl next door,a bit simple and lost in space). – Watch out for the broken nail polish throughout the film – One would think that highly intelligent beings would have adjusted that (although it could be something that was overlooked by Luc Besson).<br/><br/>In parallel to this, we have Morgan Freeman (science professor at the university of Paris) explaining how the brain uses a maximum of 20% of its capacity and preparing the audience for what's to come next. His theories reveal that if the brain uses 100% of its capacity one would die but at the same time would be able to read a book in a second and control the elements such as electricity, metal, air, therefore becoming a highly intelligent/supernatural being.<br/><br/>However, the problem of course is that with great power comes great responsibility. The film asks the fundamental questions such as: ""Will technology destroy us""? ""Will our world become emotionless and lonely, therefore non-human""? <br/><br/>The more Johansson's character gains artificial intelligence due to science, the more she's incapable of feeling pain, sadness, happiness, or any other emotions, but at the same time seeking it and wanting to keep her humanity.<br/><br/>The film is very entertaining to watch and could be interesting intellectually speaking as the concepts are original and open for discussion, but gets ruined by a few things such as endless car chases, fights, Matrix vs. X-men visual effects, and peculiar ending. However, the idea is there and worth a watch."

","I don't think the writers or director of this movie were using even 10% of their brains when they made this film.<br/><br/>I gave it a 5/10 because it wasn't terrible, and I did enjoy parts, but the story suffered and it didn't seem well thought out.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is very interesting: a drug is developed that allows humans to use more of their brain and access parts of it that are unused. However, the logistics of how this premise was played out in the film made almost no sense, and therefore made the story seem too unrealistic. For example, Lucy, at 90% capacity, is able to time travel. Why could she time travel? Even if we could use our brains to our full capacity why could we time travel? This defies the laws of physics and there was no explanation given. You will constantly be thinking these types of questions during the film. Another one I had - why didn't any of the other people Lucy came in contact with try the drug? They could have helped her. It was loopholes in the plot that really drove me crazy. If they would have played the action down a little to go for a more believable story, I think it would have driven my logical brain a little less nuts.<br/><br/>It seems to be the way most Hollywood films go these days. Pay extra attention to the special effects and the action scenes, but leave the story leaking out flaws at every turn.<br/><br/>All in all the film had some cool visuals and interesting ideas but it didn't deliver what it could have because it was a little too over the top."
"gary-444","6","1","7","25 August 2014"," Pretty satisfying Cross Genre Piece
","Lucy is a sci-fi thriller, with pace, excitement and thrills. Director Luc Besson has a track record with action (Nikkita, District 13) and his touch here is sure, and assured. The ingredients are transparent. A strong Chinese section will play well to the fast emerging Far East market, with English subtitles, which will reverse in home markets. The denouement in Paris reflects the Canal + funding and Bessons' nationality, the French Cop even gets to kiss the girl! And the Englishman is the fey baddie, a wonderfully reptilian cameo by Julian Rhind Tutt.<br/><br/>Besson does not allow himself to be too tied down by the requirements of genre. The opening scene is pure gritty action thriller as the eponymous Lucy finds herself helpless in a drug –trafficking plot, this then morphs into a superhero sequence as she ingests her packages. Thereafter there is a parallel sequence featuring the gravel voiced tones of Morgan Freeman, playing a cutting edge scientist and driving the sci-fi element with a surfeit of scientific psycho-babble, and all comes together for a cartoon style climax of increasing improbability.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansen, as Lucy, carries the part, short dresses and Loubouttin heels, with some style. Sassy, tough, vulnerable and determined she proves that female leads can command a film, an opportunity which is denied far too many actresses. Her nemesis, Mr Jang, played by Min Sik Choi has no such personality breadth, and is a convincing inscrutable, cruel killer.<br/><br/>This is not a story that bears close examination, but it rattles along at some speed, works, and entertains. The car chase in Paris is convincing, but the shoot outs are stylised, losing some of the power that the opening scene offers. The idea of a drug which enhances human potential was explored quite recently in Limitless, Lucy trumps it for verve and brio. Purists of any of the aforementioned genres will carp, but the end package is pretty satisfying."

The telling was beautiful with all the references to the wild animals and stuff. It really maked me think about it.<br/><br/>But as soon as she started flying towards the ceiling I was hoping that this would be the only ridiculous thing that would happen in this movie. I immediately thought of Supernatural since they almost have the exact scene only this is about demons. The movie didn't really explain what was happening or why it was happening nor did they tell about the effects of the drug. They show it briefly, but it didn't gave me much understanding of how it works and what other effects are, since you only see a man laughing hysterically before being shot through the head.<br/><br/>The movie didn't take the audience in the process of how lucy's mind now worked. It was dull and I felt a passive participant. Half an our before the ending I walked out(after she somehow takes the bullets out of the pistol) with 7 others. Most of the people laughed during the movie because everything was so stupid and they really didn't explain anything. <br/><br/>It could've been such a great movie with much to think about, but it wasn't deep, they didn't explain anything and it was just too simple. I didn't get why this friend of me said this movie was heavy and whatnot.<br/><br/>I went open-minded into this movie, not taking the fact with me that this theory is a myth. I can believe that somebody who is using more than 10% of her brain capacity can change her hair-color. She can alter her genes. But how can she fly up to the ceiling?

","Lucy is gorgeously shot, well acted and rattles along nicely for the first two thirds of the film. There's nothing new here, but it revels in how over the top it is. There is some character development, questions asked about the nature of humanity and a healthy dose of humour.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as the film progresses to its natural conclusion, far too much effort is expended on the special effects and little on plot development. Whilst the ending is in line with the progress of the film, that does not make for an interesting story. A twist would have maintained interest, or perhaps less time on how the last 30% of unlocking of potential develops and more time on post 100% potential.<br/><br/>Beyond a certain point Lucy herself ceases to become interesting - she's essentially untouchable due to her enhanced abilities, and the tension derives from the normal humans protecting her development. The final fire fight is insufficiently ridiculous - it needed to reach the heights of Desperado rather than remaining loosely grounded in reality, or retaining some vulnerability of the main character as per the similarly over the top The Fifth Element.<br/><br/>It's probably worth seeing once, but it's not a buy on Bluray. I'd rate the not entirely dissimilar Transcendence above this and friends have mentioned that Limitless is a better and more realistic implementation of the same idea."

","Exciting but boring! Thrilling yet disappointing! These are my immediate thoughts in my post analysis of Lucy.<br/><br/>The film started strong, delivering high intense action and gritty horror, but by the midpoint of the film, it had deteriorated before dropping off completely at the climax.<br/><br/>My disappointment with the film is that it tried to be intelligent in that it was implementing scientific fact with theory all the while trying not to sacrifice any of the action. For me, the end result appeared to be a cinematic experience of high end special effects and needless death with little else. The attempts made to incorporate a little humour fell flat and the idea of there being a story just didn't work.<br/><br/>The only real positive aspect I can find in this film is that having such quality actors/actresses in Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman stops the film from being a complete train wreck. Scarlett Johansson plays a lead action star very well and quite frankly, Morgan Freeman just has to show up with his voice to be deemed credible.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: if like me you are able to watch as many movies as you like or you can get your ticket for free then sure, go enjoy the film; but if you are going to have to pay good money to see it, put it towards the bottom of your viewing list. Yesterday I saw Guardians of the Galaxy and in retrospect, I would rather have had a second viewing of that as it was both a great display of an action film and a comedy despite it too sometimes sacrificing story for other elements."

The drug starts increasing her brain power in an unusual manner and she soon explores some exceptional super-powers much beyond the known capabilities of a normal human being, which in turn help her to break through the mysterious nexus of underworld, drug mafia, police and more. Her brain usage keeps on increasing as the film progresses further and it all ends when she eventually reaches to the maximum level of 100%.<br/><br/>Now the short synopsis shared above sure sounds pretty interesting but I wish the film was equally engaging too justifying its novel concept. It has a promising start featuring a betraying friend and the Chinese don but soon starts giving away due to a weak script and too much focus kept on its style and presentation. The film actually doesn't work because of its thin storyline stretched for long and an unconvincing narration, despite having some excellent production values and superb graphics.<br/><br/>With an otherwise fine performance by Scarlett Johansson, who later fails to leave an impact due to the ineffective culmination of a great plot, LUCY also wastes Morgan Freeman as the professor/researcher working on the brain concept. The film doesn't explode later as per the expectations raised in the first ten minutes and hence can easily be rated as a flat science fiction which keeps on giving some forced philosophical lessons at regular intervals in vain. In fact LIMITLESS (2011) made on a similar concept was a far better entertainer comparatively.<br/><br/>In short, LUCY's brain might have reached its 100% in the script, but the film couldn't even reach 50% in terms of satisfaction offered, honestly. So you can opt for it only in case you don't mind watching Scarlett alone for those 90 minutes."

"eschetic-2","6","1","8","5 August 2014"," A ""straight boy"" phenomenon: star and film
","Like her current film - which may well be a kind of apotheosis, summing hp her career to this point - Scarlett Johanssson strikes this viewer as an extremely limited actress who has had the intelligence (or luck) to choose challengingly off-beat projects put together on highly commercially successful models. Her visceral appeal may best be understood by extremely straight boys with hormones raging - the target demographic for many of the violent ""action"" films like LUCY turns out to be.<br/><br/>Johansson's current film, LUCY, purports to be an examination of the (at one time) oft discussed but somewhat controversial idea (controversial in being overstated more than actually wrong) that most humans only use a small portion of their brain's potential and could achieve untold intellectual (or other) feats if they could access more. It bolsters its advertised claim to seriousness by casting as co-lead the gravitas of Morgan Freeman as a scientist who lectures in the film's first moments on that theory - while Johansson takes the audience into the unrealistic flights of gory and supernatural fantasy the film's creators are really interested in. Long before Freeman's pseudo lecture is over, Johansson's irresponsible character in the film's real plot-line is being sucked into the film's violent chase plot with Chinese drug dealers trying to export an apparently highly addictive blue crystalline drug (whose main ""high"" results from opening up greater portions of the brain - a gimmick used in half a dozen recent films with fewer plot gaps) into the west and control same.<br/><br/>Four over-sized plastic bags of the drug are surgically packed into the stomachs of apparently kidnapped ""mules"" to be flown by normal commercial routes from Taipai to Berlin, Paris and Rome but, for reasons never explained, Johansson is sidetracked into a dungeon before she can catch her U.S. bound flight, apparently to be beaten and raped. The beating ruptures her plastic stomach bag leading to her discovering never logically explained powers both intellectual and psycho-kinetic enabling her escape to search for medical help and starting a violent 'round the world chase. Characters from drug mules to policemen to drug cartel heavies to innocent bystanders are strewn about in celebratory explosions of blood with the utmost carefree abandon which should spell a happy commercial future for audiences of teenage boys - but not so much for fans of serious science fiction.<br/><br/>The film does ultimately (with the bad guys closing in - bloody violence continuing unabated) reach Johansson's well advertised use of 100% of her brain's potential and any sense of reality is left behind for the more rarefied reaches of transmogrifying fantasy well trod by second and third tier ""sci-fi"" movies and TV fantasy shows long before.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this season's earlier (April 18) Johnny Depp/Morgan Freeman exercise, TRANSCENDENCE, which explored much the same territory with somewhat surer plotting and pacing, you should enjoy this ultra violent action fantasy (to call it legitimate science fiction is a stretch), but the abrupt conclusion of both films once they reached where they said they were going in their ads and the creators ran out of ideas diminishes the impact of LUCY just as it did TRANSCENDENCE.<br/><br/>In both cases, some interesting ideas were wasted on ultimately unsatisfying films. That's a real pity in both cases, but at least in the case of LUCY, unless you're in the mood for a ""super shoot 'em up,"" you are let down early on. The satisfaction for a appetite for intelligent science fiction is ""lite"" at best - and a few more presumably well paid exploitations of his ""gravitas"" like these and Morgan Freeman's stock as a serious actor may start to tarnish seriously no matter how high the opening week grosses."

"mistercsays1","7","1","8","31 July 2014"," Scarlett Lifts Lucy Above the Ordinary
","Whilst this latest sci-fi actioner from French filmmaker Luc Besson is utterly bonkers, it is also, for the most part, an enjoyable romp. A science-fiction story set in the present day, Lucy is an attempt to combine action sequences with deep philosophical questions about the untapped potential of the human mind. The action elements are fine and certainly nowhere near as overblown as many of the bloated Hollywood hack jobs that are churned out each year. Having directed the likes of the fabulous Leon: The Professional and The Fifth Element, this a return to form of sorts for Besson, whose recent efforts such as The Lady and The Family have not been well received. A prolific writer and producer with more than 100 credits to his name, Besson also wrote the screenplay for Lucy, in which Scarlett Johansson takes on the title role as a young woman whose unwitting involvement in an international drug smuggling operation brings unexpected consequences for all concerned.<br/><br/>Forced to take on an errand for her boyfriend and deliver a suitcase to a mysterious entity, things turn sour very quickly with Lucy to be used as a mule to transport the contents of the suitcase, an experimental new designer drug called CPH4 which, as our protagonist quickly discovers when the bag inside her bursts, unlocks those previously untapped portions of the mind. You see, the science of the film revolves around the notion that humans only use 10% of their brain capacity – a much refuted theory mind you – and as the excessive amounts of this chemical flood her body, Lucy gains access to the previously dormant areas of her brain and develops all manner of physical and psychokinetic powers. Whilst the science may be somewhat dubious, Besson uses the most tried and true method of making something like this more believable; casting Morgan Freeman as the kindly Professor Norman, a scientist whose research Lucy turns to in an effort to understand what is happening to her.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is pretty silly, but Besson stages all the action well enough that it is far more enjoyable than the likes of Transcendence, which took itself way too seriously. You need to accept the lack of logic and simply enjoy the ride. Of course there are the typical genre clichés, such as the exotic other as the bad guys (Asians on this occasion) and a wild car chase in which our hero somehow emerges unscathed despite driving the wrong direction along a crowded freeway. It is the philosophical musings about evolution, the meaning of time and the true potential of the human species that are the less effective aspect of the narrative, despite Freeman's best efforts to convince. There is violence aplenty as Lucy evolves into somebody devoid of emotion and unable to feel pain. Some might draw parallels between Lucy and Bradley Cooper's Eddie Morra in Limitless, although the former transforms in ways that extend way beyond mere intelligence. Unlike Eddie, Lucy never revels in her predicament and when she realises that her death is inevitable, it becomes a race against time to connect with Norman and provide the necessary evidence to render his theories as more than just hypotheses.<br/><br/>Following Her and Under the Skin, this is another interesting choice of project for Johansson and she is fabulous, effortlessly making the transition from scared patsy to detached super-human and as sexy as hell to boot. Hers is a performance that elevates the film beyond the ludicrousness of the premise into something eminently watchable. Freeman is as reliable as ever in a role that resembles so many he has taken on recently – (Transcendence, Now You See Me, The Dark Knight series), while the multi-cultural supporting cast – which includes Min-sik Choi (Oldboy), former model Analeigh Tipton (Warm Bodies) and Egyptian actor Amr Waked (Syriana) – are lumbered with somewhat one-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Also serving as editor, Besson uses title cards to keep us updated with the amount of brain capacity Lucy is using and he also intercuts many scenes with footage that serves as a metaphor of sorts; a mouse approaching a trap and leopards stalking gazelles as inferences to the dangers Lucy is facing. Besson is no mug and he has been able to construct a film that at least aims for intelligence while still likely to strike a chord with mainstream audiences. Yes, the ending is a mess but, at a very succinct 89 minutes, Lucy never overstays its welcome and overall there is plenty to enjoy."
"Seraphion","6","1","8","29 July 2014"," From limitless to transcendence, in so short ride
","The movie focus on Lucy, a simple girl tricked by a friend into being a drug trafficker forcefully by storing a big bag of experimental drug in her abdominal cavity through surgical process. On the drop point, Lucy refuses to be molested by her captors thus one of them kicks violently, particularly to her stomach. The bag in her break open and the drug is then absorbed. It runs out that it's a special drug that increases the usage of brain capacity of the normal 10%. Waking up, Lucy easily frees herself and gets revenge to the drug trafficker boss without killing him. As her brain usage increases steadily, she then devise another purpose of contacting a Professor Noraan about what she's been through, and at the same time getting her hands on the other three packets of drug en route to Europe. She does both of that at the same time, raising awe of Professor Norman and his colleagues. But at the same time, the drug boss has not given in and the drug mob assaults the university where Lucy meets the professors. While the police accompanying Lucy have a shoot out with the mob, Lucy steadily nears 100% of her brain usage. The drug boss slips his way to the room where Lucy and the professors are. He shoots her in the head but it turns out that Lucy has already 'dispersed'. The detective arrived and killed the drug boss, but as he wondered where Lucy is, his phone rings with a message replying to his question.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat epic if we look at the scope that it encompasses. In short and implicitly, it kind of suggests that alternative explanation on the biblical account of humans are created in God's image. It kind of suggest that as we are in God's image, we have what God really has, that is as we have brains ourselves, so do God. Yet unlike God, we don't use our brains to the full capacity. SO if with just 10% brain usage humans can create huge civilizations like what we have now, the thing we can achieve at 100% usage is explained by Prof. Norman: ""I have no idea"".<br/><br/>The thing is, this movie puts such heavy concepts in a such relatively short duration of a movie. Thus it makes the flow kind of overly hasty and feels rather rushed. Moreover the initial flow buildup and main character introduction took too long. The transition from the drug induced brain optimization, much like the concept in Limitless (2011), to a concept of controlling pretty much everything, much like the one in Transcendence (2014), feels rather too drastic for such a short duration. Thus the transition will feel weird and stupid for some people. That will in turn downplay the sci-fi appeal of this movie.<br/><br/>The action is quite nice. And by having Scarlett Johansson, the level of action is apparently no surprise to her. It's nice to see an international cast of seasoned actors. Here Morgan Freeman has his third back to back sci-fi movie role. Choi Min Sik doesn't lose his edge f calm and sudden bursts. And Amr Waked looks great as a European after all those Middle Eastern roles.<br/><br/>My verdict for Lucy (2014) is, although it offers an interesting concept and entertaining action, is that the movie will get only a 6 out of 10 score. It's because of the rushed pace and short duration of a big concept."
"dreamdemon-1","6","1","9","4 August 2014"," It fails at its own premise
","I'm a reviewer who has no problem suspending disbelief for the most outrageous premises. As someone with a former career in neurosurgery, I didn't even find this premise (increasing brain usage) more outrageous than others.<br/><br/>To get this out of the way, here's the gist on the main premise points:<br/><br/><ul><li>people use 10% of the brain capacity: note that it says 'capacity'. It doesn't refer to the debunked myth that people have unused brain areas. We use all areas of the brain, even if not at the same time. The movie claims we aren't using the entire processing capacity of the brain in the way that if we open 10000 browser windows we are using both the main CPU and the integrated coprocessor in our computer ... however not at their full computing power. It's a fact that our brain has limits (for example, why can't we read the plate number of a car moving at 200mph? the image does hit our retinas, the information is there, but the brain lacks the processing power to process and store the quickly changing information) which some people can overcome by focused training.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>people use 10% of the brain capacity: now on to the 10%. In order to claim a percentage, you need to have gaged the full process. It means that to asses 10% you also need to know what 100% looks like. But the movie makes a point of not even knowing that. Then where does the 10% come from? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the mythical drug: even if admitting something like that, there's still a problem. Why would a drug linked to developing the body still forced an already developed adult into further development? Why is that development limited to the brain and not other body parts? Why is it focused on that? The movie fails to make sense in its own universe.</li></ul><br/><br/>Other than that, who can say 'no' to Scarlett Johannson participating in blowing up cites other than New York? <br/><br/>The movie is mildly entertaining as an action movie, but even if you can suspend your disbelief at the basic premise, the movie breaks its own logic so often and so severely that it's difficult to stay on track and accept the events. The Expendables is way much better at that."

","Most of the reviews mention that the movie is different from the trailers and this is indeed the case. But, unlike a comedy where the three punchlines are all in the trailer and the movie really isn't funny - this movie only hints at the possibilities in the previews and then delivers much more.<br/><br/>As a serious and long time student of the Sci-Fi genre and having read everything from Asimov to Zelazny this movie went from just another fanciful comic book type action movie to a commentary on the human evolution and a parallel look at how far we have come compared to the basics of nature. In the same way that Sam Pekinpah tied in the scene of a scorpion surrounded by ants to the ending sequence in ""The Wild Bunch"" this movie ties flashes of the base instincts of nature to the actions of some levels of human existence. We get to see Lucy ""evolve"" herself as her intellect grows, but also her understanding, as she moves from killing her captors to merely keeping them out of the way as she moves forward to her destiny.<br/><br/>An excellent movie that I give a solid ""A"" and will definitely be purchasing the Blue-Ray when it comes out (the effects and graphics are well worth the HD experience as well)"
"joelhiggins6","4","1","9","31 July 2014"," Decent rental, not worth much more
","Even after you accept the falsity of the film's entire premise and get over the fact that this feels suspiciously similar to a recent film starring Bradley Cooper in which a new mystery drug heightens his mental capacity, Lucy still doesn't quite hit the mark. It's largely a study in theoretical nonsense which has a better place in a NatGeo ""documentary"" than on the big screen. Thematically, the movie has almost no weight and what it does have feels entirely forced. <br/><br/>But, to be honest, some of the scenes are stylistically well executed and I did find myself feeling some shred of empathy for ScarJo early on in the film. For that reason, I'd say once this one hits Netflix or Am Prime, it's worth a stream if you've got nothing better to do."

But now.. i felt that i need to throw a rock:<br/><br/>Dear Luc.. or Lucy.. please donate most of your money to any charity purpose and stop producing anything. This movie you made is not only bad.. but is bad for human kind all over the world and will not make this planet a better place.

The movie also used some ideas which from my personal point of view are lame too.. like we are using just 10% of our brain.. but also the Darwinian theory which is bad.. cos there would be skeletons of intermediates animals.. and there are none.. but too many people are still brainwashed with it. I think animals were created by one or more ""smart guys"" like we are creating different types of computers these days.. until A.I. (dna and rna are the proof)"

"Quinoa1984","7","1","10","1 August 2014"," Luc Besson's comic-book movie
","I think Luc Besson really wanted to make a comic book movie, but since he is now his own sort of ""brand"" of movie-maker, he probably couldn't get a hold of, say, the X-Men or DC or even Star Wars, and why should be anyway. Because with Lucy he decided to just make ALL the comic book movies in one, with one character. This rating means not that it's really an entirely ""good"" serious action movie or a serious look at how human beings are part of this great long thing called consciousness and have evolved for years and years. I'ts more like a colossal, memorable guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Lucy is a fairly crazy look at super powers, and how a humans brain, once going last the ho-hum 10% functionality and by tens of percents, once tapped, we can, oh I don't know, have ""Force""-like powers to push people away with the swipe of a hand, see through walls and people, learn things with instantaneous ability, and control people's actions. Oh, and once nearing the 100% mark, a super computer with the ability to time travel and look back into the beginnings of the universe. Besson has some balls, but I think what keeps this from being totally pretentious garbage, for me, is that it's not taking itself entirely seriously.<br/><br/>...or, if it is, Besson doesn't pretend he's not making a genre movie, and complete with nasty Asian gangsters (led by Choi Min Sik of Old boy, a welcome presence and he plays every scene to the subtle-over-the-top hilt), and race-against-the-clock suspense. There isn't quite so much action as I expected, or at least from the maestro behind LA femme Nikita or Taken. Or perhaps I could just see that Besson was committing so much to the premise and exploring the bullshit science that I couldn't help but chuckle as Scar-Jo contorts on the ceiling as her body is racked by the mystery drug that, after seeping into her blood following being turned by the Asian gangsters as a drug mule, gives her the initial powers.<br/><br/>We see what happens inside of her body as she is given this new drug, and then later when she needs more of the drug how, say, her face starts to melt and she falls apart like some wax figure. The special effects and science here is matched just right for pure wild fantasy. And most of all its good how much the Hero commits to her character, especially early on when she is just a frightened woman put into a terrible situation (when she sees someone shot, at first, it really shakes her up), and then at first when she is finding this power that turns her, in slightest terms, like the Terminator.<br/><br/>If there is a problem its that she is so monotone through portions of it that, despite (or because) of the demands of the script, she has less to play with except for her dead-straight voice. Better is near the end where it just gets So wild that she is becoming the Matrix or something. So, in other words, Lucy is kinda stupid and doesn't make sense If you try to think about with full sincerity.<br/><br/>But if you look at it as just pure unadulterated fantasy, And a quick one at that at 87 minutes, you'll get something... different from it, that's for Damn sure. It's like if five of Grant Morrison's most eccentric comics were put in a blender and splat onto celluloid (plus an expository Morgan Freeman)."

I walked away from the theater a little let down because I was hoping for more action. In my opinion, it had some futuristic elements of a Sci-Fi movie and I wasn't really expecting that. All-in-all, it was a great movie! I just wasn't ready for that. On a lighter note, I did enjoy the fight scenes and the acting was pretty good. I was caught off guard by the showing of different time periods of time square. I got the point, that once you reach a certain amount of usage in the brain you can go through time periods but I feel they could have shown it differently. It took me a few time periods to understand what they we're doing. Also, I wish there was a little more back story on Lucy. They didn't show enough about her. I feel like for us to completely understand how huge this incident is to the character, we need to understand how normal of a person she was before this happened to her. She was a party girl that met a boy who throws her into this huge illegal act. I just wish we knew Lucy better as opposed to knowing too many details about what happened to her."

The culmination of the movie is disappointing and did not feel to me like it fit with the plot. Yet this movie is somewhat enjoyable with some scenes that are very well done.

"puschit-1","6","0","3","5 May 2020"," Probably hit or miss for most viewers
","This movie has an interesting premise but doesn't do much with it. It has many, many flaws and you'll have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it. A lot. Virtually every minute.<br/><br/>See, the main problem isn't that much that the entire movie bases on the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. I am okay with that, you take this one thing, establish that this IS true in the world this movie takes place and then go with it. But everything else isn't any better. Our brain is doing ONE thing: Thinking! So this drug would make us super smart but that's it. But in the movie the drug allows her to do everything from telekinesis to shapeshifting and outright magic. There are lots of scenes with pseudo-science talk that tries to explain this but you don't need to be a scientist to know all of it is more than fiction, it's fantasy.<br/><br/>On top of all that pseudo-science you'll also get an even bigger dose of pseudo-philosophy. I don't know if they just mixed every remotely related eseteric theory or if it's the fault of the mostly horrible dialogues, but seriously, most of the science and philosophy talk in this movie sounds like they took all the rejected ideas that Lindelof wrote for LOST but were considered too crazy or corny even for him!<br/><br/>If it was just the bad science and corny philosphy, I wouldn't complain, though, as long as it's just a vehicle for a fun action movie. However, it also affects the script and movie.
First, there are many illogical scenes that wouldn't even work within the bad science we get presented. For example Lucy just watches someone speaking a few lines of mandarin and a moment later she is fluent in that language. No matter how smart, you can at best learn the words that have been spoken. Or, later she begins to disintegrate when she is running low on drugs. She literally lost many of her teeth, her skin was peeling off in clouds of dust >and eye was displaced<. Then she takes more drugs and the process isn't just stopped, it magically changed her to the state she was in minutes earlier.<br/><br/>But more importantly, the authors somehow wrote themselves into a corner about one third into the movie because at that point she was already a being with superpowers that nobody could match and here adversaries are still simple humans. During her next encounter with the bad guys there is no fight anymore, she just makes them float around.
So, in order to still have some action scenes, what did they do? Lucy forgets about her superpowers, locks herself in with those scientist to have a slow verbal conversation about her current state even though she is about to build a supercomputer and store every information she has. This forces the poor police to fight the bad guys themselves even though Lucy could have dispatched them easily within a minute or so.<br/><br/>And once you start looking for things like this, you'll notice them everywhere. The very first thing she does after the drugs start powering here is killing half a dozen henchmen with ease within a second. She kills guards without flinching, even that poor guy on the operation table. But she lets the crime boss that is responsible for all of this go without killing him? And again, later, in the police station, she does it again with the captain of the henchmen? Just so we can have another unecessary encounter with them later?
Lucy does, however, kill a lot of innocent byspenders during her car romp through Paris. I mean, yes, we don't see anybody get killed on screen but come on, that many crashes, flipped cars and so on can't be without casualties.<br/><br/>And most of this would easily be avoidable. All they would have needed to do is one of two things:
A) Either tone it down and give her superpowers later in the movie, bit by bit
OR
B) simply let that henchman captain eat some of the remaining drugs at some point so he gets superpowers as well so we can have a proper fight!<br/><br/>But as it is this movie doesn't work as SciFi thriller because the science is so bad, it doesn't work as a philosophic or fun movie because Lucy doesn't really do anything with it, but it also doesn't work as an action movie. I don't even know why many claim it to be one, there aren't many action scenes and the ones we have are either unnecessary, short, underwhelming or a combination of those.<br/><br/>So, why do I still rate it 6 then? It still got that many stars for the eye candy and generally everything else that hasn't to do with the plot. Johanson played well in the first half (later on she is like an emotionless robot) and the special effects were quite good. I was also pleased to see authentic set pieces in Taiwan (I have family there, so I can tell it's genuine). The movie has a lot of potential but it just doesn't know where to go with this."

"apmosley","5","0","4","30 March 2020"," Flatters to deceive
","This is a hard movie to rate so I've gone down the middle. There are some pretty spectacular action scenes and the visuals are incredible but the whole movie is too fast paced and any and all character development has been abandoned. The film really suffers for this, Johansson's role in particular, as her character is very difficult to connect with. I don't agree that she played it well, she was a hackneyed stereotype ""dumb"" New York broad at the outset and then tried to juxtapose that against a permanently serious, hyper-intelligent robot after her drug enhancement. The former character was a lazy effort and the latter just came across as wooden. If Keanu Reeves irritated you in The Matrix then so will she. There was a scene that tried to connect the two characters together, where she talked to her mother during transition but it didn't work and there were no vestiges left of her initial character. Some conflict in terms of what she loses from her original life versus what she gains from her super powers would have been interesting.<br/><br/>Of course it's ridiculous to get all worked up about the scientific nonsense in the film, it is sci-fi. What bothers me though is that there's no real reward for the viewer in accepting the premise, there are many philosophical and moral concepts that could have been explored. At the half way point it's all set up for this, then Luc just downloads a pointless shoot out scene (why weren't these ""bad guys"" just killed at the start anyway? Lucy had no problem killing others at random and she hated the mafia goons more than anyone). This is accompanied by a good 15-20 minutes of full throttle CGI, zooming around time and space with no obvious purpose.<br/><br/>The plot suggested that the climax of the film was the unveiling of the inner workings of the universe, this ultimate knowledge to then be deposited on a pen drive for the good of mankind (in some way, again not explored). It might have looked like some mysterious black hole pen drive but it could have been a 5 dollar stick from Walmart quite frankly because all that she explored was the history of the universe as we already know it anyway! There was nothing other than currently accepted theories of evolution, the asteroid collision and separation of our moon, the forming of our solar system from nebulae and lots more of that all the way back to the big bang! There was a bit just before this where the big bang was sucking its source material from another parallel plane but it wasn't a patch on how Men In Black did it, with the universe in a marble that aliens are playing with. Now that was thought provoking.<br/><br/>If you treat the film as a pure, mindless action flick then it's entertaining. Just don't get drawn into thinking that it's going to provide any level of pathos or cerebral stimulation because it rips you off on that front after sewing the seeds so well initially. The ending was flat as a pancake. A shame, as Leon showed us what Luc Besson is capable of."

I mean, she can manipulate matter, intercept radiowaves, see in x-ray vision, but she still needs to fly by plane, to drive cars, she needs the help of other people to make her a drip only to have at least 2-3 characters in the film.
She says she feels everything and remembers everything, yet she calls her mom to tell her that she loves her, even though she acts completely emotionless all the time. She says she doesn't feel fear and a couple of scenes later she seems frightened when she starts to disintegrate like in The Avengers on the plane. Inconsistencies like these just show how unaccustomed the writers were with the genre.<br/><br/>The film also has a drug lord villain who is so unnecessary and incredibly not threatening to her it just makes no sense (also, great job on wasting Min-sik Choi in this).

What would they be like?<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, an ordinary average gal roped into an untenable situation by a guy she barely knows: deliver a mysterious briefcase to a Korean mobster named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). The contents consist of a synthetic drug that supposedly allows users to tap into that aforementioned 90%. It's inserted into her system, and she becomes a rapidly evolving super-human who turns to an eminent professor (Morgan Freeman) and a badass cop (Amr Waked) for help.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's pure fantasy & fiction, and this viewer certainly wasn't expecting anything resembling a documentary.

But Besson couldn't take up the picture heavy-, Stanley Kubrick- style of filming for too long and returned to his bog-standard pattern of popcorn-cinema-action, which indeed had new Superlucy-aspects but could not fulfill the full potential of this movie. <br/><br/>The next problem is the not existing narrative structure and logical flaws here and there. Besson's compulsive, mandatory chase in the streets of Paris with French cars and Lucy's not-so-understandable revenge campaign are also part of the story. Apart of that Besson tried to implement a bit pseudoscience, but also could not integrate that consistently which results in rudimentary sentences like Bill and Ted's ""all we are is dust in the wind dude"".<br/><br/>Conclusion: A genre mix without a soundtrack that stays in mind, a Johansson, who wants to play a strong and believable role, but can't because of the staging which doesn't reach the audience to a 100 percent. A strong and image-heavy implementation which collapses too fast to a below standard look and causes every role to fade away. A pinch of ""I need energy and matter"" á la ""Transcendence"" and complete is Besson's newest film, which can't convince the audience in any category possible."

","This movie is a terrifically entertaining popcorn action flick that could probably benefit from a little less pretension and a little more common sense. But if you go into this movie just looking for a stylish action flick, it's fun.<br/><br/>The movie is based on that old myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, and tries to imagine what someone was like who could maximize their brain usage. When an ordinary woman named Lucy accidentally absorbs a huge amount of a new drug, her brain starts ramping up and she becomes, as the percentage increases, a super soldier, a superhero, and a god. <br/><br/>The movie is slick and stylish. It's often gimmicky, as in a scene where Lucy's first meeting with some bad people is intercut with wilderness footage, but it all works quite well.<br/><br/>This is the sort of movie you could really pick apart. The problem is not that the 10% brain thing is BS, which doesn't bother me at all, but that the movie is often sloppy in its internal logic. For example, Lucy types on a computer and she's so fast that hundreds of windows are opening and closing, but a laptop is not mechanically capable of that speed. And if you accept that Lucy is using her mind to control the PC, then WHY IS SHE TYPING? And no matter how souped-up Lucy's brain becomes, it wouldn't allow her childhood brain to have taken in the sort of data she recalls.<br/><br/>The movie is silliest when it has Lucy describe what it's like to be a super mind. There's a lot of talk about memories and sensitivities and time that all sounds like what someone tells you when they're describing their acid trip. The truth is, if someone were that smart, they would probably have difficulty talking to us at all; we would be animals.<br/><br/>Still, it's lots of fun, and I do recommend it for all its flaws."

","I'm a writer myself, and I've turned out a few horror novels where the female ingénue and the antagonist turn out to be one and the same; so with ""Lucy,"" I was very interested to see how well this premise could be converted into a ""Jason Bourne""-like scenario. First off, Scarlett Johansson is awesome in the movie. It's almost what would be expected if the Black Widow from the ""Avengers"" went through the Captain America process then went after HYDRA. Unfortunately, in ""Lucy,"" HYDRA is replaced by the Chinese mafia, and the Super Soldier Serum is replaced by a dangerous addictive drug which in small doses causes heightened intelligence. Small doses is the key because when Scarlett's character is unwittingly used as a drug mule, the drugs break open in large doses inside her, granting her heightened intelligence, psychokinetic powers, paranormal abilities and eventually a complete control over reality itself. Along the way, Morgan Freeman narrates what's happening as the expert on this drug who she seeks out for help. While the action and chase scenes are ""Terminator"" quality, it soon turns into an uninteresting plot that runs out of steam. Starting out, the plot is fascinating and fun to watch, but as it gets closer to the end, and one starts wondering where it's going with the metaphysical discussion, it becomes more tedious and lackluster. The ending does not match the first ninety percent of the film. I don't understand it, it doesn't make sense, and it outdoes ""The Shining"" on its vagueness. It could have gone anywhere so to end on a question mark ruins what I thought was an otherwise interesting flick. I give it 3 out five."
"ExpendableMan","5","0","4","9 October 2016"," ""I think we only use ten percent of our hearts""
","Remember that bit in 'Wedding Crashers' where Owen Wilson chats up a bridesmaid by talking about the theory that humans only use ten percent of their brain power? Well that same idea is the basis for 'Lucy,' a sci fi action movie from veteran French director Luc Besson. Sadly the results are a bit more mixed than Wilson's pulling technique but it's entertaining enough to lose an evening with. Scarlett Johansson stars as the titular character, a young woman who gets tricked by a sleazy boyfriend into carrying out a one-off job for a Thailand crime syndicate that quickly goes wrong. Forced into becoming a drug mule, she soon gets a packet of an experimental new drug stitched into her stomach and forced to smuggle it into Paris. But then it starts leaking.<br/><br/>With the drugs zapping around her bloodstream, Lucy discovers her powers expanding and sets off on a globe trotting mission of revenge and discovery. And for the first two thirds, it's a blast. Starting off like 'Taken' in the Far East, Lucy destroys every scumbag and low life in her way, casually gunning them down and pulling a bullet out of her shoulder without even blinking. She forces a terrified surgical team to operate on her at gunpoint, tortures a gang boss and as her mind expands, becomes a high powered super genius. Imagine if Black Widow were crossed with Liam Neeson and was powerful enough to wipe out the entire Marvel Universe with a wave of her hand and you'll get the idea.<br/><br/>As the film reaches its final sprint though, 'Lucy' loses traction. Hooking up with Morgan Freeman's University Professor and trying to use her full potential to its best effect, the film turns into a weird mish--mash of overblown science fiction and Terrence Mallick overtones. Lucy gains the power to travel through time and across the cosmos while at the same time constructing a futuristic super computer with her mind, all without leaving a swivel chair in Freeman's lab. You'll spend ages waiting for the trippy images to stop and for Johansson to stand up and start punching gangsters through walls again, but it never happens. Instead, the climactic action scenes are left to the French Police Force, led by Amr Waked's ""in-over-his-head"" Captain.<br/><br/>It's a frustrating finish to a movie that starts off so well but credit where it's due, 'Lucy' at least attempts to be something more than a stereotypical action movie. Plus, Johansson is terrific and manages to make the character's transformation from petrified backpacker to unstoppable force of nature compulsively watchable. The 2001 aping finale, the Dinosaurs and the hint that Lucy might actually be God are too much, but at least it's not another 'Taken' rip off."

","I have to admit when I first saw the trailer for this film I thought it looked fantastic, I thought about going to see it the cinema but never got around to it, quite a while later I bought it on DVD and watched it a few nights ago, for me I would rate it as average, Scarlett Johansson does a good job as the lead character of Lucy, a woman who is able to gradually use more and more of her brain throughout the film due to a potent drug entering her bloodstream, she uses these powers to go after the people who wronged her. The character isn't really someone the audience can relate to because of her lack of emotion and not a lot is known or hinted at about her backstory. <br/><br/>It's a hard film to enjoy because the plot is very basic and quite a few of the scenes could have been so much better, for example there's this scene where she is at the entrance of a corridor and there are maybe about 10-12 enemies that the bad guy has sent to capture her/kill her and he's at the end of the corridor, what does she do, kick their asses with some kick ass fighting moves? Gun them down with precision? No, she just makes them float about above her so she can stroll up to the main bad guy, it was a real anti-climax to film and the ending was even more confusing. I felt Morgan Freeman was solid as ever in his role but would have liked to see him given more screen time. In summary a film that didn't live up to my high hopes and a plot that felt bland and boring despite a decent cast, 6/10"

IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD DO WITH 100%. I thought that this would be more enjoyable then it was, but unfortunately I was wrong. This film stars Scarlett Johansson and its basically limitless trying to be more of an action film with a female lead. The film revolves around a woman, accidentally caught in a dark deal, turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic. The movie did not achieve its goal, it tries to be fun action film with a unique premise. But the premise is not unique and the film is barely any fun, it has its moments no mind you but I just didn't have much fun with it. The story is not that interesting, it's basically limitless meets old-boy. We see Lucy trying to kill the people who gave her this drug for being so cruel, and she takes more doses to access 100% of the brains capacity to save the information for a scientist played by Morgan Freeman. The performances from most of the cast members is just awful, they were all just really boring to listen too. The only worthwhile people in this film are Johansson and Freeman. You know this movie starts off like Old-boy and one of the actors from this film was in the original old-boy. The direction from Luc Besson is pretty good but as for the writing, now that's a whole different story. The film is poor due to its writing, it's not his best written work but most certainly his worst, or at least I doubt it is. All the elements of a good film are not present in this picture. Lucy drives to entertain, but left me with boredom but with a little bit of good acting and good directing this film wasn't a complete waste of time. I give Lucy a three out of five"

Regarding the story which is quite based on a real concept but what they had shown is just nearly touching the concept but not actually based on it fully.

","Science Fiction is not really my thing but I thought any film with Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson in it is not likely to be hard core sci-fi and basically I was right! <br/><br/>So the precept of this film is that we only use 10% of our brains (which is not true) and what would happen if we could actually use 100%. According to this film we would turn into some sort of robot with superhero powers. Johansson adopts robotic movements, turns into a crack shot killer, develops immunity to pain and has atoms flying off her before she even reaches 20% so from early on we are left wondering what on earth will happen when the 100 is reached. Unfortunately what does happen is kind of disappointing and corny, but there again it would be difficult to come up with a different ending considering what goes before. <br/><br/>There are aspects of this film I really liked - Johansson is actually very good within the limitations of the role and the imagery used is very effectively done. Despite my disappointment with the ending I did like the meeting of the Lucy's. The film zips along at a fast pace, there are no 'quiet' moments or downtime. I just feel it was an opportunity missed because the idea behind the plot (although scientifically absurd) was original and interesting. I would have liked more depth to the characters (because really we don't get to care at all about Lucy as a person), a more credible story line, a more satisfying ending. Instead we get a sort of female Incredible Hulk (although a very glamorous one), a bundle of VHS tape type stuff and a memory stick. Not satisfying at all. <br/><br/>However, I've given it 7 stars because it kept my attention from start to finish and I did find it entertaining. If you like action movies and don't mind a bit of sci-fi lite thrown in you will probably enjoy this."

","I found the film to be insipid. The acting is above average but the science poor (that didn't factor into my low rating of the movie though). It's a movie and isn't supposed to be realistic. It's certainly more of a fantasy movie than a science fiction movie though because of the poor science. Again, that's okay but hopefully people don't think this movie reflects any sort of science reality.<br/><br/>As for the script - it's mediocre - as is the editing (e.g., cutting back and forth to animals or other people, etc.). The cinematography is one of the redeeming qualities of the film (but hindered by unnecessary cuts to close-ups or animals). The other are Johansson and Freeman (who both try to make the best of a vacuous script). The film is not Besson's best work (Leon: The Professional was excellent and the Fifth Element was a visual feast but little else). This movie had a lot of potential but fell far short."

","I agree with a couple of previous reviewers. To maintain real interest, we really need some conflict. I don't mean a bunch of Korean guys chasing after you. It has to be a problem the protagonist has to solve or at least deal with. Lucy unfortunately helps a friend and ends up in really deep stuff. She is used as a drug mule for a crazy drug that can up human intelligence. She was never intended to use but a guy assault her and breaks the bag inside her. She immediately begins to divide cells and transform into a new creature. The second criticism is a lack of explanation as to why she loses all compassion and empathy. She does have the revenge thing going but she is almost zombie like in her interactions with others. Is the point that we are just animals with reproductive and survival instincts? Other than teaching his classes and giving us a reference point, Morgan Freeman is of no use. He just stands around saying he doesn't know anything. Lucy eventually takes us on a ride through time but why. Is she just absorbing information. If so, what is she going to do with it. The long and short is that it is disjointed and relatively pointless."

","""Lucy"" is a French-American film from 2 years ago. It stars Scarlett Johansson as the title character and Morgan Freeman plays one of the biggest supporting characters. The rest of the cast I am not familiar with, but this is probably just due to my lack of knowledge than to their lack of achievements from their side. However, I do know writer and director Luc Besson, who managed to make a really famous film here once again. It is about a young woman who was initially just in charge of delivering a suitcase, but then ends up as a drug mule and finally turns into a superhuman with abilities that even Natasha Romanova can only dream about. Then again, they are not that desirable. I personally believe Johansson worked great for the main part here. She brings a vulnerability and yet cold-blooded approach that certainly helps in watching this one. Morgan Freeman is okay to watch as always, but I am biased here as I usually like him and even I cannot deny that he brings really nothing here that he hasn't done before. This was also partially due to the script though. The final scene is kinda telling when he just stands there with his mouth open watching Lucy's final transformation.<br/><br/>In terms of the story, it was a decent watch. I am generally not too interested in science fiction and this may be the reason why I did not appreciate/understand the film to an extent that many others possibly did, but it was still interesting to watch and I also liked the information on the percentage that keep being shown throughout the entire movie. Still I have to say I never felt it was really an edge-of-seat thrill ride. There were also several moments that I personally did not need, such as the kiss scene. Romance was not necessary in here. And I also occasionally had trouble when it comes to the main character's credibility and authenticity in terms of how she was written. She is really scary early on and just wants to get away from it all, but when the drug comes into effect inside her, she is all of a sudden scared of nothing. I thought the transformation was mostly physical and it did not alter her character. It just sharpened her senses for example. But still she was completely ruthless, cold-blooded and able to master every situation, even if she had never been in a similar predicament before. Nonetheless, the good outweighs the bad and I recommend ""Lucy"". I just like Johansson and Freeman too much to give it a thumbs-down. Check it out."

Lucy walks around in public with a gun (sometimes 2 guns) in plain sight, and not only is she not challenged by anyone, but no one else finds this in the least unusual.

","""Lucy"" is famed action sci-fi director Luc Besson's latest import from France. The film is mainly in English and stars Scarlett Johansson who plays a student in Taipei, Taiwan, forced by an ex- boyfriend to deliver a mysterious suitcase to a Korean mob boss, Mr. Jang. It turns out that the suitcase contains packets of a new experimental drug called CPH4 which can enhance physical and mental capabilities. Jang has his henchmen sew packets of the drug into her stomach and while in captivity, one of the captors kicks her in the stomach breaking the packet and releasing all of the drug into her system. Lucy suddenly gains superhuman abilities including extraordinary depth of perception.<br/><br/>Early on it's clear that Besson has trouble deciding whether ""Lucy"" is a good ""Terminator"" or a bad ""Terminator."" After escaping by killing her captors, there's a rather ugly scene whether Lucy rushes to the hospital to have the remaining bag of CPH4 removed from her stomach. She kills a man on the operating table and rationalizes her actions to the doctors by indicating that the man would have died anyway (she scans the x-rays and concludes he is a terminal case.) Soon, however, Besson gets back on track by having Lucy strictly kill bad boys and clearly go down the ""good Terminator"" route.<br/><br/>Realizing that she will disintegrate without getting her hands on some more CPH4, using her super brain, she locates the three other drug mules and phones in their locations to handsome Parisian cop, Pierre Del Rio. Meanwhile, she contacts kindly super-brilliant Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who has been lecturing on increased mental capacity for years. Lucy's ever increasing knowledge will go to waste if she doesn't get it to Professor Norman before she expires.<br/><br/>The rest of ""Lucy"" is a combination of a dopey Asian mobster flick with some rather nice sci-fi visuals mainly involving time travel and psychedelic-like perceptions. As Lucy keeps developing her ""full potential,"" she also must fend off the mobsters who are trying to kill her. With her extraordinary powers, the mobsters are of course no match for her and she dispenses with them in a series of clichéd scenes including a car chase, assisted by the handsome Parisian cop. <br/><br/>In perhaps the neatest scene, she goes back in time to earth's creation by flipping her hand as if she going through pages on an iPad. My favorite time travel moment is when she finds herself on a street in the late 19th century. <br/><br/>The ending is rather anti-climactic. Before Lucy becomes one with the universe, she hands over her knowledge to Professor Norman on a flash drive (of all things!). Del Rio asks where Lucy is and a message on his cell phone shows up, ""I am everywhere!"" So presumably now Professor Norman will be able to cure all diseases with all the knowledge he finds on the flash drive.<br/><br/>Besson's creation of a superhero relies on the accidental consumption of an untested black market drug. Why would someone try to sell such an extraordinary compound on the black market when they could (perhaps with some tinkering) use it themselves and gain super-intelligence like Lucy? I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief, but it still feels a little too ""easy"" for this CPH4 drug to induce such effects in a human being.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" manages to be entertaining as well as tawdry as the same time. It passes the entertainment test but one gets the feeling that Besson is mired in the unsatisfying adolescent world of sadistic one-note mobsters and the vigilante's thirst for revenge."

","I had heard about this film and thought the premise sounded great and once the hype had died thought I'd give it a whirl.

However once we understand what is happening the rest of the film seems redundant. We know that Lucy will deal with everything that comes her way because of her amazing powers (despite the fact she allows half the University staff at the end to get brutally killed why she casually chats with Morgan Freeman) So many plot holes, so much daft logic it's painful. The tension disappears at this point too and we are subjected to a paint by numbers formula that so pervades US studio films these days.<br/><br/>Scarlett did a great job and I feel her performance rescued this film from the toilet completely. Yet one cannot wonder how it got to the state it did at just past the hour mark. Morgan Freeman probably did a 2 week shoot, took the money and ran. The car chase in Paris was painfully CGI ridden (see Ronin for a proper Paris car chase without CGI) I care about it so little that I can't be bothered to say anything else about it.<br/><br/>Another one of those films that's only good because it keeps people employed in the film industry whilst assuming the audience are stupid."

I must say according to the movie it can be summarized as you get the telekinetic abilities and knowledge in the world just flies into you. And once you reach 100% it becomes a divine power and you are everywhere and everything. So simple can an answer be.<br/><br/>Despite a good performance and distraction from Scarlett Johansson once she got the capacity increase (because the 'scared girl' play in the beginning was really raspberry worthy) I could not help myself to wonder why this wasn't the story a viewer would expect according to the trailer. I mean, a villain wouldn't really harm the movie. The Asian gang weren't real opponents because they weren't presenting the danger and the french cop was a terrible intermezzo. To sum up the final and deciding opinion, everything happened way too fast. The drug bust, the cerebral capacity increase and even the final shootout. I assume they shortened everything because they had been feeling they were loosing the red line.<br/><br/>Putting everything together I must admit the lack excitement or any entertainment.

","I have no idea why such amazing talents as Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman said ""Yes"" to Luc Besson's 'Lucy'. Maybe it's because it was shot in Taiwan and France, and the actors got to travel and see the sights, but it definitely couldn't be because of the script or filming. There was a time when I loved Director/Writer/Producer Luc Besson. He gave us 'Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', and 'La Femme Nikita'. He makes most of his living by writing shoddy action movie screenplays and producing, such as the 'Taken' franchise, 'The Transporter' movies, and many other action films that you don't remember anymore.<br/><br/>I would just like to know what happened to this once great filmmaker who gave us such great characters as Leon and Mathilda or Corbin Dallas, Leeloo, Ruby Rhod, and the impressive Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Besson's newest film 'Lucy' has a decent set up, but fails to tell us what the characters or film itself is trying to tell us. At one point, it wants to be a superhero movie, then at other times it wants to be a cat and mouse gangster film, then it wants to jump into a Terrence Malick 'Tree of Life' scenario complete with dinosaurs, time travel, and the Old West.<br/><br/>For some reason, Besson wanted to keep 'Lucy' right at 89 minutes, but decided to pack enough characters and story to last 2.5 hours. Needless to say, you won't feel anything for any character, no matter what their demise. If you've seen the trailer or even the tag line for the poster, then you already have a sense of what the film is about. Johansson plays an American girl named Lucy, living with a friend in Taiwan, who spends her days going to class and her nights partying with all the wrong people. She meets up with a guy who she dated for one week, who asks her to deliver a briefcase to a guy she doesn't know. This guy turns out to be some sort of drug lord yakuza named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), who now has Lucy and three other people in his custody.<br/><br/>They are all told they will be drug mules for a new type of drug that is guaranteed to make kids go wild, and all four captives are cut open to put the drugs in their lower stomach for transport across the globe. Lucy is beaten by one of Mr. Jang's goons for not putting out and one of the bags of drugs in her body starts to leak out into her blood stream. Due to a chemical in the drug that creates life for pregnant women, Lucy is able to use more than just 10% of her brain, which brings us to the overall story arc of the film. If you can use more than 10% of your brain, or hell, if you can use 100% of your brain, what would you be capable of? That is what Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), tries to answer for us, as his scenes are spliced into some of the action beats as he is giving a lecture to students and colleagues on what a human being is capable of if they start using more than just the average 10% of brain power we are given.<br/><br/>Well it seems that Besson thinks that it turns you into Superman, Magneto, Professor Xavier, Mystique, and Wolverine all at once, as Lucy now has telekinetic powers, X-ray vision, the ability to control people and objects, the ability to change her physical appearance in one second, and the ability to heal faster. The theories here are so insane that they are laughable, as in one scene, we see Lucy looking at people in a populated area on their mobile phones, able to see their cell signals shoot in the air. And just like a touch screen computer, she can move her hands and move the signals to find something she is looking for, which is Mr. Jang and his posse who are after Lucy. But after the first action scene with Lucy literally moving her hand from her left to the right, which takes out a dozen armed gang members, we never again feel like she is in any real danger. And it's completely ludicrous that in the final climactic fight scene, that she doesn't help any of the real police officers in the stand off with the yakuza, when all she has to do is move her hand. But hey, she is now time traveling and turning into a computer, literally.<br/><br/>Besson thinks that is we use more than 10% of our brain, we become less human, as Lucy turns into basically a 'Terminator' void of any emotion. Man, what a waste of a good set up and talent. Johansson is good with what she's given, but the script doesn't give her much to work with, besides one scene when she is on the phone with her mother, telling her that she can feel everything and that she is going to die. And Freeman is there to play the same role as he always plays, which is the older man with wisdom. 'Lucy' is a superhero movie without any fighting in it, besides some gun-play. It definitely wants to be something more in that Lucy might have the answers now to why we are all here, but instead of investigating that topic, it would rather spend more time on a band of gang members coming after Lucy, only to be immediately killed off with a wave of the hand. Do yourself a favor this weekend, and SKIP this movie."

","""Lucy"" by Luc Besson, plays on an intriguing notion that humanity, if capable of using more than just 10% of their brain, could achieve incredible feats, and practically become gods.<br/><br/>""Lucy"" is about a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) who quickly finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. When forced to deliver some drugs inside of her lower tummy, the package accidentally opens releasing the drugs into her system. However, rather than killing her, the drugs unlock her brains full potential.<br/><br/>Although the movie was not incredible, I did find it visually entertaining. Furthermore, the movie was full of action and interesting perspectives on the theory of evolution. However, the plot was a little underwhelming. There were many times where I was hoping the story's action would be a little more ""up close and personal"", instead, we are given ""Limitless"" meets ""The Matrix"". Which by themselves are perfectly good movies, but they could have maintained some element of Lucy's humanity as it was very hard to relate to what she was experiencing. In the end, it was as if she became like ""Amazo"", or ""Data"", which I understand was the director's intent, but it would have been interesting to see what Lucy would have been like had she maintained all of her humanity.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Lucy"" was entertaining, but it is not something I would go and see again.

"Screen_Blitz","3","0","5","6 August 2015"," Great idea, poorly executed
","In this mind-bending thriller boasting glamorizing visual effects and stylized action choreography, Scarlett Johanson steps outside her role Marvel superhero Black Widow and plays Lucy, a young woman who caught between a dangerous drug exchange in Taiwan by a French police captain Pierre Del Rio (played by Amr Waked). When she is taken hostage by Rio and his goons, they inject her with the mysterious drug that gives her mind-blowing psychological abilities that allow to use her full brain capacity. This, she is able to perform these incredible human abilities such as mentally time travel and not feeling pain or discomfort. Morgan Freeman plays Professor Norman, a college psychology teacher who assists Lucy on her escape from Rio and his evil gang.<br/><br/>The movie boasts a pretty interesting premise, but its sadly executed with an incoherent plot and a storyline that, before too long, makes a less and less sense as it progresses. This movie tries to impress us with its flashy visual effects. The visual effects are quite intriguing, and sadly that is the only eye-candy you get. Scarlett Johanson shows off a decent performance as the main heroine, but it is not enough to save this movie. The concept of how the main character gains these mental abilities is interesting. The problem is the movie doesn't do anything exciting with it. Worse, it veers into the territory of predictable. Each scene featuring the titular character facing off against enemies, she's empowered with psychic abilities that render her unstoppable, and therefore results in action scenes that are tension less and fall short of depth. There is very little excitement and barely any thrills that by the end, it just stops becoming interesting. <br/><br/>I have to say I was pretty let down by this movie. Lucy is a film that had so much going for it but was left watered down by botched execution. Unless you a die-hard Scarlett Johanson fan, it is worth looking elsewhere because you are not likely to awarded with the same charisma she has established in her previous roles."

Lucy barked orders, killed lots of people including a zillion automobiles apparently full of innocent people in her way. Too much of the film included padding scenes of wild animals and disasters, and the big cosmic rip-off of 2001: A Space Odyssey at the end. The computer she created out of X-Files black oil was an unnecessary special effect. I was assuming Lucy, at the end, would use her time-travel abilities to go back before she up met up with her icky boyfriend, and negate the whole adventure, staying alive, human, and hopefully more pleasant."

","A life is what matters. This idiom will prove its meaning through this whole movie. And no one is able to demonstrate this better and more charming as the main actress, Scarlett Johansson as Lucy. Lucy is utter nonsense, utter chaos, love, and modern dialectic. As we are questioning the meaning of life, we rather tend to obey other circumstances which are of different matters. As such we do take notice how a wonderful main actress does a superb job in a fantasy driven action thriller. Not that it would matter, but she does entertain as action hero, in contrast to the nice and sassy blonde chick with the amazing sex appeal, we are used to. But it would be unfair to state this movie good qualities just because of her, there are too many good actors and great performances to mention them all. To be honest, the story itself is the weakest spot of Lucy. Darn it. They could have emphasised a little bit more on this topic, life and evolution, more than the average peeper deserves. Enough of her lips and tits, we wanna see Scarlet (r)evolutionize. Next time, give her a great character, a great team, and a great story. Make her real. 6 out of 10."

This moment is also symbolized when she touches the finger of the ""half-monkey/half-human"" creature (a creature we're still waiting on ""science"" to prove ever existed), but this symbolized the ""knowledge"" Lucifer passed to mankind when he convinced them to eat of the ""tree of knowledge""...<br/><br/>Also remember when she reaches ""100%"", she shoots intense beams of light from her mouth, this is to symbolize Lucifer ""the light bearer"" but it's also to mock Jesus, as this is how the bible says Jesus will deal with the wicked upon his return - ""the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"" Replace lord with ""Lucy"" and that perfectly describes ""Lucy"" when she peaks at ""100%""<br/><br/>This movie is also about ""transhumanism"", because it won't be a drug they'll push for you to ""achieve god status"", it will be by merging your body with machines/computers...

"mgruebel","6","0","2","3 May 2015"," Not up to Besson's high standards
","Luc Besson is one of our modern auteurs, with films like Leon, The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, or Taken. In the Lucy tale, an innocent woman is captured by drug lords who stash a developmental hormone drug in her belly to smuggle it into Europe. Then they make the mistake of kicking her and releasing the drug into her. She turns into a superhuman who can use much more of her brainpower than you or I, and initially kills the drug lords like flies, but then realizes she has a bigger mission.<br/><br/>Lucy has an interesting premise: what if the human mind is somehow capable of much more, including telekinesis, levitation, and all those things we occasionally dream we could do. The film posits that current science of the brain is not even scratching the surface, and consciousness can control matter. Fine.<br/><br/>The problem is that it portrays current science incorrectly at a level that will make any educated high school student cringe. Nothing is wrong with the premise of the film, but if something transcends our current knowledge, at least present current knowledge as we know it correctly at the high school level. (1) Life arose well over a billion years ago. (2) The 10% brain thing is pop psychology of the 1950s. It's 2014, Luc! Etc. And if high school students will giggle (like the ones who sat next to me in the theatre), imagine someone who knows a bit about the current state-of-the-art in neuroscience!<br/><br/>Moral: If you're going to use bad science, as opposed to extrapolate good science, at least don't flash a %-value on the screen every 10 minutes as a reminder !<br/><br/>La Femme Nikita is just a much better film in the same genre: a woman turned into a deadly weapon that goes out of the control of her handlers. Lucy is a return to familiar fare for Besson, but he got it right the first time around, and ultimately fails here. If mathematics does not describe the secrets of the universe, how come you can summarize Lucy's important knowledge on a USB memory stick? That's a math-based device.<br/><br/>The film features many interesting ideas and shots, like the cutting between Lucy/druglords and a gazelle/cheetah; or the scene about cell division, sex and birth, although the religious crowd will not like the interposition of animal and human behavior. And of course there is the Lucy that started it all in East Africa, whom modern Lucy gets to meet once she controls time. For these and other good ideas, the film still gets a 6. But for the lame science (spewed with laughable authority by Morgan Freeman), lame dinosaur action, stupid plot holes that don't belong in a film with high aspirations, and the ""Lucy is the Matrix"" ending, that's as high as it goes. I recommend seeing La Femme Nikita again instead."
"empbb","3","0","4","30 April 2015"," Lucy is really a comic book hero movie with mediocre action.
","First of, this move has ZERO scientific basis. There are so many things scientifically wrong with the story that it's practically anti-science. Here are some of the obvious wrongs: Apparently ""unlocking"" parts of the brain that we consider dormant can give us ability to fly, control time and move like the Flash. Lucy gets control of the electro-magnetic waves, she can therefore appear on a TV screen or a phone and chat. Even if she did have an ability to emit electro-magnetic signals, the TV picture is actually digitally encoded and it's more than just ""waves"". It means her brain would actually have to encode a picture of herself pixel by pixel, then convert this bit stream into an electronic signal that would be understood by the TV according to the encoding transmission that is specific to that region and then she'd have to do the next frame and the next, at about 30 frames per second. OK, I guess if she really had super intelligence it may be possible. But I tend to think anyone with super intelligence wouldn't waste time encoding 5 minutes * 30 frames/second * 921600 pixels (HD resolution) = 8,294,400,000 total pixels. Yep, for a 5 minute conversation Lucy would encode over 8 billion pixels. I'd think even a person of regular intelligence would realize she just needs to pick up the phone or computer and just let the computer do it. Oh and by the way, she is transmitting her TV signal from Taiwan to a TV in the US. One would think distance still matters. At the end of the movie Lucy develops a super computer that produces a USB stick and dissolves. With all the super intelligence, the best she can do is a USB stick... WTF?!? Lucy is now ""everywhere"" or is it nowhere? Cliché. Also Lucy has some strange religious undertones. Basically, she is a human that becomes god. So, it's both anti-science and anti-religion as well. Since, pretty much every religion would consider such a thing blasphemy.<br/><br/>Secondly, This movie is actually more of a comic book hero fantasy genre. A woman (Lucy) gets accidentally injected with experimental drugs which causes here to rapidly develop super hero powers. OK, now the story seems more plausible. Not in the sense that it may actually happen but at least my brain can stop searching for an explanation and just accept that blue powder gives humans super strength, speed, intelligence, time control, ability to fly, etc... Unfortunately, for a super hero movie the action is kinda lame and attempts to inject pseudo-science to try and explain what's going on make it worse and worse.<br/><br/>Thirdly, here are some notable quotes: ""One plus one equals two. That's all we've learned, but one plus one has never equaled two. ... We've created a scale so that we can forget its unfathomable scale. "" Sorry Lucy and writers, directors. 1+1 has always equaled 2 and always will. A time may come when we start thinking of ones differently, perhaps multi-dimensionally but it will still be equal to a multi-dimension 2.<br/><br/>""I am everywhere."" Can it get more cliché than that? And by the way if she is everywhere, why is she bothering to type in a cell phone? Can't she just speak out loud? Better yet, can't she just think it to their brains?<br/><br/>""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist."" That is actually kinda scientific. Although is it time that defines matter or matter that defines time or do both of them mutually define each other?<br/><br/>""I don't feel pain, fear, desire. It's like all things that make us human are fading away. It's like the less human I feel, all this knowledge about everything, quantum physics, applied mathematics, the infinite capacity of a cell's nucleus. They're all exploding inside my brain, all this knowledge."" The informational capacity of the cell is big in a sense that it contains the entire human DNA, immensely complex. But the capacity of a cell to contain abstract data is actually relatively low. Let say of argument sake, that we did ""unlock"" the cell's ""capacity"", we'd find out things like human DNA, human origins, etc... It would tell us zero about things like earthquakes, radios, or black holes.<br/><br/>""we must break through to the nucleus"" That sounds so funny! I just was laughing and laughing! Still smile whenever I remember it.<br/><br/>I think I've broken to the nucleus of this movie. What's inside the nucleus? - Waste of time."

"phubbs","5","0","3","20 February 2015"," Lucy
","What have we here, a Luc Besson movie about an invincible female who just happens to be relatively sexy and carries guns, stop me if you've heard this before. I guess when the movie is written and directed by Besson whilst produced by his wife we gotta accept the fact that originality isn't gonna be on board. But wait! this isn't a simple rehash of virtually half of his previous creations...although it kinda looks it from the outside...no stop thinking that.<br/><br/>Johansson is tricked into delivering a suitcase full of drugs to a Korean crime syndicate on the notion that she will collect some money and go. Unfortunately for her she is soon forced into a drug mule operation with a pouch full of a synthetic drug sewn into her abdomen. This new drug is very valuable, untested and will supposedly unlock the potential to use the full capacity of ones brain. Whilst held in captivity by the nasty Korean criminals she is beaten and the pouch inside her breaks open flooding her body with the new drug. As the drug kicks in Lucy slowly becomes stronger mentally and physically, the race is then on to reach a professor (Morgan Freeman) who might be able to save her life.<br/><br/>Alas the entire concept for this part sci-fi adventure is false, even though I'll admit I thought it was true that we humans only used a small portion of the brain generally. With a bit of research it turns out we all use every part of the brain on a daily basis. Admittedly the brain isn't firing on all cylinders constantly and not all at the same time, but apparently in general over the course of one day we do in fact use around 100% of our brains. So that does tend to dip a fly in the ointment here somewhat, the whole concept that you could be some kind of super human X-man/woman when your brain is completely unlocked is a fun romantic idea...but no.<br/><br/>That is basically what happens in this movie, Scarlett Johansson pretty much becomes a member of the X-Men. Temporarily you could say she becomes a mutant with super powers, a new subspecies. As this new drug pumps through her body she gains powers of telepathy, telekinesis, the ability to switch off pain as well as other emotions and she can somehow mentally go back in time. No idea how using 100% of brain would allow these powers truth be told. I understand the fantastical idea here but it still leaves you pondering why you'd be able to perform these things. How the flip would you be able to travel back in time through the power of your mind?! and how the hell could you interact with living physical people and creatures??!!<br/><br/>Johansson's character can knock people out with the wave of her hand, she can tap into any electronics both physically and mentally, she feels no pain, she can control people and animals with her mind, all her senses...her all round perception is off the charts etc...she's a super Jedi. Yet despite all that she does at times still feel the need to have hand to hand fights and gun battles with blokes, even though she can make them unconscious with her mind. Well everyone needs to keep fit I guess.<br/><br/>The movie is suppose to be a science fiction of sorts, which it is, but it never really feels like you're watching a sci-fi. There are elements stuffed in here which Besson tries to manipulate you with into thinking its an intelligent sci-fi. There are sequences which clearly go down the '2001' route which do look impressive effects wise but in no way had me thinking this was on the same level as said film. For the most part its quite simply a chase movie with errmm...X-Men powers on display, I really don't wanna keep saying that but it is. <br/><br/>There are also various silly plot points that just don't add up, Lucy is able to just walk into a hospital and then an operating theatre with a gun. She shoots a patient and forces the doctors to operate on her...and no one alerts the police or comes to check on the commotion?! There never seems to be any security anywhere in this movie, rarely any police. Also I honesty don't get why the Korean bad guys are so obsessed with this drug. I understand its new and they wanna sell it but can't they just make more? surely they know how and if you're gonna sell it to Europe then what's four small bags going a miss? Was it really worth flying around the world to try and get back? Lastly the finale is such a combined rip-off from a few cult sci-fi movies its not even funny. Lucy becomes one with the matrix of life...or universe as it were, as we get her final cold blunt statement.<br/><br/>There really isn't anything new here...once again. The idea about unlocking the brains full potential is kinda cool but it only results in things we've seen a shittillion times before in various comicbook movies (whilst pinching concepts from others...'Limitless' much!). Johansson is good as the leading protagonist but kinda acts like a Terminator, and because she can incapacitate people with her mind that kinda limits the possibility of solid action. So what you're left with is an emotionless female Terminator that merely looks at people or waves her hand to stop them. Obviously there is some proper action but that doesn't even make any sense because of her powers. So really this movie kinda checkmates itself, its devoid of any real thrills, danger or suspense.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"FriedFlyingFox","5","0","3","8 February 2015"," Better viewed as philosophy than ""science""
","Lucy has its flaws. A lot of them as a matter of fact. It sets itself up to be a great sci-fi action film, but after half an hour, ends up taking the worst aspects of gratuitous action scenes and mixing it with Space Odessey philosophy. It has a habit of switching between the philosophy and action in a whiplash inducing manner, during which the characters remain startlingly undeveloped. And frankly, I'd argue that another flaw is not using Scarlett Johansson to her full potential in either acting or action.<br/><br/>But like a lot of things, if you step back and recognize it for what it is, that this as a bunch of what-if-ing half dressed up in badly researched science parading around as an action blockbuster? It's actually not that bad. Not great mind you, but dismiss the science and approach it as a ""What if we could increase our brain's capacity? What would that mean for us as humans?"" sort of thing and you begin to recognize that it actually has some good moments and interesting thoughts.<br/><br/>It's a well-budgeted movie of its time, and has some great shots and pretty moments. The music has its moments too, although it is mostly standard. Most the action scenes are very well-done, although there was one towards the end that struck me as cool in theory but a bit goofy in practice.<br/><br/>While I would not recommend paying money specifically to see this film, I do think it is worth a watch."

","Even without using the drug that increases the brain power of the movie's title character, one can quickly figure out why the movie was a big box office success. The idea of one's brain power increasing greatly is an intriguing one. And writer/director Luc Besson does keep the movie fast-paced, with plenty of action and special effects along the way.<br/><br/>Despite this, I think Besson should have worked on the script some more, because there are some major problems with it. The earliest and most glaring problem is the character of Lucy herself. We know nothing about her when she finds herself in trouble, and we learn little about her for the rest of the movie. Also, she is kind of a cold and heartless character once the drug starts to kick in; among other things, she hurts (or kills) innocent people along the way. And there are some glaring flaws with her actions, like why she doesn't kill the chief bad guy when she gets the chance to halfway through the movie, as well as why in the climax she doesn't take care of the bad guys BEFORE subjecting herself to the actions of the scientists. And the abrupt end will have most people in the audience saying, ""That's IT?!?""<br/><br/>The movie is not without merit, but in the end it shapes itself to be a brainless treatment of a cerebral subject. I realize that there are some people in some situations who might find the movie a breezy way to pass the time... but if you are smart enough to know you are smart, I would strongly suggest you find another movie. Action movies made by the right hands can be smart, but this one simply is lacking brains."

Money, drugs, underworld, car chases, pretty lead Scarlett Johansson, and quite a bit of CGI<br/><br/>On a more depressing level, the film questions in basic terms, what is life? Is there nothing more than matter / energy, whatever name man has assigned to it.<br/><br/>Lucy the story is as shallow as life itself.<br/><br/>Right, I'm off to kill myself (only joking)<br/><br/>?%/10<br/><br/>Budget:  $40,000,000 (estimated) Opening Weekend:  $43,899,340 (USA) (25 July 2014) Gross:  $126,546,825 (USA) (31 October 2014)<br/><br/>Doing well. These figures wouldn't mean much to someone like Lucy on the blue stuff ;D<br/><br/>A chronological review<br/><br/>The opening sequence with balls and deep bass, presented a *Scoopex flashback.<br/><br/>The vibrant opening location and it's oriental signs - flashbacks to Lost in Translation occurred.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson's black & red dress, looked great, even if it emitted vibes of Darth Maul.<br/><br/>The appearance of Min-Si Choi was reassuring. You might know him from Oldboy, I Saw the Devil. Great actor. <br/><br/>The blue crystal rocks got me thinking Breaking Bad.<br/><br/>Lucy's eyes turning blue, seemed David Banner. Imagine for a moment, a blue Hulk. Scarlett Johansson bursting out of her cloths, none of them surviving the expansion process, with the exception of a thong. Now that's a visual, not to mention a possible future blockbuster.<br/><br/>Heavyweight Morgan Freeman shows up as professor, lecturing on the formation of life. I've had A.I. on my mind for a while. Will man ever create a machine that can think beyond itself? <br/><br/>Lucy absorbing the blue crystal, then defying gravity? err, OK. Watching Lucy roll up the wall, across the ceiling, looks like they built a revolving room. Luckily the room is a basic cell, a box what's supposed to look like Grey concrete, but looks like it has been stitched together at the seams like patch work.<br/><br/>High on blue crystal Lucy goes on a rampage, shooting people, entering an operating theater, studies brain x-rays hanging on the wall, and understands them? Really? Seeing Lucy matter-of-fact push someone off of an operating table mid operation felt fresh.<br/><br/>Some rather good special effects occur around this % that show a tree though the eye's of Lucy. The tree looks colorful, transparent, moving, like a bizarre trip. Likewise, when Lucy hugs people, we see the person she's hugging appear semi transparent. Again there's a colorful trip edge.<br/><br/>Silly as Lucy is, the trick involves acceptance, and going with silly. If Superman can fly, then Lucy can do what Lucy does, right? Still, during one particular scene, Lucy telephones Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman ) and her face appears on his television screen. Professor Norman does not freak out? no, he listens to what Lucy has to say. You'd have thought he might seek to get Lucy incarcerated in the name of sake of safely for all.<br/><br/>The toilet scene with the dissolve FX, wow, impressive CGI<br/><br/>Lucy drives a car, fast through Paris, towards oncoming traffic, on pavements etc. It's quite a rush.<br/><br/>Lucy creates a black substance, lots of it, it craws around searching. Part of me got thinking, Under the Skin, as that had black stuff to. it's also the kind of thing you might expect to show up during Metal Gear Solid.<br/><br/>Time-travel anyone? yup, the blue stuff allows for time travel. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>Of all the things Lucy could do, she decides, at the end, to turn herself into a memory stick.<br/><br/>*Amiga demo group"

As soon as we step into the place where no one can predict what might happen if we are able to use about 40% or more of our brain capacity, the chains that links the story, reality and the entire film breaks.<br/><br/>There are some very nice action and fighting scenes in between, but all the mind expanding and knowledge gaining and control is simply too weird and out of touch with anything you would believe will actually be possible."

The concepts explained by Morgan Freeman were very crisp and enlightening (although a bit academic.) We were quite engrossed in both the academic and gangster story lines. About 2/3 of the way through, the film ""jumps the shark"" with some absurd sci-fi leaps. We would give the first half of the film a solid 8 and the second half of the film a 5.

But she fights back, and with the help of hotshot cop Del Toro (Amr Waked) seeks to track down the benevolent Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who's spearheading some pioneering research in to the field of mind drugs.<br/><br/>In a sea of mindless, wham-bam thank ya mam action flicks, French auteur Luc Besson has, with Lucy, tried to craft that rarest of breeds, a thinking man's action film that gets you to summon a bit of the grey matter in the midst of all the noise and explosions, even if he's admitted taking some creative license with a bit of the scientific truth behind it. The idea of experimental new drugs being used to enhance the mind's ability is a ripe idea for such a film. But, crucially before this, you need to care about the characters involved, and you need to make the film a bit of fun, two things Lucy completely fails to do.<br/><br/>We find ourselves just thrust in to the action, without any sort of introduction or character development, and so it's impossible to care about this character or any of the problems that face her, as she single-handedly wipes out gangs of villainous mobsters with an unexplained sense of efficiency. The film is so swept up in the grandeur of it's clever idea that it just becomes overwhelmingly cerebral and far fetched, without a hint of humour or more easy going stuff.<br/><br/>Yes, it gives you something to think about, but without solid writing or a lead character to root for, you just can't think about it as much as you could.

","WARNING: DON'T read this review if you have not seen Luc Besson's LUCY and still want to without preconceptions.<br/><br/>I saw LUCY, directed by Luc Besson, last night. I saw it so now you don't need to. It's not just that it's a bad film, it's that if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the film. On top of that Besson wants to have his auteur cake and mange it.<br/><br/>He sticks in vaguely appropriate stock footage when hammering home some point or other as though we can't understand his great artistic vision and winds up making a high-budget philosophy/film studies student graduation film.<br/><br/>At the other extreme he is so in thrall to lazy American action tropes ie huge gun fights and gigantically destructive car chases it comes across like a chic Parisien trying to pass himself off as an American in Paris. ""Ca va, baby? Je suis ""Hank"" Besson"".<br/><br/>These Yank tropes fill in all the bits between the French philosophising and are polyfilla in place of a solid plot. When in doubt have lots of bullets flying around.<br/><br/>Honestly, you could tell the whole story in 15 minutes but Besson spends the first 15 minutes just setting up the delivery of a briefcase!<br/><br/>As for Morgan Freeman, he's just there to be the ""voice of god as infodump"" again and has absolutely nothing to do with the outcome of the plot. He just looks on in awe as Scarlett Johansson becomes God, basically. Presumably, while he spent weeks looking at a ping pong ball on a stick, he was actually thinking about lunch in the same way that Johansson thinks showing intelligence lies in not looking people in the face.<br/><br/>Most seriously, he delivers the ""people use only 10% of their brain"" premise as though it's a real thing while playing the world's expert on evolution. No, that's a myth. We use all our brains all the time. I suspect using 100% might be having an epileptic fit but, however it is, the 10% brain trope is appallingly bad science. If you imagine Freeman as a Creationist seriously arguing the world is 6000 years old as cutting-edge science you'd get a whiff of how bad this pseudoscience is.<br/><br/>All I can say in its favour is that Johannsson is mesmerising, as always, and she does at least take it seriously. It looks good on the SFX side and is tres chic, as you'd expect from Besson.<br/><br/>But, dear God, Besson, get a real writer in. Your self-penned juvenile comic book story sensibility just isn't cutting it in a world that has people like Chris Nolan who did your finale in INTERSTELLAR and did it better. Actually so did Stanley Kubrick, in 2001."

","'Lucy' may be worth a watch to see Scarlett Johansson kick some butt and stand around looking sexy and voluptuous, but it feels extremely rushed and the storyline skips from one part to the other without mercy. The premise may be interesting, but I found the story to be quite dumb. The concept itself did not make real sense, and it was almost IMPOSSIBLE to care about any of the characters involved. Lucy's character was not at all nice, nor relatable to anyone. She's just a sexy mean butt-kicking machine. The action sequences were not really thrilling as one would expect from a big-budget action movie, and the ending when she became literally everywhere made no sense and was annoying to say the least. It's just another popcorn flick gone wrong, and it is evident that Luc Besson used only 10% of his creativity to come up with this (joke intended).

","The concept this film tries to explore is interesting but I feel like they got lost somewhere along the way while doing so. As the film starts, we see professor Norman explain to a class that humans only use 10% of their cerebral capacity and he proposes a theory of what would happen if we could somehow use more. The idea is good and part of his theories are too. Then we see Lucy, who actually gets to use more than just 10% of her cerebral capacity and we see the changes she goes through as she reaches 100%. My main issue with this film is that I felt like somewhere along the way they reached a point where they ran out of ideas and decided to turn this supposedly sci-fi film into a fantasy film. Some of the action scenes felt a little bit forced and out of place. I did enjoy watching this film nevertheless, the pace is good, the acting is good and the visuals are great. The story is interesting, but the way it develops is a bit crazy. If you're willing to overlook a few details and just take it for what it is, Lucy is a rather entertaining film."

"leonblackwood","6","0","3","18 January 2015"," Great concept but over complicated! 6/10
","Review: Although this movie didn't go down well with critics, I personally thought that it was quite good. It did seem very short and the main character didn't really show off her amazing capabilities in the normal world but I did enjoy it's originality and some of the action scenes. The story of Lucy is quite simple but extremely technical. She was basically kidnapped by a group of thugs who implanted a special substance into her stomach for her to carry across the border. When the substance bursts, it gives her access to part of her brain which a normal person can't understand, except for a professor who is played by Morgan Freeman. I think, the thing that let a lot of people down is that the director over complicated the storyline with technical jargon which no one can understand. He could have easily made it into a more interesting movie by slowing down the process of the brains progression and to see her take her revenge with her new powers but the movie seemed rushed and a waste of a good concept. I was intrigued with her capabilities and we're they were going to end up but I honestly think that Luc Beeson missed the opportunity to make a classic. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Scarlett Johansson, really isn't showing any signs of slowing down and with profits like she made with this movie, I'm sure that she will be getting many calls from the big studios. With the new Avengers, Ghost in the Shell and another Captain America in the pipeline, she definitely has made the right choices in her career and at the young age of 30, I'm sure that were going to see her challenge her acting skills with some different type of roles soon. Its always a joy to see Morgan Freeman on the big screen but he hasn't done anything major since the poor Las Vegas, which should have been better with such a great cast. He seems to be doing these bit parts which have been pretty disappointing, like in Transcendence and Oblivion so I hope that he will reach his Seven type status soon. As for this movie, I thought that the concept was great but the director wasted to much time on fancy graphics and technical jargon. <br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $459million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/action/mystery movies about a woman who gets implanted with a special substance which bursts and gives her special powers. 6/10"

I think that, as time goes by, I have less and less patience for hyperbolic, action-flick, urban fairy tale-style ""evil""; and this flick's setup sequences establish exactly that. Sorry, but I guess I prefer human-dimensioned evil in my urban fairy tales, unless you're pointing the projectile over the wall of my credulity and firing all rockets, like, say, Robert Rodriguez, or a lot of fantasy/sci-fi (like Guardians of the Galaxy).<br/><br/>To me the whole sideshow involving Freeman and his coterie was an attempt to gussy the proceedings up with a Greek chorus. It was supposed to add theoretical rigor/gravitas, but just winds up coming off like cheap VO exposition of dubious scientific provenance, writ large.<br/><br/>There is a mythic element, and it's the ongoing play on the concept of a young woman moving toward an inadvertent, human-manufactured goddesshood, a la Dr. Manhattan.

"Danny_G13","7","0","2","8 January 2015"," Throwaway sci-fi fun
","It's to know how to start this review. Lucy is filled with almost every sci-fi cliché under the sun and borrows so many aspects from dozens of other movies (including ones Johansson herself is in) that if you take it too seriously it'll be completely lost on you to the point of being terrible. It is derivative, vacuous, and slightly shallow.<br/><br/>But, and you'll have seen from my score, it is far from a bad movie.<br/><br/>Lucy sees Johansson's protagonist of the title caught up in a drug deal gone bad. Through no fault of her own she ends up ingesting the drug and finds her mind and body fundamentally altering and seemingly evolving to a higher plane.<br/><br/>Already I can see people screaming 'Limitless', 'X men', and even '2001 Space Odyssey'. They're not completely wrong - this movie borrows so many aspects from these and more that it basically is a compilation of every sci-fi movie you've ever seen.<br/><br/>But that said, while it tries to take ITSELF seriously with pretentious twaddle about evolution and psychology, it is delivered stylishly enough to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Besson's direction is also good - there are plenty of stylish set-pieces and another of his notable works, Fifth Element, is here in spirit too. The guy does know how to produce a slick movie.<br/><br/>The problem is the content, and the way it's delivered. The first half of the movie sees 'correlation' cut offs between what's happening to Lucy and Morgan Freeman's Dr Norman giving lectures to a crowd of academics which 'just so happen' to be explaining the nature of evolution and the primitive stage of human psychology. It's all very interesting but the idea all this is happening to her while he's delivering his very convenient sermons really pushes the envelope. Naturally she finds him and seeks his help 'because he's the only one who can help her'.<br/><br/>Another notable flaw is the 'bad guy' is literally there for the sake of being a bad guy. He doesn't exude any fear, menace, or indeed interest, and seems wholly contrived for the sake of there being a nemesis.<br/><br/>But, while Besson probably did intend this to be taken more seriously than it ends up being, it nevertheless entertains thanks to quick pace, an intriguing premise, and good cinematography. The visual effects are especially decent.<br/><br/>However I have no idea why he thought it a good idea to stick Scarlett in a ridiculously sexy dress for two-thirds of the movie - don't get me wrong, I'm as hot-blooded as any other man and don't object to it, but it was unnecessary, distracting, and it served no purpose beyond eye candy. It certainly wasn't practical for the character's situation.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was a fun, silly, well-executed if flawed movie which had designs grander than it was actually able to deliver."

","Every once in a while a film like 'Lucy' comes along. One that is incredibly ambitious but so poorly executed that you can't help but feel sorry for the overall product. It pains me to type this, when a project has such great potential starts to stumble and ends up tripping its own feet over.<br/><br/>Luc Besson the director and writer of 'Lucy' knows what he is doing behind the camera. Throughout it he creates undeniably beautiful images on screen. If only the rest of the film was on par with the camera work then I would be jumping for joy. I might have actually had more fun with Lucy if I wasn't treated like a dumb audience member from the get-go. Obvious imagery of a cheetah hunting its prey intercut with a scene of Lucy being surrounded by gang members – isn't what you want to show your audience especially if they have an IQ higher than a 10 year old.<br/><br/>'Lucy' stars Scarlett Johansson in the title role; she is given a drug (against her own free will) that will increase her brain power from 10% to 100%. I can admire Johansson for trying to inject human emotion – for the first 15 minutes, then her character becomes devoid of any, which left me emotionally disconnected with her character; that and her blatant disregard for human life. After she has the drug in her bloodstream we get to see what she can do with her power. This ranges from being able to read people's minds to virtual omnipotence. Sound familiar? If it does then it should be no surprise that Lucy is what I would term a superhero. Yet the film lacks what makes them interesting – a strong villain and suspense.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi who plays the villain (Mr Jang) is given so little to do that he might as well be called obligatory henchman for unnecessary conflict. It is a shame when the lead actor of Oldboy (2003) is in a film far below him. His character is no match for Lucy; as with a flick of her wrist she can magically use the force and send her enemies flying against the wall. He can do nothing to stop her – see where I'm getting at with the obligatory villain concept? Lucy can do anything and her enemies virtually nothing, so we don't even need a villain present at all. No one can challenge her effectively, thus stopping any tension within the film. <br/><br/>I'm really trying hard to find something positive apart from the visuals. Morgan Freeman is great – but when wasn't he? Unfortunately although he gives his all, he cannot stop the film from venturing on the wrong side of camp. Again I come to another element of the film which Besson can't seem to decide upon. The tone of the film; it never knows when to be serious or silly – in the end when he mixes scenes of seriousness and one-liners they end up just cancelling themselves out. Leaving me very confused as to what the director was aiming for.<br/><br/>An intriguing premise but weak story stops 'Lucy' from being 'The Matrix' game changer it should have been. The biggest compliment I can give the film is that it isn't painful to watch; just irritating that a film maker with talent fails to make 'Lucy' suspenseful, or for that matter interesting."

I liked the premise and how the story wove. It had some slick moments and some good effects, When it focused on the main character it got better. I liked the ending even thought it was slightly Matrix-ish. <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson did a good job and the more the part developed, the more I liked her. However, I din;t know what Morgan freeman was doing in that film (not a lot) because he had a rather nothing part and had no chance to show his acting skill.

"dromasca","5","0","2","4 January 2015"," viewers brains are still used at 10% ... or less
","Lucy was supposed to be a film I should highly enjoy. I love Scarlett Johansson not only for the way she looks but also for daring to undertake complex and different roles that put at work her acting talent. Science fiction is one of the genres I like most. I liked everything that Luc Besson does  actually everything he did until this film. In my opinion 'Lucy' is a low for both Scarlett and Luc as well. It's not terribly bad, as they are too good artists and professionals to fall too low, but it's highly unsatisfying, well below expectations.<br/><br/>Readers of popular science magazines, or watchers of the similar TV shows should be already familiar with the scientific pretext of the film. The complex and sophisticated computing machine which is our brain is barely used, maybe at 10% of its capacity. If somehow (maybe using a blue powder drug!) the brain efficiency was used at a higher percentage the respective individual would get capabilities that are well beyond average to the point that they may seem superhuman to the other mortals. This is what happens to the hero in 'Lucy' but the problem is that the combination of sexy techno-thriller does not work well with the pseudo-science in the film. Talking about the meaning of life and universality of time in-between car chases and the destruction of the French Academy by bullets and mortars is some kind of fun, but not much more.<br/><br/>When talking about many other films made in Hollywood I have often complained about their length. It's seldom today to find a feature film that does not reach 120 minutes of projection, and in many cases American (and not only American) productions exceed the 150 threshold, without any consistent gains in complexity or quality, but adding time resistance to the qualities required from viewers and justifying to some extent the additional ticket prices. 'Lucy' is only 85 minutes long credits included and this may be one of the reasons it feels like hurried and superficial, with the main ideas exposed like in a crash sciences lesson and all the characters with the exception of the main hero reduced to uni-dimensional sketches, without any character development. It's just a pity to see the talent of such fine actors like Morgan Freeman or Amr Waked wasted in such a way. The becoming of a genius and superhuman is described in a manner that is neither too original, nor too spectacular, and the smart dialogs between the beauty who became a genius and the scientist whose role seems mostly to be amazed without being able to help are just deprived of any emotion. There is one sentence about losing the capability to feel which if developed could have added a very different dimension to the film, but it was lost in the rush. When time becomes a dimension to be transgressed the journey looks more like an adult version of the 'Night at the Museum' which may run in the neighboring cinema hall. And that cinematographic metaphor reminding a famous ceiling painting? is it parody? 'Lucy' has many good premises and wastes most of them."
"wvisser-leusden","6","0","2","1 January 2015"," science fiction clearly is not Scarlett Johansson's trade
","The idea behind 'Lucy' is interesting enough: what will happen when mankind uses more than the common 10 to 15% of its brain-capacity? For this idea producer Luc Besson researched in the world of science, having the positive effect of it showing all over his movie.<br/><br/>So far so good. However, Besson was less happy in thinking that a subject like this could result in anything more than a common science fiction-film. Not even a prominent lead like Scarlett Johansson is able to lift 'Lucy' from its corresponding flat story.<br/><br/>Which inevitably brings us to the conclusion that Johansson wastes her great acting talent here. Or to be more precise: the more Johansson moves away from mankind's common 10 to 15% capacity, the more her acting vanishes into thin air. It is no surprise that Scarlett Johansson's characteristic down-to-earth performance comes out best in the beginning of this film."
"InMyHonestOpinion","4","0","4","26 December 2014"," If only we could I know I would
","I know when I was growing up I used to have an imagination so strong it created not only its own world but its own language, its own race of people and beasts, a world where superheroes ruled with their superhuman abilities and the one power I always had was telekinesis, the ability to make objects and people move with a simple thought. My mind was so intent on making that one power real I would sit for hours staring at a picture on my mum's mantle willing it to move but alas it never actually happened. Imagine though if it did. Imagine that you had the ability to not only make objects move but the ability to control people, make them do what you want, bend not only time but space with the blink of your mind's eye, whatever you wanted was there with a single thought. Luc Besson would be one of the much underrated directors in my opinion and another one of my favorites with such titles as: The Fifth Element, La Femme Nikita, Starship Troopers and B13 he has an ability to turn the simple into the extraordinary and usually he knows how to make his female leads totally kick ass. Lucy is his latest piece of artwork once again not only director but also writer, it is a very simple storyline; what would happen if you could use 100% of your mind? Lucy is what will happen. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) gets wrapped up in a dangerous drug smuggling ring where she is used against her will to import the latest drug to hit Europe. One thing leads to another and Lucy ends up ingesting the entire package she is smuggling into her blood stream. Slowly Lucy begins to gain the ability to use more than the proposed 10% of her brain function, as she gains more use the world she and we all know starts to disappear and Lucy begins seeing it for what it really is. Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption, The Dark Knight Rises) plays Professor Norman who is actually studying the brain and its limitless abilities who Lucy reaches out to for help. He doesn't have the greatest role but it is Morgan Freeman after all. Min-Sik Choi (Old boy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) plays the bad guy Mr. Jang who has organised the trafficking. As I said it is a very simple storyline and plot, though in the usual Luc Besson action and sci-fi style. An action packed brain melting film would be my best explanation, so much is wrong with the film but then so much is right as well. If you can leave behind the nonsense of it all and let that inner child break free this film is really enjoyable for what it is. Leave you marbles at the door and enjoy what Lucy is all about, an unknown universe and all it may have to offer."

Well, personally one of the main problems I have with movies is when the main character isn't likable (unless they are meant to be horrible) but even then some bad guys are likable.<br/><br/>Lucy is put in a tough situation at the beginning of the film and from there the story goes. Drugs are put into her stomach to transport but after getting kicked in the stomach 3 or 4 times they leak into her blood stream and she becomes a butt kicking machine with the smarts of Albert Einstein times 100.<br/><br/>She quickly is able to find a professor played by Morgan Freeman and asks for his help and opinion on what is going on. Obviously Freeman's character is astonished and very curious. The rest of the movie is the bad guys trying to get their drugs back. Lucy was 1 of 4 ""packages"" and she's stopped them from getting to there destinations.<br/><br/>While Lucy is trying to find answers, she's not very kind and doesn't care much about other people and the consequences she leaves behind. What happened to her was terrible but before she's injected with this drug we didn't know much about her other than she seemed a bit trashy and not someone who you would particularly like. It's not that I didn't care about the character, it's that she didn't seem to care about any one else either which made her somewhat not likable.<br/><br/>The action and premises were great and I really enjoyed most of the movie.

","We use less than 10% of the brain's actual power, what could possibly happen if we used more than that is what the film based its story upon. Sounds exciting? Definitely! As you start to watch the film, the promise is definitely there to explore the uncharted territories of the human mind but no, do not expect some thought provoking , mind stretching imagery on a theory that has intrigued scientists for decades. Not from director Luc Besson, you would not expect a film that just touches the surface of the power of the human mind. Instead we are treated to standard cheap action sequences that make Scarlett reprise her tough girl image from the avenger movies and soon the movie drops to the level of the weekly mall movie tripe.

","This is a huge disappointment for a Luc Besson film. The director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Lucy is a movie with a really dumb premise that has already been de-bunked. What if you can use 100% of your brain? Even if we only used 10% and somehow achieve maximum usage, we would very likely not be doing what is depicted in this movie. The main character is an American student named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson)living in Taiwan who manages to get herself in a drug trafficking operation as a drug mule. The drug that is put in her is experimental. After the drug package breaks inside her body after a physical incident with a trafficking henchman, the drug gives her the ability to do anything you could imagine by the time she achieves 100% usage in their brain. That's pretty much it. Morgan Freeman co-stars as a Scientist who is basically in the movie to explain the whole ""100% of the brain theory"" like a Science Channel program. I'm not even kidding about this. This goes alongside an action-adventure as Lucy finds out what is going on with her as the Korean gang that made her a mule tracks her down. The movie itself is short with a gimmicky, stupid premise put in with some action and even sprinkles of philosophical dialogue about humanity that's also present. LUCY may not be as bad as a DVD rental but I wouldn't waste time buying it."

The movie had no real villain, reason being that the equivalent to Lucy is God. I also don't see why there are any characters aside from Lucy. The scientist (Morgan Freeman) really doesn't need to explain anything to Lucy because she will eventually know everything. The cop, can also be excluded since she really doesn't need him to get the packages. She can control cars, electricity, so why not have the carriers delivered to her door.

The Revolution and Evolution theory was interesting for the starter, but it's a thing that every nature science student is being taught, and the movie doesn't pass anything above that. Almost all other scientific stuff is fiction and that's not the way how science- fiction movies should work. Sci- fi is a genre that should contain fictional elements out of scientific background, not otherwise. But hey, it's Hollywood, and we are somehow used to it.

She thinks the bullets out of the bottom of a pistol...magazines don't work that way, she uses a CB radio to access a mobile phone conversation... again, ouch. The only reason I give this movie 7 stars instead of the 5 that it deserves is that someone in Hollywood was intelligent enough to borrow one of South Koreas greatest actors, Choi Min-Sik. Directors may not be geniuses, but they can at least try and look one up in a phonebook. Luc Besson... Leon The Professional is in my top 10 list. What happened?"

A hypotheses in itself has no application, unless it has predictive (not explanatory) power. I think the movie could've been much better for me if it weren't trying so hard and overtly. I didn't like the cut-scenes, score, etc very much. Way too much drama for me. Had nothing against the grit which is fairly good. Min-sik Choi has a good performance. I think Scarlett Johansson did too, for the most part."

","You know Luc Besson has had a strange career, he has directed some great classics like The Fifth Element, Leon and Nikita, he has produced over 100 movies and written above 50, he is a man who has had a hand in everything and still has the most random of tastes in movies, if there is a man who can be shown as the metre stick of both success and failure in Hollywood then I submit to you it is indeed Luc Besson, and Lucy is a perfect reflection of the man who stands behind it.<br/><br/>Lucy is a film of both highs and lows, the movie starts strong and has a premise we haven't seen 10,000 times before (but we have seen at least once previously), then around the middle it starts to show moments of weakness (spliced with a feeling of an ulterior motive) until it totally loses it's way and comes clean off the rails for it's finale. Now, that's not to say there is nothing to be enjoyed or there is no fun to be had with Lucy, in fact far from it.<br/><br/>Stop me when you've heard this one before; an average nobody takes an experimental drug which lets them unlock all of their brain capacity, because of this new power foreign gangsters chase after them. The ironic thing about Lucy is that the film is at it's best when it's most parallels Limitless, because that is when the entire affair is most lucid, once Besson is allowed to indulge himself things become overly complicated and bizarre.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of Lucy's madness (Without giving away the ending) is that there is a sequence in a plane where Lucy quite literally disintegrates, we are never shown the end of that scene or how she is transported to an airport hospital. It is one of the most obvious gaping holes in a movie I have ever personally seen, and it feels careless, as if Besson doesn't care about the script or story as long as he can have the sequences he wants in his movie.<br/><br/>It's true, Lucy filming has this surreal kind of schizophrenia to it, there are points in the movie that are spliced together with stock footage of human society and how we have evolved or an animal being hunted down and attacked, just randomly placed in the middle of a sequence as if Besson is having trouble concentrating on his own movie and needs to liven up the joint.<br/><br/>I can't express how odd the ending of Lucy is and how much it degenerates into just a pleasure factory for Luc Besson's visual joys but by the end of the film we were all left scratching out heads in wonder of what the hell it was really all about.<br/><br/>Lucy is portrayed by Scarlett Johansson who is trying her very best to make the role into something of merit, but she rapidly fails, the rest of the cast fit the weird tone of the film, with Morgan Freeman, Min-sik Choi and Julian Rhind-Tutt all putting in an appearance.<br/><br/>Lucy honestly feels like an art house movie without the art. There are moments of pure beauty and brilliance but seconds do not make a movie, minuets do and no matter how hard it tries Lucy always feels like it's a couple of seconds out of time with perfection."

","It's very fun to watch Scarlett Johansson kick bad guys around, and the film has a lot of scenes that are so impressive you could use the stills as a cool photo in themselves. Luc Besson is a master of this, and you'll find yourself thinking ""oh man, this is so cool"".<br/><br/>You might have heard already that the science behind the story (10% of the brain thing) is flimsy to say the least, plot holes are abundant but that is not a problem - this is a action sci-fi film and there are many good films with a far more ridiculous premise.<br/><br/>The real problem of this film is that it spends very little time focusing on the main character and her (very interesting!) storyline and keeps insisting we sit through the completely generic car chases, gun fights and arrests. As you could see in the trailer Lucy gets superpowers but instead of featuring her abilities to the fullest, half of the finale is spent on showing us five minor characters shooting it out in a library lobby.<br/><br/>As with almost all films dealing with the topic of human potential and transcendence there is a lot of pseudo philosophical drivel about how ""humans are sheep, we need to wake up"" etc. It's quite cringe worthy, and without enough of expected eye candy you will find yourself embarrassed on the films behalf in every other dialogue.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a couple of cool scenes with a lot of generic action film stuff and penny-philosophy stuck in between. Skip it, you won't miss anything."

","I read reviews for Lucy at the same time I was watching this movie. Long story short, this movie is so ludicrous that it makes me laugh. However, I will say that Scarlett Johansson and Min-Sik Choi were great despite acting out this hilarious story. Each of them is worth 1 star. Also, the CGs are great. Top of the industry, no doubt. Wouldn't be surprised if Iron Man popped out of somewhere in the movie. Very good CG effects. That is 2 more stars, and there it is. 4 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Like many reviews commented, the beginning was good and interesting. Solid start until this Asian creep kicked Johansson in the stomach, and then all hell broke loose. It was like kicking someone suffering from diarrhea in the stomach. After that, Johansson starts to have this intense gravity-defying epilepsy. It was like Johansson was magnetic, and somebody in the next room was moving his magnet on the wall to move Johansson around. I instinctively knew that the movie will go downward spiral from that point, and I was right.<br/><br/>Also, there are many things that does not make sense in this movie: -Johansson carried her handgun in her hand all the way from the entrance gate into the surgery room, but not a single person in the hospital seemed to notice. -Min-Sik Choi and his gang was arming themselves with assault rifles in front of the university AND the police. EXTREMELY SLOPPY.<br/><br/>This is a very hard review. Everything is so bad. I understand that at the end, Lucy reproduced in form of USB, but COME ON! A USB THUMB DRIVE? That USB looked like 125GB thumb drive you can buy for 80 dollars at BestBuy, or 60 dollars at Amazon.com. Okay, that's it. I can't write this review anymore.

","Here we have a movie that I honestly have to say I was on the fence about. There were many rumours swirling that this was some sort of prequel to the Black Widow. Although I knew this wasn't the case, it still made me think someone was just trying to cash in on the Avengers action girl thing which put me off a little bit.<br/><br/>After watching it, I can honestly say this wasn't the case. This movie stands completely on it's own for the most part. The only thing about the story I didn't like was the fact it had similarities to Limitless with Bradley Cooper. Although the premise is slightly different, it definitely felt like this was the same type of scenario -- up and coming famous actor is on the verge of super-stardom and is given a slick movie with an interesting drug based story as a jump off point.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed the story and the acting was excellent. Scarlett seems to be a better fit for me in these action roles rather than the drama or romance movies she does from time to time. I think that time has passed for her and hopefully she embraces these roles, at least for the next few years.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the special effects, but I did find it a little far fetched...and yes, I know it's a movie, but hear me out. It was supposed to be kind of based on fact, but they took some serious liberties with this as the movie went on to the point of ridiculousness. It was a little over the top for me in the end and I would have enjoyed if it stayed a little more grounded. There was a particular part with a computer towards the end that I thought was kind of ridiculous and didn't make much sense, but I get where you are coming from if you don't agree with.<br/><br/>So in the end I felt like this movie was an enjoyable watch, and I'm glad it was successful, but for a reality based movie it became a little too ridiculous for me."

Our protagonist, with the help of a new drug, manages to use a lot more than that. Scarlet Johanson did a pretty good job as the lead, going from a normal women to an extremely smart and powerful being. And you had to have a wise guy to give exposition about the concept of the movie and who better to have than Morgan Freeman. He was, as always, great. <br/><br/>Now the movie had some really cool concepts and ideas, and some REALLY good scenes. But you have to be willing to apply a lot of suspension of disbelief because there is some really unbelievable stuff in this movie. If you go on wondering about the logic of it all, you'll ruin it. <br/><br/>The not so good execution of certain elements stopped it from reaching greatness. First of all, the whole Mafia stuff was extremely pointless after Lucy got her powers. They should have focused on her powers and similar plot elements instead. What makes it more annoying is the fact that movie was really short, about 1 hour and 20 mins in duration only. A longer duration with more emphasis on her powers, development etc would have made it a lot better, instead they montaged her powers in the end. Then, like I mentioned earlier, the plot is really unbelievable. Even if you suspend lot of disbelief, you'll still be like WTF in many scenes. <br/><br/>The CGI was okay-ish. Some scenes looked good while some clearly looked fake. Don't blaming it much though considering it only had 40 million $ budget. <br/><br/>IN a way, this movie was somewhat like Transcendence, great albeit not a new concept and stuff but not so good execution. Good thing for this movie though was that it was still entertaining despite its many flaws. You'll definitely have a good time with it and might even wonder about philosophies and ideas depicted in the film. <br/><br/>7.3/10"

","To call this science fiction is a mistake. Some said, that other comics too would stretch physics.

But in LUCY something totally different happens: here no one gives a crap about science and logic at all. Our brain is a powerful instrument and it would be enough to speculate about its potential without all the psychic phenomenas the protagonist manages to perform while gaining access to her brains capacities. It's a waste of an interesting question."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","5","29 September 2014"," Stumbles on old clichés and artsy tropes
","I don't really mind clichés, if they're done well, or if the film maker tries something new with them. But could we please let this ridiculous 10 percent thing go already? It's simply not true, and it hasn't been believed to be true for decades now. We humans use most of our brains for simple everyday functions. Perhaps only 30-40 percent at a time, but it's still significantly more than the alleged 10 percent.<br/><br/>But, it's a single trope in a movie. A central one, certainly, but if the rest of the film was better, I wouldn't really mind all that much. But unfortunately it's not. The story itself is not a bad one. Luc Besson has managed to create this sweeping storyline about the birth of divinity within an ordinary woman - a theme I've often encountered in anime, in fact. Scarlett Johansson's Lucy has to deal with the evermounting loss of humanity as she becomes more than any human has ever been. Yet most of her actions are altruistic in nature, which I find refreshing.<br/><br/>The biggest problem this movie has is that it doesn't go full throttle with its scope. There are certain artsy elements and imagery to its delivery that try, but that's only window dressing. The theme of transcendence doesn't open up to as, we don't learn anything about it. The most we get is that Lucy can think faster, and thus type faster on a computer and spout of scientific theory to university professors. The bare bones of an idea are there, but the meat is lacking.<br/><br/>Plus the villains are superficial and unnecessary beyond their role in setting the film in motion, yet they're constantly brought back in to create action scenes. And the mood suffers accordingly.<br/><br/>Lucy has a lot of good elements in it, from Johansson's performance, to special effects, to rather excellent cinematography to the aforementioned action scenes, which feel unnecessary, but are pretty to look at. It's only the mix of them that feels wrong, and thus brings the film down. Lucy is worth checking out if you're into science fiction or Scarlett Johansson. The rest of you should move on."

And at least half of the plot made very good sense. The bad side was at times it was so silly I wanted to laugh out loud in the theater. The plot was completely ridiculous in parts. For example, at one point where her IQ is something over 200 she walks into a hospital. But she openly carries a large hand gun through various crowded rooms - DUMB. And no one notices..

","The whole film is predicated on the long-refuted myth that humans use only 10% of their brain capacity OK, I could live with that, but the way Morgan Freeman explains what we could do with access to 20%, 30% etc., is utter bunk. The notion that accessing more of our brain would allow us to control matter is ridiculous... and the film proceeds down this path of lunacy with wild abandon and no respect whatsoever for the laws of physics or biology. Apparently, accessing 100% of our brain allows us to physically disappear and 'be everywhere.' Accessing 80% allows us to control time. <br/><br/>If you have not even the most basic understanding of science, or are able to suspend your incredulity, then you may enjoy this film. Its entertaining enough, but at its heart it's complete bunk.<br/><br/>There's a difference between science fiction and fantasy. This sets itself up as the former, but takes so many liberties it strays uncomfortably into the latter; and the dissonance is painful."

","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!! I went into to Lucy expecting an entertaining thrill ride filled with clever science fiction twists and well thought out performances to go with it. What I got was Scarlett Johansson acting as an expressionless Bradley Cooper from Limitless, but with more seizures and less of a goal (seriously, she wasn't working towards anything for like the last 40 minutes of the movie). She didn't even do that much fighting. She did some at the start, but then she seemed to unlock her cerebral capacity enough to just look and people and make them fall down. Also, I know Morgan Freeman didn't actually know what would happen when she unlocked 100% of her brain. But some of that stuff was just downright stupid. So unlock enough of your cerebral capacity and you can travel in time, have seizures and turn into a supercomputer with weird alien blobs on it that turns into a shiny USB stick (thats after the supercomputer explodes into a black powder). And seriously, ""I AM EVERYWHERE""??? What the heck does that even mean??? Honestly, I just burst out laughing at the end of this film. How can drugs in your stomach effect your brain anyway??? Honestly, this was just a dumb film. My friend laughed at this film and his favourite film is Sharkboy and Lava Girl. Seriously, never watch this film. The one thing I would say is Morgan Freeman's performance wasn't actually that bad. But, every other performance in the film was so... <br/><br/>5.2. I don't recommend to anyone."

","So I went to see this movie after reading a few reviews that recommended it saying it was ""Different"" , I'm not sure what they meant and I did not feel the feel was very innovative.<br/><br/>Basically the whole movie revolves around this theory that humans only use 10% of their brain capacity and what would happen if we somehow unlocked our full potential. Miraculously this girl Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) Manages to accomplish just that, mostly by a series of misfortunes.<br/><br/>The whole prospect is very promising, I mean think of all the possibilities... Morgan freeman explains the various stages of the transition from 10% to 100% which happens gradually to Lucy, and they include: control of her own body, of other peoples' bodies, control of matter she is even able to manipulate time itself (and of course time travel). When she first starts the process it looks like we might be in for some serious action as she pounds on the baddies who had her imprisoned (and were about to take advantage of her sexually none the less!). However it soon turns into Lucy becoming a stare-ahead unable-to-feel-emotion thing who despite being able to understand all languages perfectly still communicates solely in English and even shoots some Asian drivers for not understanding her. From then on her only way of dealing with problems is to wave her hands about which causes people to either fall unconscious or get flung across the room. This becomes tiring very fast and by the end of the movie you will find yourself wishing you could fast forward time like her.<br/><br/>The Film leaves many unanswered questions such as:<br/><br/>-Wouldn't it have been much cooler if she had learned martial arts and actually fought some of her enemies? Perhaps throw in some of that time controlling power to make it even more interesting? Some matrix-like effects? Perhaps Scarlet couldn't handle all that.<br/><br/>-If Lucy can time travel why not go back to the start of the movie and prevent all of this horrible things from happening to her? -Why does she need to build a super computer only for it to spawn a flash drive? Couldn't she have spawned the flash drive and saved herself all the trouble?<br/><br/>-Why does she need to make that flash drive anyway? In the end she basically becomes God and is omnipresent and I'm guessing immortal. So if she ever felt the need to share any information with anyone, couldn't she just tell them herself?"

The second half of the movie, which is build around the sci-fi and ""philosophy"" fails to deliver, in fact, in combination with some ridiculous special effects it makes you wonder at times ""are they for real?"".<br/><br/>Do not assume that I am unfamiliar with the topics that the movie discusses at its various parts, in the contrary I am very familiar with them and find the way they are discussed upon and build upon clumsy the very least. Having Morgan Freeman presenting us pseudo-scientific non- sense is so cliché... having Scarlett Johansson sporting a (very badly acted I might add) serious - expressionless face and blabbering non- sense is comical at best. <br/><br/>The positives:<br/><br/>a) Very interesting and intense start to the movie in which Scarlett Johansson totally rocks. <br/><br/>b) Was not bored during the movie (except a little bit at the end) and for me with all those terribly boring movies coming out lately this is a plus. <br/><br/>c)The movie is build around interesting ideas<br/><br/>The negatives:<br/><br/>a) Please enough with Morgan Freeman explaining everything, it's become a joke and makes it hard for me to take a movie seriously. <br/><br/>b) The way Scarlett Johansson is acting her gradual ""transformation"" is horrible. She is so unconvincing and fake it's unbelievable. She has that typical ""I'm a robot"" acting style that the director assumes that a person with enhanced brain capacity should have. Overall although she starts nicely on this film I have to say that her acting was poor through the movie.<br/><br/>c) The way the film tries to deliver philosophical insights is clumsy, forced and uninteresting.<br/><br/>d) The plot evolves in a ridiculous manner and you end up feeling your are watching something really really stupid. Some of the end scenes are just comical... <br/><br/>I think that the people involved with this movie where themselves puzzled about how to present someone who's brain capacity is increasing so rapidly.

This is a negative point of the movie, and all the academic show offs presented, are basically incorrect. Being incorrect is different from being possible or not completely understood. This movie was too much fiction. I'm worried about the recent trend in Hollywood that science fiction movies tend to be like video games. Is this cinema art or cinema engineering? However, I really liked certain scenes relating to the past and nature. Good job. Besides, I didn't like Scarlett Johansson's acting, as my expectations are higher for such an famous actress. Morgan freeman is the same as he is in most of his movies; Nothing special added. Action scenes were decent thanks to the modern visual effect capabilities. The plot and story were not bad.

Lucy (Scarjo or Scarlett Johansson) was exposed to a drug that allowed her to use 100% of her brain.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie reminded me of Natural Born Killers in that there were several cutaways to file footage of other things that could be symbolic or relative to what was being said or perhaps felt. There were some exciting moments and some awesome moments, but then the movie got way too esoteric and almost metaphysical. A valid and plausible theory became mystical and almost comical.

","Just saw 'Lucy'. The premise is interesting - it definitely extends beyond the realm of transhumanism into territory usually the preserve of spirituality and religion, most explicitly in the scene where Lucy and the first humanoid 'Lucy' touch fingers in an allegory to the Micheangelo fresco. It was all too easy to think of Lucy attaining god-like status, as she progresses to fully using her brain and cerebral capacities. How that works is never quite explained. Although there is a theory I came up with that brains are sort of 'receivers' of universal consciousness that ties in well with this, but in reality, I don't think using '100% of your brain' will really give you all these superhuman or superhero powers. <br/><br/>The plot was probably the most disappointing part of the film. Beginning in Taipei, Lucy's boyfriend sets her up (presumably) with a Korean drug ring that is using people as mules smuggle in a drug (although whether they know the full capabilities of the drug is seemingly unclear) that is synethesised 'CPH4' a chemical that mother's release that stimulates bone growth in fetuses. Their goal here is not that clear. Basically another 'catch the bad guy' plot, intertwined with Lucy's (Scarlett Johansen's) evolution into some kind of superhuman and beyond. A lot of the action scenes and pseudo-science (which in itself is not a sin if properly worked out in the alternative logic of the universe) have been seen before. I'll give it 5.5/10."

Women are good at multi-tasking, in contrast to the fatally obsessive guys here.<br/><br/>Besson has always liked strong, effective women at the centre of his plots. He confronts man's primeval dread of woman's power, the neurotic reason for her suppression. Lucy is both a feminization of auteur Luc and the name given a three million year old skeleton of a hominid, so she's both a person and an anthropological myth.<br/><br/>Normally a loose, hip airhead, this Lucy's drug dose is implanted in her lower belly, so she discovers it in an image of both defloration and periodic cleansing. The drug erupts when a rejected man kicks her in the belly. That — and its first usage — makes the power a physical projection of her feminist rage at powerful men's abuse if women. No other woman has a significant role in the film — we meet only her airier head roomie and a tattooist — because Lucy is Woman. <br/><br/>Lucy opens the film saying ""Life was given us a billion years ago. What have we done with it?"" She ends it with ""Life was given us a billion years ago. Now you know what you can do with it."" <br/><br/>The latter invites ""Shove it!"" because most of the humanity we see here is venal, vicious, corrupt. But we also get Morgan Freeman as the humanistic sage who offers such illuminating bromides as ""We humans are more concerned with having than being."" He probably just missed Woodstock too. But Freeman's scientist and an earnest Parisian cop are enough to give the film's view of humanity an upbeat turn. What we can do with it is live as if knowledge and morality matter. We can try to be aware. That's what the inserts of molecular and astronomical fireworks boil down to."

","I was already frustrated to find out this movie again reinforces the false belief that we only use 10% of our brains. You'd be amazed how many people believe this kind of thing to be really true. Even Hollywood should stop spreading silliness like this, just for the sake of science, except if clearly science-fictional (which wasn't the case in the context of this movie).<br/><br/>Either way, I would have been able to get over that fact if the rest of the execution of this movie wasn't so horrible. It is all so over-the-top that I decided to leave during the break, so I did not even see the whole movie.

"LloydBayer","6","0","5","6 August 2014"," Although lacking logic, Lucy is still an ambitious action film held together by a remarkable female driven role.
","Rife with analogies and open-ended questions, Lucy is a science fiction film that is every bit slick, stylized and surreal, and everything else you would expect from French action director Luc Besson. Like Besson's previous films, the extent of plausibility is directly proportional to the viewer's cerebral capacity, which, believe it or not, is what the narration is all about.<br/><br/>Using one of the most debated questions of our time – the capacity of the human brain – Besson's script begins with the visible one-thirds of a hypothetical iceberg. Documentary-like intercuts stand in for creation and existence with an opening scene on cell multiplication. This is further explained by Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman, no less) who in a conference in Paris, goes on to illustrate the cosmic relationship between death and immortality and how this relates to using 100 percent of the human brain. Freeman's main purpose in this film is to sound calm and calculated like when he presents documentaries, and to make scientific mambos jumbo sound profound, like he does in other films; using that voice, his second purpose is to bust the myth that humans only use 10 percent of their brain. Thousands of miles away, Norman's illustration becomes a metaphysical reality when Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American student in Taiwan, is tricked into working for a Korean drug lord. While another cutaway shows a deer stalked by cheetahs, it suffices to say that Lucy is naïve but not dumb because her focus soon turns to Darwinian survival. This is where Besson amps up the action when Lucy is ingested with an experimental drug called CPH4, a synthetic version of a metabolic enzyme secreted during pregnancy. As a primary effect, Lucy experiences a surge in cerebral capacity. Now at 20 percent, she is literally bouncing off the walls.<br/><br/>Before Lucy exacts her revenge, ala dual wielding guns blazing, her transformation is shown at 10 percent intervals. This is fascinating mainly due to Johansson's performance at each interval and her character's evolution into a different being. Without giving away the best parts, all I'll say is at 30 percent Johansson's Lucy is a notch above her Black Widow in the Marvel film franchise, and way ahead of Dr. Manhattan's DC comic book world by the time she hits 70 percent. Then it gets all weird to the point where you question Besson's cerebral capacity while writing the script. With an obvious inspiration from a ton of similarly themed films, it's safe to say that the main plot arcs are borrowed from The Matrix, Transcendence and especially Limitless. Although Besson won't find much praise for originality, you could say his creation of Lucy is as much a new cinematic super hero as his Frankenstein-ish approach in creating her piece by piece. Having said that, it is imperative that the audience appreciates her flaws more than her abilities because it's more about what she is becoming rather than what she can do. Through this creation, Besson's vision is clear but it is still not an excuse for his laughable hypothesis followed by a questionable ending.<br/><br/>Besides the unnecessary cramming of anthropology, paleontology, neuroscience and the mind boggling space-time continuum, Besson's forte is in the action set pieces and it shows. From locales in Taiwan to white-knuckle car chases in Paris, to a hypothetical encounter with our ancestral primate, the action is heavy handed even with subtle injections of humour. This might all seem traditional for Luc Besson, given his pedigree for femme fatal films like Nikita and The Fifth Element, amongst other classics. With Lucy, Besson's nonsense and lapse in logic is bearable, and at times enjoyable, thanks to the film's only saving grace and that is Johansson. Fresh off the critical success of 2013's Her and Under the Skin, both science fiction dramas, Johansson could be the new name in female driven plots, even if that means running the gauntlet with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence. But as far as myth busting goes, there's more to Johansson than meets the eye. Blond or not."
"jkling-1","6","0","8","3 August 2014"," Could have been so much more! 1/2 half very good, then lost what it should have been ... along with its value
","The first half of this movie was very good. The rest unfortunately lost itself with what, to me, they could have done with Lucy. <br/><br/>The visual juxtaposition of Lucy's initial capture with scenes from nature of an animal of prey running down the valiant but ultimately doomed animal was very well done, and served to heighten the scene. Everything was just great until after Lucy was first exposed, and the following pieces rapidly fell apart, leaving the rest of the story ultimately cold though visually interesting. <br/><br/>What they should have done with it, is have Lucy lose what we think of as our humanity, and normal boundaries of ethics/morals for her own personal survival, without regard for what that would take. Not to be killing for killings-sake, but merely that her new existence in nature would simply require her to ""do what needed to be done"". <br/><br/>These needs would then put her at odds not merely with the drug folks but also the authorities. Then this would be a nice illustration of what Morgan Freeman's diatribe of how some organisms leverage self- sufficiency vs. most - leveraging reproduction. Lucy could have then been driven to need the extra drugs, and gone off on a multi-country violent spree to gain the other three sachets, leaving a trail in her wake of bodies and dna. Then, forcing the authorities to track her down before she could attain the last - before she could reach 100% and then be unstoppable. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Lucy should have ended up being, through no fault of her own, a tragic figure who must be hunted down and killed before she became too powerful and jeopardized humanity and society at large. <br/><br/>A real shame that this film missed the mark, and could have been SO MUCH MORE, with their initial premise."
"vistheindian","6","0","8","4 August 2014"," Black Widow is on drugs!
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), is captured by a criminal group run by the crime lord Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). She is forced to be a drug mule for a new designer drug that accidentally leaks inside her. The overdose results in her unlocking 100% of her brain's capacity, becoming an unstoppable warrior intent on getting revenge. The concept of a person reaching super human level capabilities through some drug and then going all badass is intriguing for sure. Also Johansson is no stranger to being a badass in movies, so she plays well as the lead. The problem remains that the movie concentrates so much on delivering on the style that you'll not care for the little substance there is.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>So, Limitless + Black Widow + Neo from The Matrix? Hell yea count me in! That triple threat combo is exactly what I thought when I first saw the trailers for Lucy, so you could imagine I was quite pumped to watch this movie. Unfortunately I underestimated the epicness of that combo and Johansson ends up being so overpowered that the whole sense of danger is taken out of the movie.<br/><br/>If you have seen the recent Marvel movies especially Captain America: Winter Soldier you know that Scarlett Johansson has proved to be a great action star. Lucy gave her the perfect opportunity to be the lead in her own action film, and she owns it for the most part. It was entertaining to see the sudden change from a vulnerable young woman to a methodical killer. The powers she has gradually increases over the duration of the movie, but about the half-way point it is abundantly clear that she has become a generic powerful killer. The power takes all the tension out of the action scenes because there is not going to be any real danger for you to care about. As for becoming an overly methodical killer, essentially all character is sucked out of Lucy and you are left with a emotionless robot that you can't relate to.<br/><br/>Director Luc Beeson is a very visual director, and that is the strength of this movie. All the action scenes are very well filmed. There are no cheap tricks like shacky cam, the shootings are all very well edited and paced. There is one car chase that is definitely one of the best in recent memory. So I must give credit to the visual style. There is one thing that Beeson tries that I think will get some mixed reactions. In the beginning few times some national geographic type clips of animals are shown to mirror what's happening in the movie. I personally found it to be interesting but then it's not used at all. It's as if Beeson lost all confidence in this experiment. Why do it with half effort? Either follow through or don't do it all.<br/><br/>Lucy is not a terrible movie, there are some things to enjoy. As a whole I wouldn't recommend paying full price to watch in cinema. Marvel, just give us a Black Widow movie!<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"zardoz-13","9","0","8","3 August 2014"," You'll Love ""Lucy!!!""
","You'll love ""Lucy."" French filmmaker Luc Besson, who helmed ""Le Femme Nikita,"" ""Angel-A,"" and ""Colombiana,"" takes the feminist-oriented action thriller to the next level. This outlandish but entertaining hokum chronicles the mutation of a young damsel-in-distress into an invincible dame with heretofore unheard of mental powers. Our provocative protagonist comes to rely more on her brains than her biology. Comparably, ""Lucy"" reminded me a little of the 2004 movie ""Maria Full of Grace."" Columbian drug dealers planted cocaine into the stomach of a teenage girl in ""Maria Full of Grace"" and used her to smuggle their narcotics into the United States. Happily, this savvy babe turned the tables on her captors! Similarly, our heroine in ""Lucy"" finds a bag of exotic synthetic drugs sew into her tummy and given a plane ticket for America. The last thing that her savagely coldblooded captors are prepared for is her unlikely reprisal. Lucy turns the tables on them in ways that not even she could have imagined before she encountered these merciless hooligans. Indeed, actress Scarlett Johansson would be the whole show if Morgan Freeman weren't lecturing in cutaways as a prestigious physician, Professor Samuel Norman, whose ranks as the foremost expert on gray matter. When Professor Norman isn't delivering lectures to enthralled audiences about the percentage of use that humans derive from their noodles, Besson treats us to illuminating National Geographic documentary excerpts of jungle animals that punctuate the running battle Lucy has with the heavily-armed Asian drug smugglers. Korean actor Choi Min-shik, who starred in director Chan-wook Park's first version of the revenge thriller ""Oldboy"" (2003), makes a memorable villain named Mr. Jang that you will love to hate. Furthermore, Mr. Jang's immaculately tailored henchmen are as homicidal as he is until he meets our feminist heroine after she experiences a massive change in her attitude. Interestingly enough, before she made ""Lucy,"" Scarlett Johansson made ""Under the Skin,"" a sci-fi thriller about an alien who masquerades as a human who preys on lonely men in Scotland. For the record, Besson had cast Angelina Jolie as the lead, but Jolie had to drop out, so Johansson stepped into the part.<br/><br/>The first time we see Lucy (Scarlett Johansson of ""The Avengers""), she is arguing with her straw cowboy-hat clad scummy boyfriend, Richard (Pilou AsbÃ¦k of ""The Whistleblower""), in front of a fashionable, high-rise hotel in Taiwan. Richard is struggling to convince Lucy to deliver a sleek briefcase to a motel guest named Mr. Jang. Richard insists that he cannot personally hand the briefcase over to Mr. Jang. Lucy refuses to deliver the briefcase. She asks Richard about the contents of the briefcase. As it turns out, Richard doesn't have a clue about what is in the briefcase. Their entire argument sounds like something that Quentin Tarantino's characters argued about in ""Pulp Fiction."" Everything in the seminal crime thriller ""Pulp Fiction"" turned on the mysterious contents of a cryptic briefcase. Just as Lucy is about to walk away from Richard, the jerk of a scumbag handcuffs the brief case to her wrist so she cannot get it off. Eventually, she relents and enters the motel while Richard watches her. Suffice to say, things go downhill like an avalanche for both Richard and our heroine. The action sequences in ""Lucy"" are breathtaking, especially the predictable but exciting car chase through Paris. Besson charts the action according to the percentage of brainpower that our heroine is able to harness until fade-out when she concludes her incredible metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Quite simply, ""Lucy"" unfolds as a standard-issue, darkly-themed, revenge thriller in the vein of something notorious horror maestro Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" fame would perpetrate. About half-way through its lean, mean 90 minutes, this nimble Universal Pictures release changes our protagonist from a shanghaied schoolgirl into a gal who doesn't need a guy to save her bacon. She becomes the equivalent of Liam Neeson in the ""Taken"" thrillers and then she even surpasses him! She doesn't even have to rely on guns. Initially, the villains round up not only poor Lucy but also three other guys and sew several bags of strange blue crystals called CPH4 into their bodies. Basically, CPH4 amounts to the equivalent of stuff that pregnant moms produce to cultivate their fetuses. Somebody utters ominously enough about the substance: """"For a baby, it packs the power of an atomic bomb."""" Our ingenious heroine manages to escape the clutches of the bad guys, and she alerts the authorities about herself and the other mules. Unfortunately, the police aren't prepared for the commitment that the criminals have to their product. As the bullets begin to fly, bodies stack up in piles. These villains are armed with more than just fully automatic weapons. Before the dust settles, however, Besson's crime thriller transforms into a mind-boggling science fiction actioneer reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Literally, the heroine becomes the equivalent of the monolith in the Kubrick film. Indeed, the ending is a mind blower in itself and you may feel cheated by the ending. Nevertheless, nothing that you have seen this summer will prepare you for this supercharged little saga."

","Stating with an easy to tell, if you're a fan (Die Hard or Not) of The Matrix films, this movie is for you, without a doubt.<br/><br/>As for those who saw a great story with an interesting take on something that has only been scratch on science shows, you won't find it here. Lucy is a female take of the Matrix that only goes so far with ideas, plot threads, and a grand cast to try and sadly not pull it through.<br/><br/>Everyone does their best in this film, you can see that. But it's a story that just can't be saved. Even more so with the main lead, no one can relate too, just as Neo from the Matrix, becoming a superhero but not really as this gift was given, using it wise or not, falls through.<br/><br/>Lucy is what it comes off as, with just a simple name as it is, comes along with the play itself. Too simple, with fruitful uncountable ideas that are just not going anywhere through the film and come off as just stages (As the trailers pointed out) of what could be fictional guesses if one had this power.<br/><br/>In short, Lucy = The Matrix. If one does go see it, hold the bar low for it, and enjoy with a mindless judgment. As this movie could be a hit or miss to some, it just didn't work for me."
"pasada-1","7","0","10","2 August 2014"," Cool factor high but an insult to intelligence
","Luc Besson makes cool movies. Great action sequences and fast pace. Go see this movie if you want to have a fun ride.<br/><br/>Now comes the part about why it's an insult to intelligence.<br/><br/>We all use 100% percent of our brain. We just do. Think about it. Would you say you use only 10% of your hand or only 5% of your nose. Almost every part of a human being is under use all the time. It's being utilized fully for what its purpose is. The notion that our brain has unused capacity is simply wrong. Our brain is modular in nature and all its parts have a specific purpose. They are all under use, all the time. There is nothing in there that needs to be run at it's ""full"" capacity to unlock secrets of the universe. It's true that with proper training you can use your brain better to remember things or stay more focused. That's just rewiring inside your brain over a period of time which comes with training and good nutrition. I say this movie is an insult to intelligence, because they reduced our potential to unlock the secrets of the universe to pumping a drug in our body. Our generation is already becoming slaves to things like smart phones and the internet, here's a movie that explores the unlimited potential of human mind using a drug. That's plain lazy thinking. Is this what was going through Luc Besson's mind: ""okay so I want to show the human race what they could do if their brain were at full potential...hmm...lets see...EUREKA! a drug could possibly accelerate this process...not critical thinking...not meditation...not hard work...a drug...that makes sense...it's so simple!""<br/><br/>I look forward to see Interstellar which does exactly the opposite. I believe Christopher Nolan wants us to believe in our own selves (at our current brain capacity) to unlock secrets of the universe.<br/><br/>Also what's up with Scarlett Johansson's ET like mannerisms when her brain ""capacity"" increases. An enlightened person will not act like an alien, they will act like real human beings, they will show kindness and empathy.<br/><br/>7/10 for its entertainment value only. If Luc Besson make any claim about this movie being something more than just an action movie then a f**k y** and 1/10 from me."

She was good as The Black Widow in the Avengers, she's good here, too.<br/><br/>The movie is classified as a sci-fi action thriller. Luc Bes son, as writer director loves to play around this genre. The movie is based on the disputed premise that only 10% of the brain is utilized by humans. If the other 90% were utilized, the human capabilities would be multiplied manifold.<br/><br/>I suggest you leave 99% of your brain outside the cinema hall if you truly want to enjoy the flick.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a 25 year old student, Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), being conned by her seedy-looking boyfriend to deliver a briefcase to some clients. The briefcase gets chained to her hand, she moves in to deliver, the boyfriend gets his face blown off, and the film gets rolling. What a dumb female, this Lucy, you think - perhaps she's using only 1% of her brain.<br/><br/>The briefcase contains a blue colored drug. The Korean drug lord turns Lucy into a drug mule after a minor operation and dumps her into a dingy cell where a scumbag tries to molest her. Lucy resists and is kicked in the stomach. The packet bursts and the chemical gets absorbed in the blood. From here on, the movie blasts off.<br/><br/>The chemical is a sort of hormone which is similar to that produced and transferred by a mother to her kid in the womb. The potent drug is supposed to boost the brain's capacity to its full potential. <br/><br/>Lucy's brain cells start multiplying, the axons keep firing on all cylinders and Lucy gains successively greater powers as her brain potential increases form 10, 20, 40, right up 100%. Along the way, Lucy picks up great strength, immunity to pain, powers of regeneration, and, hold your breath, teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy and esp. Down,t know what else I've left out. The whole process of successive levels is flashed on the screen like a tacky video game?<br/><br/>And so Lucy goes about wreaking havoc on her tormentors and other baddies, spilling blood and guts along the way."

"starvb","6","0","7","28 July 2014"," Fun & fast paced but lacking heart
","As the title of this review suggests this is a fun and fast paced flick. I had a good time watching it and time moved fairly quickly while I was watching it, I wouldn't have minded it being longer. The meat of the plot starts off fairly quickly and chugs along at a steady pace throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The idea behind this movie is powerful. The idea of someone unlocking the ability to control the 90% of our minds that we don't consciously use is fascinating and the speculation here is fun. <br/><br/>There are a lot of good action sequences and fun effects that enhance the story as well.<br/><br/>However, as the title of this review suggests, the film does lack heart. There are some moments that hint at heart, they hint at linking the characters in the movie with the audience and making the audience sympathetic. But these are only hints. Even though I was engaged in the story and along for the ride to see where it lead me, I never felt emotionally invested and I never felt connected to the plight of the character Lucy or any of the people she met. The most emotional character in the film was the big baddie Mr. Jang with Professor Norman coming in a close second. Given that these characters are played by Min-sik Choi and Morgan Freeman respectively, that wont be a big surprise. Some could argue that since Lucy was meant to be surpassing ""humanity"" that her emotionlessness could be excused, they forget that some of the great characters in film who inspired emotional response and engagement have not always been ""human"" (I leave it to you to think of them).<br/><br/>One last gripe from me - the plot was fun but there was a sense that Lucy's success and evolution was inevitable from the beginning. At no point after she gained her powers did she meet an adversary she could not best or a situation she could not overcome. I never felt that there was much at stake. So while I had fun watching this the plot was a little flat from beginning to end, couple that with the not so great character development and the emotionlessness of the story and well, it just fell short.<br/><br/>At the end of the day my review comes down to the fact that the characters could have been fleshed out more, their plights could have been more engaging, and the plot would have benefited from some emotion and conflict.<br/><br/>BUT it was new and interesting enough and fun enough that I had a good time watching it."

"prixelderp","6","0","10","27 July 2014"," Gut Reaction Review: Lucy - Not sure I know what to think...
","This was a really weird film.<br/><br/>This movie leaves me in a very weird place. One in which I don't know at all what to think of it. I went into it thinking it would be a fun revenge drama with super powers. Of course, I enjoyed Scarlett's portrayal of Natasha Romanov in the Marvel Studios films, so seeing her play a character similar to that in another movie would be an interesting experience. Which it was.<br/><br/>Then why am I so hesitant to say I liked it or not?<br/><br/>I had just as hard a time trying to figure out what the theme of the film was. Was it survival? Adaptation? Actually, the more I think about it, the more it seems to be humanity is just another animal. More on this later. <br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>The opening scenes were great. This is the part where Johansson shines, and also where you get to see all the range she uses in this movie. Yup. Because it all disappears after that. I mean, it was perhaps necessary considering what the film was trying to do, but we get very little of the emotional human Lucy.</li></ul><br/><br/>Regardless, I felt she was very believable as an unknowing and terrified drug mule. A very good way to work up to a satisfying revenge movie climax. <br/><br/>Which, unfortunately never happens.<br/><br/><ul><li>I really liked the film's use of cutaways to nature, animals, etc. At least at first. </li></ul><br/><br/>Maybe they went a little too long at parts. But when they were appropriate, like when she's being talked into doing the suitcase job, and we see the film cutaway to a mouse approaching a cheese-loaded mousetrap, they work to really to tie into the aforementioned theme of humans as animals.<br/><br/>However I could have used less footage of animals mating and giving live, bloody, disgusting birth. That was quite unnecessary.<br/><br/>Hey... I'm noticing what I like also ends up being something I don't like. Which leads me to...<br/><br/>What I didn't like: - The entire premise. While this may be a movie-killer to some when it comes to the entire premise being flimsy, here it's just a minor annoyance with me. We all know that the whole ""humans only use X% of their brain capacity"" thing has long been discarded. I've decided to kind of sort of let this one go because it's more useful to think of it as them setting the rules of their own universe, rather than actual hard science.<br/><br/>And that's another thing... the science of this universe is really weird. I mean, she just KNOWS stuff even without having a chance to read anything. Is it just generating itself, knowledge I mean? Why is she falling apart? Why do the drugs help her when she takes more? How does she know what she can do before she does them?<br/><br/>And it doesn't extend to the science aspects either... even just some basic human things as well... like, why is she able to walk all the way through a hospital without anyone trying to stop her? Why does Morgan Freeman believe her story right from the get go? Does her being able to video chat with him give him irrevocable proof? How so? Why does her mother show NO REACTION to her daughter's strange and presumably to her out-of-character ramblings about, ""feeling everything?"" Wouldn't someone, especially a knowing the party girl Lucy was, kind of assume that this strange behavior is, I don't know, STRANGE? And perhaps even more important, if she is losing her humanity and the emotions that go with it, why is she (seemingly at first) out for revenge?<br/><br/>Actually, the more I think about it, the more it seems to be on purpose. As the film goes on, the other characters become less and less able to help as she plows through henchman after henchman. This also then makes the idea of the answers to the above questions not making sense... well... make sense. After all, if you're left asking yourself about logic in a universe that is already pretty weird, maybe its like how the humans are less and less capable with relating to Lucy herself.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm just over-thinking things. Maybe it's that.<br/><br/><ul><li>The idea. While Mr. Besson (not only this film's writer/director but also that of Fifth Element, another weird film) may have thought this was a brand new idea, it's really been done before. Yeah, even something as wild as a human evolving into something higher than humanity and therefore becoming less and less relatable has been done on a number of Star Trek episodes and movies, and even with Dr. Manhattan in The Watchmen. And there's something about this idea that always turns me off. If I had known that what I thought was a fun revenge film would turn into a man becomes god story, I'd have probably not even have given it a chance.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The film has no conclusion. Sure, the whole Lucy turning into God thing happened, but it comes out of nowhere, considering where one thinks the film is initially going.</li></ul><br/><br/>Final Thoughts:<br/><br/>For my gut reaction, I would have to say I liked it more than I didn't. The action was great (when we had it), and the opening scene was really strong. While having the premise of it's world be a disproved theory may have been a minor issue at first, the more I think about it, the more I think it was done on purpose to detach us from the world we are watching unfold on-screen. And it's a world I wouldn't mind seeing at least one more time to see if I still think the same way."

","We all know Luc Besson and his style of directing. Lucy had some action in but just not enough for me. It seemed like right when I got comfortable the movie was over. The movie is only 1hr and 28mins but that is plenty of time. Since the movie started out with the plot I thought, ""Great, that means plenty of time for action"", and I feel like it just wasn't enough. Just a tad more would've been fine. But the film is decent. Glad I used my free movie ticket for it though. The fact that it made way more than ""Hercules"" and that film cost over double of ""Lucy"" lets you know something. The rest of this review is just to have enough lines for it to go through."

","This film is hit or miss with audiences. It's a film that from beginning to end bombards the audience with ""science"", when in reality it avoids all attempts at logic or even making sense. It appears to take itself seriously at the same time it comes off as Crank 2 meets the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>That may be where it's charm lies though, it's a stupid movie. As you watch you realize it just doesn't care about making sense, it cares about being very entertaining... which it actually manages to do. The plot, the messages and the characters go from almost believable to ridiculous bit by bit and as all sense of reality falls off the ride gets more and more fun.<br/><br/>So in the end if you're looking for stupid fun, this is probably worth a shot. If you're looking to take the film at face value, take it's ""science"" seriously or even it's message seriously, you'll probably feel insulted something like this exists."
