"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","142","184","17 December 2005"," Now that's what I'm talking about!
","As much clich√© there is on this typical action flick, this was a terrific and fun one to watch! Come on! I mean a 6.3?! People, this was a great movie that kept you on the edge of your seat with some of the greatest actors of our time: Nic Cage, John Malkovich, and John Cusack. The movie though went to Steve Buscemi! He is just becoming one of my favorite actors, but I'll explain later. Con Air is about these prisoners who have taken over an air plane meant to transfer some prisoners to other states and some are actually free. There is one person, Cameron Poe, who wants to stop this maniac, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom played by John M. from destroying these men's lives.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Vince Larkin, a Marshall who believes that Poe is on his side and wants to get this plane down as safely as he can, he does a terrific job, even though his looks aren't what I would've pictured for the part. John M. did a great job on scarring the heck out of me and was a terrific psychotic villain and Nic is so great as an action hero while he ""saves the *beep* day"", he also has this southern accent that is kind of funny but charming. Now, onto Steve who plays Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene, this incredibly intelligent but insane serial killer who gives you a Hannibal the Cannibal vibe. His dialog is incredible and grabs you ""What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to *beep* off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time? Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?"" He's funny in a way that wasn't meant to be funny and he just steals the show. Especially how he was singing ""He's got the whole world in his hands"" at the end when the plane was going crazy. :D <br/><br/>These are remarkable actors, and yes, while the story is predictable and the stunts are over the top, nevertheless, I think anyone can enjoy this film an just have fun. It's a great action flick that deserves a look and a better rating! Come on, let go and have fun. Grab the popcorn, because you're going on a ride! <br/><br/>9/10"
"shino","7","63","80","29 August 2005"," The mad mad mad mad world of violence
","While not as clever or amusing as _The Rock_, which this was apparently an effort to surpass, it certainly delivers the pyrotechnics. Cage, as always, delivers the best performance he can, given the confines of the script, and his best _Raising Arizona_ drawl.<br/><br/>The film's beginning sets a hopeful tone, we see the honorable Cage unjustly imprisoned and preparing to return to his home and the child he has never seen. Meanwhile, the penal system is filling the transport plane which will take Cage to freedom with a cast of the worst criminal psychos behind bars. There is an odd parallel to the beginning of _Stagecoach_ as the plane is loaded with the case of miscreants and a cursory description is given of each criminal. The film has a weakness for hyperbole, each character introduction, each scene, each explosion is meant to top the one before it.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film does have a real ensemble cast, the full roster of villainous character actors: Malkovich, Rhames, Buscemi, Danny Trejo amongst the cons. The law is Cusack and Colm Meaney and Rachel Ticotin (Total Recall). Even Dave Chapelle is amongst the crooks.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film maintains too straight a face during the ruckus. If you are going to ask the audience to accept one outrageous improbability after another, you need to keep it amusing. Chappelle keeps it funny while he's on screen but it's not long enough.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the throttle has only one speed: pedal to the metal. Unlike Woo or McTiernan, who--predictable as they may arguably be--are able to build crescendos and know when to let off the gas, this one keeps on pushing harder and harder until we're feeling a bit catatonic. There is just a terrific amount of pyrotechnics and they use up twice as much powder each time. It never seems to end, which is usually a bad thing for an action movie.<br/><br/>But I shouldn't grouse too much. It is definitely an entertaining diversion, and Cage and Cusack are good in their roles, Colm Meaney is as always amusing. Malkovich and Buscemi are creepy enough but not the flamboyant psychos they could have been. Ironically, Cage has exactly that type of charisma (remember _Kiss of Death_, _Snake Eyes_, _Face Off_) but is forced to be restrain himself as the stolid ex-Army ranger.<br/><br/>Finally: what the HECK does bruckheimer have against Corvettes???"
"gfhrt435","10","57","78","11 November 2006"," Underrated
","John Malkovich gives a ground breaking performance as Cyrus the Virus in this movie and you won't find a similar performance anywhere else. He and John Cusak actually overshadow Nicholas Cage for the most part of this movie. This movie is just filled with so many things that will keep you entertained and amused from start to finish, leave you extremely satisfied and force you to come back and watch the movie all over again. You also wont find such a huge assembly of stars in most other movies either. The same guys wont shy to display their attitudes as well. The story is good and the action is even better. The cinematography and screenplay are also top notch. This movie was a box office hit and I can't understand why its rated so low?"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","48","67","30 July 2003"," The ultimate guy movie!
","Macho's in a non-stop action movie with lot's of explosions. This is ladies and gentlemen; the ultimate guy movie.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with crazy over the top characters such as Pinball, Johnny-23, The Marietta Mangler and Sally-can't-dance. It has some of the best casting in a movie I have ever seen. The actors are all simply perfect for their roles. Especially John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are excellent as always and their characters are the best of the movie even though Buscemi's character wasn't really needed at all. The introduction of the prisoners at the beginning of the movie is completely over the top but I love it! It possibly is one of my favorite scene's in cinema history when we first meet Cyrus the Virus and Diamond Dog, the music really sets the mood in that scene.<br/><br/>Of course the story is not important, it's all about explosions, shootings, fist fights and everything in between. But dislike other action movies ""Con Air"" actually has a story that I like, even though it's completely over the top. Although I think that the movie might had been better of without the Poe's family scene's and storyline, even though I still sort of like the emotional scene's between them. Also I think that Nicholas Cage is a bit too much of a good guy in the movie, not only does he help his friend on board, he even finds time to try and save all the cops their lives and that of the bunny present for his daughter.<br/><br/>A good thing is the excellent soundtrack by Trevor Rabin and Mark Mancina that gives the movie an extra 'cool' feeling.<br/><br/>One little point of critic is that the editing isn't always great. But I can live with that...<br/><br/>Perfect entertainment in a crazy over the top non-stop action movie!

"sme_no_densetsu","7","14","17","10 May 2018"," Entertaining for the most part but also ridiculous at times
","""Con Air"" is a typical Jerry Bruckheimer production of the mid to late 90's, more or less along the same lines as ""The Rock"" & ""Armageddon"". Featuring undemanding action executed by a nicely assembled cast, it's the type of movie that's designed for popcorn munching enjoyment rather than garnering prestigious awards. While that approach can often lead to a fairly hollow & trivial experience, in this case the unique premise sets ""Con Air"" apart from countless other routine action flicks.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a flight containing some of the nation's most notorious criminals who are on their way to a new maximum security detention center. Little do the authorities know that they've plotted to take over the plane and use it to transport themselves to freedom. Luckily for the good guys, a recent parolee who just happens to be a highly decorated Army Ranger is also on board and he's not too keen on letting these guys have their way.<br/><br/>The premise may be fairly high concept but it's an intriguing one. I'd have to say that screenwriter Scott Rosenberg put together a pretty clever plot, even though the last act goes all out in terms of action and, as a result, strays into ludicrousness. There's also quite a bit of memorable dialogue, which is helped immensely by the excellent cast. Nicolas Cage & John Cusack are better than average as the good guys but in my opinion it's the bad guys who really stand out. John Malkovich is always worth watching and here he gives perhaps the movie's best performance as the main villain, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom. His criminal brethren include the likes of Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Dave Chappelle & M.C. Gainey. That's an impressive group in and of itself and it's supplemented by a few other standouts like Colm Meaney & Mykelti Williamson.<br/><br/>The movie's production values are up to snuff as well, which is no surprise considering that this was a summer blockbuster. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination for its sound along with one for the original song ""How Do I Live"" by Trisha Yearwood. In general, the movie shows the trademark quality of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that the movie delivers the goods for most of its running time but I find that the extended finale goes a bit too over the top. I can understand why they'd want to go out with a bang but I found the earlier stages to be more intricately plotted than a typical action movie and, as a result, more rewarding. In any case, the movie is worth watching for having a pretty nifty premise along with some entertaining performances from a nicely assembled cast."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","79","118","20 December 1998"," Best action film of the late 90s
","Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it.<br/><br/>Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.<br/><br/>On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a men on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat.<br/><br/>As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.<br/><br/>Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. Con Air is everything an action film should be.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.<br/><br/>Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare. It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the (sadly incomplete) score CD. And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one.<br/><br/>Superior to both The Rock and Face/Off, Con Air is Nic Cage at his (worst) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer. See it, for the love of God, see it."

","""Con Air"" can best be described as ""The Rock"" in the sky.  The film deals with a Gulf War veteran (Nicolas Cage) who becomes a victim of circumstance and is sentenced to eight years in prison.  He is going home via a gigantic prison plane which is also carrying some very unsavory characters (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi among others).  Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day.  Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters.  4 out of 5 stars."

","Here's my chance to defend my choice of this movie as my all time favorite. John Malkovich plays the ingenious leader of a group of cons who manage to take over a federal airplane during a prisoner transfer. Nic Cage is a good guy, a prisoner who's being flown out to be released. He's got to save the day, because his friend is on board, along with several innocent prison guards. Thwarted at every turn, John Cusack plays a federal marshal who sees Cage as his chance to save the innocent people on board. Jam-packed with one liners and various other lengthier bits of humor, this movie has it all: drama, action, love story, loyalty to friends, and honor. Steve Buscemi and David Chappelle have some of the funniest lines I've ever encountered in a movie and this is one that should be seen if for no other reason than to hear Buscemi explain what 'irony' is."
"MadReviewer","6","110","183","22 May 2001"," A Good Movie That Got Bogged Down With Greed
","`Con Air' more or less defines the term `popcorn movie' ¬ñ it's an action film designed strictly to entertain.  The film's emphasis is on flash, flair, and adrenaline, with a smattering of humor and story spread throughout for good measure.  Not exactly the most lofty of goals, but the desire to entertain is quite sincere, and `Con Air' does largely succeed in the entertainment department.<br/><br/>Where `Con Air' falls apart, however, is the grandiose, grandstanding way in which it tells its story.  Subtlety is a word that is impossible to use in describing this film.  `Con Air' is a firm believer in the concept that more must be better ¬ñ ten explosions must be better than one; three psychotic villains must be better than two; and so on.  The `bigger is better' approach never truly turns the film into an utter mess, but it does bog it down to a certain extent ¬ñ what could've been a fantastic action movie becomes, well, just better than average.  A leaner and meaner `Con Air' could've been a classic.<br/><br/>`Con Air' is the story of good-guy Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), an Army Ranger unjustly tossed in prison for eight long years for protecting his family from a drunken, knife-wielding maniac. Finally paroled, Poe is placed on a converted troop transport plane that will take him home to his family. However, also on board the plane is a roster of psychotic criminals vaguely reminiscent of the Legion of Doom from the old `Superfriends' cartoon. There's Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), an articulate, thoughtful madman with a penchant for automatic weapons; Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a black militant and Cyrus' trusted lieutenant (or so Cyrus thinks, at any rate); Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo), a serial rapist; Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer in the Hannibal Lecter vein who is treated as the resident prison celebrity; and a good half-dozen other colorful characters to flesh out this flying rogues' gallery of nightmare criminals.  Under Cyrus' direction, the criminals take control of the plane, and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day, with some help from good-guy U.S. Marshal Larkin (John Cusack) on the ground, who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.<br/><br/>The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  `Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it, and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However, the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie ¬ñ there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault (although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slow-motion explosion filmed from five different angles, a l√° `The A-Team'), but more a by-product of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments, where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking, but they're filler, and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film ¬ñ story, action scenes, you name it ¬ñ could've easily been excised from the film, and not only would it never be missed, `Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.<br/><br/>
Even the characters, while entertaining, wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog, as played by Ving Rhames, is charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus, John Malkovich is also charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains (and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecter-inspired Garland Green, who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief, but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.)  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes: Cage is good, Cusack is good, but c'mon, pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film, the characters become too much, and wind up becoming pure overkill.<br/><br/>In many ways, `Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire, where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in `Con Air' are surprisingly decent, there's just too many of them. (How many times have you heard that about an action movie?)<br/><br/>Overall, `Con Air' is okay, and if you're in the mood for fun, mindless action, it gets the job done.  Personally, I'd recommend watching `The Rock' instead ¬ñit's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks ¬ñ but  `Con Air', for all its excesses, has its own good moments, too.  Grade: B-"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","53","84","29 July 2004"," Pretty standard stuff, but enjoyable enough
","Con Air is what I've come to expect of a standard Hollywood action flick, nothing more, nothing less. It's got plenty of action, big explosions, one-liners and pure entertainment value. The plot is pretty good, somewhat original, and fairly fast-paced. The acting is good, and the film has a surprisingly large amount of well-known good actors; Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and John Malkovich. They all give good performances, as do most of the supporting actors. The characters are well-written and credible. I found it interesting how most of the characters aren't all black or white in their actions and personalities; many of them have a shade of gray or two. The action is well-done, exciting and intense. The special effects(the few there are) are good enough. The ending may be a little extreme, but it's a good climax, and the good things in the film make up for the bad; granted, there are a few downright lame parts, but there are far more good parts than bad. All in all, everything you'd expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, and nothing else. I recommend it to fans of standard action films. 7/10"

I grew up watching this film as a child and honestly it was my favorite action film and the first one from Nicholas Cage I have ever saw. After seeing Con Air for the first time, I bagged my mom to buy me The Rock and Face/Off along with Con Air on VHS because of Nicholas Cage! I still have all three films on VHS and I also have them on Blu-ray. I don't like Face/Off anymore I have my reasons, but Con Air is a bad ass action film and it is still my favorite action film today that I love to death. I have a blast watching this film.<br/><br/>Plot: Newly paroled ex-con and former U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control.<br/><br/>The film is actually about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) U.S. Ranger who accidentally kills a man in self defense when three goon's try's to kill him. Cameron confesses the crime, but because of his military past, Cameron gets 7 - 10. years maximum prison after years his paroled and only what he want's is to get home to his wife and to his daughter he never saw before. Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the country's most dangerous criminals, who actually take control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin (John Cusack) is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals, including Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich).<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast is great and Nic Cage's Cameron Poe is one of my favorite action heroes of all time. With such lines as ""I'm gonna show you God does exist"" and ""I'm gonna save the f**king day"" you know you're dealing with a Grade A bad ass. He's not without a sensitive side though as he is prone to crying like a girl at some points too. Con Air is directed from Simon West, who directed also The Expendables 2 another film , that I love. <br/><br/>Why I love this movie: You have a solid likable cast that I love, awesome score from Mark Mancina, cool characters, ton's of action, a lot's of explosions, lot's of gun fire and awesome fights, including incredible stunts that I love.

C. Gainey gave us a wonderful action performance in a action film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe is a bad ass action decent hero, that I love him so much. John Cusack as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin is awesome and incredible likable hero in this movie. John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom is a bad ass villain and he is also very brilliant and insane. Colm Meaney as DEA Agent Duncan Malloy is amazing I really love this actor in this film. Mostly I remember Colm from Under Siege who played Dummer William Stranix's (Tommy Lee Jones) second hand, even in Under Siege I loved him as acting performance. I love Colm's character in this movie. Nick Chinlund as William Bedford was awesome I love the fight scenes with Billy and Cameron and Billy says to Cameron ""Die Punk!"" and Cameron kill's him. I love Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, I love his character I don't think his character is dangerous or a serial killer, because on the airport Garland doesn't kill a young girl a child, I think he redeemed him self. Last one that I love is Ving Rhames as Nathan Jones was another bad ass villain.<br/><br/>I love that Cameron is desperately try's to safe his friend's life Mike O'Dell aka Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) and get him out of the plane and he try' to safe Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin) off the plain. He even safe's her on the plain twice when Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) try's to rape her. I love that Baby-O protects Cameron against Cyrus and confess that he is a traitor on a plain, but he wasn't. I love this flick.<br/><br/>There a re a lot of action scenes that I completely love and I have enjoyed them including a explosion's fire truck who explodes in Las Vegas. A lot of gun fights. Cameron using his martial art's skills on a air field, Cameron beating three guys on a plain and force the pilot to land the plain down.

"Robert_duder","9","6","8","18 November 2014"," A breath taking action classic
","Con Air is one of those movies for me that I am certain when I first saw it...it was a ten. A huge flat out ten. It has incredible performances, tons of action, a great story, incredible actors and memorable moments for an action film. It is in a league of its own in the genre and could be considered an action ""epic."" Now I have seen the film dozens of times and I'm entertained by it every time but eventually it does have to wear thin so its dropped down a tiny peg for me and now sits comfortable forever with a solid 9. Con Air is perfect in its simplistic concept. A war hero accidentally kills a man defending himself and his wife, spends many years in prison and when he is moments from being released he inadvertently ends up being the last hope in stopping a group of terrifying ruthless villains. The best thing to come out of Con Air is the characterizations of the villains. There are so many great actors and performances that it would take a skilled film maker to make sure no one gets lost in the shuffle and everyone gets their moment. Ironically I felt watching it this time that the most underdeveloped character is actually the hero himself. We know he's a former soldier, trained to kill, and adores his family. He's soft spoken but steadfast in his morals. Outside of that we don't know a lot about him. Its almost like he's not the focus of the film. Regardless, each scene, each moment, the music, the characters...everything falls together in one of the most entertaining films in this genre.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage was flying high at this point coming from his Oscar win and having a truly epic trilogy of action films in 96/97 with this film, The Rock and Face Off. This was Cage at his best in my books. He is understated but full of strength as Cameron Poe and you just root for this guy because much like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, he is literally in the wrong place at the wrong time and just wants to get home. The rest of the good guys are also very good. John Cusack is terrific as the fast talking Vince Larkin and the scenes towards the end with him and Cage are just awesome. Colm Meaney is also a lot of fun as Duncan Malloy who is constantly at odds with Cusack and ends up being the butt of a lot of...damage. Now how can I talk meaningfully to this incredible cast of villains. First of all John Malkovich as always is stunning. No one does villainy like this guy and his portrayal of Cyrus The Virus is untouchable. He is perfect period. But that doesn't take away from the truly outstanding performances from Ving Rhames, MC Gainey, Dave Chappelle (and I can't stand this guy normally), Nick Chinlund and Danny Trejo. Now some of them have very small parts but Rhames, Chinlund and Gainey are truly fantastic. And then you have in my opinion was the best performance ever from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene. This performance haunts me because he does it so well. He is truly twisted and just gives off this aura that is sick and twisted. Entire films could be based just on his character alone.<br/><br/>This is truly one of those films where everything just works. Director Simon West knows action. He is actually one of my top action director favourites because of films like this The Mechanic and The Expendables 2. I think he just is truly a fan of action films because he seems to have a style in his direction that is reminiscent of classic actioners like Die Hard and Rambo and films like that. There is nothing that you won't find in Con Air if you love the genre. Car chases, air-plane scenes, gun fights, ""cops and robbers"", explosions, crashes, hand to hand combat...this film literally has everything. But the reason it is so great is because it has all that AND amazing performances AND a terrific story too. If you haven't seen this you are truly missing out and if you have its time to watch it again. This is one way you are always guaranteed entertainment. 9.5/10"

","Strap yourselves in, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that ""Con Air"" is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.<br/><br/>Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. ""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.<br/><br/>Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For ""Con Air,"" the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.<br/><br/>Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.<br/><br/>She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.<br/><br/>Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.<br/><br/>
Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.<br/><br/>Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts.I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.<br/><br/>However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.<br/><br/>Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.<br/><br/>Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.<br/><br/>This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance."

"hitchcockthelegend","8","8","12","6 November 2010"," Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I have the only gun on board. Welcome to Con Air.
","Hummingbird Humdinger.<br/><br/>Con Air is directed by Simon West and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and John Malkovich. Plot sees Cameron Poe (Cage), a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter after serving years in prison for manslaughter. He's travelling on a plane full of the most dangerous criminals currently being held in America, they are being transferred to some new super prison. Inevitably something goes wrong and the cons take over the plane, with only Poe standing between them and freedom.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, Con Air is one of the most over the top action film's you are ever likely to see. But it knows it is, it embraces it - and positively revels in it. What we have is a bunch of sicko's and psycho's on a plane, their roll call of crimes as gargantuan as the excess of explosions and quips are. Down on the ground are a frantic John Cussack and an angry Colm Meaney, the play off between the two almost as funny as the shenanigans on the plane - where characters called Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), Cyrus The Virus (Malkovich) & The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) push mania to a new level.<br/><br/>Enter director West, who clearly under orders from Bruckheimer, unleashes a barrage of explosive set pieces, each one more outrageous than the last. It's neatly edited and paced like a good action movie should be. There's also no small amount of tension to sidle along side the white knuckle thrills. As Cage strips down to his Bruce Willis vest we have a real likable hero to get on side with, yes it's played tongue in cheek, very much so, but his character has been so well written by Scott Rosenberg we really forgive the ridiculousness of each heroic act. Also along the for the ride are Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, M.C. Gainey & Rachael Ticotin, the latter of which does admirably well as the lone female surrounded by 800 tonnes of testosterone.<br/><br/>Junky nonsense as a story for sure, but just like the cast are having a blast of a time with it, so too should the discerning action comedy fan. 7.5/10"
"RbDeraj","6","9","14","1 May 2015"," Implausible Action, Mediocre Story, Some Good Acting, and Somewhat Entertaining
","I will start off by saying that I found this movie entertaining despite its vast number of flaws. Stories of innocent wrongly convicted men always seem to interest me for some reason and this had a unique plot that hadn't been done before. The cast was very good, you can't get many more big names than that into one film. Steve Buscemi was perfect in his role of the psychotic yet likable serial killer. My complaints though are more than just a few. First off, the music throughout the entire movie was so out of place and quite comical at times. While I enjoyed the action much of it was completely implausible and most of it degraded into nonstop explosions. A lot of the dialogue seemed rushed in the beginning, and much of the latter was cheesy. Question: Has Nic Cage ever been to the South? I think not. He didn't make the accent believable whatsoever. He reminds me of Tom Hanks attempting to do the same thing, but they both end up sounding like people with slow mental ability. The scene in the end tried to leave the movie on a serious touching note, but it came off so awkwardly. I don't regret watching it but it isn't something that I'll probably ever watch again."
"Leofwine_draca","8","4","5","14 May 2016"," Cheesy action fun
","This rip-roaring, bombastic action adventure is a must for adrenaline-hungry fans: yet be warned, as just because a film is flashy and full of expensive-looking special effects, this doesn't make it an instant classic. While CON AIR will only ever be remembered as an exciting DIE HARD on a plane variant, it's certainly enjoyable enough with a lot of good performances from a nice cast. Taking the lead is Nicolas Cage in a departure from his usual self - here, he's long-haired, sporting muscles and a Bruce Willis vest. Sadly irritating is Cage's southern drawl which grates on the nerves every time he opens his mouth.<br/><br/>John Malkovich plays the hissably evil Cyrus 'the Virus' who singlehandedly plans the airborne escape attempt. Malkovich has some amusing lines to himself and is fun in a comic book way, threatening without ever being frightening or disturbing. A lot of lesser yet still distinguished actors fill out those orange-and-blue uniforms, including PULP FICTION's Ving Rhames as a black writer, the ever-reliable Steve Buscemi (FARGO) on particularly creepy form as a mass murderer who enjoys a sing-song along to ""He's Got the Whole World in his Hands"" - a hilarious scene it has to be said. Also popping up is the evil Danny Trejo (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) as a convict rapist. For the guys on the ground, there's a quiet, intelligent John Cusack running about and being heroic, while Colm Meaney (UNDER SIEGE) puts in a hilarious over the top performance as a pompous DEA officer who spends most of his time ranting, raving and repeatedly swearing.<br/><br/>While most of the action is centred on the plane itself and is expectedly taught, there are precisely two smashing set pieces full of explosions and action galore. The first comes in a firefight between the convicts and the army, set in a deserted scrapyard and is an incredible scene of chaos. The second is the exciting finale which sees the grounded plane forced to land on the Las Vegas strip - and causing all manner of havoc. After this there's another extended chase between two bikes and a fire engine, before all of the main bad guys get their poetic justice.<br/><br/>The running time of this film seems quite long as they manage to pack loads into the running time. In the style of Armageddon, there's enough quick editing to make your eyes water. The music is suitably stirring, while the non-seriousness of the film makes way for some snappy one-liners. CON AIR is generally fun viewing for an uncritical crowd, which does its job and never outstays its welcome. Fun but not very intelligent."
"view_and_review","7","4","5","6 March 2015"," Buckle Up
","Con Air was a simple enough movie in its plot. Some very dangerous criminals are being transported to an Alabama prison via a prison plane. The prisoners had other plans which amounted to hijacking the plane and going to a South American country with a no extradition policy. Poe (Nicolas Cage) wasn't ready to go along with that plan.<br/><br/>This movie was made in Nicolas Cage's heyday. He had come out with Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock, Con Air and Face Off all in a row. All solid movies. Con Air is truly a high octane action movie full of zingers and one-liners. It was pure mindless entertainment¬Ö in a good way. Although I didn't realize it in '97 this movie had quite the all-star lineup. Cage, Malkovich, Cusack, Buscemi, Rhames, Chappelle, Trejo and even Mykelti Williamson who was Bubba Gump.<br/><br/>Forgetting Cage's TERRIBLE southern accent this was his chance to be a real action movie hero. He even got to show off his shredded physique. John Malkovich was excellent. He was made for the ranting psychotic role. And Chappelle was vintage Chappelle¬Ö funny as heck. I count this among the memorable movies of the 90's and definitely one of Cage's better flicks."
"Gideon24","7","4","5","3 March 2015"," A Great Popcorn Movie
","Another one of my favorite popcorn movies was the 1997 action adventure Con Air, a non-stop thriller that moves from jail to the desert to the air to Las Vegas, never allowing the viewer to take a breath.<br/><br/>The film stars Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger who has just been released from prison, who is being sent home via a plane filled with some of the worst criminal offenders on the planet, who finds himself in jeopardy when the criminals actually hijack the plane, thanks to a criminal mastermind named Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and how Poe ends up being a very reluctant hero.<br/><br/>Director Simon West displays a real flare for the action drama and has given us a very likable hero in Cameron Poe (despite a questionable southern accent). <br/><br/>Malkovich brilliantly walks the line between funny and menacing as Cyrus and John Cusack brings his flip screen charisma to the role of Vincent Larkin, a US marshall in charge of the plane. Ving Rhames, MC Gainey, Nick Chinlund, Mykel T Williamson, and Rachel Ticotin offer solid support to one of the most enjoyable action flicks of the 1990's...just hold onto something and watch."
"tburke85","8","4","5","15 June 2009"," Con Air A Well Made Action Adventure With Solid Performances
","Con Air is a well made action adventure with solid performances by the cast including Nicolas Cage, John Cusuak, John Malcovich, Steve Buscemi, and Ving Rhames. Director Simon West does an admirable job of making Con Air giving audiences for the most part what they come to except from these type of movies. Nicolas Cage is excellent as Cameron Poe an ex-con and former ranger who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control. John Cusuak is equally impressive as US Marshal Vince Larkin who joins Cameron in an attempt to stop the dangerous criminals who have taken over the plane. John Malcovich is great as the main villain Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom whose the leader of the criminals. Steve Buscemi is solid as Garlin Greene another psychopath who is brought into the plane in restraints when you first meet him before being set free. Ving Rhames is perfect for Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones one of the dangerous criminals working with Grissom. The rest of the cast including Monica Potter, Dave Chappelle, MC Gainey, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Nick Chinlund, and Colm Meaney are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences, the chases, and explosions are well executed. Despite some flaws with the film juggling too many characters, development, and a rushed finale. Con Air is still an entertaining film with plenty of intense action, some suspense, thrills, and exceptional performances by the cast who make it worth the time to watch."
"LagerLagerLagerShouting","7","4","5","1 May 2008"," Thankyou For Choosing Con Air...
","Con Air is just simply mindless entertainment! The script is full of hard-as-nails characters, each nicely developed to melodramatic point, with Nicholas Cage's con the moral centre. The only exception probably being Steve Buscemi's Ed Gein-esquire Garland Green who offers a slight variation on what we come to expect as your typical lifer con! O.K, so the plot does have a few holes that need filing and the whole thing is pretty unoriginal but the ridiculousness of the premise does call for some suspension of disbelief. It may have been best played tongue-in-cheek but the great-one liners, insane situations, brilliant staged, if overblown action sequences and a great guitar score by Trevor Rabin, still make for a white-knuckle two hours.<br/><br/>7/10"

Nic Cage really got into good shape for this film but his long hair on the neck side was funny. It has good one liners, plenty of actors, awesome action. It can b called one of the best action flick of the late 90s. Nic Cage was really having a good time, Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock, Con Air and Face Off all in a row. All solid movies.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","5","7","21 November 2015"," The stuff that action movie dreams are made of
","Nicolas Cage Week: Day 7<br/><br/>Con Air is as loud and dumb as action movies get, so much so that I'm surprised Michael Bay had nothing to do with it. Instead its helmed by Simon West, with explosive support from producers Jerry Bruckheimer and notoriously bawdy Don Simpson. It's a big sloppy kiss for action movie fans, and a right good time at the movies. In case I get called out for focusing more on Nic's more shallow genre stuff during this week, keep in mind there's one more film that I left out on account of a special video project that myself and a good friend are cooking up this weekend. But I am aware of his artsier stuff like Adaptation as well, just haven't gotten around to them yet. Anyway.. back to Con Air. Cage plays stoic navy SEAL Cameron Poe, who accidentally kills a scumbag (Waingro.. I mean Kevin Gage) who really, really asked for it. He's sent to the clink on manslaughter charges and awaits his return to his wife (Monica Potter‚ô°) and young daughter whose birth he missed. Just his luck though, as the transport plane that is to carry him home at the end of his senteance is also home to the meanest, nastiest, most psychopathic bunch of convicts that US Corrections could dig up, making him pretty nervous. As anyone who's seen the trailer can guess, the inmates take over the plane and all kinds of fiery, high octane hell breaks loose thousands of feet above the ground. Cage is left to contend with the worst of the worst...These guys are really bad. How bad? Danny Trejo stands out as 'Johnny 23', who's got 23 heart tattoos, for each of the women he's raped. ""They'd call me Johnny 600 if they knew the truth"" he sneers. Ugh. Snarling, volatile Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund) slaughtered his wife and her family, even the dog. Hannibal Lecter esque Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi) committed countless atrocities, which he reminisces about like he's ordering lunch. The leader of the pack, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich, hysterical) claims to have killed more people than cancer. It's a trashy, unapologetic flick, but it's endlessly fun as well. Poe races to control the situation, while US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) struggles to get things under control on the ground. There's some impressive sequences, including a desert explosion and lot of bloody antics on the plane. The climax erupts into a massive car chase through downtown Las Vegas that's so incredibly chaotic and ridiculous that one has to admire the filmmakers own commitment to pure reckless abandon lol. The supporting cast is stacked too, including Ving Rhames, Dave Chapelle, Don S. Davis, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Powers Boothe, M.C. Gainey and a priceless turn from a blustery Colm Meaney, getting all the best lines (in reference to Cusack's character ""He's probably recycling his sandals to save the amazon or something""). This is definitely check your brain in at the door territory. Sit back, have a beer and enjoy the near comic book over the top aesthetic of this classic headbanger."
"Theo Robertson","5","13","24","9 February 2004"," Something Is Missing
","CON AIR has a good enough premise to make the audience forget about some rather obvious plot holes like the good guy Cameron Poe getting sent down on a manslaughter charge ( It was self defence and no one in America would be convicted of defending themself especially if it`s a serviceman against a red neck scum bag ) , but there`s something missing from the movie that stops it being a classic action thriller which is a great pity because I do remember seeing the trailers and thinking CON AIR would be worth watching . Ah maybe that`s the problem ? All the good bits are used in the trailers !<br/><br/>
Yup that`s what`s missing - enough substance to make this movie enjoyable for its full duration . In fact when you stop to examine the script it contains next to no substance whatsoever , it`s a simple contrived tale of a good guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time saving the day and watch out for some clumsy scripting where it looks like there`s a traitor amongst the feds and this becomes quickly forgotten about by the end of the film . Nicholas Cage is an under rated actor but I doubt if he has what it takes to be an action movie star ( But after seeing Steven Segal and Jean Claude Van Damme that`s by no means a criticism ) and I found his Elvis Pressley type mannerisms rather grating . Likewise John Malkovich is seriously miscast as the main baddie but I guess Gary Oldman would be a too obvious casting choice and being a Jerry Bruckheimer production the real stars are the explosions and stunt sequences <br/><br/>I wanted to like CON AIR a lot but it`s spoiled by its shallow blockbuster roots"

","Yes, far-fetched, loose, bonkers, ridiculous and knows it for the most part. It's the usual Bruckheimer exploding stuff colored by someone who has known the Coens as simply those quirky guys. Malkovich threatens to kill a bunny. A body falls from the sky, smack dab on normalcy.<br/><br/>But just about its best quality is how pliant.<br/><br/>Just as you might settle for an elaborate hostage situation, we're already wandering about where to land. Just as you might expect a protracted anxiety about the death toll of landing in Vegas, we're already blithely plowing through casinos. It always moves faster through its sets than the equivalent Die Hard movie would, which was the established staple of this type then.<br/><br/>Cage stops just short of channeling his Sailor/HI persona and goes the Bruckheimer route of action hero. But it's still Cage at the time when he was the best possible version of himself, feeling the most comfortable in his skin, cockiness that moves through the whole body."
"rmax304823","Null","2","2","25 January 2003"," A Zany Laff Riot
","SPOILERS.  Aboard a cargo plane filled with madmen and hostages and under fire from Army helicopters, Malkovitch, known as ""Cyrus the Virus"" (cf., ""Hannibal the Cannibal""), grabs a filthy stuffed bunne and holds a pistol against it and shouts, ""Anybody tries anything and the bunny gets it.""  A skinheaded convict, Malkovitch is given the only lines in the movie that sound amusing -- or even meaningful.  ""My proclivities are well known and often lamented in legal lore.""  Well, I suppose others have one or two good lines.  A huge airplane takes off towing a new car in the air behind it. A passenger stares at the flopping thing for a moment and remarks, ""Under other circumstances this might be considered unusual.""<br/><br/>The rest of the dialogue can be thrown out.  The film jumps from one action scene to another.  The proclivities of the writers for one-line wisecracks are as intense as the effects people's (there must be a hundred listed in the credits) proclivities for producing exploding fireballs, usually with someone in the foreground trying to outrun the ballooning flame.  I have a proclivity for turning these kind of flicks off but also a penchant for hanging on in order to see just how vulgar the whole thing can become.  It ends with a wingless airplane landing amidst cars (don't worry; no bystanders are killed) on the Las Vegas strip.  Vulgarity piled upon vulgarity.<br/><br/>But watching this thing also gave me a chance to try to figure out what makes Steve Buscemi what he is.  It's his high, deceptively harmelss-sounding voice, combined with a set of blue eyeballs like a child's agates, and flabby lips behind which there lurks one of the white plastic Dracula false teeth with prominent incisors that belong with a Halloween constume.  Every time he smiles, the viewer shudders.  He's supposed to be some sort of child killer but while his inmade buddies are demolishing hordes of junked cars and offing soldiers, he's sitting at a play table singing hyms with a little girl who somehow manages to survive the party. The director does his best to make us fear for the helpless lamb's welfare, since there are multiple shots of Buscemi leering at her, but nothing happens.  It's as if Frankenstein's monster never threw his playmate into the lake.<br/><br/>Then there is Nick Cage.  He has long convict-type hair in this one, and he's all bulked up and muscular.  Why do actors show such proclivities these days?  In addition to Cage we've seen Charlie Sheen, John Travolta, and of course Sylvester Stallone.  And who knows how many actors tried and gave up out of boredom.  I mean -- can you imagine Jimmy Stewart bulked up?  Or Gary Cooper with Schwarzenegger's physique?<br/><br/>John Cusack has a thankless role.  He is to Nick Cage's ex-Ranger inmate as, say, Alec Baldwin was to Sean Connery's Russian submarine skipper in ""The Hunt for Red October.""  The succulent Monica Potter might as well be elsewhere.  Rachel Ticotin is one of the good people, locked in a cage aboard the hijacked aircraft, constantly in jeopardy.  Rape always lurks ominously in the background when your captors are a bunch of dim-witted libidinous thugs -- except for one Hispanic transvestite who, come to think of it, doesn't look too bad in short skirts.  At any rate, he looks better as a woman than Hillary Swank looked as a man.<br/><br/>The editing is so poor that the action during the action scenes, meaning almost the entire movie, can't really be followed.  We lose track of who's where, of who's doing what to whom, of what machine that particular chunk of falling metal belongs to, of where the smoke is coming from, of what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>Not that it matters much.  The violence is a Ding an Sich.  The plot is too full of holes to really bother describing.  I'll mention one puzzler.  The huge cargo plane lands at a deserted airport but the pilot loses control and the monstrous cumbersome thing plows off the runway through mountains of desert sand and decapitates a couple of shacks along the way.  How are you going to get it to fly again?  You get the convicts together tugging on ropes, pull the airplane out of the hole it's dug for itself, start it up and fly it away, that's how.<br/><br/>It's impossible to take this in the least bit seriously without doing yourself a big disfavor.  It's the kind of movie in which, when the airplane is finally finished careering down the strip, demolishing every grotesque neon sign in sight and smashing into one of the casinos, it comes to rest with its radar bulb just barely nudging a slot machine, which then rings up 3 sevens and ejaculates a bucketfull of coins.  It's amusing at that level all the way through, beginning with the punny title.  I can't honestly say this movie is enjoyable, but it's fascinating, watching things sink as low as they possibly can."

"schroeder-gustavo","8","3","4","16 August 2015"," This movie sucks...but it's awesome!
","Con Air is probably the most over the top action movie I have ever seen. It has so many one liners and Nicolas Cage with long hair and speaking in a terrible but hilarious southern accent. That being said, I love this movie for all the wrong reasons probably. It's almost like you're watching a spoof on other action movies, being extremely dumb and over the top. <br/><br/>Surprisingly though, Steve Buscemi pulls off an amazing performance. It's almost like he didn't even belong in this movie. Ving Rhames and John Malkovich are also pretty good.<br/><br/>I don't think Con Air is a great movie. In fact, I don't think it's even a good movie. As a matter of fact I think it's terrible, with dumb dialogue, way too many explosions and one liners for its own good and Nicolas Cage overacting at its best. But it's hilarious, it's awesome. If you like 90's action movies like Broken Arrow, definitely check out Con Air if you haven't."
"jcbutthead86","10","3","4","16 April 2015"," An Excellent,Action-Packed And Explosive Action-Thriller. Nicolas Cage And Jerry Bruckheimer At Their Best.
","Con Air is an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a wonderful all-star cast,outstanding Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Con Air not only one of my favorite Action Films but also of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Nicolas Cage and Jerry Bruckheimer at their best.<br/><br/>Con Air tells the story of United States Army Ranger Cameron Poe(Nicolas Cage)who after serving 8 years in prison for manslaughter is getting out on parole and going home to his wife and daughter and to get home he has to board a plane that transfers prisoners. Unfortunately for Cameron the plane is taken over by convict Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom(John Malkovich)and other prisoners. Now,Cameron with the help of U.S Marshall Vince Larkin(John Cusack) has to stop Cyrus save the say and get home to see his family.<br/><br/>Con Air is a brilliant and exciting Action movie that was a Box Office hit in 1997 and is a film that I have loved ever since I saw it on Home Video during the late 1990s and in my opinion is not only one of the most enjoyable,watchable and defining Action movies of the 1990s but also one of the Nicolas Cage's and Jerry Bruckheimer's finest hours on the silver screen and is a big budget spectacle that is explosive as it is thrilling and is the true definition of a roller coaster ride that you just never want to end. Ranking alongside with The Rock(1996),Bad Boys(1995),Crimson Tide(1995),Enemy Of The State(1998),Black Hawk Down(2001),Top Gun(1986),Beverly Hills Cop I(1984 and II(1987)and Flashdance(1983)Con Air is one of the best productions from Jerry Bruckheimer. Con Air is one of those movies that whenever it's on television you just never turn it off and just gives viewers non-stop thrills and entertainment from start to finish and is the kind of movie you watch with a drink and popcorn. Con Air is a movie that is just re-watchable no matter how many times you watch it. This is a movie that has everything I love about Action films:great Action,memorable characters and great lines that are catchy all within a Die Hard type storyline with a very good twist,instead of terrorists taking over building it's prisoners taking over a plane. Another thing I also love about Con Air is that the movie never takes itself too seriously because it's a movie that is big,loud and over the top meaning that the film isn't going to win any Oscars,get tons of acclaim from major film critics or give viewers thought provoking story that is important,it's an Action movie for Action lovers. The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously because of the Humor thanks to the main and supporting characters(some who are straight forward and others who are weird and nutty)and with moments and scenes of wildness and fun. The Action scenes in Con Air are amazing,fast and intense and when you see the Action you don't want it to stop. There is tons of Action and more with gunfights,fist fights,explosions and heck there's even a car chase sequence and each of the Action scenes are big,in your face and done in Jerry Bruckheimer's style of quick and slow motion because like in any Jerry Bruckheimer production everything is far and beyond it's limits and the pace goes from 5 to 100 in seconds. The Action scenes will have Action fans glued to the screen and craving for more. The main character Cameron Poe is the tradition Action hero he's a one-man Army who is strong willed using his fists as well as his brains and can kick anyone's butt in the entire film but he's does it for a reason and that is to get home and see his wife and daughter. You also like Cameron because of his honor and loyalty to not only people but to certain principles and ideals that is true to his nature. You will root for Cameron Poe to survive and beat the bad guys. The ending of Con Air is outstanding and is filled with terrific Action and thrills that will have you cheering at the screen. A wonderful conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Nicolas Cage is excellent and at his best as Cameron Poe,with Cage kicking butt with a Southern accent and mullet. John Cusack is terrific as Vince Larkin,a U.S Marshall. John Malkovich is brilliant and at his best as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom,one of my favorite Action movie villains with Malkovich being charismatic and evil. Steve Buscemi is delightful as Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene,a serial killer. Ving Rhames is great as Nathan 'Diamond Dog',Cyrus' partner in crime. Colm Meaney is wonderful as Duncan Malloy,a DEA Agent. Rachel Ticotin(Guard Sally Bishop),Mykelti Williamson(Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell),Danny Trejo(Johnny-23),Nick Chinlund(William Billy Bedlam Bedford),M.C Gainey(Swamp Thing),Dave Chapelle(Joe Pinball Parker),Monica Potter(Tricia Poe),Renoly(Sally Can't Dance),Jesse Borrergo(Francisco Cindino),Steve Easton(Guard Falzon),Jose Zuniga(DEA Agent Willie Sims)John Roelius(Skip),Angela Featherstone(Ginny),Landry Albright(Casey Poe)and more give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Simon West is fantastic,with West bringing an energetic style and pace to the film while doing an incredible job with the Action scenes. Fine direction,West. There is also songs by Tricia Yearwood(How Do I Live)and the classic song by Lynyrd Skynyrd(Sweet Home Alabama).<br/><br/>The score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin is great,big and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Nice score,Mancina and Rabin.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Action Films,Nicolas Cage or Jerry Bruckheimer,I highly suggest you see Con Air,an excellent,Action-packed and explosive Action-Thriller that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"vip_ebriega","7","3","4","3 October 2009"," We've seen it before, and just the way I like it.
","My Take: An action-packed guilty pleasure action movie loaded with thrills.<br/><br/>Try DIE HARD meets AIRPORT with several elements borrowed from FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DELTA FORCE and SPEED and you got the idea behind CON AIR, a completely implausible but nonetheless entertaining action adventure team-up with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Simon West (in his directorial debut). It's not exactly art, but then again that may guarantee that's pure not-to-be-taken-seriously fun.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the hijacking of a prisoner transport plane by one of the nastiest criminals on the planet, led by Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich). The rest of the passengers read like a who's who of the criminally insane, like the cast of AIRPORT in hell. We have black militant leader (played by Ving Rhames), a Hannibal Lecter-like psychopath (Steve Buscemi), a rapist (Danny Trejo), a loudmouthed black stereotype/comic relief (Dave Chapelle) and down to a transvestite inmate and all mass murderers as far as the eye could see. Back on the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) must rely on paroled ex-convict Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) to cease control of the plane. With already such a cast, I was expecting George Kennedy to show up somewhere.<br/><br/>Part of the fun is seeing who the movie plays with several clich√©s of the genre. The clich√©s are age-old, some dating back to the days of AIRPORT with such a big all star cast (but this time, mostly with character actors). At some point, Cusack tells Cage that ""he's at the wrong place at the wrong time"", which will immediately remind anyone of DIE HARD. CON AIR is not exactly strong with plot, with an ending in Las Vegas that could only be described as implausible. (Plus, after all the action, the movie even has time for Trisha Yearwood to warble the theme song ""How Do I Live"") Not that it matters, the whole film is not exactly art but it's loads of fun, and I'd be damned if I say I wasn't entertained.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"zardoz-13","8","3","4","3 August 2009"," Leave the Bunny Alone!
","Summer action movies for adult males celebrate those macho virtues that red-blooded, he-men cherish. British director Simon West's ""Con-Air"" (*** out of ****), teaming Nicolas Cage with John Cusack, sizzles as a high flying take-off on all those vintage ""Airport"" movies, but the passengers here are convicts who skyjack their transport for a rendezvous in the desert with Colombian drug smugglers. At the heart of this superficial but stimulating action movie lies a less than subtle Hollywood commentary on what a macho man must do to conform to society.<br/><br/>In ""Con-Air,"" Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former U.S. Army Ranger who pulls a stretch in prison for killing a knife-wielding drunkard in a brawl over his wife. Before Poe can recover, the villain's pals scoop up the knife, scram, and leave our hero to take the rap. Because Poe's Ranger training qualifies him as a lethal weapon, the court sentences him to eight years in a federal lock-up. While he is incarnated, Poe's pretty young wife Tricia (Monica Potter) has given birth to an adorable baby girl. In the second quarter-hour of ""Con-Air,"" Poe and his cut little daughter exchange amusing letters. During this interval, Poe matures enough so that his exemplary behavior wins him a parole.<br/><br/>A short plane ride is the last obstacle between Poe and his freedom. Prison officials pile him onto a cargo plane with an all-star line-up of psychopathic murderers, among them Cyrus 'the Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich of ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction""), a vicious black militant. A clean-cut, sandal-shod U.S. Marshal named Vince Larkin (John Cusack of ""Grosse Point Blank"") officiates the transfer. The plot thickens when abrasive D.E.A. agent Duncan Molloy (Colm Meaney of ""TV's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") wins permission to smuggle a trigger-happy undercover agent on board to cajole information out of a Colombian drug lord's son. Once they're airborne, the convicts stage an ingenious jail break; ice the D.E.A. agent, and commander the plane. Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin of ""Total Recall""), then acts as an insider for Larkin. Meanwhile, Larkin clashes with Molloy who aims to avenge his dead agent by blowing the plane to smithereens! ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" scenarist Scott Rosenberg has contrived this hard-fisted hokum that excites and entertains even though it is hopeless predictable from fade-in to fade-out. ""Con-Air"" spends most of its two-hour running time in the air instead of behind bars. The early prison scenes establish Poe's friendship with a diabetic black prisoner named Mike Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson of ""Waiting to Exhale""). The filmmakers have carefully balanced good African-Americans with bad African-Americans so as to avoid charges of racism. Rosenberg has penned some catchy dialogue that serves the dual purpose of foreshadowing the action and sounding quite quotable. Nothing happens in ""Con-Air"" that is not set up far in advance, so the movie never pulls any unfair tricks on its audience. Moreover, the characters spout dialogue about their predicaments that never leave any doubt for the audience about the destination of the action.<br/><br/>Freshman director Simon West and Rosenberg endow Poe with such heroic qualities that it is difficult to believe that any court could have sent a man of his caliber up the river. After all, he is a Gulf War veteran who has just come home to his gorgeous young wife pregnant with a baby girl. Furthermore, the filmmakers hammer home Poe's Ranger's credo: no matter what the dangers, U.S. Rangers never abandon their comrades. When Poe has a chance to leave the plane, he sticks around instead to save the day. What ""Con-Air"" lacks in credibility, it compensates for with its diversity of colorful characters and its pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>Wearing scruffy shoulder length hair and flexing sculpted biceps, Nicolas Cage resembles Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo"" as he thwarts his opponents. Cage's syrupy Alabama accent gets a little thick on occasion, but he registers as a respectable enough hero. John Cusack excels in his first dramatic action role. Before ""Con-Air"" crashes to a halt, Cusack's U.S. Marshal Larkin has been scorched, slugged unconscious, and nearly killed. As a sneering, egotistical D.E.A. agent, Colm Meaney is so convincing that you want to shoot him yourself.<br/><br/>The filmmakers have assembled some really grisly looking actors as the convicts. These bad guys emerge as a truly venomous bunch that richly deserve their inevitable comeuppance. John Malkovich impersonates a character here who is just as despicable and cunning as the assassin that he played in the Clint Eastwood thriller ""In the Line of Fire."" Malkovich's predatory, bald villain boasts that he has slain more men than cancer. As his henchman, Ving Rhames is equally as nefarious. Danny Trejo of ""Desperado"" fame creates a chilling portrait of lust run amok as a rapist named Johnny 23 with twenty-three hearts tattooed on his beefy forearm to represent his unfortunate rape victims.<br/><br/>West keeps the action stirred up to such a whirlwind pace that its far-fetched elements don't detract from the excitement. ""Con-Air"" is West's big-screen movie debut and he displays a lot of promise as an action director. His action scenes ripple with adrenaline, especially the plane hijacking, an ambush in a derelict airplane scrap heap, and a rousing finale in Las Vegas. The explosive music of Mark Mancina and former ""Yes"" musician Trevor Rabin considerably enhances each of these slam-bang scenes. ""Yes"" rock music fans will recognize those distinctive, throbbing Rabin chords that punctuate the action.<br/><br/>Nobody should imitate ""Con-Air"" or take its woefully exaggerated carnival of snap, crackle, pop violence seriously. Characters get shot, stabled, and dismembered beyond anything an ordinary individual cold take, but then this clever, slickly-packaged fantasy pokes as much fun at itself as at its audiences. One amusing scene involves the destruction of a classic sports car. Another features Cage battling with another convict because he refuses to head Poe's warning to ""leave the bunny alone.'"

John Malkovich steals the show as always in this badass performance. Monica Potter is super sexy and cute at the same time; how does it works?

","Actually, it's a pretty dumb action movie. Many things in this film didn't make enough sense, the leader of inmates looked tough, but he also was very naive. So why did I rate this movie 10/10? Because it was highly entertaining action movie, that's why. Like I said many things didn't made enough sense, but that's not important when it has so many great action sequences (most of them were in the second half of the movie). The direction was great. I heard positive and negative responses about Simon West, but after watching this movie, I realised what a great director he actually is. And if that's not enough, this movie has some of the coolest fictional inmates. There were many colorful characters, but my favorite was Steve Buscemi's character."

","Hands down one of my favorite movies, that doesn't make me think but has enough action and plot to keep me watching, and watching.<br/><br/>Not one of Nicolas Cage's best performances, but he is the same actor in almost everyone movie he is in, his voice never changes, and neither do his expressions. However, he is nonetheless one of the main, and key characters in this action flick.<br/><br/>John Cusack, actually, one of John's best acting performances, really I haven't seen a great John Cusack movie ever, however, with these set of actors he actually puts on a very suspenseful drama induced part, of an FBI agent.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi, he adds to the motley crew of killers and rapists that all happen to be on this airplane. He is in fact a very smart and intellectual killer, but he is said to be psychotic.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so great is its simplicity, yet complexity. It's a very simple theme, however, the cast of characters that were casted for this movie is just so diverse that it makes this simplistic theme a drama ridden tale.<br/><br/>After watching this movie you sadly won't be any smarter, or no anything more about the world. However, you will be throughly amused and delighted. Unlike many of the great ""thinking"" movies of the last decade, this movie plays on it's use of great acting, and average story to produce a wonderful, and likable movie."
"poolandrews","8","3","4","15 October 2007"," ""I was going to get a hair cut."" No expense spared 90's blockbuster action flick.
","Con Air starts as US Ranger & wrongly convicted killer Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) boards a prisoner transport plane for a routine transfer back home to Alabama to be released on parole after several years in jail. Also on-board are some of the country's most dangerous inmates who are being transfered to a new state of the art prison in Alabama including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich), Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames) & William 'Billy Bedlam' Bedford (Nick Chinlund) who through careful planning have set up an elaborate scheme to hijack the plane & make a break for freedom. The plan works to perfection & they gain control of the plane, however in the struggle Poe's best friends syringe is broken & he cannot inject himself with the insulin he needs to stay alive & Poe refuses to leave him. Not only does Poe decide to stay & help his friend he sets about grounding the plane & sending the likes of Cyrus back to jail where they belong...<br/><br/>Directed by Simon West this mega budget no expense spared action flick produced by Jerry Bruckheimer is as good as huge overblown excessive Hollywood action flicks come. I should say at this point like many Hollywood films Con Air is available in both it's original theatrical cut & the obligatory 'Extended Unrated Director's Cut' just so the studio can milk more money out of the fans, I have never seen the extended version (these days I flat refuse to spend yet more money on what is essentially the same film) & will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical cut. The script by Scott Rosenberg was apparently inspired by newspaper article about a plane that transports prisoners & from such humble meagre beginnings one of the most downright entertaining big budget action spectacles of the 90's arose. I admit it right now, I love this film & have seen it multiple times & enjoy it immensely on each occasion. The thing moves like an absolute rocket, sometimes it moves a little too fast & the numerous over-the-top action set-pieces come thick & fast. Would fans of the genre have it any other way? Sure there's plot holes & it's highly unlikely half the things featured in Con Air would be achievable in real life but this isn't real life is it? No, it's an unashamed, highly entertaining action flick & if you treat it as such you'll have an absolute blast watching it. I thought the character's were fun & distinctive, there are some great one-liners & it's a tight, simple yet effective story.<br/><br/>Director West does a fine job, the explosions are huge, the stunts are suitably spectacular, there are car chases, plane chases, fights, shoot-outs & some nice satisfying violence too. It's all here. The action scenes are brisk & well choreographed with plenty of big bangs for the money. I loved the climax as well as the plane landing in Vegas & the subsequent motorbike/fire truck chase. There really isn't anything negative I can say about Con Air, I just thought it was a top film that does, what it sets out to do, perfectly.<br/><br/>With a budget of around $75,000,000 (it took about $25,000,000 during it's opening weekend) you can definitely see a large chunk of that on screen with all the action & explosions. There's a great cast including Cage, Malkovich, Rhames, the creepy yet always funny Steve Buscemi, John Cusack & Colm Meaney. Everyone put in good over-the-top performances such as the material demands.<br/><br/>Con Air is one of the quintessential action flicks of the 90's, it's absolutely great & has everything you could hope for including big bangs, flashy cars getting trashed, fights, shoot-outs, big name actors having fun & funny one-liners. Those looking for something deep or meaningful may want to give Con Air a miss but this is essential viewing for action film fans who wouldn't have it any other way."

","The only reason I didn't give this 10 was because of the lack of female stars but then what do you expect from a movie about a bunch of prisoners on a aeroplane? the thing that amazed me about this film is that it is essentially a prison movie but they manage to fit a car chase and a shoot out. this film made me a John Malkovich fan and he has some of the greatest one liners in any movie. John Cusack is possibly one of the most underrated actors anywhere and Nicolas Cage does what he does best, plays a good guy with a wicked sense of humour. with supporting roles for two truly great actors, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi this film works on every level."

Cyrus is played brilliantly by the menacing John Malkovich, and he makes the character appear truly evil, down to his cold eyes.  This is the sort of role he excels at.<br/><br/>There is also an appearance by Steve Buscemi as the Marietta Mangler, a serial killer who first appears in the film strapped to a chair with a mask, a la Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is also good as a very honourable guy who just wants to get home to his wife and child, but not at the expense of his fellow prisoners.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching many times - its entertaining, sometimes funny and altogether brilliant!"

","Like Face / Off, Con Air works best when you don't think too hard about what you are watching, though it must be said that the first 2/3 of the film are pretty good ‚Äì if formulaic.<br/><br/>Nic Cage is returned serviceman Cameron Poe, home to see his pregnant wife who works as a waitress, after a spell away ‚Äì the fact that his wife is pregnant means he was either stationed for far less than 9 months (she wasn't even ""showing"" upon his return) or that perhaps he might have cause to wonder how she picks up her tips¬Ö In any case on the first night some local hicks poke fun at Poe, then confront him in the car park where a fight breaks out. In dispatching his three assailants Poe accidentally kills one of them, leading to a trial and a sentence of 7 ‚Äì 10 years.<br/><br/>Welcome home.<br/><br/>Poe ends up serving 8 years and is due for parole. While behind bars he wiles away the time improving himself, working out, writing hokey letters to wife and daughter and growing a bad-ass redneck mullet ‚Äì according to the montage we are shown anyway.<br/><br/>If that wasn't ""Awww shucks"" enough his day of release coincides with his daughter's birthday, and seeing Poe didn't want his daughter to see him in a cage this will be their first meeting.<br/><br/>Don't worry I'm sure there will be absolutely no hiccups.<br/><br/>Poe is scheduled to board a plane that will take him home to be released, only it happens to also be transporting some of the most seriously deranged and violent criminals to a newly created facility to house ""the worst of the worst"". This gives Vince Larkin (John Cusack) good reason to list the various body counts and worst aspects of the inmates, who have names like Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Pinball (Dave Chappelle), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and Cyrus ""the Virus"" (John Malkovich).<br/><br/>As a special matter a Drug Enforcement Agency operative will be boarding undercover as a prisoner to try to uncover information from one of the inmates ‚Äì this is at the behest of the DEA boss Molloy (Colm Meaney), though in reality Molloy's character only exists to provide friction between he and Larkin, and to make bad decisions to allow Larkin to fix them in heroic fashion.<br/><br/>Once aboard it takes all of 14 seconds for the locked up criminals to undo months of prevention and security planning and take over the plane. The only thing between them and freedom is a routine stop to drop off and pick up more inmates (including meek looking mass-murderer Garland Green who gets the full Hannibal Lector treatment) if all goes according to plan they are then on the way to freedom.<br/><br/>This stop necessitates the drop of some inmates. Now the ideal scenario would see Poe volunteer to leave the plane, thus removing himself from the situation so he can make his release in time and see his family, but¬Ö Because Poe isn't really a criminal ‚Äì after all he only killed one little guy with his bare hands! ‚Äì and as his buddy on the plane is diabetic and there is a female guard (Rachel Ticotin) that he worries about, he chooses to stay aboard.<br/><br/>To this point the film was only very far-fetched, now however the fun starts and the film loses whatever fragile grip on reality that it previously enjoyed, devolving into a mess of plot-holes and one ""REALLY?"" moment after another.<br/><br/>Shortly after the plane once again takes off the good guys on the ground realise that they are no longer in control of matters. Might I point out though that no-one seems to have a radar to see the plane, they only follow the transponder that was once in the plane ‚Äì seeing as how satellites can now read the numbers on our mailboxes from space I feel that their inability to locate the real plane was baffling. (I know this was over a decade ago but I know they had pretty good radar equipment even back then!) Anyway in between the gun battles, explosions and macho talk that includes some gems as:<br/><br/>""I said, put the bunny back in the box!"" ¬Öand<br/><br/>""I drove through three states wearing her head as a hat."" John Malkovich lends credibility and genuine menace as Cyrus the Virus and John Cusack tries in vain to make the Larkin character work as the voice of reason, though if you consider most of his arguments with Molloy and his own boss his suggestions and protests are often plain wrong.<br/><br/>There is a creepy ""Well did he"" subplot involving a young girl which seemed unnecessary in a mindless shoot 'em up and the longer the movie goes the more ludicrous and laughable it all becomes.<br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 5.5 / 10. Another ""don't think"" film, if you just enjoy the pretty explosions then Con Air has a couple moments, not enough to suggest that you seek it out unless you want a good movie for a drinking game."

","What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in ""Total Recall"" and far better action scenes in ""First Blood"" than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch ""Fargo"" or something.<br/><br/>A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!"
"PeterKurten911","9","9","20","19 June 2004"," Perfect if it wasn't for Cage
","My TV guide insists on granting ""Con Air"" a single star, whereas ""The Rock"" usually receives three. While the two of them have a lot in common. They use the same combination of Nicolas Cage teamed up with another major name and state-of-the-art action sequences in order to deliver a roller-coaster action thriller against an original background. <br/><br/>But i'm here to discuss ""Con Air"" in its own integrity. During several screenings i started to make an explicit distinction between the elements that work and the aspects which probably upset the critic community.<br/><br/>The principal cast mostly gives away a good performance : John Malkovich is due to his voice & eyes the perfect choice to bring Cyrys Grissom to live. It was one of the few times i would nominate an actor as the new Anthony 'Zorba' Quinn. Next, Ving Rhames' portrayal of a black militant seems more convincing than the decent, but rather soulless roles of Nick Chinlund Danny Trejo - whose characters get a little more attention than most of the convicts. On the other side of the law, John Cusack found himself an appealing equilibrium between the rookie and the sidekick approach. Steve Buscemi is a man apart. Although basically he has little more to do that put his teeth and tiny humid eyes to work to play the greatest psycho of them all, Garland Greene wouldn't have been the same without Buscemi's dry sense of humour. He is a relief - well, measured by the standards of action movie humour. For example, his comments on insanity & idiocy have the class of a Trainspotting voice-over. <br/><br/>As for the action, there are some memorable moments : the breakout, the trap at the deserted airfield and the firetruck chase in Vegas really brought out the merciless insanity connected to the convicts on the Jailbird. The other sequences may not be as good, but keep up a rapid, steady pace. So far, we have a more than average action flick which is enriched by its cast. Then where lie weak points ? <br/><br/>Number On : Nicolas Cage !! It is a complicated matter which is best explained through another comparison with the Rock : both times he played a sensitive hero, making good use of his personal charisma, but the emotional background Scott Rosenberg came up with for Con Air feel like a lame excuse to put a likable one-man army on screen. Apart from that, his haircut and smoky BBC accent annoyed me immensely. Number two : that stupid diabetic sidekick of his was merely another twist of the script to make us connect with Cameron Poe. I did not give a damn whether he'd succumb to an insulin shortage or take one between the eyes like the three stooges aka Carl, Bensen & Popovich. <br/><br/>Number three ... you've got to have some Elvis Presley or Tom Jones on the soundtrack when you take a trip to Vegas, though Buscemi's attachment to Sweet Home Alabama largely make up for it :-)"
"stdaganov","1","12","29","30 September 2005"," The most classic anti-example
","This film is the most classic anti-example of a movie, ever created in the history of the world's ""drive"" towards artistic perfection. Obviously from time to time the searches and the aspirations to get to this perfection can lead to a disaster so ""perfect"", that in it you cannot find anything... GOOD, actually - even if you search with subatomic microscope. ""Con Air"" has achieved this ""perfection"" to the full, but multiplied by minus one.<br/><br/>And yet, you cannot create a nice and decent film only by doing the opposite to what the script-writers, the director, the actors and the producers of ""Con Air"" did. You cannot do it simply by multiplying with (-1). Cause there is one thing in ""Con Air"", which equals zero: and it is the plot - the vision, the ideas, the messages, which every movie has to have. And as it has no plot and no reasoning, apart from the wish of the its makers to show us unimaginably ridiculous pile of crap that they intended to label ""an action movie for fun"", you see the point: when you multiply anything by zero, you will get zero again.<br/><br/>The conclusion is clear: you cannot make a film without a core, and the core of every film is some kind of an noticeable idea. Only the comedies (and not all of them) are excused of that need, but then it has to be replaced by a continuous number of really good jokes, tricks and comic situations. Take ""Blue streak"" as an example: what it would be without the lost diamond, or without the main character being black? Only some stupid chases and shootings will remain. But how he tried to retrieve the diamond, and the comic situations that came from it - this is enough to create a good, fun action movie. Just don't take it seriously, when you lack the big idea to tell!<br/><br/>The idea is indispensable for a serious movie - so if you don't have what to say to the world, you will never make even the slightest kind of a good non-comedy movie - even with a billion dollar budget at your disposal. In this case - depending on what your social status is - better go wash dishes, or continue to drive your daddy's $200,000 jeep, that he gave you for your birthday. While if you have a good idea and you don't want to spoil it tragically, watch ""Con Air"", and watch it at least 20 times, and oblige everybody from your future film-making team to watch it, cause there - in the most vivid, noticeable and ""classic"" way - it is shown HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE. It can also be used as a certain kind of ""barometer"": whoever has actually liked it and didn't find how shallow and silly it is, is himself exceptionally stupid. To be more specific, he is more stupid than one hundred thousand sitting ducks, staring at a ticking bomb right in front of them.<br/><br/>This film has in it - in compacted and very accessible form - EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO AVOID, when you make a movie. The idiotic dialogues; the terribly overexposed, mostly misplaced and pointless effects; the obvious physical impossibility of so many scenes that were supposed to be ""for real""; the irritating, horrible acting of so many of the cast - who probably were contesting for the ""Triple worst actor"" Golden Raspberry awards; the infinite clich√©s - especially this about the innocent convict, who not only has to beat the bad guys, but also the police, the government and the military, which, of course, are not aware of the situation, so unwillingly help the bad ones and handicap the hero - yet he will overcome the difficulties (or rather - the impossibilities) and prevail in the end - and they will arrive only to witness the spoils of his smashing victory, to shake his hand and to apologize that they almost killed him (I'm not sure if ""the-authority-shakes-hands-and-thanks-the-hero-for-the-good-job"" scene was in the film, but in the last minutes it had turned into such an omnipotent mess, that my head turned into a pumpkin); and on top of it - the serial child killer, who happened to be so nice person: this almost brought me to tears; and so many more - from beginning to end, embroidered in every second of this movie disaster... I actually can't count them all, without breaching the 1000 words limit.<br/><br/>Despite all said above, from an ironical point of view ""Con Air"" has a value. I gave it the lowest possible rating, because it was the worst movie ever created, but I also have written this comment about it. There are worse films than ""Con Air"", but they are so unnoticeable, they cannot earn even that ""label"" - ""THE WORST MOVIE"" - as not only me, but nobody would ever watch them. While this one had a relatively prominent cast, Nicolas Cage in first place, and I kept watching it to find how bad it will go, and to see the disaster from the whole perspective. It caught my attention with its HORRIBLE, YET CLASSICAL WEAKNESSES. And what about the actors? What they played is always played by total ""beginners"", not by career actors, and as they are totally unknown, nobody notices the movie also. Yet these ones were moderately well-known in Hollywood, I think. We have to pay them a tribute: they destroyed - if not their careers - at least their reputation, in order to give us this classic anti-example of a movie.<br/><br/>It is the most vivid, conspicuous film that you have to watch in order to find what kind of films you must never watch."

","This film is slightly based on true air travels made to transfer convicted criminals. I think I don't need to say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa plane full of chains and bars, with criminals traveling like caged beasts, is pure fiction. Despite having a good cast and some regular action scenes, this film has a very poor quality. The script, written by Scott Rosenberg, is too unrealistic and implausible, starting with the totally stupid idea to fill a plane with crazy killers (one wearing a mask out of ""Silence of the Lambs""), side by side with an arsenal of light weapons and fatty policeman full of donuts. This scenario could only end badly, making the hijacking too predictable. I don't understand how the police had so much difficulty in tracking the airplane with so many locators and covert surveillance devices available in that days, on the service of the writers and the director, Simon West. Starting from there, the film only gets worse, with a huge circus of unlikely and unbelievable scenes. The end is worthy of the Razzie Award that this film won.<br/><br/>The film has a good cast led by Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich and John Cusack. Also participating, among others, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Renoly Santiago and Dave Chappelle. Nevertheless, none of the characters was particularly interesting with the exception of John Malkovich, who gave his Cyrus all the required malice and wickedness without allowing himself to explore a little more his evil. Some of the characters tries, mainly through dialogue, rehearse a few moments of humor, but it's a shot that backfired. The action scenes are truly impressive, but most merely to show-off, being clogged with special effects and sound. For posterity remains a regular action movie, able to entertain, which seeks to impress but ends up leaving us a bitter taste, like a good wine that was too long exposed to air."

Doesn't this happen in every Bruckheimer movie? It's so cliched as to invoke nausea. Nic Cage's character is overstated as usual. First-time director Simon West is out of his element and would be better off doing comedies.

"sunspot","1","10","24","4 May 2003"," A good cast can't save an awful script
","Were Con Air a parody, it would have been one of the best action flicks of the '90s.  Unfortunately, they played this truly awful script straight, and the result is one of the worst action flicks I've ever seen.  It's like watching a 90 minute trainwreck in slow motion.  I'd rather watch Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire again - at least that film was good for a few laughs, and had some imagination (lamebrained though it was).  Con Air is about as original as asphalt on a highway.<br/><br/>The only surprising thing about this film is the sheer number of good, or at least competent actors stuck in it, including Malkovich, Buscemi, Colm Meaney and John Cusack.  I'm assuming they were all offered a fortune, and probably figured this stinker of a script would either get cleaned up while in production, or that their combined talents would allow them to rise above it.  It wasn't, and they can't.  As writer Mike Judge once had his characters Beavis and Butthead observe on their old television program, you can't polish a turd.<br/><br/>Oh, and Nicolas Cage has become - without question - the most overrated actor in Hollywood.  I loved this guy in flicks like Raising Arizona, but he has almost systematically turned himself into cinema's premier soulless action film ""hero"".  His performance in this flick is tee vee movie of the week atrocious, and he sports what has to be the worst southern accent since Streisand's ludicrous attempt at one in Hello Dolly a generation ago.  If it weren't for his inexplicable ""status"" as an A-List star, giving him first pass on fantastic scripts like Adaptation, this guy would be waiting tables in his uncle's restaurant.

"jeffyoung1","7","2","3","17 April 2018"," Martial artist's worst self-defense nightmare
","My post is not about Con Air per se but about the movie's beginning. For every honest, decent, honorable person who has studied martial arts for the respectable purpose of self-defense, Con Air presents a realistic scenario of how everything can go wrong for the law-abiding citizen who defends himself.<br/><br/>For starters, the laws of this nation defining 'self defense' have long been established by lawyer politicians and judges who never studied self-defense and more, have never been in a self-defense situation. It's possible a few have served in the military but that doesn't mean they experienced combat. Therefore the laws defining what the law-abiding citizen can and cannot do have been written by politicians who harbored only a vague sense of what legal self-defense should be. They never took into account just how fast and chaotic any life-and-death self-defense situation can be and the victim is not always in the position to determine just what constitutes enough self-defense that a 'reasonable' person would be expected to commit. This term, 'reasonable' and 'reasonable of amount of force' comes up repeatedly in the laws defining self-defense and deliberately cultivates an element of subjective uncertainty that is left up to the jury and judge to decide. The victim is still considered to be a law-abiding citizen and therefore is subject to strict compliance with the subjective laws of self-defense while the criminal aggressor of course is free to use whatever means of violence he chooses. Also bear in mind that the politicians and judges who framed our nation's laws of self-defense; many, not all, greatly disdained violent responses to personal attack because to them it broke the laws of civilization, introduced the law of the jungle and regressed society to the Old West frontier. While you can't pass laws restricting the criminal's violent crime they could pass laws restricting the law-abiding citizen's ability to defend himself.<br/><br/>The set-up in Con Air is pretty stereotypical. Decent man, former US Army ranger, Cameron Poe, celebrates his return home with his beautiful wife in a local bar. And there's the stereotype villain, an obnoxious, drunk, horny, local white lowlife, dressing, looking, and speaking the part. And he has two, silent, lowlife buddies with him to give him courage. Drunk white trash lowlife makes obnoxious, lewd comments to Poe and his wife. Poe and wife put down the idiot and do the right thing, leave the dive. Since the white trash drunk lowlife has two buddies with him, he feels invincible in deciding to thrash the impertinent, clean-shaven Army boy, and maybe get in some rape fun with his wife. Well, that's how it is with bullies, isn't it? They always need to have a couple of guys backing them up. Had the slob been alone, he may have thought twice about going out in the rain to confront Poe (Nicholas Cage). Now the laws of self-defense in almost every state declare that Poe and wife retreat from the scene but it doesn't look like they have much opportunity to do so. A guy by himself could try to duck and run but with a woman on his arm that's out of the question, unless he plans on leaving her behind. As might be expected, the lowlife takes a sucker punch swing at Poe, who, counterattacks with fast, well-placed military combatives hand strikes, one of which, the palm heel strike to the nose, kills the lowlife. His two buddies immediately desert the scene. <br/><br/>At the trial comes the nightmare. You hear nothing from Poe's lawyer, who stands silently like a store mannequin ten feet away from Poe as if he had some communicable disease. You get the sense Poe's defense lawyer was worthless to a tee. Then comes the judge who immediately shows his left-wing liberal views on self-defense by declaring Poe the aggressor and the criminal, simply because he had military combatives training and, ""...should have known better."" Should have known better, what? How was Poe to know? Men have died from a single punch to the face/head from an untrained assailant and it's happened twice in southern California over the past five years. During a fracas at local baseball park in southern California, a normal, healthy 5'10"" man took a punch in the face from another fan. The man collapsed and died two days later.<br/><br/>Now the laws of self-defense being what they are, when you kill someone in self-defense, a lot has to go into consideration. Typically killing an assailant armed with a deadly weapon usually (hopefully) ends with no prison time provided there was no escape option for the victim. Most of the time these situations involved house break-ins with armed burglars. But out in the street, fist-to-fist, it gets murkier. Killing someone in what the judge considers a bar brawl is not self-defense in his mind. You might blame the defense lawyer for not being eloquent or persuasive enough with the judge and jury. When you kill someone in a fistfight often the law declares you guilty of negligent homicide, be it manslaughter or second degree homicide. So you are going to jail. But the jail term should not be as long as Poe received, ten years. The judge could have sentenced him to three years to seven years. With time off for good behavior, Poe could have been out of jail in as little as 18 months to 3 years. Poe would still be vulnerable to a wrongful death lawsuit from the dead man's relatives but that's another worst case scenario.<br/><br/>As you contemplate self-defense, know from the experts that it is chaotic, unscripted and thousand things can go wrong. But in the split seconds that you have, you take the risk, especially as in Poe's case, he could have been badly injured, even killed by three men, with the possibility of his wife been sexually assaulted afterwards, which in this movie was a distinct possibility given the lust the drunk lowlife exhibited to Poe's wife."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","2","3","23 November 2015"," Welcome To Con Air!
","US Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage)returns home to Alabama to see his wife Tricia (Monica Potter). Poe has trouble with some of the locals and does his best to try to ignore the troublemakers. After he leaves the bar, the men spot Poe outside and start beating him up, but Poe fights back and ends up unintentionally killing one of the men. As a result of his actions, Poe is sentenced to 7 to 10 years in a state penitentiary. Poe becomes eligible for parole and boards a plane with various convicts who are being transported on the aircraft for varying reasons. However, some of the convicts have plotted an escape attempt and hold the guards and air crew hostage. Poe's conscience will not allow him to sit by and do nothing and he does everything he can to try and stop them.<br/><br/>Con Air isn't entirely original and shares many of its plot elements with Air Force One. Despite this though, the story isn't actually too bad. Despite the fact that Poe is a convict here, he isn't an animal like many of the others on board - he has morals and a conscience and it does mean that it's very easy to get behind Poe and his fight against the convicts. The film flows very well and for the most part the script is actually pretty good - we all know that the convicts are going to hi-jack the plane, but it can be fun sometimes to see how they're going to do it and it's clear that some thought had been put into the script. As with most action films there are plenty of wisecracks, some tongue-in-cheek humour, and the film also has a sense of menace about it which are all essential ingredients for a good action film.<br/><br/>The film is very well-paced and mercifully has no real padding or silly sub plots and stays very much focused on Poe trying to save the day (which was fine with me). The performances from the main cast are variable; Nic Cage is OK when he's called upon to do anything physical, but lacks any real charisma meaning that he gets by here on his likability. Monica Potter is cute, but rather bland. Malkovich is the star of the show and seems to have a lot of fun hamming it up here. He knows exactly what film he's in and really throws himself into the role. Rhames is good here too, but is very much playing second fiddle to Malkovich. Colm Meaney and John Cusack are also good in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Director Simon West stages the action well and once again serves up pretty much everything we come to expect from an action film. The final sequence of events was pretty exciting and overall I was fairly impressed with this film.<br/><br/>Con Air has everything I look for in an action film; a sense of fun, wise-cracks, tongue-in-cheek humour, a fast pace, a reasonable story and a trace of menace about it. If these are the sorts of things that you look for in an action film then you certainly won't be disappointed with this one."

Those wanting a lot of things blowing up will certainly be entertained by this. The greatest thing going in the film's favor is the terrific cast, which not only includes Cage and Malkovich but we also get the likes of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, Danny Trejo, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson and Colm Meaney. The terrific cast certainly adds a lot of fun to the picture as the supporting players all fit their roles wonderfully and there's no question that the two leads are perfect. Malkovich chews up the scenery in the role of the bad guy who you can easily fear but also tell how smart he is. Cage, with a hilariously fun Southern accent, is also extremely good in the part and is smart enough to know when it's best to just wink at the viewer and have some fun. Another major plus are the stunts and action scenes. There's certainly some great stuff here including the finale with the plane landing in Las Vegas and of course the end stuff with the firefighter truck. Throughout the picture we're given all sorts of fun situations and it certainly doesn't hurt that we've got all these likable characters.

","Jerry Bruckheimer. He has a way of turning every movie he produces into s---, such as Black Hawk Down, although that was still good it could've been great if Ridley Scott was free to do as he pleased. Okay, now for this movie. The premise is somewhat interesting since it has never been tried before. The cast looks worthy, good actors such as Cage, Buscemi, and Malkovich. The execution is just plain bad. Instead of being a somewhat intelligent movie about its characters such as The Rock it becomes a mindless action film. It doesn't even have enough action to be called an action film. It tries to be dramatic and funny but utterly fails. Cage is all right here, he doesn't have much to act out. Buscemi is okay too, he doesn't do that much. Malkovich is too stereotypical, watch him in Being John Malkovich and In the Line of Fire. The ending was so pathetic with that song all of a sudden starting, it was such a sharp contrast to the overall feel of the film. That song even got nominated for an Academy Award (seriously, this is the first time it was played??) The wife and kid of Cage were really annoying, I wanted them to leave him alone. Overall, this is a stereotypical film with a weak plot and bad action. The only reason I give this above a one is because of a rare memorable action scene or a good joke. 4/10"
"OdeLute","5","2","3","18 April 1999"," what an awful ending
","Let's be brutally honest, no matter how much you love action films you have to admit that the end of this movie was incredibly contrived.  The film could and should have ended about an hour before it actually did so, no single session of commenting could sum up all of the unnecessary footage/over acting/explosions(most of which occurred without any real cause)/etc.  While enjoyable as a popcorn flick, the film isn't worth multiple viewings."

","`Oh the Action Movie', as a child of the eighties I was practically raised on a diet of loud explosions, simple scenarios, white vests and killer one liners.  So with so many action films around, why do I turn my attention to the only slightly above average `Con Air'?  Well, for a start, I watched it last night and it's still fresh in my mind, but besides that Con Air represents every aspect of the turning point of the action movie.  So it's one small step for entertainment, one giant leap for Jerry Bruckheimer's bank balance.  The simple scenario of Con Air involves Parolee Cameron Poe (Cage) hitching a ride home to his wife after a seven-year sentence for murder.  Of Course Cage didn't mean to destroy the hillbillies' vocal chords at the start of the film, that wouldn't be very heroic, instead he is protecting the honour of his ladylove.  This being Hollywood, we couldn't let the hero be a real killer, but that doesn't stop the film-makers populating the rest of the film with the most adorable host of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers, some of whom only serve as nothing more than comic relief.<br/><br/>You see, this is the big plot mover in Con Air, every action movie has a plot mover, be it the taking of the Building in Die Hard, or Sarah Conner's decision to run in The Terminator, in Con Air, as luck would have it, Cameron Poe is being delivered out of captivity on a prison airplane.  Not just any airplane mind, this one is filled with said jolly bunch of paedophiles, rapists, and murderers and as if we couldn't guess, the maniacs end up taking over the asylum.  What follows may not be Bergman, but it does constitute as some damn fine, time tested entertainment, for as we all know Bruckheimer is of the, `if it ain't broke don't fix it' school of producing, so here we have a (just under) two hour re-hash of Bad Boys, The Rock and Top Gun.  The film follows the path we would expect it to and ends in exactly the way we knew it would, but it doesn't matter how tired and predictable the film may be, because it does what it's supposed to do, and that is to deliver a solid piece of mind-diverting entertainment with all the loud explosions, white vests and killer one liners (`Buckle-up') that any action film fan craves for.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the acting, for this kind of film anyway, is first class, with a definite ensemble at play.  Besides Cage, who continues his role of the action hero that he perfected in The Rock, and later carried through to Face-Off, this time however, delivering all his lines with an hilarious deep southern twang (`Dis iz your Barbeque an it taste gud' is just one side splitter), but adding to his star power we also have the two Johnnies, Cusack and Malkovich as the Good and Bad elements.  Both are good in their respected roles and there is fine support from Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and Colm Meaney.  To top it all off, the director is Simon West (aka Michael Bay without pretension) who applies an unbelievable amount of colour filters and MTV editing, that we have now come to expect from the Hollywood crap factory.  So to finish, Con Air is a decent enough action movie that washes over the brain and leaves you punching the air with excitement, it may not be high art, but it's still a pretty fun ride.  7/10"

Now there are four interesting actors! Cage and Cusack are the likable heroes while Malkovich and Buscemi play the interesting and cerebral villains. Malkovich is always good in that kind of role.<br/><br/>Note: it's interesting that drug-infested Hollywood always makes the DEA the bad guys. Anyone, apparently, who is against drugs is a corrupt, bloodthirsty or just plain evil guy! That's how it is in this movie. Even worse, the DEA head is portrayed as anti-Liberal - the worst sin of all!!<br/><br/>Overall, the interesting characters and some of the action scenes are fun to watch (a few are awesome) but everything is overdone, exaggerated and too profane.

","Con Air is your typical crash, bang, wallop Jerry Bruckheimer kind of movie. Loud & blatant pyrotechniques, lots of shouting and bad language; a dumb-downed script, actors act by the join-the-dots method, and not a lot of subtlety.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, has the worst kind of scum all being dumped on the same plane as Mr Nice Guy, Nic, who has just served a 7 year jail term on a jumped up charge.<br/><br/>There's lots of stern faces, flexed biceps & fixed stares, but you begin to wonder who is using the brain cell between this motley crew.<br/><br/>Nic Cage acts like sly stallone & Bruce Willis rolled into one with equal numbness but ends up like Hommer Simpson and gives us the impression he'd rather be somewhere else. (""Duh, put....duh...the....bunny...duh....back!"")<br/><br/>Cage talks like an old-fashioned LP playing at the wrong speed; Cussack & Meaney are the comic relief who spend most of their time calling each other a__holes & much worse along with lots of running/flying around.<br/><br/>Buscemi is always fun to watch - a bit like the whining kid in the classroom; and here he thinks his Hannibal the Cannibal with a fixed smirk and a worrying choice of bondage-wear.<br/><br/>The only person I really felt for was John Malkovich - playing the chief baddie with the loaned-out brain cell. You just knew he was only in the movie for the money and not to stretch his considerable acting talent. But to be fair he played the part with gusto and in real life would have kicked Cage (and his fluffy bunny) into touch!<br/><br/>This film would suit those people who like a crazy Saturday night at home with the gang and a few tinnies. There's just no point in being critical for its lack of intelligence because that would miss the point.<br/><br/>Con Air is hokum pure & simple, and yet its fun to watch when you want to unwind big time.

","Con Air really coins the term ""stupid action blockbuster"".<br/><br/>It is held together by great cast (performances) and insane action. It is stupid, but it's still somewhat entertaining and childishly romantic.<br/><br/>While it's clearly not going to top any 90ties action lists, it is still watchable (or re-watchable if you saw it as a kid or young adult in the 90ties).<br/><br/>Obviously the plot is full of holes, but it's sufficient for an action film (especially a 90ties one). The only distracting or rather confusing thing was the teleportation and insane continuity errors. It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat, when our characters are not on screen they disappear from their relative position and re-appear when we start looking. Nobody is anywhere consistently and this provides for some funny situations.<br/><br/>It was also very weird for me to see Cage as a ripped action hero and for me he looks kinda comical in these roles (like in Face/Off, same year). If you want to be entertained, to immerse yourself in the 90ties and have a good laugh - you're welcome to watch Con Air. Not the best one of the 90ties by far, but a tolerable action ride."

Scott Rosenberg's witty script boasts a lot of snappy one-liners along with a wickedly funny sense of self-mocking sardonic humor.<br/><br/>This film further benefits from a colorful and entertaining array of deliciously detestable villains: Ving Rhames as black militant Diamond Dog, Steve Buscemi as flaky and philosophical psycho Garland Greene, Nick Chinlund as the surly Billy Bedlam, M.C Gainey as easygoing good ol' boy pilot Swamp Thing, and Dave Chappelle as wisecracking lackey Pinball. Moreover, there are sound contributions from John Cusack as eccentric smartaleck US Marshalls agent Vince Larkin, Colm Meaney as bullheaded DEA agent Duncan Malloy, Mykelti Williamson as Poe's affable buddy Baby-O, Rachel Ticotin as sassy guard Sally Bishop, and Steve Eastin as sarcastic guard Falzon. The roaring and rattling score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin does the rousing trick. David Tattersall's glossy widescreen cinematography likewise hits the impressive polished spot. However, it's this movie's giddy willingness to go totally over the top and then some that makes it such a gloriously gonzo blast to behold."

","While certainly it is an entertaining film, is not as good as other over-the-top action flicks of the 90s, Air Force One and Face Off come to mind.
While some one-liners remain classic, some others are just ridiculous. Nic Cage is just Nic Cage, he is kinda hard to take seriously in some of the movies he stars in, but he was acceptable in this. John Cusack and John Malkovich really pull their characters off. I believe the 90s continued a trend with action flicks, that may have started in the 80s and continue today with such unrealistic unplausible plots that somehow the heros magically save the day at the last minute. It all comes down to a greasy machine that keeps manufacturing these overproduced audiovisual pieces just for the sake of a genre, without providing something different to the formula. Well, at least movies like Con Air have a nostalgic element to it that decidely throws in an extra charm. And if you watched it in the 90s and you watch it now in 2019, you obviously realize it hasn't aged well, but it is still highly entertaining and not as bad as you recall. It's actually decent."

This time, he just wants to get home to see his daughter, after being released from prison after doing his time. The plane, carrying all convicts, gets hijacked, and puts a serious dent in his plans. However, it's NOT going to stop him from seeing his kid. No bomb, threat, fight or fire is going to stop this man. The movie is strategic, combining a little bit of Die Hard with the formula. Pretty much, it's Die Hard on a plane. The action, well, it's a little silly looking back on it, but for the most part, I still think this is a great flick to watch. And it has plenty of laugh out loud humor to keep you smiling, and the action never ceases up, so it keeps your blood pumping. So strap yourself in tight, and enjoy the ride.

","Con Air was directed by Simon West and stars our lord and saviour Nicholas Cage, John Malkovich and John Cuasck. ‚ÄãJust-paroled army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is headed back to his wife (Monica Potter), but must fly home aboard a prison transport flight dubbed ""Jailbird"" with some of the worst criminals living. Along with Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) and Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson), genius serial killer Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich) unleashes a violent escape plot in mid-flight. Secretly working with U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack), Poe tries to foil Grissom's plan.<br/><br/>This movie can be genuinely summed up with the simple phrase 'PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX'. Nothing more needs to be said but I took notes while watching so why not? All the acting was great in this movie, it has a cheesy, stupid story, dialogue straight from the word of God and absurd action. This movie is the best bad movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It shouldn't be as good as it is. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie; it's pure, unfiltered stupid fun and I beg of you to watch this movie at least one point in your life.<br/><br/>The story for this movie is so stupid, so cheesy, so ridiculous that it makes it better than Shawshank. A script can be so bad it's good and this movie proves that. If you watch this movie looking for a dark, gritty, realistic crime thriller then read the quote in the summary and rethink your mindset. It's so dumb and unrealistic but that is what makes it perfect. If I actually cared, the story would be awful but this movie is so fun that you shouldn't care.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage was so cheesy in this movie and his accent is thicker than the 38th parallel. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing in this movie and relished in that fact. John Malkovich was amazing as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom and is easily the best part of this movie. Cyrus is such a great villain; he's a pure psychopath and sociopath but has so much charisma that it's genuinely frightening but also amazing. John Cusack was good as Vince Larkin. Steve Buscemi was good as Garland Greene as was Danny Trejo as Johnny 23. Every actor in this movie did a good job and knew exactly what type of movie they were in. Every single inmate has a sickening degree of likability to them and was very memorable.<br/><br/>Technically, this movie was awful. The cinematography was awful and the editing was just sad. The effects were awful and the set design consisted of plane.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is absolutely absurd and that makes it so much better. It's stupid fun and doesn't work in any way but that is what makes it worse. This movie's primary goal is to provide a mental time and it does that to the nth degree. <br/><br/>Honestly, I could vote this movie for having the best dialogue in any movie ever, along with Face/Off and The Wicker Man'(Something convenient there don't think). The line 'PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX' and 'MAKE A MOVE, AND THE BUNNY GETS IT' being two of the greatest lines of dialogue ever written. It's now official that Scott Rosenburg(co-writer of that beloved classic 'Kangaroo Jack') is officially a better writer than Roald Dahl, Steven King, William Shakespeare and J.R Tolkien purely for those two lines.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is awful. I mean it is but it is so much stupid fun. I love it. I can name so many flaws with this movie but none of them matter if you take this movie for what it is. If you can do that, then you will enjoy this movie immensely.<br/><br/>7/10"

The highlight of the movie is certainly John Malkovich, he really brings class and sophistication to this movie with a very dramatic and somewhat frightening performance that is much more believable that any other actor in this.

Cameron has to find a way to stop them, Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin is trying to help Cameron and stop a DEA agent shooting the plane down.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage (who was delivered some ropey performances to say the least over the years) is at his best here, John Cusack is excellent as Vince Larkin and John Malkovich is as usual excellent self as the main villain Cyrus The Virus.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames (who never disappoints) offers solid support as Diamond Dog, likewise Danny Trejo. Colm Rainey is effectively annoying, while Mykleti Williamson, Dave Chapelle and Rachel Ticotin are all good in supporting roles. Renoly Santiago is a lot of fun, <br/><br/>However it is Steve Buescemi who completely steals the show as Garland Greene. <br/><br/>I also need to mention the song ""How Do I Live"" which I didn't stop singing when this movie was released, and usually is stuck in my head for a while every time I watch it."

The rest of the actors are doing nicely as well although it always saddens me to see Colm Meaney playing a dumbass and/or bad guy after his role in Star Trek.<br/><br/>The story is not really bad although it has the usual Hollywood mistakes here and there. The ease by which they pick locks in this high security flight is somewhat laughable and I seriously doubt that they would have been able to haul the plane out of that desert junkyard in flyable condition in real life for instance. Still, it is not a bad story and it works for moving the movie forward.<br/><br/>There are plenty of action and it is mostly quite entertaining. Sometimes it is a bit silly and rather unrealistic of course but, as I wrote, mostly it is quite entertaining. The ending is definitely a bit on the silly side with the plane touching down on the Las Vegas Strip.

Right from the opening where we are treated to Nicolas Cage sporting a laughably bad Southern accent, I knew I was in for some cheesy fun. The action scenes are gloriously spectacular to watch. It's filled with explosions, cheesy one liners from Cage, and totally improbable situations which make it all the more fun to watch. How can you not love the sheer audacity of Nicolas Cage continuing to strive forward towards the baddies on the plane and act like nothing has happened, despite the fact that he gets shot in the arm while doing so. Some of the stunts in this one had to be extremely expensive. The finale in this movie takes place on the streets of Las Vegas. I won't spoil it, but let's just say the destruction that commences is somewhat breathtaking to watch. It's totally illogical, but who cares. For almost two hours, you'll get your money's worth in this one if you're an action junkie.<br/><br/>I'm still a fan of Nicolas Cage, despite his unlucky string of many terrible movies as of late. It's not exactly a great performance, but he is a lot of fun to watch. He has a really bad mullet while having a bit of a lone wolf character, which carries a heavy heart. His breezy character is pretty illogical, but I had a hoot with him. His star power is very apparent in this one. John Malkovich can play this type of role in his sleep. Not many people can play an entertaining villain like him. I loved his show! John Cusack provides great support as the United States Marshal, and manages to overcome slight miscasting with charisma and charm to spare. He doesn't feel like the Marshall kind of type, but he did really good; David Chapelle is the comedic relief (Not that the movie needed it!) Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Rachel Ticotin, M.C Gainey & Monica Potter all do their roles well. Steve Buscemi is a scene stealer in this one, despite not having much screen time<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I had fun. It's very stupid, but fun. The critics that rip into it aren't getting the big picture here. You can rip into the script all you want, but this is set to entertain the masses, and that's exactly what it does.

","""Con Air"" is simply the perfect movie to watch if the viewer wants nothing more than to be entertained in high style for two hours. The beauty of it is, the filmmakers *know* this ain't exactly the smartest movie out there, far from it, but they do a superb job of taking this goofy escapism to a delightfully over the top place, blowing up stuff REAL good and giving us a bunch of memorable characters, starting with hero Nicolas Cage as former Army Ranger Cameron Poe, jailed for killing a man in self defense, and now being paroled. On his flight home is a delicious assortment of the worst of the worst, society's unrepentant scum featuring such people as rapist ""Johnny-23"" (Danny Trejo), black militant ""Diamond Dog"" (Ving Rhames), and mass murderer ""Billy Bedlam"" (Nick Chinlund), as well as guys like ""Swamp Thing"" (M.C. Gainey), ""Pinball"" (Dave Chappelle), and Hannibal Lecter like psychopath Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi). Presiding over all is crafty nut job Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom, played by John Malkovich, who plays the role with true gusto. The law is shown is to be pretty incompetent here, as typified by Colm Meaney's obnoxious D.E.A. agent Duncan Malloy. But, hey, at least they've got Vince Larkin (John Cusack) on their side, the only guy other than Poe who has more than half a brain in his head. The decibel level is cranked way up in this flashy, snazzy action movie that has many inspired moments. One's got to believe that a fair amount of this humour was intentional. The fate of the sneaky drug dealer Francisco Cindino (Jesse Borrego) is a hoot, and it serves as yet another fine example of the necessity in action movies to come up with appropriate witticisms when bad guys bite the dust. Another perfect moment shows that there are MUCH worse things that can mess up a car other than bird poop. Use of the Lynyrd Skynyrd classic ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is inspired. Buscemi, who's great as always, steals his scenes and has some of the best lines; the filmmakers show some brevity in intimating who could be his next victim. Lovely ladies Monica Potter and Rachel Ticotin hold their own well, but this is still very much a show for the guys, who are sure to appreciate it. The special effects are excellent and the pacing flawless - these two hours go by quicker than one would think. Granted, the movie does feature at least two climaxes, but by the time it's over it's a guarantee that all the bad guys will get theirs. And Cage is just a gas, right from that hairdo to the overdone accent. Nobody can say this guy ever gives too little to a role. And Mykelti Williamson is effectively likable as his diabetic buddy who motivates his actions for much of the story. All in all, ""Con Air"" is purely fun Hollywood nonsense, right from start to finish. Watch it and you'll realize the importance of leaving stuffed animals where you find them. Eight out of 10."

All that being said, Con Air is a true action-adventure thrill ride, one of those Jerry Bruckheimer films you can't stop watching. Casting alone is worth the watch, with Cage, Malkovich, Cusack and the rest providing for intense moments, dialog, and entertaining quips sure to delight. Emphasis on the Action part of the genre, this film is rated R for violence and language, and deserves it. All the right elements for a great fun film, and collectible for all the Bruckheimer fans."

","Time was I didn't care for Nic Cage, and Con Air was the movie which changed my mind. His Cameron Poe is a relatively by-the-book action hero, a not-so-ordinary ordinary man, put in a situation of extreme prejudice by circumstances beyond his control, and doing the right thing at great personal risk when he has no need to so because that's just the sort of guy he is.<br/><br/>This movie is packed with action from start to finish, it has a whole bunch of memorable characters, and a script which is littered with memorable and amusing lines.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that it is improbable from start to finish, yet it always manages to stay on the credible side of the line beyond which suspension of disbelief is impossible.<br/><br/>And there is a quality to be found in some movies which I espouse frequently (often in the context of those movies where it is not to be found) - fun. Con Air is a fun-filled romp from start to finish, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who hasn't already seen it."
"i77310","9","1","1","28 November 2009"," Con Air and Steve Busemi both rocks! ^-^
","I saw this movie a couple of times in the 90s. Seeing it again recently, it has lost none if it's shine and appeal as a fun popcorn action flick, with an all star cast, standing the test of time well with its pretty original story. Special kudos to Steve Busemi, who is been one of my favorite actors since Reservoir Dogs, for upping the humor factor in this movie.<br/><br/>Cameron Poe (Nic Cage) is a prison parolee hitching a ride to freedom after 8 years in prison to reunite with his wife and meet the daughter whom he's never seen before. He boards the known maximum security plane, Con Air, which also transports some of the worst criminals in the state. Trouble brews when guards are killed mid-air and the place is skyjacked, led by Cyrus 'The Virus' Crissom, (convincingly played by John Malkovich) and it's up to Poe to save the day.<br/><br/>There are the usual action film ingredients: lots of guns blasting off, staggering body counts, explosions reminiscent of Michael Bay's Bad Boys, that makes it so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>There' re a few heart-stopping moments which includes when Poe is nearly caught writing the plane's destination- Lerner Airfield- on a corpse before throwing it off the plane, alerting good US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) who seems to be only one on Poe's side in the law enforcement. <br/><br/>The film has its bits of humor like a car is tied behind the flying plane, then comes crashing down in front of its confused then dismayed owner Duncan Malloy (Colm Meany). The action mounts as the plane spins out of control, crashes into Las Vegas, creating chaos and plenty of room for spectacular destruction scenes where cars explode and horrified passer-by scream and scuttle in all direction for safety.<br/><br/>There are also some cheesy but fun lines from Cyrus: 'If you say a word about this, the next wings you see will belong to the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse.' And to Poe: 'Before I kill you, I just want to know that the last thing little Casey ever gets to smell will be my stinking breath'.<br/><br/>I practically enjoy the cameo from Steve Busemi, and only wish he'd have more screen time. My friend thinks I'm crazy, but I just find him cute and attractive in his weird, funny, fast-talking way. Here he portrays Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene, who has butchered over 30 people in various gruesome ways, thus considered as a 'national treasure' by Cyrus. His pale composition, lanky frame and haunting eyes stood him out amidst the tough and muscular criminals. I love the part where he sings 'He's got the whole world in his hands' with the little girl and as the plane is crashing down. He also has some witty lines:<br/><br/>'Define Irony. Bunch of idiots dancing on a plane to a song (Sweet Home Alabama) made famous by a band that dies in a plane crash.' 'One girl¬ÖI drove through 3 states wearing her head as a hat.' I don't care what my friend thinks, Steve Busemi rocks! To me he outshines Nic Cage here.<br/><br/>This film makes a good rental and a great buy, especially on a Saturday night. If you haven't already seen it, do it now. You won't regret it!"

","The most awesome scene in this movie must be that fighting scene where somebody shoots our hero in the arm and he just keeps on walking. This thing has really slapped together a great cast for an action movie. John Malkovich! Ving Rhames! John Cusack! Steve Buscemi! The relevant Nicholas Cage! All in one movie, all in great straight-forward action scenes that remind me of John Woo. The writing is semi-mindless, with an appetite for destruction, but occasionally it shows more depth. Buscemi's conversation with the little girl is another highlight. The plot has been done millions of times, but never really this well. The developments are great, they keep everything dynamic, where most action flicks fade out and tend to drag near the ending. From that angle the screenplay is actually pretty creative. It's a movie that's probably at best in a wide-screen, surround sound, cinema experience, but you could watch it on a cell phone and it would still be cool. In conclusion, ""Con Air"" just plain rocks."

","Kudos to Jery Bruckheimer for making his first movie without Don Simpson. He showed he could still continue with one of his best friends gone.

"NxNWRocks","8","1","1","19 August 2007"," Effective OTT action caper
","""Con Air"" is a film that inhabits the alternative universe where everything is highly combustible, bad guys are always larger-than-life and have a talent for quips, heroes can defy the laws of gravity and probability, and vehicles of all shapes and sizes have a tendency to crash spectacularly. There is nothing ostensibly wrong with this kind of film, but it is not for everyone, and some may be annoyed with the lack of reality as the stunts and improbable events pile up higher and higher.<br/><br/>The movie is one of the better specimens of the over-the-top sub-genre of action movies, mainly due to an excellent cast list and a very fluid sense of direction. The editing hardly puts a scene wrong, and the plot holds the attention for a good two-thirds before it slides into ludicrous, badly-orchestrated overdrive at the end. One of the biggest bugbears is that some major plot points are overlooked along the way, such as who helped the bad guys obtain materials like plans of the plane, etc.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage does reasonably well in a role that is effectively a rewritten John McClane, but the clothes do not quite fit him right, and neither does the Deep South accent. While it would be very easy to see Bruce Willis romping around the plane if this were another ""Die Hard"" sequel, there is something just a little off-key with Cage's character, an Army Ranger who is being paroled after seven years of a ten-year sentence for killing a man in a bar-room fight. This may partly be due to the over-emphasis on sugary romance featuring his wife and the daughter he has never met. It's possible to get behind Cage as he takes on the bad guys, but he just isn't as likable as McClane.<br/><br/>On the other side of the cast, Malkovich and Buscemi both play very effective, believable psychopaths, and a scene of Buscemi's freed character stalking a little girl is among the most tension-filled in the film. The rest of the cast largely play their parts effectively.<br/><br/>If you are willing to delve deep enough ¬ñ and you do not need to examine the movie too closely to spot them ¬ñ the flaws are there, as the goofs section indicates. Depending on your tolerance for a film to deliver an entertaining story over being entirely realistic or accurate, this may or may not be a problem. Most things considered, ""Con Air"" has a lot going for it, the least of which being that it is neither ""Air Force One"" or ""Executive Decision"" to name but two fellow (and inferior) high-octane action movies featuring airplanes."

At no point was i bored! this is quite something for me. normally if the first 5 seconds of a film don't please i wonder off and get something to eat. But here it was a different case. i liked where the film was going right from the very beginning. i think unlike some films the characters were developed on very well. you knew more than they were convicts. you knew about their backgrounds and what they had done. and generally about there mental stability. the star of the film, Nicholas cage, pulls it off very well. he puts on a very nice hillbilly accent and acts quite tough for the duration. sure some of his lines and actions may have been corny but i liked it never the less.<br/><br/>i think overall it is a good film and one i will buy, and watch many times."

With an all star cast, fun characters, great comedic relief, a very polished look, and classic action sequences; Con Air is sure to be one ride you won't forget. The only scenes that feel a little too over the top were the door flying right past John Cusack and certain aspects about the ending. When it comes to action movies we are supposed to cut a little slack, so if you do that with Con Air you will come out ready to go back for another viewing. Like I've said before, action movies these days are sloppy and reckless. Con Air soars above today's action films."

","There are many types of love story in this film. The greatest one is the father's love for their child and to have his family back. In my opinion, there is no greater motivation for a plot to stay boiling and brilliant throughout as much as this objective. Nick Cage is caught on the transfer plane of America's most dangerous criminals. He finds himself having to make many choices that could end his life while attempting to save the innocents. The sea of characters are all wonderfully played. The relationships are strong and reviewing. The most intense of these relationships is the Nick Cage and John Cusack even though they only are together in one scene at the end. The direction is strong, but the acting is what makes this movie memorable."
"Wulfstan10","6","1","1","25 March 2005"," Fairly Entertaining Action Film
","This film is really pretty good for what it is. Since it's about a recently-released prisoner on his way home when prisoners seize control of the prisoner-transport plane he's in, it's a relatively unusual action film. The relatively unique setting (it's kind if like Die HArd in a general way only) and plot have potential, with Cage's character trying to solve the situation in the air whilst cops on the ground try to handle it there. And, for the most part the film uses the potential well. There's action, tension, and drama, and the momentum keeps up throughout.<br/><br/>That said, of course the film has some failings. Some themes and elements are well-trod and even clich√©d while parts of the whole things are rather implausible, and in some parts the story has not handled very smoothly.<br/><br/>One other point is that some people don't like the range of characters, especially among the criminals, and think that the film tried to do too much. I think, however, that all of this added to the film. Although the number of singular characters does prevent much exploration of each one, that is not something to be expected in a film such as this and it is not a very significant problem. Thus, the variety of characters increased the film's depth and the range of entertainment value, added to the realism and tension, heightening the mistrust, etc., among some of the prisoners, and it provided some more rich characters with personality. Some claim that Buscemi's much-feared serial-killer character was superfluous, but I find him a great addition in part because he's a relatively complex and interesting character and he provides a very different aspect to the lot of criminals on the plane. The fact that the other criminals kept him tied up because they thought he was just a dangerous nut case, while in the end he ends up coming off as much more intelligent and less savage than they is a fun and interesting spot in the film. This is heightened by the fact that he appears to be the only prisoner who escapes, which adds more fun irony to the film.<br/><br/>Could this film have been better? Yes, it could have been much better if different themes were introduced, characters handled differently, etc,., but as it was it is still a pretty good film for what it is."

Unlike Independance Day, Armageddon, and The Phantom Menace, which are all decent enough, Con Air manages to communicate a strong sense of personality, which most movies since Pulp Fiction have really lacked.<br/><br/>Con Air rises above that ""junk food for the eyes"" feeling, while it does have special effects all over, gives convincing performances by Cage, Cusack, Malkovich, Buscemi, and Ticotin.

","Con Air follows in the tradition of most Bruckheimer films - it's flashy,oversized and contains more explosions per minute than Dresden in WWII. The ilm contains a number of interesting characters - Cusack's Marshall Larkin and a number of the villains (notably Malkovich as a thoroughly engaging psychopath and Buscemi as - well, an even more engaging wackjob) are especially interesting, but most of the talent in the film is wasted because someone upped the budget on explosives but forgot to include summary raises in intelligence.<br/><br/>Yes, the film's worth seeing once or twice. It's visually entertaining (and often almost ludicrously so) and features some well-choreographed action scenes, but can't stand up to repeated viewing. You quickly realize that most of the movie is boorish and many of the characters - mostly the villains, sadly - are hackneyed and cliche.<br/><br/>Cage's leading role is especially disappointing, though the fault lies in the writing rather than his portrayal. The script makes his Army Ranger out as a soulless creation of the military, a man without any emotion - unless you decide to mess with his family, in which case he gets rather angry. He's shown as devoted to friends and something of a crusading hero, but there's barely enough development to give us an inkling of why he's the way he is. If you want to see convincing Army Rangers, go pick up a copy of Saving Private Ryan and check out actual humans in the military. For some reason, ""Con Air""'s writers decided to take more of a ""Terminator"" approach, but at the same time make us like and identify with Cage's role. I'm not buying it."

Were it not for the ""What Next?"" factor, it would crash as ignominiously as its main device.<br/><br/>The ""What Next?"" factor is present when the hero finds himself in a seemingly impossible situation and is constantly frustrated in his attempts to solve it. In this case, it is a friend (Mykelti Williamson) in need of life-saving medication. He will die in two hours unless injected with insulin. Diabetics and their friends will shake their heads in disbelief when they hear that.<br/><br/>Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), a former Army Ranger, is paroled after serving eight years for killing a man who was attacking his wife. The US Marshal Service transports him home on a plane full of ""the worst of the worst"" en route to a Super Max prison in Alabama. The legal base for his conviction is baloney at best, but the filmmakers needed a reason to put Mr. Perfect Morality on the plane.<br/><br/>Three of the convicts concoct an elaborate plan to gain control of the plane: Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich), Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames), and Pinball (Dave Chappelle). They succeed and plot course to a foreign country, but must make two stops first: Carson City, to pick up the son of their money source (Jesse Borrego), and a remote airfield to board another plane.

The notables are Guard Sally Bishop (a surprisingly attractive Rachel Ticotin), ""Swamp Thing"" (M.C. Gainey, in an annoying performance), and serial rapist Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo, who cannot act to save his life), who desires to make Guard Bishop number 24. On the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) deals with a DEA hothead (Colm Meaney) who wants to destroy the plane and all the innocent people on it. Malloy has a worse attitude than half of the convicts. Most resemble professional weightlifters. Realistically, they would be in solitary confinement, where there is no access to an exercise room.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" contains a surprisingly small amount of action. Only two such scenes last more than a few seconds, neither are impressive, and they both come at the end. The filmmakers place their hope in the many explosions. Explosions are not enough to carry an action movie, especially one not set in space. Besides, director Simon West makes most of them difficult to see. The end credits show all of the major characters smiling, right after the plane crashes on the Vegas strip, likely killing over 100 people.<br/><br/>Only two characters experience any change. The first is Malloy. The second is Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), who murdered 37 people in a way that ""makes the Manson family look like the Partridge family."" Strangely, Greene is the nicest person on the plane. When he approaches a young girl, he acknowledges that he is sick and sings a Christian song with her. At the end, he is the only convict not killed or captured. How are we supposed to feel? Has he accepted Christ? Has the girl's kindness changed his heart? I didn't know whether to be upset or happy.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" has little to applaud. I had to see this movie more times than I would like so I could piece together its confusing and poorly-explained story. West had no concept of how to photograph action; he would greatly improve for ""Tomb Raider."" Outside of Cusack, Malkovich, Buscemi and Chappelle, the acting is awful and the music is worse.

","The storyline of this movie is anything but original. It must have plundered (if not exactly plagiarised) at least a dozen previous scripts, and is inferior to most of them, and I really can't savvy why Nicholas Cage, an actor of real ability, got involved in the movie at all (except perhaps for money). As the anti-hero he looked more anti than hero.<br/><br/>The decision taken to collectively transport some of the country's supposedly most dangerous convicts in one aircraft would surely never have been contemplated by the real U.S. authorities. One would hope not.<br/><br/>The action moves at quite a pace, which is probably just as well, as it doesn't give the viewer time to consider it's many faults, not least of which is the ludicrousness of the whole package. Personally I cannot understand the obsession of modern Amercan movie-makers to produce and glorify this type of violent pap, or for that matter of the American public in watching it.<br/><br/>Except for a re-vamping of the usual ""good against evil"" theme (or could it perhaps be for the enhancement of bad language?), this film (I hesitate to call it entertainment) seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. I can't see one valid point it's trying to make. Not that a justification is always necessary, but this garbage is just violence for the sake of violence, and there's no worse reason for a film to be made. ""Why did you watch it?"", you may well ask. Answer...It seemed to be a good idea at the time, but I wish I hadn't."

","I saw this movie on TV and watched it just for lack of anything better to do. Of course, at home it is possible to occupy oneself with other activities while viewing a show. I wonder how anyone who actually went out to see it at a theater where they are expected to give the silver screen undivided attention could possibly come away satisfied or anything but disgusted. For me, the most enjoyable part of the experience turned out to be reading comments here about how incredibly bad others may have found this piece of cinematic junk. Negative criticism was so overwhelmingly abundant that I will not even attempt to elaborate on what was already there, except to say that it felt like a relief to locate something else that at least made a reasonable amount of sense by comparison. The IMDb gives people the chance to express themselves instead of remaining completely passive, so the very act of composing an opinion can become entertaining in itself."

","As an aircraft full of murderers, rapists and criminals pulls away into the air, a rope attached to the tail of the beast catches on a convertible's front bumper, pulling the car upwards where it flies into the air, and sways back and forth, as the plane picks up altitude. ""On any other day, that might look strange,"" Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) says as he stares out the back of the plane and watches with exasperation.<br/><br/>Cameron is having a strange day, indeed. The film begins eight years prior to the present. Cameron returns home from the Military to his pregnant wife, who is being harassed by a band of drunken idiots where she works at the town bar. Shrugging them off, Cameron and his wife are both assaulted by the men when they make a dash for their car in the rainfall outside the place. Defending his wife, Cameron kills the men and is sentenced to 7 - 10 years in prison. Because he is a trained government weapon, his murder charges are a bit different than those of other criminals. Because he knows how to kill more than most people, he is given a longer sentence. If the point of this is to make the audience wonder why in the world the justice system works like this, it has achieved its goal.<br/><br/>Flash forward eight years, and Cameron is finally getting parole. Hitching a ride back to his wife on a plane with a band of ruthless criminals, Cameron expects nothing less than a pleasant ride. But when ""Sirus the Virus"" (John Malkovich) takes over the plane with his buddy (Ving Rhames), everything goes wrong.<br/><br/>Cameron is suddenly an undercover hero. Back on land, a U.S. Marshal played by John Cusack thinks something is wrong. When he finds aircraft blueprints lodged in Sirus' old prison cell, he realizes that the plane could be in trouble. Cameron solidifies the marshal's suspicions when he alerts everyone on ground (in secret) that the plane has been taken over. He also tells them where it's going to be landing.<br/><br/>The movie's grand finale--in which the plane lands on a Las Vegas strip--is silly but fun. The film is a Jerry Bruckheimer production that rivals ""The Rock."" Very similar, it's an over-the-top action extravaganza with big explosions, a ""Die Hard""-esque plot, and a surprisingly large human quotient in the mix. It's one of the best action films of the past decade; the type of film all the pale imitators always try to be, and few ever come so close to actually being. <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, who in fact starred in ""The Rock,"" is often picked on for bad acting. I like him. Here he provides a sort of gentle hero to the film, more realistic than Stallone would be, not quite as funny as Arnie, but somewhere in between both of them. He was absolutely fabulous in ""Adaptation"" (2002), and also in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" for which he won an Oscar. I'm one of his bigger fans. He doesn't disappoint here.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is great as the villain. Something about the man has always seemed strange, and he's good at playing oddball serial killers and baddies. Malkovich was creepy and effective in Clint Eastwood's thriller ""In the Line of Fire,"" downright silly in ""Johnny English,"" lovable in ""Of Mice and Men,"" and here he's creepy again.<br/><br/>My favorite character in the film has to be that played by Steve Buscemi, though. ""He makes the Manson family look like the Partridge family,"" someone tells Cameron. He went on a killing spree and murdered thirty people. He tells Cameron that one time he drove for three hours wearing a little girl's head as a hat. ""Feel free not to share with me,"" Cameron tells him.<br/><br/>In other cases, Buscemi's character might seem totally evil. Here he's funny, though, because the film makes us think he's murdered again after the plane lands to re-fuel, and then we find out he hasn't when we see his potential victim waving at the plane as it takes off again. That makes him a ""good guy."" It's all contrivances in the script, but it works. Just like the film.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","Could a movie get any worse? I have never cared much for Nicolas cage, and this is one of the reasons I did not see Con Air in the past. Well tonight I was flipping thru the channels when I saw the show on one of the cable channels. I paused for a few moments to see what it was, after a few moments I discovered what it was, I decided to watch a few minutes to see if it was as bad as I imagined. Well it went beyond my wildest dreams. It is bad. The part I was subjected to was, as I guessed near the end of the show. Cage was trying to get to a plane in the bone yard, I am assuming that this the bone yard in Tucson Az. If so it looked nothing like the bone yard; I have had the opportunity to visit it myself when I was a training mission at Davis-MonthanAFB, These two are adjacent to each other. If the military is going to be sending in troops it would send in a lot more then the few it did, plus there would be no civilian police cars in the parade. But then this would not make for a so-called action movie. I turned it off right after the Corvette hit the ground. That was about all I could take. I just hope that they did not destroy a real Vette, in the making of the movie. There is now way that plane would have been able to takeoff let alone fly with that car tethered to it. I feel that I have spent more time writing this review then I did watching the movie. Bottom line: Bad movie."
"PudgyPandaMan","4","2","4","28 December 2008"," ""Why couldn't you put the bunny back in the box?!""
","I wish they could put this movie back in the box. This was a very crude and offensive movie. I watched it on TNT and even with some of the cuss words bleeped out, this movie obviously has to have used the f-word more than any other movie. I guess some film makers equate crude language with what makes a good action flick. There is also quite a few uses of the N-word as well.<br/><br/>My other complaint is Nicholas Cage's horrendous southern accent. Being from the south, I don't think I have ever heard a more fake and overdone accent. I don't think anyone has talked that brand of southern accent since the Civil War. They could have easily made him from somewhere else in the U.S. without negatively impacting the story one bit. It would have been much better to have him in a believable speaking voice than a ridiculous one.<br/><br/>Also, what was with the music?! I thought the electronic, synthesized background music went out with the 80's (a la ""Top Gun""). Yet this movie was made in 1997? For such a high budget film, you think they could have spent a little more on the music. Or maybe they spent ALL the money on stunts, explosions and special effects and couldn't afford to hire a decent music composer. It was the same ridiculous music throughout the whole movie."

But what's up with Cage's accent? Its not like him, and he didn't do a good job. I think its because everyone is used to his acting style and he can't really go far out of his way now.

"lllinggg","4","2","4","31 July 2003"," Simplistic and Infantile
","'Con Air' is an exploration of the untold depths into which an action film can sink when guided solely by a lust for revenues. Nicolas Cage is an exemplary inmate just released and on his way home, who finds himself aboard a prisoner transportation airplane hijacked by a group of notorious convicts. Depressingly one-dimensional and sadistic, the film is a cluttered patchwork of often unrelated action scenes, centered around miserable primordial notions of good (Cage) and evil (everyone else onboard the plane, with the possible exception of a black diabetic inmate). Most viewers over the age of twelve will rapidly lose interest following the introductory procession of stereotypical villainous characters -the latter representing the worst fears of American suburbia, and featuring Latino drug barons, deranged murderers, compulsive rapists, serial killers and, of course, black supremacists. At some random point toward the end, there is a botched attempt to conceal the film's barrenness behind a deranged display of chaotic blasts caused by the airplane's landing in downtown Las Vegas. Yet even this nauseating waste of production funds on a meaningless vision of urban mayhem fails to stir the film's overbearing numbness. Following the crash, the audience is left with a number of bizarre segments offering an unbefitting comical twist to a truly laughable film."

"STFU","10","2","4","28 October 2002"," Greatest Movie Ever
","This movie ranks number one on my top 9 movies list.  What could be better than this movie?  Nothing.  It had an all star cast, and had the most original plot of any movie.  No other movie has had a group of convicts hijacking an airplane before (Ignore the movie US Marshalls and a few other exceptions).  But honestly, this was the greatest acting performance by Nicolas Cage ever.  It is a shame he didn't win an academy award for best actor.  And how about that John Malkovich.  He played a psycho criminal so well, that if you saw him in real life, you would crap your pants on the spot.  Dave Chapelle was wonderful too, playing an all too fitting role of a crackhead, just added to the realism.  Then there was Colm Meaney. Everyone knows him from being that guy in Under Siege, and his new upcoming role playing apart from Seagal again in the yet to be released Half Passed Dead (I know good movies, and let me tell you, HPD will be number 6 on my top 9 list, and I haven't even seen it yet).  Nobody can forget John Cusack being the anal retentive ""nature boy"" policeman.  Ving Rames played a convincing criminal as well.  But the greatest character in this movie was Steve Buscemi.  Little do you know, but Buscemi was not acting in this movie, he actually is like that in real life.<br/><br/>But enough of the cast, back to the plot.  What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it.  You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans.  I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing.  The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal.  So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it.  I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.<br/><br/>A Masterpiece.  Belongs in the Walt Disney hall of fame. 45,000 stars out of a possible 10."

","Cameron Poe is hitching a ride home, but he is catching a lift with the deadliest cons alive. These guys are the stuff of nightmares from rapists and murderers to three prisoners on death row who turn their transport plane, The Jailbird, into ""Con Air."" This film is the newest film with Nicholas Cage and is one of his better performances since this is a vehicle for him. Other than a questionable accent, the action is top-notch, and a bang from start to finish and Cage delivers.<br/><br/>It's about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) who ends up jailed when he defends himself and his wife against three thugs, and Cameron kills one of them, and he gets a harsh sentence for seven years. Years go by, and Cameron gets put on a plane that is transporting dangerous convicts to a new supermax facility. Once they take off, It's not long before it gets hijacked by a convicted murderer, Cyrus Grissom (John Malkovich) and Cameron must rely on his military skills to save alive and bring the Plane down. On the ground, a US Marshall, Vince Larkin (John Cusack) tries to figure out who Cameron is and where the cons are taking the Plane to.<br/><br/>One of the more exciting scenes in the movie is when the prisoners are getting unloaded from a bus in belly chains, and the first three cons are what the Chief Prison guard calls ""Two Hardcopies and a Genuine Heraldo interviewee."" These guys are locked in separate cages, and they are Cyrus ""the Virus"" Grissom, whose psych eval declares him insane. The character is psychotic genius and the brains behind everything. Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) is the Heraldo interviewee who is a black militant waiting to make his move and a serial killer called Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), who makes Hitler look like a carebear. Towards the end of the film, another character gets brought on board, and he is a violent serial killer called Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), complete with a Hannibal Lector mask. Cyrus admires him and orders him released from his restraints. He says, ""This is no way to treat a national treasure."" and adds, ""Love your work."" See what I mean by Insane? Poe is stuck with all these creeps and about another twelve cons aboard a rickety C-123 Transport.<br/><br/>Onboard is also a friend of Poe's who he met when he was locked up, Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson), and when he falls ill, Poe refuses to leave him behind to die. Also, there is a female guard, Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin), who Poe saves from a crazed rapist, Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo), who wants her so he can be called Johnny 24. So who is Poe? He was a decorated Army Ranger who got unfairly locked up because he got forced to defend himself and his wife from three vicious criminals during a rainy night. When he appears in court, he is called a ""Deadly Weapon"" because of his military skills. When he gets locked down, his daughter, Casey, is about to be born. The ride home is Poe's parole so that he can see her for the first time.<br/><br/>On the ground is US Marshall, Larkin, who never does anything out of character and tries to figure a way to bring the Plane down and why, at one point, Poe had a chance to get off the Plane, and he didn't do it. The single biggest mistake this movie makes is Colm Meaney. This guy cannot act, and he plays a dingdong mad dog DEA Agent who wants to shoot the Plane down. He is an unbelievably stupid character and a typecast who never says the right thing. There is something that he does just before everyone climbs on board the Plane that leads to fatal results for someone. Anyway, when the chaos starts because of one of the cons and the three prisoners get free, one of the guards has a handcuff arm violently driven into his neck before the other guards can get to him. It's also interesting to see how Cyrus easily he fools a group of cops shortly after the hijacking, and you can believe this guy is smart and knows what he is doing.<br/><br/>Cage pulls off an energetic performance, but Malkovich has the charisma that forms the plot. Into the second act, it takes place on an old airfield that ends in a massive shootout with the army and the cops, and it results in a lot of explosions, but It's how Cyrus puts a brilliant plan together at the last minute. The cons try to dig the Plane out, so Cyrus stalls the authorities with propane tanks and a lot of other things to make a loud bang. Now, during all this, there is one questionable element to the film that skates on bad taste, and I'm not sure why it's here. The Garland Greene character has pretended Tea with a little girl who seemingly lives someone on the airfield alone. It makes us believe that she will become his next victim, and it results in the toddler teaching him how to sing that leads to humour when the Plane is going down, but the sequence is really out of place.<br/><br/>Jerry Bruckheimer is the producer of the movie, and he did ""The Rock,"" and Jerry is a great producer, but like his other movies, this one is loud and noisy as well. What stands out is the first time director, Simon West, a British music video director who has a visual style that goes along with the elaborate action sequences. The strangest element has to do with the end credits and ""Sweet Home Alabama"" playing over a montage of the cast. Even more, so is the unexpected weirdness of someone playing poke, and I suppose this is the film's final shot at humour to leave it on a high note. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It knows its absurd, but that's part of the fun. Its a high flying action bang with less seriousness than ""The Rock,"" but its a wild thrill ride to kick off the summer."

","Greetings from the outer space! A long time without writing here so I'm back to give it a try with a movie that never failed to get my love, attention and
never lost its fun and charm all over the years. ""Con Air"" was one of those big ass blockbusters produced by Jerry Bruckheimer back in a time when ""bigger, better,
faster and more"" were the ultimate goal for him to generate budget and conquer audiences. I'm not saying that he doesn't do that anymore, but there's a certain
distance from the times he delivered the likes of ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Rock"" and ""Bad Boys"" where the sense of adventure, real danger, spectacular sequences and
stellar casts were the main attraction even if the story didn't deliver much, lacked of bigger brains and as usual, countless jump cuts and plot holes - he's still
delivering more of the same but the quality of the material, the charm and innocence of the 1990's flicks (the lack of political correctness was a major turn on too)
were all gone; the team he has now, the directors and actors on his productions are too softened in those days where he basically lives of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"",
some other franchises and super heroes who are the name of the game now. Action films were made with more humans beings than CGI. And that's why ""Con Air"", despite its numerous flaws,
still stands out as a supreme moment in terms of entertainment, quality and memorable moments.<br/><br/>The basics: Golf War veteran Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) spends some time in jail after accidentally killing a man who was messing around with him and his wife
(Monica Potter). When jail time's over, free is at the door when he takes a ride on a plane filled with the most horrendous and dangerous criminals, and their plan,
meticulously conceived by Cyrus ""the Virus"" Grissom (a hilarious yet menacing John Malkovich) is to take over the airplane and escape from authorities. After all, the
majority of the group have long sentences to complete while Cameron is going on parole and his greatest wish is to return home to wife and the daughter he never met.
The hijack works and suddenly our hero Poe is destined to alert the good guys down there about what is going on. One of the guys is Vince Larkin (John Cusack), supervisor
of the flight and a good man who has the thankless job of dealing with the unpleasant presence of a careless Narcotics chief (Colm Meaney, also hilarious) who put an
inside man on the plane to track down the schemes of a powerful drug dealer. It's total chaos but for us in the audience is an endless thrills to joy the ride, how
Cameron is gonna make his good plan to work; how Cyrus' dangerous plan is going to work; and how Larkin is gonna manage to do his job without being bossed around by
clueless bureatric people.<br/><br/>Gotta put into account that ""Con Air"" was a baby created to be pleasant to its creators (obviously) and to ourselves as long we don't get too demanding on
what the film brings to us. One action sequence tops the other, it's extremely fast paced yet perfectly edited, a insanely sense of humor with one countless cheesy lines
and dialogues (never cringeworthy), and to the ones expecting some message behind all those rushes, changes and gunshots there's a positive message behind it all:
there's always someone with good intentions trying to make the best of nightmarish situations. Poe is not the selfish hero who just wants to leave the plan and go
back home; he's the one who always finds means to spread the message of a taken flight to the police and also save his sick friend (Mykelti Williamson) and the female
guard (Rachel Ticotin), hostage of the bad guys. And the Cusack character comes in a high and might intellectual way, though always knowing best but when it's time to
act he becomes a man of action. As for the humor relief - though ""Con Air"" is not as heavy as one may think - Malkovich delivers all the goods, along with the ad-libs
from Dave Chappelle and the frightening Hannibal Lecter-traits coming from scene stealer Steve Buscemi. I grew up watching this and the forementioned films to the point
where I can watch repeatedly and the pleasure it's always the same. I might discover one or two new things, overlooked points, lots of errors obviously but I never get
tired of it. It reached to a point that few current films hardly ever get, which is to make you revisit the film time and again, absorb everything and that enjoyable
thing where you can repeat the most memorable lines every time you watch it. Not saying it's the greatest script ever written, but there's excellent quality stuff
that never gets out of your head (""Put the bunny in the box"" or Buscemi's definition of irony when people are having fun while listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd).<br/><br/>The core of this review goes to show how nostalgic one can be with a movie. I guess the majority of current viewers are only accostumed to see Nicolas Cage
wasting his talent with ""only in it for the movie"" flicks and forget that for some decades he was a truly great actor, not just in action movies as this one and
""Face/Off"" but also a heavyweight actor for all seasons in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Moonstruck"" and ""Adaptation."". I must say ""Con Air"" joins the list of his best movies;
along with John Cusack who also was at one time a talented fella but his current wave of dark characters simply don't appeal to me. His heroic character is smart,
likeable and it's worth the adrenaline he goes through while following the plane's movements. I mean, let us be honest: how many times in recent you looked back at
a highly charged action flick that had all those best elements combined that made the profit this one had? The difference is that audiences don't care much about
getting lost in the enthusiam and the fun filmmakers are delivering to us, now we all follow only intelligent action films that lose in appeal or quality here and
elsewhere (sometimes they're not even all that good). And a pity that director Simon West (unknown at the time) never repeated a similar feat with his next films, they
were all dull and empty - but made money, possibly launched some careers.<br/><br/>In all honesty, heart of hearts, ""Con Air"" is one of the most exciting, humorous and heart-pounding action/adventure films of all time in my book. It brings the best of me in so many ways, I get the laughs, the suspense and I can even enjoy all the unbelievable goofs and silliness of it all - the descent in Las Vegas tops everything - and admire how bald West/Bruckheimer et all brought to the screen. Fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the flight and apllaud at the end. You probably haven't feel this good in ages with a movie in the past decade. Just maybe. 10/10"

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","25 February 2020"," It's so 90s, but in the best way possible
","Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former US Army Ranger, who has been locked up behind bars for years after he accidentally killed a man while defending his wife. But now he's about to be freed. There's only the last remaining prisoner transport flight left. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>The whole idea of Con Air is ludicrous. You have all these over the top bad guys in one airplane. Each of them almost worthy of joining Batman's Rogues Gallery. And then you have the one good guy, who just happens to be there by pure luck and it's up to him to save the day. But you know what, it works. Perhaps I'm more forgiving because it is from the 90s or perhaps they simply knew how to make these plots work back then. Nevertheless, in Con Air the ludicrous tone is a source of strength, not a hindrance.<br/><br/>Especially when it comes to John Malkovich. He plays a character named Cyrus the Virus. What a great name and what a great performance. It shouldn't work. This sleazy, smarmy, snobbish piece of over-articulating rhetoric shouldn't work. But in Malkovich's hands it just flows so naturally. Because it's Malkovich.<br/><br/>I also like Cage's odd accent. I like Steve Buscemi's completely nonsensical and distracting character performance. I like the clich√©dness of John Cusack and Colm Meaney's characters. I like the stunts.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the completely unnecessary fourth act after one of the best ending action scenes I've seen in a while.

Is basically a movie about a bunch of ex-cons and Nicholas cages character Cameron Poe gets stuck on the plane and the ex-convicts take it over. Other than that if you would like to watch the Simpsons I'm sure it is just as funny as this movie. This movie does not have a serious plot not was it ever intended to have one.

","Con Air stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and is what I like to call the second film in the Nick Cage summer trilogy. The film revolves around a former U.S. Ranger who has been released for serving a ten-year sentence for manslaughter. He's about to fly home to see his wife and daughter, but things take a turn for the worst when the passengers take control of the plane. I'll talk go into more detail about it in the first one, but the rundown is is that Nicolas Cage has starred in the Rock, Con Air, and three weeks after this movie he would later star in Face Off. And what's more ironic is that The Rock and Con Air are both produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Now that I have gotten that out of the way lets talk about this movie as a whole. While I enjoyed the concept of the film and how the film didn't take itself seriously it feels like this was split into two groups when it came to the script. Group A was responsible for creating a script that wasn't to be taken seriously, but stilled be enjoyed at the same time and Group B's responsibility was to provide us with some action. And while Group A succeeded in the first half Group B got drunk on testosterone and gave us out of control action that the entire time felt like a competition to see who was tough. And that's where I think the problem lies. Groups A and B couldn't settle on an agreement so they turned this film into a macho ego competition. The only thing that kept it from falling apart was the cast as they try their best to keep this movie on autopilot instead of letting it crash and burn. But the one person that soars above all is Cyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich. He's sadistic, funny, and terrifying all in one that in some strange way I found myself actually liking and cheering him at the same time. I liked John Malkovich in this movie so much that even if the movie did crash and burn I wouldn't stop watching because his performance is terrifyingly fantastic and nobody in the making of Con Air would question him. But the movie isn't that bad as Group A and B finally come together and bring this movie in for a sweet landing. So in the end, while this film may provide some turbulence, it's still a sweet ride to board."

","To anyone out there, good luck trying to make a film anything like this ever again, a cult but also high quality classic of film history (in my personal opinion at least). A stellar cast all delivering performances of their lives despite their seemingly ill fitting placement, Malkovich and Buscemi as serial killers, the latter as a Hannibal Lecter figure, total stroke of genius. It's high octane from start to finish, Cage is likeable once your ears get used to his atrocious accent and the action is perfectly spliced with both moments of humour and an enjoyable concurrent subplot of John Cusack's struggle against his superiors which leads to our explosive final conflict at the air field. Crash landing in the LA strip despite being wildly far fetched is still one of the greatest endings I've ever seen, all scored by a remarkably ill fitting song which somehow gives an operatic value to that closing sequence. Reuniting Cage's family and having a fantastic arc for Buscemi I can't say I've ever been as satisfied when watching a film in my life, total masterpiece"
"phubbs","7","0","0","16 August 2019"," Con Air
","Right, believe it or not but there was a time (the flashy 90's) when Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (and originally Don Simpson) was king of the box office action genre. Spread throughout the 90's we had to endure a string of style over substance action vehicles that were literally all about the visuals and not much else. Kicking off with 'Crimson Tide' then followed by 'Bad Boys', 'The Rock', 'Con Air', 'Armageddon', and finishing with 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' at the start of the millennium.<br/><br/>So let's get down to the brass tacks here, 'Con Air' is essentially a 90's version of 'The Fast and the Furious' franchise, albeit the later movies in that franchise. In fact you could easily have a movie called 'Con Air vs Fast and Furious' and it would totally make sense. Except 'Con Air' was far more manly than that camp Vin Diesel . This movie was all about plosions, guns, muscles, and quips. It was pretty much a man's man movie, no girls allowed. All the blokes in the cinemas watching this were chompin' on Yorkie bars dagnabbit! Your muscles had to be a certain size to even get into the screenings for  sake! Yup, this movie was all about big male balls. Total man stuff, gruff sweaty man muscles, lookin' cool. If any of this offended you then you were outta luck.<br/><br/>But what's funny is the plot is actually kinda original and kinda cool. Unlike the repetitive superhero crap we constantly get now or the yawn-inducing farse that is the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, 'Con Air' actually had a neat little concept. Yeah sure it was still cheesy and made no sense but the basic idea was sound. A special airline for the transportation of criminals gets hijacked by the cons, simple yet effective. Who knew there was such a thing as convict air? Not me. That alone intrigued me to find out more. So yes the premise is a simple hijacking but it still gave you something a bit different.<br/><br/>But aside from guns, muscles, and sweat, this movie was also the perfect recipe for a stunning cast. You've got a plane full of convicts, who can we cast? I know, lets cast all the top characters actors we can muster. Sorted. Let's make no bones about it, this movies cast is highly impressive, even though at the time most were still relatively unknown. Yes tis true, believe it or not but at the time some of these top stars were small fry. Take Danny Trejo for instance, before 'Con Air' he was merely known as that guy who starred in a few Robert Rodriguez flicks as a baddie. Ving Rhames was solely known for 'Pulp Fiction'. Nick Chinlund was merely another background baddie guy. Rachel Ticotin was the chick from 'Total Recall'. And then you had various actors who you probably recognised from various smaller things such as M.C. Gainey, Renoly Santiago, Jesse Borrego, and Steve Eastin.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is ludicrous, utterly flawed in many ways. But this is what has made it something of a cult. The hyperbolic performances are one thing but the plot gaffs, cliches, stereotypes, and decisions are another. For starters, at the start these guys at the bar seem to pick on Cameron Poe (Nic Cage) purely because he's with a pretty woman. They literally act like children and start bullying Poe seemingly because they are jealous. Then later on (after school?) they actually wait for Poe (in the pissing rain) in the carpark so they can beat him up? How long did they wait?? And really?<br/><br/>When Poe is convicted and sent to prison, the minute he walks into the cell block all the prisoners start jeering him...because prison cliches. Also Poe has a workout routine montage...because cliches. Also Poe doesn't seem to get his haircut whilst in prison, why? Yes its prison but I'm sure there are basic facilities for things like that. Not everyone walks around with hair down to their shoulders. You'd also think he'd get it cut before leaving to see his family again.<br/><br/>Then there are many little touches that just beg questions. Vince Larkin (John Cusack) keeps referring to the airliner with the convicts on as 'his plane'. Is it really his plane? Like does he own it or something? He is always worrying about the plane like it's his personal property. What the hell happened to Pinball (Dave Chappelle)? He gets left behind by mistake and whilst attempting to get back on he gets sucked up by the landing gear?? He's literally running by the side of the plane and we are meant to believe he somehow gets caught up in the wheels? Later on we are shown a terribly  Pinball/Chappelle body in the bowels of the plane all in one piece, eh??<br/><br/>At one point more cons are transferred onto the plane during a sandstorm which allows Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and co to wear masks. But what if there hadn't been a sandstorm? What would they have done then? And how come no guards recognised Cyrus or his voice?? When Larkin discovers where the convict plane is heading he races off in DEA agent Malloy's flashy sports car . But where did he get the keys? Then later on in the desert the cops walk into the most obvious trap set by the cons. During the following shootout against the cops, Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) seems to only be interested in raping guard Bishop (Rachel Ticotin).  Then during one of the movies numerous big finales Swamp Thing (M.C. Gainey) must land the plane on the Las Vegas strip. How does this not cause mass chaos destruction and death??<br/><br/>And I guess I have to mention the bizarre death of Cyrus. In another one of the movies big finales, Cyrus and co escape from the downed plane in a fire truck, causing yet more chaos and destruction. Eventually they obviously crash said fire truck (into a construction site) which leads to Cyrus being, somehow, decapitated by some highly dangerous rock crushing machine. The oddity of this death is how Cyrus' body manages to get into this position of being decapitated in the first place; and why exactly a dangerous machine like this is still running at night with no one around supervising.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there is the total curveball of Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi) being touted and paraded around the entire movie as the most dangerous bad guy ever, only to do absolutely nothing. This guy is feared by the badass criminals because he is the killer of killers, but he does zip. Kudos for the setup but what actually is the deal with Greene? What was the point? At one point he clearly states how he once wore the head of one of his victims (a little girl) as a hat through three states. Then later on we see him getting all cozy with this little girl and we are meant to fear the worst. But he doesn't kill her, he doesn't do anything, and then we see him gambling in Vegas right at the end as if he's decided to change his life. But did he? Did he change? Or was this last scene just for laughs? (it totally was).<br/><br/>To be clear, this movie and all involved were aware of what the goal was here. I myself am also aware of what the aim was, what this movie was doing. And by that I mean (in case you haven't already guessed) its a nonstop thrill ride that isn't supposed to be taken seriously. Now whilst you could say that overrides all my points (which it kinda does), that doesn't mean you can't point them out and maybe mention that the movie could have been much much better had these issues been addressed. Take 'The Rock' for example, that's a very similar movie which is in my view the better movie because it's a tad more grounded, at times.<br/><br/>But overall, yeah, sit back, relax, grab some victuals and pop, and strap yourself in for a movie that utterly screams Michael Bay but isn't. High energy, high-octane, fast food, popcorn fodder. The movie doesn't give a rats ass and neither should you, but please take my review into consideration. The not politically correct equivalent to most modern action flicks, well anything with Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson in basically.<br/><br/>7/10"

Cage was a beast. it was funny (chappelle!). there were a few dumb things and some cheesy music but mostly this was an awesome movie (about 5 viewings)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
the way Cyrus the Virus dies at the end is shockingly funny. he gets thrown off a firetruck through two windows, and just so happens to fall on a bunch of wires to get electrocuted, then just so happens to fall onto a treadmill of an assembly line leading to a garbage crusher, then just so happens to fall off of the treadmill in the perfect position for his head to be crushed by the crusher with the rest of his body sprawled out. if the rest of this movie was terrible, this might be the worst villain death ever. but i liked the rest of the movie so i just laughed at it and no longer considered giving this 4 stars.

If you're looking for a logical story, you will be disappointed. That's why some don't like it, you can't take a lot of the material seriously. With that being said, it's such a fun experience. It's about a guy (played by Cage) named Cameron Poe accused of manslaughter after defending his pregnant wife. Years later, he's released and is transported through an airplane with the most dangerous criminals who end up hijacking the plane on the day of his daughter's eighth or ninth birthday. Poe hasn't met his daughter yet and is at the mercy of psychopathic and violent convicts. Will he make it to see his daughter or will he make the wrong move with the criminals?<br/><br/>I like the way they mix action and humor. Despite a laughable story, the actors all do impressive performances and it's exactly what you expect from a Bruckheimer film.

"burlesonjesse5","7","0","0","3 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Con Air
","I have found one of cinema's all time guilty pleasures. I almost chuckle in embarrassment when I tell people I dig this movie. If you looked up the term ""screw loose"" in the dictionary, there would be an image of its hyper kinetic poster front and center. This Dirty Dozen on steroids has got well known, respected actors hamming it up to no end. Its also got snappy, thoughtful, and witty dialogue which is something not normally found in a cheesy action flick. Finally, it has Nicolas Cage, letting the world know that hey, I already won an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas (1996) and I can do whatever the heck I want. <br/><br/>Cage plays army ranger Cameron Poe, a soon to be father who winds up in a federal prison over a bar fight. A drunk messes with his pregnant wife and Poe, using excessive force, accidentally commits murder. He is sentenced to eight years, gets out early for good behavior, and hitches a ride home on a plane full of convicts. Most of them are being transferred and are in the process of doing consecutive life sentences except for Poe. Once he gets off the plane, he is a free man. However, something happens and there is a hijacking by the criminal passengers on board, hence the title, Con Air. <br/><br/>The unique thing about this late 90's exercise in ridiculousness is that despite its caffeinated, testosterone filled action sequences, we find serious actors (John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Steve Buscemi) striving hard to sell scenes that make you wanna take things seriously. I gotta admit though, it can be hard to embrace what's on screen. A lot of the material is less than plausible. I do however, applaud the effort. Basically this is one of those movies where you can forgive its shortcomings based on the likability of most of the characters. Let's face it, they may be nasty criminals but come on, they're a hoot. For instance, let's examine John Malkovich's character being a convicted murderer named ""Cyrus the Virus."" He becomes the leader of the hijackers. He spouts lines like, ""and if you say a word about this over the radio, the next wings you'll see will belong to the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse."" Ah, you gotta love a criminal mastermind who has multiple college doctorates and degrees. Then, you have Ving Rhames as ""Diamond Dog,"" a character who writes a book in prison that may be made into a movie. Federal agent Larkin (Cusack) explains this and also reminds the audience that Denzel Washington is in talks to star. Ah Huh.<br/><br/>With Con Air, you have violent action scenes that have short set ups and even shorter payoffs. This is inter played with biting, sarcastic humor. Cage, almost mumbling his lines with a monumental five o'clock shadow, (I'm thinking he might have been paid per line) exhibits a fearless devil may care attitude because hey, he just wants to get home and embrace the daughter he has never seen before (I'm sure after seeing this flick, you'll probably wanna run out and buy this guy some razors stat).<br/><br/>To end this review, I have a feeling that you will be entertained. Con Air's relentless zing factor will put you through the ringer and slap a big fat smile across your face. If you are looking for a ride this film is your ticket; not first class, but coach and that will do because ultimately you still get to your destination; uninhibited movie going bliss."

From liftoff, it doesn't ever attempt to be the most acclaim worthy movie; that wasn't Con Air's intentioned destination.

The characters from Con Air are in large part what makes it so great. It has great characters, played by great actors. Nicolas Cage is intensely incredible as Cameron Poe. Nicolas Cage is on fire in this movie! Cameron Poe is a badass action hero! No one could of done Cameron better. Cage is a topnotch movie star. John Malkovich hijacks the show with his incorrigible and encouraged performance as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom. John Malkovich is comfortably at his best in Con Air. John Cusack is slick and in heavy gear as good guy, Vince Larkin. John Cusack is such a good guy, too. Steve Bushscemi is scary good as scary bad, Garland Greene. Ving Rhames does fine wingman support as the easy-going Diamond Dog. Danny Trejo does fine wingman support too as the unapproachable and reproachful Johnny-23. Monica Potter fits the build beautifully in her role as Mrs. Poe. Potter has great chemistry with Nic Cage and with John Cusack.

It is simply because of the fact that this movie is filled with extremely satisfying thrilling fast-paced, ultra over-the-top-flying-in -an-airplane-and-fighting, pandemonium high energetic screenplay that results in you probably considering this to be one of the best action movies you've ever seen and that you would like to share with anyone in any way associated with the genre.<br/><br/>However to give whoever's reading this a deeper analysis of the story, let's just say, it isn't what defines this movie. Now don't get me wrong, the story isn't shitty, it is simply a bit basic.<br/><br/>Moving on, I really like this movie and it definitely is not because of the story, the message of it or the may I say its brilliant cast of actors, it's just the great action movie spirit it has and will always have no matter how archaic it eventually will be.<br/><br/>So this was a short, but my first review, and yeah... Hope you like the movie if you decide to watch it otherwise I guess err. Don't like it................<br/><br/>Also, RATE IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","""Con air"" defines the term ""popcorn movie"". It's an action film designed strictly to entertain. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too unbelievable to happen in real life. It's done DELIBERATELY . ""Con Air"" is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish . A genuine escapism. At no point does this film ever take itself seriously. I cant help but feel that people who didn't liked this movie haven't realized the joke.<br/><br/>The movie was inspired by a newspaper article about a plane that transports convicts. The story does have resemblance to ""Die hard"". Anyway , the story is rather thin , full of holes and the characters are one dimensional The screenplay however deserves praise for the dialogues and colorful characters.<br/><br/>Direction by Simon West is great. He has a quick-cut, music-video sensibility . The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities, you might even not notice the plot holes because things are happening so quick. West manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable. West keeps you on the edge of your seat with the non stop action. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. From one devastating climax to another devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. The corny emotional sequences, however, ring completely hollow.<br/><br/>There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( nice good guy) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny ‚Äì as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works).<br/><br/>Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe).<br/><br/>The movie is full of great dialogues and one liners . Here are some of my favourite quotes : ""Define irony: a bunch of idiots dancing around on a plane to a song made famous by a band that died in a plane crash."" And ""Insanity, I'll tell you what insanity is: spending sixty years working in an office only to end up in an old folks home to die an undignified death while trying to get to the toilet ‚Äì that is insanity"" . Who could forget ""Put the bunny down"" or ""He's got the whole world in his hands"".<br/><br/>Non stop action and hundreds of classic one-liners, what's here not to love ? ""Con air"" it's an endlessly re-watchable genuine action movie escapism. Lynrynd Skynryd "" Sweet home Alabama"" is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like ""Con air"" . I give it 7/10."

","one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a ""super max"" prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch."

","Between an Oscar-winning portrayal of a Vegas drunk and an Oscar nominated performance as a tortured screenwriter, Nicholas Cage decided to let out his inner redneck. Cage plays Cameron Powe, Alabama Ranger and monotonal meatsicle who lugs around with his muscles bursting out of a wife-beater. You have to remind yourself that you are not witnessing a live-action depiction of some lesser known Street Fighter character. Cage finds himself on a plane ride with the cream of the criminal crop. And make no mistake, America's most notable ethnic groups are represented. Of course we have the white lifers with daddy issues, but we also have a Latino serial rapist with enough charm to fill three baggage compartments; a Big Bad Black convict who is incarcerated for ...not sure... being big, bad and black (???); and a stone-faced Native American whose only crime seems to be communicating in grunts. The Jewish counterfeiter and Chinese cyber criminal must've been flying Delta. Throw in a Cyrus The Virus ...and yes, he is viciously viral... and a Hannibal Lector disciple who is ‚Äì gasp ‚Äì the moral voice of wisdom in the film and you've got a wham-slam-alabam adventure that will kick you in the balls. And being kicked in the balls never felt so good."

","If you enjoy movies with a lot of fast paced and intense action, some good acting, and a pretty good emotional vibe, then you will probably enjoy ""Con Air"". <br/><br/>Filled in with some top-notch actors (Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi), you believe John Malkovich as the bad guy in this role and I would say that Malkovich probably delivered one of the best performances of a villain in an action movie of all time. You could tell that he was having a blast with the role and Malkovich himself is usually never disappointing whenever he gets an opportunity to have time on screen in any movie he's in. <br/><br/>As for the plot, you don't really rely much on the plot in these sort of movies due to the action scenes that are provided in the film, although I do think that the movie handled itself well and had some pretty good emotional scenes, as well as some great action scenes as well. <br/><br/>7/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","6 August 2012"," ""Con Air"" won't let you take it too seriously
","In the era of the gritty blockbuster actioner, tongue in cheek action has become a lost art in Hollywood. 1997's ""Con Air"" resides between the tongue-in-cheek heyday of the '80s and the explosive realism of today, but it certainly leans toward the former.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage stars as Cameron Poe, an Army Ranger who immediately after returning home to Alabama gets in a brawl with some drunks that turns deadly. He lands in prison, having to wait eight years to finally see his wife and the daughter he's never met. But when parole day finally arrives, his lift home comes in the form of a U.S. marshal max-security aircraft transporting the country's most dangerous criminals. When they manage to overtake the plane, Cameron proves to be the only one capable of thwarting them.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" takes much delight in its concept. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg gleefully crafts an array of criminal characters that are absolute freaks, but not without a large degree of self- awareness as to their rotten nature. Equipped with absurd nicknames such as Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom and Johnny-23 (23 being the number of women he's been convicted of raping), these villains strike a balance between formidable and not to be taken too seriously.<br/><br/>John Malkovich leads the way as Cyrus, a ""learned"" convict who educated himself in prison. Malkovich has fun with his typical over-enunciation and patented snide tone, making him the ideal clich√© mastermind. Ving Rhames plays his right hand and physical compliment, Diamond Dog, a black supremacist of sorts. The other convicts receive boatloads of personality and the script hypes them up ahead of time. Steve Buscemi's Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene even gets the Hannibal Lecter treatment ... yup, Steve Buscemi.<br/><br/>These nut jobs actually make a lion-mained Cage speaking in an awful Southern accent seem totally normal. As ripped as he's ever been in his career, Cage makes for a convincing action hero, though his real strength turns out to be how flips countless one-liners into enjoyable movie quotes. Cage seems to know exactly what kind of a movie he's in and never flinches. Few actors can say the line ""put the bunny back in the box"" with a straight face and get away with it. Cage has always had that gift.<br/><br/>Director Simon West keeps the tone light, but that doesn't mean he also eases up the on the action. ""Con Air"" has a pretty relentless motor and all of its major sequences feel as though they could be the climactic showdown. It could've ended an hour in and been effectively entertaining, so everything in the final hour feels like a bonus. The degree of explosions does get to an absurd level by the end, but that's part of the film's charm.<br/><br/>To some extent, there does feel like a wasted opportunity to create an intense self-contained action thriller aboard the plane. One man trying to stop a plane hijacked by horrific convicts has plenty of potential, but the plane lands three times in the movie, plus John Cusack's character, Larkin, plays the U.S. marshal trying to rectify the disaster and keep an over- zealous DEA agent (Colm Meaney) from jeopardizing his plan.<br/><br/>Helping us stay invested in the outcome is the desire to see Cameron and his daughter meet for the first time. The film spends not 10 minutes setting up the ""relationship"" between the two (Cameron's lone motivation) in hopes we'll care and somehow we do. Care too much, however, and you start to wonder how a guy on parole gets stuck taking a plane full of the worst of the worst and why at one point he elects not to take an easy out. Those are not questions worth wondering.<br/><br/>A lot of action films struggle to cross the border from ridiculous and stupid to tongue in cheek and facetious, but ""Con Air"" is one of them. From the story to West down to the actors, there's an unspoken acknowledgement of exactly what kind of a movie this is and together they churn out one of the '90s finest guilty pleasure action films.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I never liked Nick's old movies but since his maturity as an actor grew after he did the Blockbuster hit ""The Rock"" followed by ""Face Off"", Nick kicks ass in Con Air with his second masterpiece action movie in the 90's era. I highly recommend this to all action movie lovers.<br/><br/>Cyrus the Virus pulls off as a great character played by John Malkovich who is also the Villain. Nick Cage kicks ass everywhere as a bad ass US Ranger. Steve Buscemi as Garlan Greene is a nut-case serial killer who even frighten the crap out of other prisoners including Ving Rhames and Danny Trejo. John Cusack is a US Marshall and many other familiar faces appear in this movie along the way.<br/><br/>Soundtrack and music is spot on, always keeping the audience in suspense, slightly emotional and at the edge of your seat at best of times."

"The-Sarkologist","8","0","0","18 November 2011"," This is one heaps good movie
","This movie is just absolutely brilliant. It is one of the best action movies that I have seen in a long time. There are numerous Hollywood clich√©s in it but they do not spoil what is an absolutely brilliant movie.<br/><br/>The story is simple (as it is with most action movies). Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is a US Ranger that has just retired. He returns to Mobile Alabama to see his wife and is dragged into a fight with the local rough necks. In the fight he accidentally kills one of them. As he is a trained killing machine the Judge sentences him to eight years for involuntary manslaughter. He spends his eight years in jail and writes to a daughter that he has never seen. He is released after eight years and put onto a plane to be flown back home.<br/><br/>Seems simple but there is an added twist. There is a new Maximum security prison opening in Alabama for hardened criminals. The worst criminals in the United States of America are being moved to this prison and they are being taken by plane ‚Äì the same plane which Cameron Poe is on. Almost immediately, these highly intelligent and extremely dangerous criminals break out of their cells and capture the plane. There is a simple solution to the problem, shoot the plane down, and a DEA agent, played by Colm Meanly (he who is Miles O'Brian in Deep Space Nine) wants to do just that. Federal Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusak) wants his plan back in one piece and works to hinder the DEA agent at every turn. Thus the movie takes off.<br/><br/>And take off it does, not just in the literal sense. The movie is full of action; and when action is not the center of the scene then the brilliant cinematography will dazzle you. There was hardly every a dull moment in this movie. Things were happening thick and fast. The lead up was very short ‚Äì throwing the audience into the thick of the action immediately. The criminals were hyper intelligent ‚Äì yet their plans were very fallible: relying on other criminals who turn around and betray them as soon as their path is clear.<br/><br/>The movie has many tense moments ‚Äì putting the audience into the position of a possible horror and then revealing that they horror that its mind had conceived was not as they expected. There are many twists and turns, and unlike most action movies, there is a real danger to the hero Cameron Poe.<br/><br/>Not only are the criminals, lead by Cyrus the Virus (John Malcovich) ‚Äì who I might say played his role brilliantly ‚Äì the bad guys but Colm's DEA agent also turns out to be quite an antagonist. Where the criminals are being actively resisted, the movie passively hinders Colm's character.<br/><br/>Colm's character is worth a mention for many of us who watch Deep Space Nine are very familiar with the kind and shy technician Miles O'Brian. Though Miles is known to have a bit of a temper, in general he is a nice guy. The DEA agent that Colm plays in Con-Air is a complete turn around. Simply put, he is a swearing, arrogant, prick of a DEA agent. His character is a character that the audience is to hate ‚Äì and to mock when things do not go his way. As with most Hollywood movies, Colm's character reconciles with the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>As with Hollywood Clich√©s', there is a bit that I must mention. The bad guy, Cyrus the Virus, dies a spectacular death. There is no back to prison for him. His death was original and spectacular, but in the end unbelievable. Still, Jerry Buckenheimer (the director) retains the all important suspension of disbelief and one feels good that the bad guy has finally met his match.<br/><br/>The money shower is another clich√© that has worked its way into the movie. That is where a truck full of money is hit and money goes flying into the air and lands everywhere. People then come piling in from all over to grab as much money as possible.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is great and it ends well. Buckenheimer creates much anticipation at the end of the movie and the tense moment remains as Cameron Poe lays eyes on his daughter for the first time ever. There is another interesting twist but I will let you see that for yourself.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is what Speed was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Favourite Quote: Insanity, I'll tell you what insanity is: spending sixty years working in an office only to end up in an old folks home to die an undignified death while trying to get to the toilet ‚Äì that is insanity."

","I've heard numerous people saying that Con-Air is their favourite film of all time. Hearing this time after time, i finally decided to watch it when broadcast on the box.<br/><br/>I was expecting the same quality of other classics action films from the 90s like die hard. Sadly however, this doesn't even stand close of it in terms of overall viewing.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, for all the things i love him for, was at times, annoying. I'm not one to judge the accent but either ways, truly annoying . The concept was brilliant and there were some great characters, mainly the convicts. I most interested in watching these baddies killing and blowing stuff up than watching Cage trying to make it out alive to see his wife and daughter again.<br/><br/>The shootout at the deserted airfield deserves merits and the final showdown between Cage and Cyrus was great. The ending on the otherhand, best not to go there but totally understandable with the song choice seeing that this was made in the 90s.<br/><br/>There are some riveting moments ( and some darker moments ) that makes con air enjoyable. My expectations were perhaps set up to high. good to watch on Saturday night."

"dee.reid","10","0","0","8 July 2011"," ""Con Air"" - What a wild ride!
","I have to say that 1997's Jerry Bruckheimer-produced, Simon West-directed ""Con Air"" is one of the best action films to come out during the cynical, seen-it-all late '90s. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too over-the-top to be truly believable and deliberately so. But damn it, is this movie good and endlessly re-watchable - 14 long years after the fact!<br/><br/>True to most Bruckheimer productions (it was only just Bruckheimer at this point because his long-time business partner Don Simpson had only just passed away the year before during their time on 1996's Michael Bay-directed ""The Rock,"" and that film was dedicated to his memory), ""Con Air"" is loud, crazy, and there is not anything even remotely close to resembling a brain cell in sight during its 122-minute running time (this review is based on the extended version). But like I said, damn this movie is really good.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" begins in the aftermath of the U.S. military's Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and U.S. Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) has just returned home to Mobile, Alabama, after his tour of duty overseas. Before he can break out the celebrations with his pregnant wife Tricia (Monica Potter), he gets into a drunken brawl with three locals and kills one of them. An unsympathetic judge sentences Cameron to no less than seven to 10 years behind bars for his crime.<br/><br/>Eight years passes and the day Cameron has eagerly awaited has finally come: he's been paroled, and he's on his way home to reunite with Tricia and see his young daughter Casey (Landry Allbright) for the very first time on her birthday (July 14). He's hitching a ride home on the U.S. Marshal's prisoner-transport plane, The Jailbird, along with his buddy Mike ""Baby-O"" O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). This same flight is a special one, because it is also transporting some of this country's most lethal criminal offenders to a brand-new maximum-security penitentiary in Alabama - a place that has been ""designed to house the worst of the worst... most of these guys are lifers, some on death row,"" one official exclaims.<br/><br/>Some of these ""colorful,"" over-the-top characters Cameron and ""Baby-O"" are sharing this ride with include arsonist and dope addict Joe ""Pinball"" Parker (comedian Dave Chappelle), who is actually one of the least dangerous of all these hardened criminals and is essentially a nice guy; the notorious serial rapist ""Johnny-23"" (Danny Trejo) - ""23"" standing for 23 counts of rape - and who has his eyes set on the flight's sole female, Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin); Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames), a former general in a black militant organization who blew up an NRA meeting; mass murderer William ""Billy Bedlam"" Bedford (Nick Chinlund), who proudly boasts that he's serving eight consecutive life sentences for killing his cheating wife's entire family, even the dog; the soft-spoken, yet weaselly Hannibal Lecter-wannabe Garland Green (the weaselly Steve Buscemi), ""The Marietta Mangler,"" who went on a serial-killing spree that spanned up and down the entire Eastern seaboard; and the notorious criminal mastermind Cyrus ""Cyrus the Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich), ""who likes to brag that he's killed more men than cancer.""<br/><br/>Predictably, some of these convicts, led by ""The Virus,"" get loose during the middle of the flight, kill some of the guards and take control of the plane, which he not-so-subtly re-names ""Con Air"" for a trip to a non-extradition country somewhere south of the border. Cameron and ""Baby-O"" realize they're in way over their heads on this flight. Meanwhile on the ground, U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) clashes with DEA Agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) over how to bring the situation to a resolution that will hopefully please everybody but it appears that the only one capable of saving the day is Cameron.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" is loud, brash, and over-the-top (did I say that it was over-the-top already several times?). It's hard to believe that Michael Bay WASN'T in the director's chair this time, since it contains many of his trademarks including fast editing, crazy characters, outlandish dialogue, stunning action sequences, explosions, car chases, and shootouts. What involvement he had, if any, on this picture is unclear, but it is clear that Simon West definitely took his cues from Bay and definitely knew how to stage the picture in his vain. That goes to show you Bay's influence in movies these days.<br/><br/>Cage is good in another one of his trademark low-key performances, since this action flick was made to cash in on his massive popularity following his Oscar win for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995). It's clear the actor worked pretty hard on his Southern accent and hand-to-hand combat skills as well as his physical appearance in order to beef up for the role. The actors playing the convicts seem to be having the most fun here, though, and let loose with over-the-top (there's that hyphenate again!) theatrics and performances, especially the lunatic criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus played by John Malkovich. He's made a career out of playing creepy, compelling psychopathic bad guys (like in ""In the Line of Fire""), and with his role as the steely-eyed ""The Virus,"" he has more cause to celebrate as this is one of his greatest portrayals of movie villainy.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" is one boldly energetic and exciting action flick. I've seen the movie well over a dozen times since it first came out in 1997 and it's never lost its luster or ability to be exciting, brain-dead entertainment. Trust me, it's one wild ride you'll want to take again and again!<br/><br/>10/10"

","Having just watched Con Air I think the film was everything that I expected there were several good performances, John Malkovich and John Cusack stand out, but Steve Buscemi is also good. <br/><br/>There is also a lot of action which is beautifully directed and gets the adrenaline rushing, the only disappoint was in my view the performance by Nicolas Cage, however this did not particularly surprise me as I am yet to be impressed by his acting. Tell me a person who speaks with a stupid accent thats hard to understand and shows next to no emotion is a good actor? Well loads of people seem to think so, I believe while Nic Cage isn't a bad actor he just seems to be very average and overrated by the mass population.<br/><br/>However having such a poor lead did not ruin my enjoyment of the film, it just made the emotional speeches drag on a bit as I didn't feel anything for what he was saying.<br/><br/>So in conclusion if you like a fast-pace action film with more twists and turns than the spaghetti junction and good supporting actors then watch this, if you want to see a fantastic lead performance don't."

Its easily in the top list of action films with those two films, but though its the same Con Air offers something different.<br/><br/>Con Air is basically the story of Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage)...I know John McClaine and Riggs sound better but just because the main characters name is bad doesn't mean the film is bad...I mean the names can only get better right? Still the film is around him being transported with several other prisoners, the only difference is that hes being set free...so this begs the question why is he with the most wanted guys in America on this plane in the first place? Anyway several minutes into the movie and we meet the other characters but the most important one is the villain Cyrus 'the Virus' (John Malkovich)...I told you the names get better! Anyway because all these prisoners all want to escape and are all as bad as each other they decide to in fact all try to escape! makes sense right? Its at this point we learn that one of the security personnel have in fact done the most stupid of things and taken a gun on board the aircraft (guess who ends up with the gun...YEP...CRYUS).<br/><br/>Anyway as the film progresses along we learn that Cameron is trying to get home to see his daughter whom hes never seen and hes got her a present (wont spoil it for you but its quite important and has some good moments in the film). The film is very much like the other two I mentioned, its fast paced and has loads of memorable moments where Cameron tries to stop the prisoners from stopping him seeing his daughter.<br/><br/>The most memorable thing about the movie though is the sound track its so good and so suited to the environment. The ending is also a real treat after following the main character you finally see one of the most powerful endings in any action adventure film (it will more than likely make you cry). The other thing which is important about this film is the sound track the main song ""How do I live"" is a very very good track and at the end is used to good effect.<br/><br/>This film is by far one of the best Nicolas Cage movies...though he does have several which include Gone in 60 seconds and National Treasure. This film however marks the beginning of his action roles and is one which is easily the best."

","Con Air has all the makings of a good, but not great, action movie. It all begins with Nicolas Cage, having just finished his eight-year prison sentence, taking a plane flight home to his wife and daughter. The plane is affectionately known as the ""Jailbird"", and for good reason, as it's filled with the country's most vicious convicts who are being transported across the country to a maximum-security prison. With ""Cyrus the Virus"" (John Malkovich) engineering the break-out, the rowdy criminals quickly take over the plane and predictable carnage ensues. For the most part, Con Air delivers just what you expect: a really straight-forward plot line, lots of action in the form of explosions and gunfire, and a little comedy mixed in among the mayhem. However, Cage, is really weak in his role as ""all-American good guy"" Cameron Poe, whose prison sentence was the result of him simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In short, Poe is equivalent to Bruce Willis' John McClane and Sylvester Stalone's Rambo, without any hint of personality. One of the aspects that made Die Hard's McClane so popular is that you got the feeling he was getting a great deal of enjoyment out of kicking some bad guy's ass. The same cannot be said for Poe, who is likable, but has no real distinguishing characteristic or edge that makes him memorable. Jon Cusack is also lame as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin, another consummate, yet lifeless, ""good guy."" Colm Meaney, although over the top, at least provides some enthusiasm as a fiery and opinionated DEA agent. Thankfully, the bad guys in Con Air are just as impressive as the good guys are unmemorable. The convicts aboard the plane are for the most part unique and combine effective humor with their evil. Unlike the movie's heroes, they actually have personalities. The colorful cast of convicts, also including Steve Buschemi and even Dave Chappelle, makes Con Air worth watching. Nothing about Con Air is especially amazing, but its bad guys and quick pacing make it an enjoyable, prototypical, action flick to kick back to on a long summer night.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"

","If there is nothing else to do on your wimpy, pathetic, miserable life, then do what most lonely people should do on a Saturday night: check out a mindless action flick. Of course, the trick is, finding an actual good one. The 80s was a decade chock full of them, but the past two decades, we've seen quite a decline on full-powered action movies destined to destroy the plot and still be able to run on fight after gunfight after explosion after unnecessary roughness. The Rundown is an example of an action flick that doesn't allow the plot to conquer the film, and allows for style to conquer substance. The Transporter relies on an extremely simple plot and expands upon it with a long action scene that runs in the second half of the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to blow things up (a lot of things I may add), and while this isn't always good for Hollywood, which doesn't get many films nowadays that can be attributed to the word ""instant classic"" or ""masterpiece,"" the technique does indeed work for this movie; the mindless yet satisfying Con Air.<br/><br/>Con Air has enough action, blood, and guts to make you look away at the screen and wipe off the bloodstains that have suddenly appeared all over your shirt. While being hyper-violent but not a point of losing too much realism, Con Air stands as one of Bruckheimer's best works, director Simon West's best work, and one of the best action movies to come out within the last 15 years. Also, unlike most action movies released in history, this one actually has believable acting, some convincingly tough and creepy convicts, and also doesn't allow the sappy moments to soak in on the running time.<br/><br/>Convicts. Plane. Convicts entering plane. Smart convicts. Hero of story is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Convicts take over. Simple enough? Now, add the fact that more convicts have to enter the plane, add the fact that some feds want to shoot the plane down despite the innocent folks boarding, add the one guy about to die if he doesn't take his insulin, add the one female aboard and a rapist ready for his next victim, and then add the psychotic murderer who scares even the toughest aboard. We get conflict after conflict after conflict; it doesn't end. By the time the movie is over, we'll be able to see four to five fights, one massive gun battle, and a dozen action sequences, some ranging from short, to amazingly loooong.<br/><br/>Scott Rosenberg does a superb job in giving the characters in the film a lot to do, even with the film clocking in at two hours. Also, he doesn't sap the movie up with too many tear-jerking scenes about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) wanting to see his wife and daughter after 8 years. John Malkovich is excellent as the main villain, as he is violent, unsympathetic, yet portrays himself as trigger-happy, when he is much smarter than the impression he gives others. Ving Rhames does his usual awesome performance as the main villain's second-hand man. Rounding out the supporting cast is Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, M.C. Gainey, and also John Cusack.<br/><br/>Con Air takes no prisoners, literally and figuratively. This is a Man's film, and it's not for the easily offended or queasy. This film has it all: good fights, action sequences that stretch beyond the imagination, brutal deaths, amazing gun battles, and then an obsession with pyrotechnics that delivers so many explosions, it almost looks like World War III was going on. The special effects were excellent and was never overused, and rarely did it ever look unrealistic. But for some odd reason, everything flammable that you can possibly think of just happens to show up.<br/><br/>With little time to think about what just happened, you are forced to sit there, like some of the victims in the plane, and go along for a wild ride that seemed to have no end. Nonetheless, it's a better ride than you would expect out of an action movie that has more fire than air in almost every frame. Witty dialogue, nice little twists, well-thought out sequences, and a cleverly creepy scene involving the most psychotic killer and the most innocent of children rounds out the 1997 action blockbuster.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Lowlifes, single men, get off your seat, and rent Con Air. You'll forget your troubles; you'll forget everything that's going on, because this movie won't allow you to think. Instead, you'll be practically forced to sit there and witness all the carnage, all the senseless violence, and all the bitter, no-holds-barred action that is sprinkled upon every single set and scenery in the movie. No, that's not a bad thing at all. Despite the fact that mixing action with good acting and great writing happens so seldom it can be considered a modern-day contradiction, Con Air pulls it off nicely. The movie doesn't take long to start, and once it starts, it will continue flying high on bloodshed up until the very end. This is indeed a Man's film. Before Snakes on a Plane, there were convicts on a plane. Difference is, the snakes didn't have motivation, or weapons of mass destruction. Con Air: please remain seated, and enjoy the trip"

","Once once in many years is a movie released that appeals to the inner soul of a man, makes him think, makes him see the world in a new perspective, forces him to ponder over the little things in life....This is not one of those movies.<br/><br/>This movie defines mind-blowing action, with Nicolas Cage being in the center of it all. First of all, I'd like to say right off that if you want a deep, thought-provoking story, then this is not the movie for you. Con Air works as a stress reliever; filled with explosions, extremely high number of casualties, bombs exploding, planes crashing, karate scenes etc etc.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays as a convict being released. He is set to go to Carson City by air, along with many other hi-profile criminals who are being transferred. He has a wife and a daughter waiting him for him, and he is looking forward to a new beautiful life. But then a slight problem comes in the way. The plane he is in is captured by the criminals, the leader of them being John Malkovich. Now it is up to Nicolas Cage to think of something so that he can get off the plane and see his family again. And then the action starts.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage was brilliant in this movie, he played up to his role extremely well; and Malkovich was excellent as the criminal leader who knows what he is doing, and is extremely good doing it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an excellent summer flick that acts more as eye-candy to the stressed soul who wants to see large scale gunfights and planes crashing. The movie would have been perfect if it had been able to add some twists to the story, but unfortunately the story is as linear as it comes."

","Con-Air is kind of movies that you don't look for a logical script,satisfying character analyzes or lessons for life.You just go and watch the movie.You remember that there were times that movies were just for entertainment.It helps you forget the day and enjoy the moment.And I think Con-Air does it very well,all of the special effects,explosions,gunfights.chases...It's hard to find a minute to breath and focus on another thing. Con-Air is the plane that all 'respected' and 'highly-reputable' criminals of U.S.A. are brought together for a transport.And of course there is a good man who will save the day.The bad guys take the control of the plane so you start to think with all of this cruel gang if there can be a top for the action.<br/><br/>      The script has a lot of senseless points like if there is any way to put all these men together with such a lazy security or every agent in U.S.A. knows 'cutting the root' with exploding something no matter what the cost is the best solution for a problem.But as I said the action is so successful that if writers tried to write the script deeper,there won't be such a big chance to make this adrenaline crush.Seeing this movie I thought that Simon West would be good action-movie director but I still can't believe that is there any chance to make a 'going down' movie like Tomb Raider.Then I figure it out that the key to this movie is the script;it is too smooth.It has no mysteries,puzzles,dialogs to analyze so it lets the director create huge action scenes.Like Tomb Raider,if you try to tell a story,an adventure,too,Simon West is the wrong man.By choosing him you both loose the chance to tell the story or make great action scenes.<br/><br/>     Con-Air is a typical Bruckheimer production:good cast,easy story,smooth script,a director who is familiar with action movies,culture of new generation and of course the explodings that are planned never to stop.After The Rock Bruckheimer chose a different path.I think Con-Air and Pirates Of The Caribbean are the best ones of this period.In movies like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon he tried to tell a story,too.But Michael Bay was the wrong man.To achieve this he finally worked with Gore Verbinski and 'right in target!'.Unlike most of his other productions the bad guys are another topic to speak.These guys are not just characters to be.In this movie Malkovich,Rhames,Trejo and of course Buscemi make the villains to watch.All of the action and humor are on the shoulders of these guys.<br/><br/>     There is no need to speak about the cast very long.There can be great actors but the language of their performance depends on their charisma in this film;except Buscemi.Just for watching Steve Buscemi,this movie is one of the gifted ones.This guy is a great actor and after seeing the movie the longest talk can be about his character.<br/><br/>    I don't say that this movie is a classic.Probably when there is John Woo,it's hard to remember this one.But in 1970's the Michael Caine movies are the purist tone of action movies.Now time has changed.There are special effects,new concepts and audience approach to action in different ways.And I think Con-Air is one of the examples of the pure action movie of these times.Besides sometimes you love a movie just because it's just a movie"

""Con Air"" is wedged somewhere between the two, though closer to ""Die Hard II"" -- you sorta care about a few of the characters, but not enough to stand up and root for them unabashed.  Still, it doesn't really matter, because by the final lap Jerry Bruckheimer has reduced the film to action-mockery and Explosions R Us (the same fate ""The Fifith Element"" suffered).<br/><br/>Bruckheimer, with his late partner Don Simpson, engineered flicks like ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""Days of Thunder"" and ""The Rock"" ¬ñ ""Con Air"" is more of the same; a film that feels more like an arcade-game than a work of art.  It's junk-food cinema for the Nintendo generation.<br/><br/>The star of the show, Nicolas Cage's ex-Army Ranger Cameron Poe, is finally getting out of lock-up after eight years to see his family; imprisoned for defending his pregnant wife in a bar fight and killing a hooligan (personally, froma legal standpoint, I don't see how he could have gotten sent up river, but hey, this is Hollywood).

But guess what -- Poe suddenly finds himself mixed up in a carefully detailed skyjacking masterminded by Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (played unequivocally by Malkovich).  And, as you might guess, Poe becomes a reluctant hero, fighting to thwart Cyrus and his band of ""lifers"" from massacring everyone on board as the damaged plane careens toward disaster on the famed Las Vegas strip. The criminal superstars are probably the best part of the film: there's Malkovich (awesome in every role he's played), black militant Nathan `Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer who arrives on board encased in custom-made restraints patterned after Hannibal Lecter's in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""<br/><br/>The film's most riveting scene comes when Buscemi, the soft-spoken serial-killer, has tea with a little girl who's likely to become his next victim ¬ñ the little girl and he instead sing `He's Got the Whole World In His Hands.'

John Malkovich's character, though sinister, was almost likeable at times. There were comedic moments in this movie.  I liked John Cusack's character and how committed he was to getting that plane on the ground and seeing that Poe remain alive.  I also liked Nicholas Cage's character and his committment to protecting the woman on board and getting insulin for the other convict.  I do feel that Nicholas Cage's southern accent was weak.  I feel he should have either spoken without it or worked with another dialect coach.  However, there were enough strong points in the film to outweigh the weak accent...I just sort of forgot about it and became engrossed in the story."

","First off, I want to say that ""Con Air"" isn't a bad movie. It has lots of great action and I thought all the actors did pretty good jobs. I will admit that Nicolas Cage's accent was hard to listen to but I liked him in this movie. John Cusack was about the same as he is in every movie that he's in but he was good. Steve Buscemi, we could've done without. I like him when he's funny and making people laugh. He's better at doing comedy. Dave Chappelle gave a short comical role and everyone else was pretty much mediocre. But the best performance was that of John Malkovich. He is so good at playing the bad guy. Although it does kinda get old seeing him as the bad guy in just about every movie he's in but he is a very talented actor. He was vicious in this movie! His character (Cyrus the Virus) made me cringe sometimes and he was just downright mean! But he did have some comical lines though. ""Make a move and the bunny gets it!""  I think this movie would've fell flat if he hadn't been cast. The only thing that made me wonder was, why did Cyrus and the other prisoners take the plane hostage? What was their motive? They probably explained it in the movie but I must've missed it. I just didn't understand that part. The scene at the end where Cameron Poe (Cage) meets his daughter for the first time and they start playing the song was sweet and I almost started crying. He was so happy to see his family. Well, all in all I thought ""Con Air"" was a great action movie and all the actors did fine jobs. (Especially Malkovich). But thanks for reading my review! Bye!"

","I really wanted to like this film.  The basic premise of the plot was great and it had a fantastic cast.  But all this seems to have gone to waste. Nicholas Cage's abilities were wasted by a poor script, and let's not go into the accent.  John Cussack also seemed very much out of place, and I felt his character added very little to the story. Okay, it was an action film, but there's no reason why the rather intelligent plot basis couldn't have been expanded into a wholly intelligent film.  Sadly it was riddled with poor jokes, ridiculous sub-plots, and a lot of unnecessary characters and events.<br/><br/>I must however commend John Malkovich for playing a convincing and genuinely menacing psychopath, and for the best part of the film, Steve Buscemi's talents had not gone to waste, even if his character was a little superfluous to the plot.  But that final scene...way to really screw up an average movie.<br/><br/>""Well, he *is* a psychopath and he did kill 30 people, but come on!

","I'm an action movie guy, and I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately, the action itself is hokey and maybe too over-the-top to be believable.

Nicholas Cage is laughable in his performance of a Southern Ranger, but who cares, it adds to the cheesiness of the film, along with the classic oneliners.  The ending is a bit over the top, even for an action movie, but it detracts little from this classic action flick.

","This is an interesting anomaly in the Hollywood Spectrum. Take an overly talented cast (John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi) and make a movie as bad as possible. I do not blame anyone for this movie. Not the writers, not the director, not even Nicholas Cage. Somehow, this movie managed to suck and I don't know how. Outside of Magnolia and Cradle Will Rock, this is one of the most talented ensembles I've ever seen. Take almost anyone of these men (or even Nick Cage in some movies) and you've got a Being John Malcovich or High Fidelity or Pulp Fiction or Ghost World worthy performance. Put them together, and you get Con Air. Not that there aren't funny moments. Steve Buscemi is especially hilarious as a Hannibal Lecter-esque sociopath. But the battle scenes and climactic chase scene all seem rather forced. Mind you, I didn't watch this expecting Citizen Kane. I watched this expecting cheese along the lines of Plan 9 or Chopping Mall. What I get instead are lazy performances from a talented cast who needed a paycheck. As for Nicholas Cage (I had to get to it sooner or later), his character has NO FLAWS. He should have a freaking halo around his head the entire time. Even during a fight scene he is NEVER to blame for anything. If his long-haired hick of a character had any flaws he might be interesting. But, as the previews showed, even when he's in a life-or-death situation, he's more worried about his daughter's stuffed rabbit then anything else. I give it a four just because I can't completely hate a movie with the combined forces of Malkovich, Cusack, Buscemi, and Rhames. Heck, it even had Dave Chapelle being not funny, which is really hard to imagine for anyone who's seen his stand-up special, Killing Them Softly. With this much talent, you can't completely hate the movie. Until next time, this is ToucanBob fighting the good fight."

Accent aside, Cage is fine as paroled con, Cameron Poe (who, of course, had a perfectly good excuse for killing someone and isn't a bad guy at all), but he is overshadowed by John's Cusack & Malkovich.<br/><br/>Malkovich seems to relish playing Cyrus Grissom - the criminally insane sociopath who masterminds the capture of the plane - with an over-the-top flair that is both comic & chilling by turns while Cusack steals the show as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin, who is on the ground struggling to contain the situation and keep his superiors from blowing the plane to bits (the exchanges between him and DEA agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) are particularly note-worthy).<br/><br/>The finale is as over-the-top as you would expect from a Jerry Bruckhemimer production, cramming the maximum possible mayhem into the smallest possible time as the plane crash-lands on the Las Vegas strip, followed by a high speed chase through the city.<br/><br/>Con Air doesn't pretend to be anything other than another fairly mindless action film and, if you watch it with that in mind, you won't be disappointed as (after a slightly slow start which sets up the reason for Cage being in prison) the action doesn't stop and the humour is better than average.<br/><br/>My advice is watch this with friends & a plentiful supply of alcohol for an enjoyably pointless evening in.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Strap yourselves into your seat, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that ""Con Air"" is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.<br/><br/>
Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. ""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.<br/><br/>Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For ""Con Air,"" the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.<br/><br/>Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" He is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt. She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.<br/><br/>Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric. Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.<br/><br/>Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts. With his role as Cyrus, I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.<br/><br/>However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.<br/><br/>Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.<br/><br/>Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.<br/><br/>This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance."

","Disappointing to me, as I am a big fan of some of its closest relatives within the burgeoning action film canon (The Rock, Face Off, Bad Boys, Die Hard with a Vengeance in particular). What distinguishes these films, is that they have a certain style about them: you can look at any number of scenes or shots within them and think 'that's cool'. You cannot do this with Con Air. There are no shots to match those of the Bridge or Alcatraz Island in The Rock for aesthetic and photographic quality; it lacks the choreographed, balletic style of Face-Off and the orchestrated precision of, say, the break-in in Die Hard.. ; and compared to its sibling chase scenes in The Rock and Bad Boys, Con Air's final reel is less a scintillating, grippingly visceral rollercoaster and more a sprawling, unravelling mess. Symptomatic of the film's stylistic failure (and all of these films, with the exception of Face Off, can only be exercises in style) is its (mis)use of music. Whereas Die Hard with.. and Face Off used music at times to remarkable effect, Con Air simply adds Celine Dion in a crass and reprehensible attempt to intensify its romantic scenes. No film worth anything would ever feature Celine Dion in its soundtrack, and no action movie can ever neglect the effect of its soundtrack and retain the sense of style upon which films in the genre must be judged."

I was stunned and could only imagine another committee-decided plot-point here: ""We got 3 votes for impalement on a picket fence, 4 for death by country music, and a whopping 7 for the pile-driver.""  This is exactly the kind of tripe that Itchy and Scratchy was made to parody.<br/><br/>I think that if a movie has big bucks to spend on big actors, big bucks should likewise be spent on good writers and editors who know how to put spit and polish on the movie to make it look good.  If you haven't already seen this, why don't you give it a pass and watch a classic action flick, like Die Hard or Predator."

","Uhhh, this one was kinda like watching Die Hard II but with a Steven Segal type on board with a planeload of whackjobs instead of Willis. I liked it, in an A-Team with dead bodies, more explosions and bigger budget kind of way-but its nothing special. Sure, Malkovich, Cage, Rhames and Buscemi are all big name actors, and yeah, some of them rise to the occasion. For me, it was entertaining enough, but not worth trying to pin down for its loopholes or unrealistic moments. This is a flight of fantasy, pure and simple. Bruckheimer and Cage had done it before-better I might add-in the Rock just a year before, and it shows.<br/><br/>(I Do throw in a couple Spoilers about a Bad Guy at the End, too, warning!!!!)<br/><br/>I got a kick outta seeing the Irish Trek guy as a DEA slug, and then Reverand Alden from Little House on the Prairie sharing space under a truck with Nick Cage. Cusack was pretty good too.<br/><br/>Buscemi's characeter was under-written, I preferred him as Rockhound in Armageddon myself, but always like seeing him of course. Guys like David Chappelle and the big Indian there were good in their parts, stereotyped as they were, ditto the mangy looking Pilot. All of them fine character actors.<br/><br/>Over all, you have to give it some stars for panache and ooomph, esp the overkill way they have of killing off Malkovich, what with the pile driver, fire truck and what-not. They really wanted us to get the point-the guy is a bastard and is quite dead at the end, no doubt.<br/><br/>Cage's southern accent sucked and you really hadda wonder Why they even bothered, but overall he was okay.<br/><br/>I give it **1/2 outta ****, pretty good effort for what it is."

The fastest way to get home to his wife and child is if he takes a plane filled with some of the worst criminals which ever lived.

The criminals are very well thought out, as are the rest of the characters.  Acting from the 3 main leads is very good, but some of the others are fairly ordinary.

So, he has to beat all the crim's, warn the authorities, get control of the plane, and get back to his family."" Oh, brother. Did I mention Jerry Bruckheimer is producing this one?<br/><br/>There are absolutely no prizes for guessing who wins, who loses and who gets the particularly queazy death scene. The outcome is signposted before you even enter the theatre, let alone five minutes in. But be fair, what did you expect? This is gourmet popcorn of the highest order. It rises above lower event films like ID4 and Batman & Robin simply because it has no intention of being anything more than what it is: two hours of violent, funny and very good looking eye candy.<br/><br/>Cage and Cusack do what you expect. They're dudley-do-right's that wouldn't return a library book late. But both of them have their harder sides. Cage is sent to prison for man-slaughter during the credits. BUT HE WAS ONLY ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE AND TO PROTECT HIS FIANCE. Which is pretty much what he does throughout the entire film. Whenever Cage does anything it's either to protect himself or some other helpless person, be they a shackled female prison guard or his prisoner best friend with diabetes. Cage is a great actor but here he's obviously in Bruce Willis sweaty vest mode and plays it to the hilt. Cusack retains a little more dignity but gets less airtime as a result. It's still good to see him in something a little more high-profile than his usual choice but he's obviously just doing it for the self-advertising (it worked).<br/><br/>But the show stealers are the villains. Being a nice guy is okay but it's better to a really cool bad guy instead. This films full of them. Malkovich and Rhames lead the nasties and Malkovich does his In The Line Of Fire routine with more energy than you could believe. Rhames gets to be Marcellus Wallace again. He's happy. The rest are a bunch of straight-to-video faves with stupid names like 'Bedlam' Billy and Johnny 23 but they're evil, sick and marvellously cool. Buscemi cameos with his gibbering Lecter-a-like and almost steals the show from Malkovich. He fails of course. Nobody steals the limelight like John Malkovich.<br/><br/>He's given free reign to do so with a script which has more one liners than plot exposition. Some of them are dumb. Some of them hit the mark. Most of them do the latter by being the former. She the Quotes section for the good ones but Buscemi's definition of irony really stands out: ""A bunch of idiots on a plane singing a song made famous by a band that died in a planecrash."" It's with the script that this film will lose or gain it's audience. Half of you will just roll with it and enjoy the stupidity (such as threats like ""put the bunny back in the box"") while the rest will just wave it off as utter trash. When the script gives way to the action sequences they suceed due to Simon Wests zippy direction. Like a combination of Woo, Scott and Cameron he slo-mos, explodes or machine guns most of the cast and set. Again you'll either enjoy or get bored.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it as the big budget explosion that it obviously was. But I must warn you that this is not the best action film out there. The Rock and Die Hard beat it by miles because sometimes the gags do fall flat, sometimes the cast get a little too hammy and sometimes the ""Oh, pah-lease!' moments get a little too much. The saccharine, sugar-coated beginning and end are a little annoying as well but the ninety-minutes in between make up for that.

"Anonymous_Maxine","7","0","0","17 July 2001"," Not bad for a Bruckheimer production.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Leave it to the destructive clutches of Jerry Bruckheimer to botch even the role of a great actor like Nicholas Cage. Con Air is a very entertaining action film about a bunch of hard criminals who hijack an airplane that is transporting them, and their subsequent efforts to solidify their escape. Nicholas Cage plays the role of Cameron Poe, the guy who was serving time for a crime of self defense, who is so caring that it's cheesy, and who has the most ridiculous fake accent in recent film history, at least until Kevin Costner's fake accent in Thirteen Days. The thing that becomes important is that Poe is on his way home, his time is up, and once the plane reaches its destination, he'll be a free man. Most of the suspense in the film is derived from the fact that he remains on the plane (after having passed up an easy chance to get off) so that he can be the man on the inside for the police, but also (and more importantly) so he can make sure that the real bad guys on the plane don't do too much damage to the plane's crew, male and female alike, as well as to some of the already injured criminals.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage does a good enough job as Cameron Poe, except for that damn accent and the weak script, but as far as acting quality, he is far from the most noteworthy actor in the film. John Malkovich is spectacular as the cold-blooded Cyrus `The Virus' Grissom, and he very effectively takes on the leadership position of the remaining criminals on board the plane. One of the most despicable criminals on the plane is known as `Johnny 23,' named for the number of women that he has raped, played with satisfactory gruesomeness by Danny Trejo, a Quentin Tarantino veteran. Steve Buscemi plays a small role as Garland Greene, who is wheeled onto the plane tied down in true Hannibal Lecter form, and who is one of the quieter and less disruptive criminals on the plane. John Cusack is the cop desperately trying to get back in control of the plane from the ground. He is the one who first figures out that Poe may be his man on the inside.<br/><br/>(spoilers) The action in the film is very well presented and there is clearly no shortage of it. There are excellent gunfight scenes as well as plenty of airborne mayhem, not to mention that crash landing down the strip in Las Vegas at the end of the film. This particular scene was not as well done as many of the other scenes in the film, but it was fun to watch a plane that size crashing down such a large street.<br/><br/>There are, however, several things wrong with the film. Of course, all films have SOMETHING wring with them, but some of the things here were so bad that they just can't be excused. Poe's accent, for one thing, was absolutely unnecessary and did nothing but cut the quality of Nicholas Cage's otherwise good performance in half. Also, sure he was the good guy, but at some points, namely where he is telling Baby-O O'Dell (what a name, by the way), played by Mykelti Williamson of Forrest Gump fame, that he will not let him die, that he's going to be okay, etc. It's nice to see that he cares, but sometimes it gets a little too cheesy.<br/><br/>And, of course, the worst thing in the entire film, there is a scene in the film where Poe drops the body of a guard out the back of the plane, writing a note on the guard's shirt for the police. The body falls though the air and lands on the hood of a car at an intersection between skyscrapers in a big city. A policeman later says that the body landed on the hood of a car in Fresno. I'm not picking this apart just because I've lived in Fresno, but I have to point out that nothing in Fresno looks even CLOSE to that huge city that the body fell into. I'm complaining more about the fact that they must have done no research whatsoever for this movie if they were able to get something that easy to find out about totally wrong.<br/><br/>
Another thing worth complaining about is the way that the script-writers thought that they would do something cute (and they weren't exactly doing a bang-up job up to that point) and have Garland Greene gambling at the end, having escaped from the wreckage undetected and gotten away pretty clean. Hey, that's pretty funny guys, but let's all keep in mind that this is the same guy that killed some little girl and then drove across three states wearing her head as a hat. That's not exactly the kind of person that we want to see go free at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Con Air does manage to escape the almost predestined fate of being some hugely elaborate Hollywood film with wooden characters and a dumbass plot that is so common from Bruckheimer productions (see Armageddon, Gone In 60 Seconds, The Rock, Coyote Ugly, Pearl Harbor, etc.). While not an award winning film in any way, Con Air remains a satisfactory action film that is worth a look."
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","18 July 2001"," CON AIR is a big, noisy, pre-fab summer movie. Yes, it delivers large-scale stunts and lots of hyperactive energy; but after six or so climaxes, it is just plain exhausting.
","Nicholas Cage is the good-guy hero, Cameron Poe, a Southern soldier jailed for killing another man in a fight. He has paid his debt to society after years of separation from his loving wife and daughter. Poe is on his way home on a flight carrying some of the scum of the earth. The script tells us over and over just how bad these hardened criminals are. How bad are they? ""Every creep and freak in the universe, the worst of the worst."" Led by Cyrus ""the Virus"" (John Malkovich), they take over of the airplane (yea right). Also flying business class with Cyrus are demented sex offenders, crackheads, career rapists, murderers, serial killers, a drag queen and a violent black militant. Oh, yes--there is also an attractive female guard handcuffed in the galley for the rapist to drool over throughout the flight. Unlike that other cons-take-over-an-airplane movie, TURBULENCE, these guys don't crash at LAX, but make a spectacular landing on the strip in Las Vegas. The most satisfying moment has the cargo plane taking out the Vegas Hard Rock Cafe. Maybe they should have circled around and aimed for those Golden Arches. I Loved the flying convertible sequence. Excessive violence, excessive pyrotechnics, excessive music and a script in which every word must have been underlined pound viewers into physical submission. The corny emotional sequences, however, ring completely hollow. <br/><br/>Director Simon West, who has graduated from TV commercials, has a quick-cut, music-video sensibility that will grow annoying to those with an attention span longer than five seconds. Oscar-honored Cage adopts a stiff, Alabamy-bound accent, but demonstrates that after THE ROCK and FACE/OFF, he is ready for an action-hero upgrade."

Now being released he finds himself on an aircraft hi-jacked by the worst criminals in America, nicknamed 'Con Air'.  The inevitable happens, of course.<br/><br/>John Malkovich, John Cusack, plus many others, are excellent actors, and steal the show.  They, unfortunately, make Nicholas Cage look wooden, and encourage support for the 'baddies'.<br/><br/>Worse, still, the script tries too hard to involve 'comedy' ala Die Hard. Whilst the 'running gag' does tie the film together a bit, it is really quite risible.  The script also is hampered by Political Correctness, and some of it's assertions on rape are just laughable.

","Lessee, let me get this straight.  Nicholas Cage plays a decorated veteran of the Persian Gulf War.  A Ranger, Cage knows dozens of ways to kill. His first day home, Cage goes to pick up his wife (a luscious Monica Potter), defends himself against three low-lifes, and kills one. Cage is then railroaded into an 8-10 year sentence for involuntary manslaughter (which usually carries about 2-4, most places).  Right, I can see a Southern judge maximum sentencing a decorated veteran with no previous criminal history (or, as the film spells out, a minor one).  But, hey, it gets better.  Cage, a ""model prisoner"" is paroled after 8 years (what, no time off for good behaviour?).  Then, catching a Marshall's flight on his way home (why not have the wife come pick you up?) finds himself aboard a aircraft hijacked by ""Cyrus the Virus"" (John Malcovitch) and the baddest bunch of baddies this side of the WWF (By the way, is this where the casting director GOT these guys?  The casting is the best thing about the movie; these guys really look like mean ""muthas.""  So far, so good; even though the security seems a bit too lax (compared to, say, U.S. MARSHALLS), there's enough clever action (as well as the known incomptence of federal authorities) to let this quibble pass.  It is, however, at this point the movie gets sappy. CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD Cage gives up the perfect opportunity to get off the plane in order to save a ""friend,"" a black con whom is diabetic and will die without his insulin.  This subplot is so condescendingly handled, it plays like a skit borrowed from IN LIVING COLOR. Second, Cage is simply too good at dispatching some really dangerous guys.  Unlike DIE HARD, where the viewer's confidence gradually builds in Bruce Willis, one never doubts Cage can get the job done, no matter how implausible. It gets worse.  When the prison guards find Malcovitch's plans, which he has conveniently left behind, they are blown up by a bomb AFTER they know what he plans to do.  Wouldn't Malcovitch have boobytrapped the OPENING of his little hideaway or destroyed his plans.  Okay, maybe ""Cyrus the Virus"" IS that much of an egotist. Then they throw in Steve Buscemi as this movies' Hannibal Lector, build us up with horror stories, then give Buscemi absolutely nothing to do except wisecrack.  What a shame.  Wouldn't it have been wonderful if Buscemi had been allowed to dispatch one of the major baddies? Further, they expect us to believe the DEA ""hardass"" (Colm Meaney) whom has believed in ""shoot first ..."" during the ENTIRE movie would not shoot down the airplane, when it will likely crash into highly populated Las Vegas with a tremendous loss of life and property.  Ain't gonna happen, folks.<br/><br/>Finally, the movies' dispatching of Malcovitch is so ""Rube Goldbergian,"" I thought someone had slipped in a couple scenes from BOTH TERMINATOR movies.<br/><br/>Good action, performances and a great song (HOW WILL I LIVE WITHOUT YOU?) is not enough.  CON AIR is too manipulative to be believed. CON JOB is more like it."

","This film, sadly, began a string of films in the Nicolas Cage pantheon which I refer to as ""must avoid"" films. Now it is not that I don't think Nicolas Cage can be a good actor. I think he was fine in The Rock, because he played a shlubby scientist who was sort of bumbling his way through action movie heroics with Sean Connery. And more recently I did enjoy Cage in Adaptation. However, in this piece of claptrap he is ""the hero"" Camerone Poe, which is such a fake sounding name, by the way. Then again, it fits, because the whole movie is filled with these paper thin ""bad guys"" who are so one-note jokes. Buscemi is the only one who somewhat elevates the material to something watchable, and even then it's just barely. Monica Potter plays the wife of Cage, and she is nothing but vapid airiness as well. There was nothing to grab a hold of, nothing substantial, and with Cage making these hokey one-liners and swaggering all around with his then recently muscled physique.

","Con Air is the type of movie that separates film-goers into 2 distinct camps: Those who think or dare to say aloud, ""this film has it ALL"" and those who feel as if a chunk of their ""life force"" has been forever stolen. The latter leaves the TV room or, worse, the theatre weak, angry, and sad for the state of cinematic art in the western world. Expertly ruined by director, Simon West, Con Air at first glance has the look and feel of a crummy, jingoistic Michael Bay film, crammed with slo-mo, gratuitous violence, testosterone, low-rent style, and zero substance. We watch, uncaring, as sell-out actor Nick Cage struggles to stay alive in an airborne turbo-prop chock full of prison socio-pathology. He's a former bad boy who's trying to pay his dues in a world that's ""totally out of his control!"" If I had to single out only one defect in this abortion of entertainment, it would be the unnecessarily-large ensemble of otherwise accomplished actors. This is a recent trend in Hollywood: Get a separate actor to over-play each separate emotion in the colorful rainbow of human experience, like in that rocket-powered reel of pure excrement, Armageddon. In Con Air, it's the ""criminal"" version of the trend. One guy is the genius psychopath (the worst on record), another eats faces (the fastest eater of faces around), and so on. In summation, this whole miasma of poorly-conceived, infantile ideas is an insult to a thinking person's intelligence. And, anybody who likes it or had anything to do with its creation should be bashed squarely in the teeth. Insert sound effect of crunching bone here."

He starts to get the upper hand and when one guy attempts to kill him with a knife he grabs the knife and stabs the guy. Isn't that self defense? What kind of lawyer can't get a guy off who is just defending himself from being murdered? What kind of DA would even take that case to trial? The premise that Cage goes to jail for four years on a manslaughter charge is preposterous. He's a war hero. He did nothing wrong. I found it impossible to watch the rest of the movie after seeing that."

","Few movies can be considered dreadful enough to not have any redeeming charecteristics; this is one of them. Nothing could have saved this movie. I am writing this review in a state of rage, anger, embaressment (of having been seen watching the movie), and pain. So where exactly did this movie go wrong? It had a great cast, an all-star cast if you will. The movie had tons of money to spare, as could be seen by the liberal use of the special effects budget and the enormous sums paid out to the numerous big-name actors. Steve Buscemi was in it, and he is in many good movies. So what is wrong. First of all, the acting was dreadful. I sensed that every actor was delivering the lines the same way that a hostage reads his ransom note. They seemed to be in constant pain and were probably kicking themselves for accepting such a poor script. The lines were delivered with a lack of coviction and sense of reality. Now onto to reality; this movie is not reality. The Rock was more realistic than this. Wait...wait Star Wars was more realistic than this. OK, no biggie. Action films are never supposed to coincide perfectly with realism. However this film goes so far from the laws of physics that it is unforgivable. For example, what happens when a motorcyle crashes into a fire truck? That's right: it explodes. Or what happens when a large transport plain crashes in Vegas? Yep, that's right: it skids for a few miles without going off of the road. Furthermore, nothing was ever explained. How was 'The Virus' able to hijack a fire engine and why didn't anybody stop Poe from getting onto the police bike? It's pathetic. Steve Buscemi was another problem. I saw the movie looking up for a short period of time when he appeared, then what happens? He has tea with a little girl and she 'reforms' him. I can't think of something more clich√© than the child reformer. Oh yeah and children should never be allowed to sing in movies, or at all. The ending was so overblown and corny that it became completely unwatchable. I understand that I view this differently than most other folks here, but I couldn't bear to see Poe reunited with his family. I thought this was an action movie not the second coming of the Sugar Plum fairy."

","CON AIR is a very funny, good movie. I don't mean good as in top 250 standard, but good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) gets involved in a fight to defend his wife Trisha (Monica Potter) and is sentenced to seven years in jail. On his flight home are convicts Cyrus 'The Virus' Grisson (John Malkovich), Johnny 23, a rapist (Danny Trejo), there are also others but they're not so important. Later they pick up Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Green (Steve Buscemi). US Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack) tries to intervene whilst his 'buddies' are trying to gun the plane down. That's all you really need to know.<br/><br/>The plane is then taken over by Cyrus and that's where it starts to go wrong. I'm not telling you the ending because that would ruin the film, but I assure you it's a good ending, and there are a few people who cry, me being one of them.<br/><br/>John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi both prove that they can sing, and Steve Buscemi gives by far the best performance, his facial expression barely changes and his character is the most convincing, and he is sort of a 'nice' psycho in a way. Yes, it is a slighty Lecter-inspired performance, (but who cares, Steve Buscemi is a much better actor than Anthony Hopkins). As for Cage's accent, well I'm not American, I've never been to America, and I thought it was pretty good, however I'm sure there are a lot of Americans who would beg to differ.<br/><br/>You don't have to understand the details.

"JohnnyCNote","3","2","6","23 March 2005"," I'd forgotten how stupid this movie is.
","I rented this a while back, and my main recollection was that I didn't pay much attention to it. Having seen it again on TV, I now know why: it failed to keep my attention because the plot was so completely unbelievable. To put it another way, it's a stupid movie. I try to avoid using such terms when reviewing movies, but in this situation it's the most appropriate one.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that I don't enjoy a mindless movie. For example, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" is equally as implausible, but it doesn't take itself very seriously and it's at least entertaining. The plot is clever and Bruce Willis does a good job.<br/><br/>I'm afraid there is virtually nothing redeeming in ""Con Air"". I can forgive such problems as the fact that the real ""Con Air"" uses passenger aircraft rather than converted military cargo planes, or that a released prisoner on his way home would not be flown via the real ""Con Air"". I could even handle the extremely unlikely eventuality of nearly every one of the most dangerous criminals in the US being on one plane, as long as it's done well.<br/><br/>Possible Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>This simply isn't done well. Rather than at least ATTEMPT to be somewhat original, it succumbs to the temptation of using cheap clich√© after clich√©. To name but a few: the Hannibal Lecter clone played by Steve Buscemi (in yet another quirky role); the body falling out of the sky on the hood of a car; the Corvette being pulled behind the plane taking off, then dropping RIGHT IN FRONT of John Cusack and his DEA rival; the armored car that blows up immediately upon impact with a fire truck; Nicholas Cage, who'd been shot, yet 20 minutes later is jumping from a motorcycle onto the same fire truck (and the sloppy editing that tries to convey the idea); the motorcycle that (what a surprise) continues on its course and runs into the back of the fire truck, bursting into flames (where have we seen that before?) and killing one of the bad guys; the false alarm ending of the movie, after the plane has landed in a casino full of people, NOT ONE is killed; the slot machine that starts spewing coins as it's hit by the same plane; etc, etc, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Those are just a few of the MANY, MANY clich√©s in this contender for ""Most Clich√©s per Minute Award"" that contribute to the overall tedious quality of the plot. One thing that I found most baffling was the decision to have Nicholas Cage speak in a (presumably) ""Southern"" accent. I grew up on the South and know Southern accents. His was so bad that it wasn't even laughable. Why did they not simply have him use his own voice? It would have been a slight improvement.<br/><br/>Moving on, I was saddened to see several good actors in this sorry affair. John Malkovich is clearly way above this sort of material. I can see him as a criminal genius, such as in the immeasurably superior ""In the Line of Fire"", where he was chillingly convincing as a troubled ex-CIA agent who taunted Secret Service agent Clint Eastwood. Likewise, John Cusack is NOT an action hero, so when they try to make it look like he can jump from a moving police motorcycle (that conveniently had the key left in the ignition) onto a fire truck (yes, THAT fire truck, and THAT sloppy editing), it's just not the sort of role I expect to see him in. When he's thrown off onto the roof of a car, is he injured, are any bones broken? No way! He's tougher than old Arnie the Terminator himself! He's up on his feet as if it's nothing at all to drop 15+ feet from a fire truck at high speed and land on a car.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. I've seen movies that were bad enough to be entertaining, like ""Firestarter"" or the infamous ""Hot Rods to Hell!"", but this isn't even entertainingly bad. It's just plain bad! Don't waste your time."

","There are great films that will stand the test of time and then there are great ‚Äì FUN ‚Äì films. 'Con Air' is the latter. It may never be committed to the world's film archive as an example of classic Hollywood storytelling, but it deserves its place the annals of nineties action movies. For, if you're looking for one great action film that summed up the decade, then it's 'The Rock' (or possibly 'Speed'). But if you're looking for two or three, then Con Air should definitely be in there.<br/><br/>Where do I start? Oh, yes, the star of the show. And, when I say 'star' I don't mean Nicholas Cage, but the explosions! Everything (and very nearly everyone!) explodes around here. Years before Michael Bay bored us to death with those pretty explosions Con Air did it first (and better!). However, apart from the fireworks, it does boast a really impressive cast to blow things up. Yes, Nick Cage is at the forefront of the carnage and he plays what is actually a bit of a tongue in cheek role straight as they come. He's ably assisted by John Cusack and ‚Äì perhaps more importantly ‚Äì John Malkovich, as he's almost as important as the explosions. The fact is, he's possibly one of the greatest (and possibly under-rated) villains ever to grace the silver screen. He's absolutely fantastically bad, only slightly over the top, but never playing it so much that he becomes unbelievable or a cartoon of himself. Now, it's easy to give all the acting credit to Malkovich, but this 'rogues gallery' of an aeroplane is also packed full of colourful (and completely evil) other prisoners and a special mention to Steve Buscemi who isn't in it for as long as some might wish, but is also fun to watch as a ‚Äì not particularly subtle ‚Äì Hannibal Lecter clone.<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot¬Ö our Nicholas Cage plays a U.S. ranger who returns from active duty to his pregnant wife, only to immediately he embroiled in a bar fight where he ends up killing his assailant. Now mercy is spared here and he ends up being sent to prison for years. Then, and all this is hardly a spoiler as it all happens in practically the first five minutes, when he does get released he only ends up on a prison plane flying across America that gets hijacked by the convicts. Some guys just don't get a break.<br/><br/>I think the reason I find Con Air so watchable is because it's serious, but not dark ‚Äì if that makes sense. It kind of knows that it's being a bit overblown and has some nice moments of humour thrown in there, but it's part of that generation of action film that came because 'uber-serious' action films were forced upon us ('Bourne' franchise and Daniel Craig's Bond ‚Äì I'm looking at you).<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that there are people out there who won't find some enjoyment from this film. Even if you're not a massive fan of any of the stars or action movies in general, this is just such a daft, silly ride then surely you can't help yourself from climbing aboard the plane and going along for a ‚Äì very explosive ‚Äì ride."

"Wuchakk","8","1","2","10 September 2016"," Comic booky pull-out-all-the-stops action/thriller with Nicolas Cage and John Cusack
","Released in 1997 and directed by Simon West, ""Con Air"" is an action/thriller starring Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger and newly paroled ex-con who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane where the hardened cons seize control, led by the brilliantly insane Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich). John Cusack and Colm Meaney co-star as the two conflicting officers in charge of resolving the situation. Some of the more notable cons are played by Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi.<br/><br/>My title blurb says it all: ""Con Air"" is a no-holds-barred action/thriller with a clever sense of humor in the compelling spirit of 1996's ""Broken Arrow,"" although I give ""Con Air"" the edge. Yes, the story's contrived and the movie's overall cartoony, but it's just so kinetic, amusing and well-executed you're inspired to go with it rather than go against it. In fact, you'll probably find yourself hilariously laughing at moments, particularly in the third act. On top of this, the movie shoots for a little depth with the well-done (and amusing) redemption of a certain con.<br/><br/>The weak point is the lack of a quality female role. Sure, there's the guard on the plane played by Rachel Ticotin, but her role is rather one-dimensional; however, I do appreciate a later scene with her and Poe. Monica Potter is on hand as Poe's wife, but her part is limited to standing around looking doe-eyed. Despite this cavil, ""Con Air"" delivers the goods for what it is; and spectacularly so. <br/><br/>The movie runs 115 minutes and was shot in Indiana, Utah, Nevada and California. <br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

","Con Air was one of my favourite movies growing up and to this day I still enjoy watching it from time to time. Con Air was another reason Nicolas Cage was one of my favourite actors as a teenager, although nowadays not so much. Con Air is still enjoyable eye candy with non stop action, explosions, and crackling one liners. John Malkovich is a delight as the lead villain and John Cusack who is normally well known for comedies and dramatic films did great in his first action movie.<br/><br/>Former Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage, The Rock) is sentenced to 10 years in prison after he kills a drunken lout who accosts him and his pregnant wife Trish (Monica Potter, Along Came a Spider), despite the fact Cameron was acting in self defence. After being paroled after 8 years and keen to meet his daughter that he has never met, Cameron is flown to Alabama on board the Jailbird along with a number of dangerous criminals being flown to a new maximum security prison. The assortment of criminals include Cyrus ""Cyrus The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich, In the Line of Fire), Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames, Pulp Fiction), John ""Johnny 23"" Baca (Danny Trejo, Heat), William ""Billy Bedlam"" Bedford (Nick Chinlund, Training Day), Joe ""Pinball"" Parker (Dave Chappelle, The Dave Chappelle Show), ""Swamp Thing"" Williams (M. C. Gainey, Breakdown), and Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi, Boardwalk Empire). While Cameron tries to keep his head down and stop the crisis, he also works to protect his diabetic friend Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson, Forrest Gump) as well as the guards kept hostage including Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin, Total Recall). Meanwhile on the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack, Grosse Point Blank) must also work to stop the criminals from escaping custody however his efforts are hampered by headstrong DEA Agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney, Under Siege) who is eager to have the plane obliterated from the sky.<br/><br/>Following the success of the blockbuster hit The Rock (1996), Nicolas Cage's career kicked into another gear in the late 1990's with Con Air. His accent may be a bit dodgy, but Cage looks impressive after pumping iron for his role as Cameron Poe and getting involved with doing his own stunts. John Cusack who is well known for romantic comedies such as Say Anything...(1989) does a great job as US Marshall Vince Larkin who seems like the only ally he has is Cameron Poe in taking down the dangerous convicts who have seized control of the Jailbird. John Malkovich who has always been a quality actor sinks his teeth into his role as Cyrus the Virus and comes up with all the cool one liners throughout the movie. The rest of the supporting cast including Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi also do a fantastic job in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Simon West makes his directorial debut with Con Air and it is unfortunate that he hasn't hit the same heights of success with his subsequent movies with movies such as The General's Daughter (1999), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and The Expendables 2 (2012). Con Air would also be the first movie produced by the then-newly established Jerry Bruckheimer Studios after Jerry Bruckheimer went solo following the tragic death of his producing partner Don Simpson in 1996.<br/><br/>Con Air is everything that is to like about blockbusting action movies. One where you can just sit back and enjoy all the action. The story and some of the acting may be divisive, but put all of that aside and enjoy the fun.<br/><br/>9/10."
"Mr-Fusion","8","1","2","4 August 2016"," Immensely entertaining
","""Con Air"" is like a nice souvenir from that late-'90s sweet spot when Nicolas Cage action movies were good. For my money, this is his ""road House""; the hair, the accent, the roundhouses. It's impossible to take him seriously (and yet he's the sterling hero of the movie) and that applies to the rest of the movie as a whole. One wrong move, and this could be insultingly stupid, But that move never comes, and the absurdity is somehow very appealing. This is a great cast, spouting macho dialogue to a screaming guitar score; violence and explosions all over the place while Cage's cartoon character stares down every last convict. And the one-liners just come one right after another. Bruckheimer's not usually my cup of tea, but I had a lot of fun with this.<br/><br/>8/10"

This is one of those movies where you see it once and it makes you want to watch it again. This movie consists of a variety of great actors that really make it great which many movie casts do not consist of. The plot keeps the viewer interested, on the edge of there seat and includes a variety of categories from suspense, to a lot of action and comedy scenes that brings the movie together.

It's not a masterpiece by any means but it is enjoyable. The special effects are good.<br/><br/>But all films have faults, and I felt, a few of the characters were not as well written as I would've liked.

"BA_Harrison","8","1","2","24 February 2012"," 1997: a vintage year for Cage.
","I realise that Con Air is about as far from ground-breaking visionary cinema as you can get‚ÄîHell, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which speaks volumes about the artistic integrity involved‚Äîbut as a thrilling slice of slam-bang popcorn action fun, it works a treat.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, an honourable army ranger who is sent to a maximum-security federal penitentiary after accidentally killing a man while protecting his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). After serving eight years, Cameron is finally given parole, and scheduled to fly home on a C-123 Jailbird aircraft, along with several other prisoners whose number include evil criminal mastermind Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and Poe's likable diabetic cell-mate O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). Poe's freedom is delayed however, when Cyrus and his equally vile cohorts take over the plane by force, and O'Dell's life is placed in jeopardy...<br/><br/>Unlike The Rock, which was an overly dramatic and rather jingoistic affair, Con Air is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish. To try and analyse the plot or apply logic to proceedings is futile, the script conveniently glossing over details as and when it suits (for example, we never learn what Cage's cell-mate O was jailed for; as a result, he becomes a sympathetic character, when the guy could have been a child killer for all we know!). Director Simon West sure isn't concerned about his film making sense, 'cos he's too busy having the time of his life inflicting maximum damage on everyone and everything in the most spectacular manner possible. In this film, the rules are 'don't just have a car crash when you can drag it behind a plane on a hook for a while before smashing it onto a runway?' and 'Don't just kill a man when you can kill him and then drop his corpse from several thousand feet onto a moving vehicle?'.<br/><br/>It's stuff like this, coupled with a formidable cast and excellent stunts, pyrotechnics and special effects, that elevate Con Air from the ridiculous to the sublime. I give Con Air a rating of 8 delightfully ruthless maniacs out of 10, making it the second best Nicolas Cage action flick of 1997."

"JamesHitchcock","6","1","2","7 January 2009"," The man who makes the Manson Family look like the Partridge Family
","""Con Air"" was the second of two action-adventure films which Nicholas Cage made in the mid nineties for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, the first being ""The Rock"". (Cage and Bruckheimer were also to work together on the ""National Treasure"" films). In ""The Rock"" Cage's character, Stanley Goodspeed, is an unlikely hero, a scientific nerd who has spent his whole career in the laboratory but who, through an unlikely combination of circumstances, ends up as one of the two men who are left to foil the villains' scheme.<br/><br/>In ""Con Air"" Cage plays a more conventional hero, a former US Ranger named Cameron Poe, who is found guilty of manslaughter after killing a man in a bar-room brawl and sentenced to seven to ten years. Poe was trying to defend his pregnant wife Tricia from a drunken thug, and in real life, even if the authorities had pressed charges, he would have been able to plead self-defence, but doubtless the film-makers wanted to whitewash their hero by making him the victim of a miscarriage of justice rather than a genuine criminal. He is released after eight years, and is scheduled to be flown back to his home in Alabama on a plane belonging to the US Marshal service. Most of the other passengers on the plane are dangerous criminals being transferred to a new maximum security prison. During the flight these prisoners manage to escape, subdue the guards and seize control of the aircraft. As in ""The Rock"", Cage finds himself, through an unlikely combination of circumstances, with the responsibility of foiling the villains' scheme. Moreover, he has to do so before the authorities shoot the plane down.<br/><br/>Cage makes a rather more convincing action hero than in some of his other films, but this is one thriller where the hero tends to be overshadowed by the villains, most of whom are depicted as larger than life. The two most memorable are John Malkovich's ""Cyrus the Virus"", the leader the prisoners in their uprising, and Steve Buscemi's Garland Greene. Cyrus, a ""poster child for the criminally insane"", likes to brag that he has killed more men than cancer. Greene (described as the man who makes the Manson Family look like the Partridge Family) is a serial killer reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, even wearing a similar type of mask. Like Lecter he is soft-spoken and outwardly polite, yet utterly creepy and frightening. There are also good contributions from John Cusack and Colm Meaney as two law enforcement officials of very different character. Meaney plays Duncan Malloy, a gung-ho, overzealous Drug Enforcement Administration official, only slightly less aggressive than the criminals themselves; it is he who wants to shoot down the plane with all on board. Cusack plays Vince Larkin, a more liberal US Marshal.<br/><br/>The film's central premise strikes me as an unlikely one; no doubt if it ever became necessary to move all of America's most deadly criminals to one prison the authorities would transport them separately, by road and under heavy armed guard. Action thrillers, however, do not always have to be realistic, and, as Roger Ebert pointed out, ""Con Air"" is a movie that knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it. For those who like intellectually undemanding thrillers this is a reasonably enjoyable example of the genre, with well handled action sequences. The script also displays a dark, sardonic wit, much of it deriving from the convicts' complete honesty about their crimes. (Johnny 23, a rapist whose nickname derives from the number of his convictions for rape, points out ""It would be Johnny 600 if they knew""). At times it even verges on the surreal, especially during Garland Greene's strange tea party with that little girl. A film in which a serial killer ends up singing the hymn ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"" must have its tongue firmly in its cheek. 6/10"

His ride home: the 'Jailbird', a plane which is also transporting society's vicious murderers to Feltham Penitentiary, Lousiana's toughest maximum security prison. A surprising escape is made on board the plane as the cons seize control of the plane! To me this has to equal Face/Off & The Rock as Cage's best action films! It has excellent characters played to perfection, such as John Malkovich as 'Sirus the Virus', and Steve Buschemi as 'Garland Green' aka 'The Marietta Mangler'. The action races along with little release, and yes it can be seen as a little clich√©, as it's about a good guy has some bad luck to end up in jail, then just when he's going home to his family hits some more bad luck and has to save the day, but I defy anyone not to be impressed when Cage's character continues to storm ahead without flinching, after been shot in the arm.

","Strap yourselves in, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction.<br/><br/>""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.<br/><br/>The ""Con Air"" director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.<br/><br/>Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe.<br/><br/>Monica Potter and young Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.<br/><br/>She may not be a veteran at the time, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proved that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.<br/><br/>Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.<br/><br/>Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.<br/><br/>Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts. I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.<br/><br/>However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.<br/><br/>Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.<br/><br/>Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.<br/><br/>This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance."

I know this movie has been played out, I know that they will keep dishing out more movies like this later in the future....this is just Hollywood driving us batty with all the familiar formula plots and reminding of us of a movie somewhere in the 1970's that carried the same theme. I did however enjoy the end of the movie where Cage is reconnected to the daughter that was just in the womb when the movie started and beginning a new life, with all the cons and criminals and crashed planes scattered and interspersed all throughout Vegas behind.....he's just the typical Eastwood and Wayne riding out into the sunset without the redemption and with a winning touch that soothes us, the audience...once again!!!"

Actually I happened to have watched this movie in 1997 with my siblings, but as a teenager who fancied only comedies, this movie was therefore not very enjoyable back then. However, after watching it for the second time last weekend, I should say Con Air is definitely a 'two thumbs up'. It has lots of action, and although with strong violence and language, the storyline is actually great and quite emotional in the end. Being in prison for 8 years and as a father who has never met his own daughter, u'd imagine how eager Poe would be to go home and meet his family. But when his release came, unfortunately his original flight was delayed and he had to be placed in a transport plane carrying a cargo of convicts including the most dangerous criminals like Cyrus the Virus and his gangs. That's where the action begins. Even though Poe had the opportunity to go out, he decided to stay in the plane in order to help his friend who needed medication, after when his friend's syringes were damaged during the in-flight chaos.<br/><br/>So, in short, Con Air is extremely incredible.

","If you're like me, the summary phrase above probably made you balk a bit. And then you realized something like 'ha ha, it's for like makeup or whatever' )Sound Editing, I believe). But that's kind of my gut reaction to this movie - basically a good ride (I remember seeing it a couple times in the cinema), but, wow, not anything that should ever be referenced as 'good'.<br/><br/>Scenery-chewing (in a good way) by John Malkovich, Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi give this movie what entertainment value it has. All three ham up their performances with the director's (and the audience's) blessing, and clearly had a lot of fun doing this. I can't blame them, as it probably was.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage competes strongly with Dick Van Dyke in the 'Worst On-Screen Accent of All Time' category, with an Alabama drawl that makes me feel like someone's working my cerebellum with a cheese-grater.<br/><br/>John Cusack is slapped in the background, even during scenes in which he's talking. His entire performance is straight-to-cable, and is possibly the biggest downer - we all know he (unlike Cage) could be doing a lot better.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the movie are swallowed by a gaping plot-hole, in order to get Nick Cage ('a really good guy, with some lethal training') aboard Con Air, surrounded by all the evil in the universe. Clearly not comfortable with making him an anti-hero (which would have been infinitely preferable), we're instead stuck watching a pre-credit buildup that stretches one's benign disbelief to the breaking point.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it gets a bonus point for having rocket launchers.

"ajpemort","8","1","2","22 June 2005"," I kept watching
","Via on demand, digital cable, and premium channels, I always have zillions of movies at my fingertips -- but rarely watch any of them for more than a few minutes. The last movie I watched on TV from beginning to end before Con Air was the extraordinary Master and Commander -- I saw it in the theater and liked it even better re-viewing it on HBO on demand. The closest I usually come to watching movies at home are watching some of the great HBO series like Carnivale, which have a movie-like feel to them.<br/><br/>Now Con Air is a silly, formulaic movie. But I found it engaging and entertaining from beginning to end. They throw so much at you that there is plenty to like, unless you're trying to be a movie critic...<br/><br/>It was not a movie that was intended to be taken seriously -- that's obvious as minute by minute the movie gets progressively more over-the-top and fantastic in the second half. You know more or less what's going to happen, the only question is ""how?"" The characters are mere sketches -- Con Air is pure viewing pablum.<br/><br/>But the wonderful cast effortlessly handle their formulaic roles -- and of course the action is non-stop to the point of being ridiculous. I often find that I like 2 star movies more than 4 star ones, dating back to the Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns of the 1960's. I'm generally not watching movies to be educated or to show how much taste I have. I want to have fun!"
"mOVIemAN56","5","1","2","12 June 2005"," Some scenes are ridiculous, some are pointless, and some are pretty cool
","I have a mixed feeling about the 1997 film Con Air. At some points in the film I would just sigh and realize how stupid the part I was watching. At other parts I'd be on the edge of my seat enjoying every second of the action or dialog. And yet at other parts I would yawn and nearly fall asleep. It was pretty weird.<br/><br/>As the story goes, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is a former US ranger preparing to be a father with his wife. But after a late night of drinking his wife keeps getting hounded by a two guys at the bar. Cameron and his wife leave but are attacked outside by the two men. Cameron accidentally kills one of them and soon finds himself in police custody. <br/><br/>He is convicted of manslaughter and sent to do time which he does and is scheduled to be released. On his flight home, on a plane filled with murders, terrorists, and just plain filth of the earth, high-profiled prisoner Cyrus (John Malkovich) sees an opportuntiy to hijack the plane. After a struggle with the guards, the felons seize control of the plane. Not being part of it and just wanting to see his wife and daughter, Cameron makes attempts to contact US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack)who can help him save the guards and felons that have no part in the hijacking.<br/><br/>The film goes from the skies, to the deserts of Nevada, to the main strip of Las Vegas. the action isn't spectacular and highly unbelievable at most scenes. Nicolas Cage isn't exactly my favorite actor but does go from being the usual, boring, weak guy to a tough soldier. The script isn't exactly strong but some scenes are filmed and acted beautifully. John Malkovich is brilliant and is beginning to top my charts as one of the best actors around. <br/><br/>All in all the film wasn't terrible. It could have been a lot better with a little less focus on the man getting back to his wife plot and more of just survival plot. I enjoyed it at some scenes and hated it at others. Nicolas Cage is entertaining is entertaining at the least and does have a tough guy attitude. John Cusack gives a better-then-average performance and is pretty cool at some scenes.<br/><br/>In the end, Con Air just doesn't match up to Cage's previous action flick The Rock (1996) which was pretty awesome. Director Simon West had the right setting but never reaches what he originally set out to do in creating a top action film.<br/><br/>Con Air. Starring: Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack, and Rachel Ticotin.<br/><br/>2 1/2 out of 5 Stars."

","I think, that the characters of the actors where just perfect. i could not think of any other actor on any place in the movie. And what i think was the most interesting thing is that Cyrus the main bad guy was played by an actor who never really a good action actor, he is more of a ""thinker"", than a ""doer"". But in this he was just really good.<br/><br/>Cameron was a little less than i thought, but it was great to see, that he was shown as a father, who can be fight with, and got hurt by 3 drunk man, on the ground... The reason why i think he was a little less than he should be is because his face was not shown the emotion he felt. I mean i know that he was a ranger and as a profession soldier he can not show any of this but he was in the jail for 8 years. And his wife didn't grow old...<br/><br/>But I thing it was just really good..."
"soymilk","8","1","2","30 November 2004"," Main storyline is pretty incidental, it's the subplot that makes this so great
","I must admit, I have a real fascination with this movie, of all movies.<br/><br/>Yes, it's basically a montage of compiled footage featuring large-scale explosions, endless destruction and loads of guys running around with their shirts off (mmm, chick flick!). It has 'camp' written all over it, but at the very least 'Con Air' is refreshingly cool with being that campy and, via its own playful sense of self-awareness, manages to elevate itself to a whole new level of post-modern thrill-ride. There's something about CA which makes it strangely difficult to dislike - it's fast-paced, flowing with catchy dialogue and sharp one-liners, and the entire cast is clearly having a ball. It's good fun in the guilty pleasure sort of way, and were you really expecting a serious, prestigious prison drama?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, if this was all that CA consisted of, I'd still have issues with it. You don't really feel for the hero, played by Nicholas Cage, at any point, which is always a setback, and the means by which they manage to insert him into the scenario, while still keeping him a law-abiding man who just happened to be the 'wrong place at the wrong time', are completely contrived. The editing is often really, really bad, ranging from the dynamic to the just plain choppy and confusing, entailing so many things which just don't add up. It's also an example of one of those action flicks where it simply isn't enough to let your major bad guy die swiftly and gracefully with a single gunshot - good grief no, you gotta have him handcuffed to a speeding fire engine, thrown against some power lines for good measure and, finally, crushed head-first and screaming on a junkyard conveyor belt. If you can't call that OTT, then I don't know what to say.<br/><br/>BUT, this criticism is irrelevant anyhow because, the way I see it, it wasn't really the point of CA. The wanton destruction may be what occupies most of the screen time, but its real purpose is to provide contextual depth for something much more subtle and involving.<br/><br/>Bear with it for the first two fifths or so and you'll start to see a very different kind of story emerging from amidst the mindless rabble. It's the compelling, unnerving, and ultimately very charming story of a notorious serial-killing (but perfectly civil) sociopath named Garland Greene (aka the Marietta Mangler) who, while supposed to be headed for Maximum Security Prison after killing thirty-odd people, instead gets to wander round a trailer park and have a chance meeting with a sweet young girl enjoying a tea party with her dollies. A situation which would make any viewer cry out in dismay, and the guys behind the camera really know how to play on those feelings of appal, but the outcome proves to be unexpected, hilarious, and even a fair deal poignant if you read between the lines.<br/><br/>What's so eerily disarming about Garland Greene is that he seems worlds apart from anything else around him. Infamous enough to make even the most vindictive of those cons tremble, he's happy for the most part just to sit back and make wry observations on this unexpected in-flight entertainment. He's twisted alright, and deeply disturbed (about as much as the handle 'Marietta Mangler' implies) but so charismatic at the same time. If you didn't know advance what he'd done, and what he was still capable of doing, would you see him as anything other than an innocuous, witty, lonely man who perhaps lacks a few basic social skills? A lot of it comes down to the sheer brilliance of his portrayal. Steve Buscemi was the PERFECT choice for this role - I can't imagine anyone else who could've handled it better. He nails the part right down to every last eye movement and facial twitch, and this movie is a telling testament to his genius.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of viewers were puzzled by Garland's presence in the movie. He doesn't really contribute much to the main storyline, in spite of getting first dibs on the best lines, and the whole thing with the young girl at first might seem like little more than a weird tangent designed to punctuate the airfield showdown and build up extra tension while it's at it, but I beg to differ - I think the writers knew full well where they were going with this. First, we have Garland admitting to the girl straight out that he is indeed 'sick' (this rather goes against what he previously told Cameron on the flight), then, the beautifully ironic moment where he reveals that he already knows the lyrics to 'He's got the whole world in his hands' (it's beautiful in its own way). I like to think that, while the other cons were off waging their high-testosterone civil war on the airfield only metres away, thanks to the openness of this unsuspecting kid, Garland was able to recapture a moment of his own lost innocence - a brilliant contrast and probably the greatest irony of it all.<br/><br/>And that's what I love about CA. It's one of those movies that seems to be making its point by having the subplot intentionally better than the main one. A lonesome search for stability in a milieu where there is no compassion, logic or control - it's a unique and interesting approach that makes the entire picture well-worth your time, and definitely my favourite movie to have Bruckheimer's notorious name on it.<br/><br/>In short, this is guilty pleasure popcorn viewing at its most entrancing, and with the Mangler on board it adds more than just a sprinkling of substance and extra reason to watch. Personally I was very pleased with the last few moments, which proved a subversively feel-good surprise. A little unconventional, but I guess it's Garland's reward for making this otherwise standard action romp such compelling viewing."

But this film, despite its actors, is actually an encore of the standard Jerry Bruckheimer action escapism, or in other words, just-action-no-real-brains.

","Con Air must be said to be a genuine action flick. Jerry Bruckheimer really knows how to impress his audience, with previous action hits like The Rock and Top Gun, and now Con Air. Scott Rosenberg's electric screenplay is the aspect of Con Air that really sets it alone. Smart, inventive, and downright entertaining, Rosenberg presents a story that takes us back to films like The Wild Bunch and the Dirty Dozen, where we get to know all the characters and get to like them all too. Bruckheimer and director Simon West really pile on the hardware, and make Con Air one of the most appealing and best looking films of 1997. The aspect of maximum security prisoners- including murderers, rapists, and serial killers- really appeals to teenage audiences. But despite their crimes, the characters become quite lovable, which then turns Con Air into an action/comedy. Spectacular action scenes on the plane, in the desert, and most importantly, Las Vegas, really make Con Air a top action movie. Although containing some love scenes, it doesn't drag Con Air down much more than any other movie. Con Air's film editing is quick and effective, adding another action movie aspect to it. Con Air really gets the audience involved in the movie, and never lets the audience stop and think. It's real in-your-face action, which never lets up. Con Air is really a prime example of the action genre."

","I personally do not like Con Air, not seeing it as a good movie. I think that its premise it is too silly and I did not believe it as a film.<br/><br/>The plot of Con Air is that ex-US Ranger and war veteran Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) protects his pregnant wife from two drunks, and accidentally kills one of them. He pleads manslaughter, but gets the maximum sentence. He ends up going to the maximum security prison San Quetin in California. When Cameron serves his sentence he goes on a prison plane back to Alabama, with dangerous criminals including terrorists, murderers and rapists. One criminal, Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich) leads the criminals to over take the plane and negotiate with the FBI to let them go to a foreign country and disappear. But Cameron is on hand to help stop this, and works with the FBI to get the plane back on track.<br/><br/>I don't have a great knowledge of the American legal and prison system, but I find that some of the aspect of the film too silly. Examples are that Cameron gets the maximum sentence considering his case, that the US prison system would transport a lot of prisons on plane, which in itself is dumb, but also use idiotic that there were only a few guards, with no major weapons. The plot of the film too implausible. I don't see why the Americans needed to transport the prisoners, and why when the prisoners took over the plane that the Americans didn't just send the Air Force to shot it down. I know that it wouldn't have made a very romantic film, that's what would have really happened. There is a lot that happens in this film that feels that you need to suspend belief to accept it, like the plane clash landing in Las Vegas. The writing is very weak, I did not believe in the film and some aspects of the story are force, especially Cameron's relationship with his daughter. I also doubt that the writer did much research for this film and it may as well have been written by a computer. The biggest problem was the character Cyrus the Virus and John Malkovich pretty much stole the show. He was good in this film and I thought that he should have been used as a villain in another film. It is high to sympathy with some of the characters, considering the crimes they committed. But at the same time Cyrus is the best think in this film There was also a good cast in this film, having good actors like Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, John Cusack, Danny Trejo and of course Malkovich.

"thesar-2","2","1","4","3 May 2015"," A Vegas Con
","This is a movie I saw once, back in the theatres in 1997 when it was released, I hated it, had a strong opinion on it and just never thought I would ever see again. Thanks to the great podcast, How Did This Get Made?, reviewing this movie, I broke that last promise. (It's always best to watch the movie they cover in order to follow their hilarious commentary on the feature.) Anyhoo, there are just too many things both wrong and boring about this movie, but suffice to say, my 18-year complaint was the enormous continuity errors involving the climactic battle in Las Vegas:<br/><br/>1: As the plane is crashing down onto Las Vegas Blvd, it passes the Stratosphere and immediately crashes into the Hard Rock neon giant guitar¬Öwhich is 5 miles away.<br/><br/>2. Following that, they are back on the strip and crashes into a casino¬Ö that hasn't been there in just about a year in 1997: The Sands.<br/><br/>3. Once the convicts exit the crash site, they steal vehicles and within seconds, they're on the old strip¬Öwhich is 5 miles away.<br/><br/>4. Somehow once on the old strip, they manage to enter the airport tunnel¬Öthat's not just 5 miles away, it somehow expands three times its actual length.<br/><br/>5. And...then they're magically back on the old strip upon leaving said tunnel from 5 miles away. <br/><br/>This movie really isn't worth reviewing, but getting Vegas wrong in movies and TV gets me cranky. And for those of you who say: Well, not everyone's been there, so not everyone would know. Well, I say: I have never been to New York City, but I do know I can't walk from Central Park and within 3 seconds I'm in Long Island, and then take a left and end up at the Statue of Liberty and then jog a bit to Queens and turn around to be on Staten Island. <br/><br/>To really screw up Las Vegas like that is just pure laziness and an insult to moviegoers. Oh, and really the rest of the movie sucked. So skip it!"

","Strap yourselves in, fasten your seatbelts and prepare for one of the most exhilarating thrill rides of your life as ""Con Air"" takes you on a two-hour adventure that includes an all-star cast, powerful action sequences and great direction. Everyone will be glad to learn that ""Con Air"" is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.<br/><br/>Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. ""Con Air"" revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.<br/><br/>Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For ""Con Air,"" the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in ""Con Air."" Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.<br/><br/>Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in ""It Could Happen To You"" and Moonstruck"" to dramatic roles in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" to comedic roles in ""Trapped In Paradise"" and ""Guarding Tess."" Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.<br/><br/>She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.<br/><br/>Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.<br/><br/>Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.<br/><br/>Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in ""Con Air,"" he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts.I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.<br/><br/>However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board ""The Jailbird."" John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.<br/><br/>Another aspect of ""Con Air"" I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Con Air"" is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.<br/><br/>Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called ""How Do I Live."" It remains my favorite song even today, five years after ""Con Air"" was released.<br/><br/>This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see ""Con Air"" for a great action film with substance."
"that_bloke","10","1","4","19 February 2003"," A brilliant film with action throughout
","'Con Air' is one of those movies where, no matter how many times you've seen it before, you still find it very entertaining. It's not like a murder film where once you've seen it, you know who did the murder and it wrecks it, because you already know that the good guys are going to win at the end.<br/><br/>I've looked long and hard to find a film where there is action all the way through with a really good storyline, and although a bit unrealistic, 'Con Air' certainly does have them. Obviously it's not the only one, but I find that with films like 'Lethal Weapon', although it's another good film, it takes a while for the action to start.<br/><br/>The film is about a man, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) who was imprisoned for manslaughter, When he is released, he flies home on a plane with a group of criminals and terrorists who take control of the plane. It's up to Poe to regain control, and make sure the bad guys don't escape... and he does just that... except for one man!! It does have some funny bits in it which all add to making it a good film.<br/><br/>I've never found another film as enjoyable as 'Con Air' and I doubt I ever will. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!!"

","'Con Air' represents everything wrong with the action film genre. Granted, I loved the Die Hards and some of Arnold's work, but this film is just way too much in terms of ridiculous logic and loud bang-bangs. The plot involves a too-good-to-be-true wrongly accused prisoner (of course he has no true flaws) played by Nicholas Cage, on his way home after being released. He can't wait to see his wife and daughter, but one problem: he is put on a plane with a group of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including John Malkovich as Cyrus 'the Virus' who have plans of their own. (old John was clearly collecting a good pay check here to pay off that mansion.) Others in the gang include Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and Danny Trejo. You might say this is an impressive cast in an opressive story. Even more absurd is Cage's southern accent that makes Dennis Quaid's Any Given Sunday accent look as authentic as a NASCAR driver's. This movie is non-stop catch phrases and explosions, the kind of thing that pays John Woo's bills and makes a ton at the box office. I'm all in favor of selling out every once in a while. Hell, like the Tupac song says ""Hey, I gotta get paid.""... But 'Con Air' is on a level of it's own. It's dumb, real dumb. Mind-numbing dumbness. If you make it through the film, you're in a for a real treat of an ending. This is laughable: Cage gets to see his family (CUE THE SAPPY POP-LOVE MUSIC!!). You're sitting there thinking this can't be not a parody, but it's true...and I don't get why they make Steve Buscemi's character, the sickest of all the criminals get away at the end!! The movie makes you want to cheer for him and laugh as he gambles in the films last shot at a casino. WHy should we all of a sudden like this guy..he eats CHILDREN!!! The bottom line is there is no bottom line: the movie just sinks and sinks into bad-movie Hell. ""Cy-Anorra""... 3 stars out of 10."

","Con Air (1997): Dir: Simon West / Cast: Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, John Cusack, Mykelti Williamson, Steve Buscemi: Mindless geek show compiling more disbelief than most fairy tales. Every dangerous criminal alive is being transported by plane with Cameron Poe being the hero. He served time for a drunken brawl that left someone dead, and he anticipates being released by his daughter's birthday. The criminals take over and land in the midst of a shootout. Standard setup used before in films such as The Delta Force and Executive Decision. It is so pointlessly loud that a construction crew couldn't drown it out. Concluding reference to The Silence of the Lambs is lame with its pointless cannibal character. Other stupid scenes feature a gambling machine that comes up all sevens when the plane rampaging through. Directional debut for Simon West with tremendous production and a lot of noise. Nicolas Cage holds his own in a sympathetic role but John Malkovich is basically the standard head honcho villain as Cyrus the Virus. John Cusack is limited as Poe's contact whom attempts to maintain some sort of order. Mykelti Williamson plays an inmate needing medical treatment. Steve Buscemi has the pointless Hannibal Lecter role and it should have been dropped from the script let alone the plane.

Although it does contain some competent special effects and a few shining moments at the hands of John Malcovich, John Cusak, and Steve Buscemi, these brief temptations of satisfaction only make the viewer wonder why these outstanding actors chose to participate in such a foul heap of Hollywood dung.

","Whatever happened to the ""Raising Arizona"" Nick Cage? From the looks of this, he's gone forever. It goes something like this: good guy, murder, prison, bad guys, murder, explosions. Oh yeah, and there's an airplane. The dialogue was unbelievably horrible-- the physical equivalent of being punched in the head repeatedly-- and Cage's accent is a joke. Even this cast of notoriously great actors couldn't get past the script. I realize that action movies aren't supposed to be plausible, but *please*... I'm not that stupid."
"jboothmillard","7","1","10","12 July 2005"," Con Air
","This is a fantastic action crime thriller film from director Simon West (The General's Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Basically many of America's most violent criminals society has created are being flown the toughest maximum security prison/facility ever built. These criminals include: Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames) - life sentence for murder, William 'Billy Bedlam' Bedford (Nick Chinlund), and the most deadly, who has done almost everything, Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (a fantastic John Malkovich). All these criminals are going away, besides paroled ex-U.S. Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), heading home to his wife Tricia (Monica Potter) and daughter Casey. Along with the police and army, U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) is making sure the flight goes smoothly. Soon enough though, the criminals manage to escape their locks and the plane is now in their hands, and are now heading to another airport for freedom. They do stop off to get more criminals, including the deadly serial killer Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene (a sinister Steve Buscemi), but then they are off again, and the feds are trying everything they can to catch them, while Larkin is trying to stop them himself and save Poe, who did not leave the plane when he had the chance. The best line of the film in my opinion is when Cage says ""I'm gonna save the f***in' day!"" Also starring Colm Meaney as DEA Agent Duncan Malloy, Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Guard Sally Bishop, The Nutty Professor's Dave Chappelle as Joe 'Pinball' Parker, Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson as Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell and Desperado's Danny Trejo as Johnny 'Johnny-23' Baca. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""How Do I Live"" and Best Sound. John Malkovich was number 59, John Cusack number 48 and Nicolas Cage number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Malkovich was also number 53 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!"

","The whole point of this movie is to enjoy over the top dialogue and situations. I watched this movie originally in 97 and it is still my pick me up movie next to Top Gun when I want to enjoy pure Hollywood cheesy drama/comedy.<br/><br/>If you want top notch effects and subtle drama this is not your movie. Here Nicolas Cage and John Cusack are the perfect heroic figures you dream when you are 13 years old and somebody gives you a budget to create a movie. From this view the movie is pure genius.<br/><br/>Cage plays the role of the good guy caugth in bad situations that land him in jail and in the Con Air flight that is supposed to move the worst criminals of the nation to a new supermax. All the story details of the movie pretty much do not make any sense in reality, but as movie tropes they are very entertaining. <br/><br/>This movie has all the movie tropes you can pack: from Cage writing love letters to his daugther explainig to an innocent mind how in jail you don't have playtime, to a prisoner that has to be transported Hannibal Lecter style but turns out to be a sweet philosophical guy. Malkovitch is the perfect mastermind sicopath criminal that has to be witty to boot. Many of the characters are overacted in a very effective way to make the movie hilarious even when you know that they are doing it intentionally.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action, physical comedy, puns all over, innocent people being as pure as the criminals being cheesily bad to make this a very entertaining movie. The ending could not be better with the non sequitur landing on Vegas strip. You know this scene does not make any sense, but it is part of the over the topness of the movie and therefore is a perfect fit for all the other exagerations. The villain -Cirus the Virus- is so evil that he has to go over several painful ways to kill him when you know that only one of them was necessary, but he is close to immortal so he needs to be killed several times.<br/><br/>And to top the cheesines Cage has to rescue a dirty bunny from the sewer to have a proper birthday present to his daughter. The scene where Cirus makes a threat to the bunny has to be one of the most hilarious things ever if you buy into the overly theatricness of the movie. <br/><br/>To me the greatness of the film resides on the playful way it uses a lot of classic cliches in an intentional way to push your buttons without insulting you as a viewer as you are into the joke all the time. This is not a movie to be taken seriously and at the same time it can be very smart when you notice how all the details are shown to maximize the epicness of the story. So please if you haven't watch this give it a chance, all the sillyness and outragoeusness is played masterfully and you will have a good time."

","I recently had the pleasure of listening to Chad Dukes discuss CON AIR on his podcast and it prompted me to get out my own DVD copy and watch it again for the first time in many years and was pleased to discover that it was just as great as the first time I saw it back in the theater in that long ago summer of 1997. But seeing it again made me a little sad, as it is now a stark reminder that the old clich√É¬© is very apt in this case: they just don't make them like this anymore.<br/><br/>Looking back now, it's clear CON AIR was the high water mark of the Golden Age of the Action Movie, the era that gave us SPEED, THE ROCK, AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and the first couple of DIE HARD sequels; the kind of films that made Jerry Bruckheimer a fan favorite. These movies were cheerfully over the top in the way good comic books are; filled with great dialog, scenes of mass destruction where every explosion looks like a huge gas tank going up with along with tough guys trying to annihilate each with everything from bullet spewing automatic weapons to wicked looking knives, and if nothing else, their fists. These were movies based on a ridiculous and improbable premise that served as a perfect hook for a easy to please audience yearning for good entertainment. <br/><br/>The hook for CON AIR was Nicholas Cage's Cameron Poe, a good man who caught a bad break which landed him in a tight situation where he has to be a hero if he wants to get home to his wife and daughter. Poe, a hero of the Persian Gulf War, accidentally kills a drunken lout in a bar fight and inexplicably ends up in Federal Prison; when he finally wins parole, Poe gets a ride home on a prison flight filled with some of the worst criminals ever put in solitary confinement. Things go south in mid air when John Malkovich's Cyrus Grissom, a brilliant criminal mastermind leads the rest of the very hardened criminal passengers in a successful plan to take over the plane and escape across the border. On the ground, US Marshall, Vince Larkin, played by John Cusack, is desperately trying to find a way to get the plane back, the prisoners recaptured and do so despite the incompetent interference of superiors and co-workers. This sets off a convoluted plot filled with narrow escapes just in time, epic confrontations, ambushes, double crosses, and a showdown on the Vegas strip that is wonderfully over the top as Simon West's script works overtime to top itself.<br/><br/>The big pull for CON AIR has always been the violence, which is excellently staged, not only in the fore mentioned Vegas Strip finale, but especially in the middle section of the film when the plane puts down at the isolated desert airport. But every true fan of the film knows that the movie's real strength is the performances, which gives some great actors plenty of scenery to chew and spit out. Cage was at the height of his stardom in the mid 90's, having just won the Oscar for LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and was considered a serious actor at the time; Cameron Poe gave him a great opportunity to use some of his best tricks, starting with an affected Southern accent that is impossible to forget. At first, the laid back Cusack seemed an odd choice for an action blockbuster, but it proved to be a piece of inspired casting as Cusack's distinct style of cool intensity proved to be perfect fit with the overwrought eye rolling of his co stars.<br/><br/>By some accounts, Malkovich was less than happy with his villain role and the project itself as a whole, if so, it doesn't show up on the screen; he commits totally to the role of Cyrus the Virus.<br/><br/>Then there are the great acting contributions by Ving Rhames, Nick Chinlund, Danny Trejo, Colm Meaney, the young Dave Chappelle, Kevin Gage, M.C. Gainey, Conrad Goode, Ty Granderson, Rachel Ticotin, Mykelti Williamson, and two great character stars: Don Davis and Dabs Greer. But the icing on the cake is still Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, the detached serial killer who sits back utterly amused at it all; his conversations with Poe are classic bits, as is Greene's unnerving ""tea party"" with the little girl. How great is it that the worst of the worst seems to be the sanest of the lot and is the only one to actually get away in a great final scene. <br/><br/>Yet watching CON AIR now makes me painfully aware of the passage of time, I agree with those who point out that if it came out today, the ridiculous plot twists and over the top action pieces would be picked apart on social media Friday night of opening weekend while Millennials would no doubt be horrified by some of the crude racial epitaphs thrown back and forth by the inmates. In the post 9/11 era, the action movie would become darker and much more serious, Cameron Poe would be replaced by Jason Bourne and a movie about a plane hijacked by criminals would not be considered fun. Even the villains would change, where in the 90's, great bad guys like Cyrus the Virus were cousins of Hannibal Lector, while now they are some variation on a terrorist. Though Nicolas Cage had a great summer in 1997, starring in both CON AIR, and that other action classic, FACE OFF, in the years ahead, a series of bombs and bad role choices along with an increasing tendency to over act would turn him into a punch line."

Poe spends all his time looking for insulin for a convict with diabetes while scores of soldiers are being machine gunned all around him. The aircraft crashes along the strip in Las Vegas, killing untold numbers of men, women and children and wrecking several casinos to save a couple of convicts and ex convicts and of course the ""damsel in distress"" the female police woman. I watched this movie to the end because I just didn't believe how bad it could be, not even amusing I'm afraid.

There was a time in big budget film when viewers were required to think even a tad little bit to understand what is occurring on screen. Not now. Instead it is ""tell me 100% instead of ""show me."" The screen play writing that must have occurred: ""OK...all the convicts are getting on the plane. We must tell the audience exactly who the characters are. We do this by having the supposedly good cops list off simplistic statements while the convicts go from bus to plane and are superfluously searched by a bigoted guard making statements to bring the characters to life.""<br/><br/>Almost every statement that anyone makes in the film shall be a single line of snappy dialog. We will allow for a couple lines to set up the mastermind of the operation. He is a (I can almost quote the film exactly because the dialog is so banal) 'product of the criminal system having lived his whole life in it...a moron who was illiterate when he came in and now has a law degree...and killed like 20 people both in and outside the prison system.' He gets locked in the cage like an animal. He and Hero Nick Cage have a single line of hate with each other to set up that they will not get along.<br/><br/>We have the line up introduced.

All the while what are basically voice overs with a shot of human body to occupy the screen say things like: ""This one is so bad...(cue the audience to say ""How bad was he?"" like Gene Rayburn on Match game episode)...""he did this and that evil thing."" All the while the whole set up going on of loading this plane of prisoners is so incredibly ridiculous in premise that my head was beating itself on the wall. Unless there is a need to have all these incredibly evil men...with one good guy...to be transported by air all at once...so that they can all go to the exact same place...there is no way that this could happen.<br/><br/>So...you must believe that people in law enforcement are incredibly stupid. They say and do incredibly stupid things and are very one dimensional. I mean, if you are transporting the ""unholiest of unholies (save one)"" then wouldn't the crew already know who is being transported BEFORE the arrival at the airplane? Wouldn't they have a staff meeting to do some prisoner planning and contingency planning? And what about the guy in a cage on an airplane for a few hours? What if he has...oh...an accident of mother nature while in the cage? Would you really want this person escorted to the bathroom on a flying airplane? Wouldn't the ACLU be up in arms about cruel and inhuman punishment?<br/><br/>""Suspension of Belief"" is something that usually requires a an audience to have suspend belief. Con Air doesn't require that to happen. It gets more and more ridiculous as stupid decision is compounded by stupid decision to make the big explosions and fight scenes occur. If you have no belief to suspend you will love it. Otherwise you will find it painful."

","The attempts at drama and characterization in ""Con Air"" are exceptionally hollow and simplistic. There is not a hint of logic through the entire screenplay. The cast is made up of big names who barely bother with the acting side of things at all, and Nick Cage's southern drawl and put-on everyman badassery doesn't exactly qualify as a good performance. There are also several shots which are downright bad, scenes just run into each other with no fluidity (even the score changes from sugary sweet sentimentality to menacing hard rock far too abruptly), and the movie just generally has the intelligence of a peanut.<br/><br/>But of course as you've probably guessed by now I F-CKING LOVED ""Con Air"" simply because it is F-CKING AWESOME. Sh-t gets BLOWED UP REAL GOOD. Nick Cage says stuff like ""What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna save the *beep* day!"", which is just REALLY F-CKING AWESOME. John Malkovich chews scenery like the best damned steak he's ever had in his life, and says sh-t like ""onara!"" after a guy started saying his name, begging him not to burn him alive. The guy says ""Cy..."" and Malkovich says ""onara!"" GET IT?! He even says this to a rapist: ""You keep that in mind when you look at her. Because if your dick jumps out of your pants, you jump off this plane."" HOW F-CKING AWESOME IS THAT? COULD THIS *beep* GET ANY BETTER? Believe it or not, the sh-t does in fact get even better. <br/><br/>How does it manage to get better? THEY F-CKING CRASH-LAND IN F-CKING VEGAS, MAN! Sh-t gets BLOWED UP REAL F-CKING GOOD, and stuff is destroyed and oh man they even tack on a totally extraneous action scene near the end! You get a shot of John Cusack and Nick Cage getting on two motorcycles and looking deliberately badass! HOW F-CKING AWESOME IS THAT? <br/><br/>If you don't cry tears of joy during the insanely protracted and eye-roll-worthy finale with Nick Cage reuniting finally with his daughter, you have no appreciation for AWESOMENESS. Because while ""Con Air"" is exceptionally dumb and lacking in logic, it also has an extremely high amount of AWESOME. I know for sure now that AWESOME is an ingredient which can cancel out every single bit of intelligence in my brain and turn me into a caveman just like Nick Cage in this movie. The movie has the line: ""This is a situation that needs to get unf-cked, right now!"" for Christ's sake! THAT TRANSCENDS ANY AWESOMENESS EVER PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO MAN.<br/><br/>TOTALLY. F-CKING.

Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day. Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters. 10 out of 10.

"nikkinyberg","7","0","1","28 August 2005"," Nice action flick with some stupid parts..
","Contains Spoilers *Warning* Truth to say, i liked this movie.. It tells the story about a Ranger (Nicholas Cage) who gets involved in a drunken fight concerning his wife, and he accidentally kills one of the men. He gets put in San Quentin, and stays there for a couple of years and then all of a sudden they decide that they have to escort some prisoners to another prison. They do so, by plane. On this plane there are some crazy villains and some not so crazy.. For example we have the bad guy Cyrus The Virus(John Malkovich), who i found to be extremely overexagurated. However Malkovich as usual gives us a top notch performance. Now most of the characters i found extremely clich√É¬©d. However there was one guy. One character they could actually make a whole movie about, but instead they throw him in late in this movie. Its Steve Buscemis character I'm talking about. He is so mystical and so weird but in a nice kind of a way, that you don't know whether to hate him or love him. he tells you gruesome stories like how he wore a girls head as a hat but in the end he becomes totally normal and ends up gambling in Las Vegas. Ah yes, the film ends in las Vegas.. Now here are some stupid things, they have to land the airplane somewhere in las Vegas and they cant make it to the airfield. So they have to land it on THE STRIP! i mean Come On! And during this attempt to land, Mr Poe(Nicholas Cage)'s friend called ""baby-O"" gets shot and is fatally wounded. So Poe gets started on a frenzy. He walks right up to the pilot and gets Shot in the arm on the way with out making the slightest move! However, they manage to land the plane strangely enough but Cyrus and his friends makes a run for it! So Poe starts chasing them.. Now Cyrus's death is one of the most stupidest death's i have ever seen.. First, he gets a pole right through his leg, then he gets smashed through some windows tied to a ladder, then he falls right through some electrical wires and THEN he land on some kind of a industrial machine that crushes things and he has the bad luck to get his head right under it. IN THE MIDDLE OF LAS VEGAS! A INDUSTRIAL MACHINE?! Now there's also Vince (John Cusack) who tries to help Mr Poe. He's kinda boring, but he gives the story somewhat of a lift.. And it really did need a lift.. Other than that, this is a nice little action flick. Yes it does contain stupid and unrealistic parts, but hey its action. The performances are great especially from Steve Buscemi who practically made this movie. If it was'nt for him, this movie would go way down. If you're looking for some nice action this is what you want. If you want some realistic thought provoking movie, this is not what you want."

","Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a highly decorated Army Ranger who is coming home to his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). While he and his wife are about to go home, three bums attack Poe. Poe unintentionally kills one of the attackers and the other two get away. Poe is sent to prison where he remains for eight years. He makes friends with a fellow prisoner named Mike 'Baby-O' O'Dell (Mykelti Williamson). He is granted a parole and is put on a plane along with Baby-O and other convicts including Joe 'Pinball' Parker (David Chappelle), William 'Billy Bedlam' Bedford (Nick Chinlund), Johnny 'Johnny-23' Baca (Danny Trejo), Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), and Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich). Cyrus the Virus and Diamond Dog break out of their restraints and, with a little help from Pinball, take control of the plane.<br/><br/>On the ground, meanwhile, Cameron's wife and daughter (Landry Allbright) are waiting for Poe when they are requested to go to Carson City to answer a few questions for U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack), who is trying to get the plane down peacefully when his superior, DEA agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) is chasing the plane trying to shoot it down.<br/><br/>After a while, more convicts are loaded onto the plane including Ramon 'Sally-Can't-Dance' Martinez (Renoly Santiago), Swamp Thing (M.C. Gainey), Francisco Cindino (Jesse Borrego), and Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene (Steve Buscemi) The movie is full of action, drama, and quite a bit of comedy (Cyrus the Virus and Garland Greene are quite funny). As well as that, it's sad enough to draw tears at some parts. I thought so at least.<br/><br/>The casting is flawless. Cage, Cusack, and Malkovich, as well as all the other actors/actresses, were perfect in their roles.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a great movie with action, drama, comedy, and some tear-jerking moments, then see this.

","Initially i decided to give this movie a go as it starred both Nicholas Cage and John Cusack, now there's 2 kick ass actors already. Seeing as there were a lot of characters involved i expected some to lack quality, as a lot of films do this, but i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it to find out that ALL the characters (not just the prisoners) were well characterised, original and entertaining. Although this movie doesn't have a very obvious 'deep' meaning or moral, its one of the best films i've seen. If you are into car/plane chases, lots of explosions, shooting etc then this is a must see movie.<br/><br/>This film also contained a lot of humorous moments, i think i probably found Vince Larkin (John Cusack) and Agent Malloy the funniest together, but its a hard one to call! After the plane had finally 'landed' in Las Vegas i was preparing for a slower ending, although this would have been good still, i was so happy that they had included a very entertaining car chase, then you've got your 3 minute reunion with Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) and his family. Followed by the prisoners names which i thought was a cool idea! This film is packed with action, fun ideas, a great soundtrack, nifty lines, humour and a nice plot that isn't over enthusised for its type.

Sure, there's plenty of movies that don't seem to let up, but this one in particular seems extremely anxious to get to the next big scene. It's almost in a rush at the beginning as to say 'Let's hurry up with how Nicholas Cage got into prison' and get on with the fun stuff.<br/><br/>And for this film it really works.

Okay, obviously this movie was not made with the intention for the movie makers to end up standing behind a microphone thanking their agents. It was simply made to entertain, and that it does. John Malcovich (spelling?) is not his usually stiff self and he really lights up the screen as Cyrus the Virus.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this movie work is its vast cast of characters from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, or Dave Chappelle as Pinball, all the way to John Cusak (YES!) as U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin, not one of his regular roles. I am so glad that he decided to do this movie however, because he really breathes life into this film, er I mean, Movie.<br/><br/>And with all it's explosions, and cheesy action dialog, I still have a hard time not crying at the end.

","As if my summary didn't say enough.  This movie is about as exploitive and stupid as a summer action movie can get.  By using mult-ethnicity, the makers only reveal their own bigotry.  Let's see:<br/><br/>We have the black revolutionary complete with dogma and his own 'gangsta style'.  There is the tamer counterpart to balance out any negative effects the former may have, of course.<br/><br/>We have the hispanic rapist, sure to be popular with the kids.<br/><br/>We have the everyday white serial killers and mass-murders complete with degrees in insanity and lunacy.<br/><br/>And, to make things worse, we have Nicolas Cage wasted on a repeat of his role in Raising Arizona.  Whoever thought giving him a southern accent was a bright idea needs to be dropped from 20,000 feet onto a parked Volvo.  John Malkovich, wasted on a role as the dominant predator, shows he is as empty-headed as the script.  He was better in Empire of the Sun.<br/><br/>Obviously, a movie of this nature devotes more time and money into making sure the pyrotechnicians don't accidentally kill everyone than the script. If you are a fan of Bruckheimer's work, or if you liked Tomb Raider, then this is for you.  Otherwise, forget it.  The boneyard battle shows--in full glory--where the money went more than any other scene.<br/><br/>Overall, so dense you need a chainsaw to get through it, this is predictable entertainment. 1.5 out of 5 stars.

"Li-1","Null","0","2","27 June 2003"," A goofy comedy posing as a thrill ride.
","* 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>I love action films, but as I was watching Con Air, I kept asking myself, ""where's all the action?"" Apparently, director Simon West decided he'd hold off the typical gun fights, car chases, and big explosions until the last half-hour. Big mistake. This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and I don't expect to have to wait 90 minutes to get to the action, which even then, is extremely disappointing in how routine all of it turns out to be.<br/><br/>
So, instead, it might be more applicable to view this as a comedy about a relatively simple situation that goes awry. After all, this whole mess begins when an army ranger named Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) defended his pregnant wife and killed a man. Even though he was just defending himself and his wife and pleads guilty, he still gets the maximum sentence because he's seen as a ""deadly weapon"" in the judge's eye. It's too bad Cage, normally an okay actor, plays his role like a mix between Elvis and Forrest Gump, and as if to make the latter more obvious, Poe's best friend is none other than Mykelti Williamson, AKA Bubba! <br/><br/>This Poe Fella and his buddy manage to get on board a plane full of the most dangerous criminals alive (meaning a good number of these inmates are all from the same prison!), who come up with an escape plan that's executed perfectly despite them having never even set foot on the plane before. Poe has to try and thwart them, and this goes on for pretty much the entire movie. <br/><br/>So what we have here is a film with a lame protagonist, even lamer villains, and average action scenes that don't get the pulse pounding. Oh, yeah, and there's constant bickering between John Cusack and Colm Meaney over whether or not to shoot the plane down. The answer should be a no-brainer, but since that description fits the movie itself, you can guess what they decide to do with the plane.<br/><br/>I get a lot of amusement over the family reunion in the movie's final scenes, where Poe meets his wife and his daughter, whom he's never seen before. Though probably intended as heart-rending drama, this reunion is about as well-handled as something you might see on the Lifetime Channel, maybe even worse.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) Take a look at the scene where Malkovich's villain is killed. It's pretty obvious he falls in such a position so that his feet, and not his head, would be facing that crushing machine. This is the kind of haphazard editing that's displayed throughout the whole film, so it's of no surprise Simon West would go on to direct Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the worst film of 2001. Hey, I actually see that as a good thing, since it kept West from directing Black Hawk Down, which was, ironically enough, the best film of 2001."

","Nicholas Cage has proven himself as an action star in my mind. What he gives you, that you won't get from people like Arnie and Van Damme etc, is the ability to convincingly play a character with more than two dimensions, he can easily do roles in action films with his eyes closed as the characters do not require to much stretching. Of course when it comes to the action itself he has been doubled too much for my liking. Although he was pretty good in Con Air it must be said, Cage was in great shape in this movie. He has been in three classic action films. This, Face Off and the Rock. In The Rock and Face Off he was doubled annoyingly every second, but he is more involved in this film. Basically Con Air is your typicle macho man action flick, full of one-liners and angry stares but what sets this apart is the amazing energy produced by the direction, set pieces and the standard of actors you don't usually get in this genre. Nic Cage is good although his accent is a little difficult to take in at times, he gets it spot on but it just doesn't suit him. Also John Cusack is in great form as an FBI agent who is responsible for the plane that subsequantly becomes hi-jacked and terrorist controlled. As for the villiansof the piece, well Ving Rhames stars as Diamond Dog and is very good and John Malkovich excels as lead baddie Cyrus the Virus (all the bad guys have stupid names). This film has many of the stupid cliches of the action genre but the amazing action sequences, quality score and the stars make this a must see. The plot may be thin but do we really care in an action flick. Overall this is a great flick, and I really appreciate those few action flicks that employ top actors to add something in that department. Some of the scenes really raise the excitment levels pretty high. 9/10"

","This is one of those movies that if your not looking for a 2 hour lecture, then this is the movie for you. Nicholas cage is the perfect redneck, even though i'm from Alabama and I hate how they always make fun of this state. He has the accent down right. The action is great. The story is great and this movie was great."

","Great action flick! Cage plays a mellow family man who defends himself and kills some bar trash that attacks him. Well, it's off to prison and onto the psycho plane full of killers. Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene is very funny. Fellow NE Ohioan (yes!) Monica Potter, is gorgeous as Poes wife. (I hope I run into her at the Mall)!!! Great action scenes, nifty fighting moves by Cage, the crazy John M. as the lead creep, man, a Vegas plane crash,  this film has it all. Good triumphs by the end. I'm still mystified that Mrs. Poe doesn't fly into the arms of her husband at the end with more passion! What's up with that lousy ending?? The guys been through hell and back and she acts like a distant cousin to him, explain that??? Overall though, a 10!"
