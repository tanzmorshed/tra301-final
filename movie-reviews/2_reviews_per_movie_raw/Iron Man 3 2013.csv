"ivo-cobra8","9","148","186","22 October 2015"," A Big improvement over Iron Man 2 : Defending an Underrated Marvel third entry!
","Iron Man 3 (2013) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Iron Man trilogy. It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn't boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn't ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style!<br/><br/>I am defending this film against haters. I know a lot of people who will see my review will put it down, just like 30 people put down my review Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)! First off this film isn't Die Hard With A Vengeance or Lethal Weapon film even tough Tony and Rhodes are fighting with guns without their armors. I love the film because it is serious it has Action. Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful performance as Pepper un like she did in Iron Man 2. And yes fans I am saying it. She was so damn annoying in Iron Man 2, I disliked watching her in that movie, in this film she is a supporting and caring girlfriend unlike Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>I love this film because The film sets place after the events of The Avengers on Christmas Eve!!! Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. This is the first time I see Tony Stark and Iron Man in a snow in Christmas, This film reminds me on Batman Returns (1992) Tim Burton's film. It is pretty good. The attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! There was kid in this film and no he wasn't annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin""! that was brilliant and I love the twist!<br/><br/>Tony Stark, is proved in this third and more than likely final chapter in the solo run of Iron Man. Iron Man 3 or Three as it appears in the end credits amps up the action and closes out the trilogy on a high note setting Tony's eventual return in summer 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. But in his most darkest moments he is challenged by his emotions of what happened to him in New York, while dealing with the biggest threat he has encountered: Mandarin. Without given any plot points away for those who may have not seen this, but Iron Man 3 is well worth the admission and then some. People Iron Man 3 sets up Marvel's Phase 2 of features.<br/><br/>This is the best Iron Man movie yet, better than Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Loved the storyline and Tony was a genius and brilliant again as usual. Great special effects. A very busy, action- and humour-packed comic-book flick. Better than Iron Man 2, but not nearly as good as the original. As usual, Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) rocked, as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 (stylized on screen as Iron Man Three) is a 2013 superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution.<br/><br/>The rating I am giving to this movie is 9/10"
"MR_Heraclius","8","44","55","24 February 2020"," love this movie highly recommend
","It's always hard to see a movie with Robert Downey, Jr. and not find his sarcasm and personality incredibly charming. He really shows why he is one of the best on-screen superheroes today by showing that he can have good chemistry with everyone ... even a young child. This is a huge step-up from ""Iron Man 2,"" which failed in many different ways. It features a very promising villain that could also be the setup for future installments of - not only the ""Iron Man"" movies, but the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"shangsta","8","80","107","9 November 2013"," Hated it at first, I like it more each time I re-watch
","The first time I saw this movie I really didn't like it, I had just come off the high of ""The Avengers"" and let me make it clear, this one isn't as good. That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.<br/><br/>One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.<br/><br/>Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.<br/><br/>It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more."
"jfgibson73","8","29","39","9 August 2014"," I hope this series never ends
","I thought this movie was a lot of fun, and I may have enjoyed it even more than the first two. The two big criticisms I see people making about it are that the Mandarin wasn't the same as in the comics, and that Tony didn't use the armor much. I consider the Mandarin to be a boring villain in the first place. The comedy was worth not having an iconic super villain. As far as not using the armor enough, I did want to see more of Iron Man tearing stuff apart. But again, I liked what we got in place of it so much, it was an agreeable trade off. Seeing how resourceful Tony can be with none of his technology was just as fun, and the stuff with the kid was full of great humor. Guy Pearce's sleazy bad guy in a suit wasn't nearly as much fun as Justin Hammer from #2--I would have rather had him back. The after-credits scene legitimately had me worried--I want to imagine Tony and Banner are hanging out. I don't like the idea that they might not be getting along! Even all the other problems people point out about plot holes and character inconsistencies don't really diminish how much I enjoyed IM3. I thought the script was incredible and I was constantly surprised at how inventive it was. RD jr. created a character for the ages with his take on Tony, but with this installment, I now feel this character and this movie series may be among my personal favorites. This movie is just too smart to be a big summer action kids movie, but it had its cake and ate it too: well made and impossibly successful. Good for them. I want more.<br/><br/>2019 Update: Oh well.."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","32","44","30 November 2013"," A risk-taking third solo outing for 'Iron Man' with plenty of payoff
","How will Marvel's universe ever be the same after ""The Avengers""? There's bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of ""Iron Man 3"" thinking, ""why didn't he just call his superfriends in the end?"" It's a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black's script doesn't ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn't seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after ""The Avengers"" blew it open—and the answer is yes.<br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn't been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of ""The Avengers."" In fact, the words ""New York"" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.<br/><br/>As the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian—a think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years ago—to Don Cheadle's Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as ""Iron Man 2."" Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what's actually a rather clever story.<br/><br/>Story structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy.<br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you'd expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce's Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don't really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.<br/><br/>Not unlike ""Iron Man 2,"" the film's action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. ""Iron Man 3"" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.<br/><br/>The ""Iron Man"" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark's greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you'll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger's Joker from ""The Dark Knight.""<br/><br/>The movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as ""the 'Iron Man' movie with Tony Stark and that kid."" That's dangerous territory. If ""Spider-Man 3"" had worked, everyone wouldn't refer to it as ""the one with emo Peter Parker.""<br/><br/>Nothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there's no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but ""Iron Man 3"" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.<br/><br/>The humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn't pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered (""Spider-Man 3,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand""), it's testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding ""The Avengers,"" which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way ""Iron Man 3"" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.<br/><br/>Few actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel's canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after ""The Avengers 2,"" it'll be the end of an era.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more"
"stubs182","8","29","42","26 June 2013"," Not perfect but risky and enjoyable throughout
","Ever since the release of the first installment back in 2008 I've been a big fan of the series, I caught the first flick on the big screen 3 times and it's sequel twice, so my anticipation was high. I'd intentionally avoided most of the trailer, TV spots and early reviews as I tend to find too much exposure to pre-release hype diminishes the actual viewing experience, but I had a general idea of the direction. I'm also a big fan of director Shane Black and specifically Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, an action/comedy/buddy flick, set at Christmas featuring Robert Downey Jr, so I also had a general idea of what to expect in terms of artistic tone and I was not disappointed with what I saw. <br/><br/>Easily the best Iron Man movie so far, the movie finds itself in an unusual position, not only is it the direct sequel to Iron Man 2 it also follows the events of The Avengers which plays a big role in the character development of Tony, who finds himself suffering from severe panic attacks which is understandable for a guy who just flew a nuclear weapon in a giant worm hole in the sky above New York opened by an army of evil intergalactic space aliens. So how do you create an appropriate threat for the man of Iron now that he's fought Avengers level threats? The answer is to cripple Tony's confidence, take him back to basics, essentially fighting himself back out of the proverbial cave with a bunch of scraps. <br/><br/>What Shane Black has achieved is the funniest Iron Man movie that also features stunning action sequences, something that was somewhat lacking in the previous installments. As always the dialogue is witty and expertly delivered by Downey, but what really had me laughing out loud was a particularly inventive sequence featuring a not quite complete Iron Man suit.<br/><br/>The big third act finally has been pretty much spoiled by every single trailer they put out but it still manages to deliver in terms of sheer 'ZOMG' awesomeness. <br/><br/>I loved the relationship between Tony and the little boy and was genuinely touched by the heart warming ending. I've seen a few reactions by people wondering how Tony will feature in future installments specifically Avengers 2 now that he has removed his chest piece and destroyed all his suits, I would point out that it the chest piece isn't required to use an Iron Man suit, War Machine uses one, Iron Monger used one in IM1, Whiplash used a suit in IM2, Pepper Potts uses the suit briefly, so Tony will still be able to use an Iron Man suit when required. As to the destruction of his entire arsenal, He's Tony Stark, come on, of course he's gonna make more suits. He even says right at the end of the film, I am Iron Man. And essentially I always will be no matter what happens to me. And in case you had any doubt at all, the movie even spells it out for you in the end credits, Tony Stark will return. Speaking of end credits the stinger, the amount of people who stayed glued to their seats in anticipation of the now famous Marvel stingers was really a testament to their appeal. I really enjoyed this one, the relationship between Tony and Bruce was something I really enjoyed in The Avengers and I'm really glad they've decided to build upon that. <br/><br/>Now just as few things I do have an issue with, The Ten Rings? As revealed in this movie The Madarin was nothing more than a tool used to manipulate the public, created by Aldrich Killan, that in itself I have no problem but it does raise one important question, what was going on in the first movie when the Ten Rings kidnapped Tony? Are we to now believe that Aldrich Killian was behind it all along? Or has Shane Black just created a pretty sizeable plot hole in the entire Iron Man series? <br/><br/>That being said I really dug the movie and I'm super excited for the future of the Marvel cinematic Universe."
"Reno-Rangan","8","19","27","10 September 2013"," This film's success made it one of the finest trilogy among the others.
","It's weird, the movie starts without the opening credits. Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.<br/><br/>'Iron Man 3' one of a most anticipated movie of the year. I still don't understand this movie and 'Avenvegers' are connected or separate stream stories because Tony behaves like there's one like he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Anyway this movie was a bit more dramatised than stunts, it tells his earlier time mistake which creates a deadly enemy for the present. I always wondered such a good actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, appearances in earlier two movies were so wasted. At least she gets some improvise role here, maybe we can expect more from her in the next movie in the series I guess.<br/><br/>I totally loved the Ben Kingley's cameo though I easily guessed the twist on his role. More or less this movie's success made 'Iron Man' trilogy to one of a fine trilogy ever. A good movie to watch once, especially if you ever liked 'Iron Man' duology or any other sci-fi- action movies.<br/><br/>8/10"
"bowmanblue","8","31","48","24 August 2014"," A new type of Iron Man movie
","The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.<br/><br/>However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.<br/><br/>And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"ehankins2147","7","18","26","20 June 2013"," How bad can a plot twist be?
","Iron man 3 is not completely fresh in my mind considering I saw the movie over a month a go, but it was a movie to remember.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was the first movie on my list of anticipated movies for summer 13, and I thought it was a delight. Robert Downey Jr. was great in the suit as usual. He steals every scene, charms you, and is an overall funny guy. War machine ( haha) had good chemistry with stark and remained a relevant supporting character.<br/><br/>I am a big Guy Pearce fan! I loved him in movies such as: memento, hurt locker, and la confidential. He was good as an actor in this film, but I felt they could have made him a little deeper of a villain. Which brings us to the supposed downfall of this film. The Mandarin. Die hard fans of the Mandarin will be disappointed as ever by the mandarin in Iron Man 3. He appears as a large threat and as a ruthless terrorist in the first half of the film. Halfway through the movie you actually find out he is a drunken actor. In the end, no one can deny Iron Man 3, unless your a Mandarin purist. 9/10"

"Simionski","4","44","72","10 June 2013"," Iron Man 3 is not the best in the trilogy but is still an entertaining movie
","Iron Man 3 is, for me at least, one big letdown. It is not a bad movie but it certainly is not what you'd expect after The Avengers. <br/><br/>Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. He delivers his lines as witty as he can but at one moment the jokes become one too many. The movie derails from what it should be and becomes a comedy. And not in the good way. Most of the jokes are out of place in moments which should be dramatic and thus the scenes cannot be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley is great but the weak script doesn't do any good to the main villain. And a superhero movie needs a good villain which Iron Man 3 hasn't.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle's character is mismanaged and doesn't contribute to the plot or the movie in any way.<br/><br/>One of the good things in Iron Man 3 is Tony and Pepper's relationship which is handled really well and the chemistry between the actors reflects on the screen.<br/><br/>The ending is forced in a way but after all the film ends on a high note. <br/><br/>It certainly could have been better but given as it is Iron Man 3 is a good continuation to the story of Tony Stark that leaves you with wanting more and we all know at some point Robert Downey we put on the suit again and maybe we'll get a movie on the level of the original."
"BiiivAL","8","97","171","8 June 2018"," Not a single costume
","It's time to say goodbye. No, Tony Stark will not get anywhere from us, Iron Man is still at the top of Olympus Marvel. But it will never be the same again, because the cycle of the name Robert Downey Jr. comes to the end. Enjoy the same ellipsis of a beautiful trilogy, worthy of his hero.<br/><br/>The third film turned out to be minimal superhero, but as human as possible. To achieve such an effect was possible because of a change of man in the director's chair - the place of joker John Favreau was taken by Shane Black. The screenwriter of The Deadly Guns received an appointment clearly in an old friendship with Downey. It so happened that the iconic for both ""The Kiss"" (for Robert to a lesser extent, of course) makes itself felt in the story of the ""Iron Man"" - if the last two films were simply ""not serious"", then this time we can safely be called the funniest in the trilogy. In addition to abundant jokes, some plot twists from the duo's past collaborative work are also guessed.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. now spends much less time in a suit. After the events in New York (""The Avengers"") he is overcome by panic: and suddenly something like this will happen again, suddenly Pepper will again be in danger. In a suit, fear goes, then he and Iron Man, but the battle with yourself has to lead literally with bare hands. The costume, in turn, does not disappear from the screen, it is multiplied either independently, or under the control of the skillful AI Jarvis, thereby preventing Robert's talent, the flow of which is always a little bit, but restrained by the suit. The screen time and Gwyneth Paltrow increased, for this incarnation of beloved Stark, this is actually also the last fight and this time it gives a light to the old one.
With enemies everything is much better than last time. First of all, the mysterious Mandarin. Sir Ben Kingsley and his character is SPOILER riding a spoiler, plus a spoiler and chases. It is not enough, but it surprises him fantastically, for it completely changes the preliminary opinion about the film and from fears that ZhCH3 turned into the fall of the Dark Knight, there is no trace. The second villain went to Guy Pearce. The Englishman goes deeper and deeper into the abyss of extremely negative roles, which, incidentally, is not bad, because the hostage of one role is definitely not about him.<br/><br/>Flashed on the screen by tradition and Stan Lee, without which there would be no comic books about Tony Stark and there would not be anything else. A few months before the premiere of Iron Man 3, the master turned 90 years old.<br/><br/>The funny pseudo-realism Iron Man 3 captivates. With the change of director, the film also changed, which pays more time to Tony Stark, and not to Iron Man. Who knows, Robert Downey Jr. may someday. will return to his main superhero role, but so far the film and he himself hint that it's time to move on. Finally, Marvel gives the audience a cocktail of humor, action and nostalgia, supplemented by a slice of the beloved actor and a piece of the universe after the credits."
"craigedmond97","8","20","30","26 May 2013"," Iron-Man done right
","First of all, I would like to make clear that I have watched the first two Iron Man movies and the Avengers, so I'm in good stead when seeing this movie. I thought the first Iron-Man was great and the second good, but more of a run-up to the Avengers than Iron-Man. So upon seeing Iron- Man 3, I expected good things, especially after the Avengers which was incredible, and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. <br/><br/>We start with Tony Stark giving an opening Monologue as we see his legacy as Iron-Man blown to pieces, from this moment the viewers attention is grabbed. Then we are thrown into a flashback, which details how all of this madness came about. During this flashback, it is made pretty obvious Aldrich Killian is going to be problematic for Iron-Man as Tony Stark stands him up. So we get to present day where we see Tony, and I was very impressed by the characterisation of Tony Stark in this movie particularly. His anxiety attacks as a result of the Avengers can be related to by the viewers- I'm sure none of us could fight off alien hordes, fly a nuke into space then survive the whole ordeal and just walk it off. It reminds us that behind the suit is a man, who still feels and is maybe beginning to realise that he's plunged right into the deep end. Another interesting idea, is his obsession with his suits, of which he has many. This obsession endangers his relationship with Pepper and it really shows the audience that Tony Stark has lost sight of the things most important in his life, in some ways.<br/><br/>After dealing with our protagonist, I feel it's only right now to deal with the films antagonist, the Mandarin. The movie took an interesting slant on the mandarin which personally, I loved. The important thing to remember however is the The Mandarin is a comic book character, so while those of us who just watch the films may enjoy the twist, some comic book readers may be left slightly annoyed at the wasted opportunity to use such a great villain. Looking at what he stands for is certainly interesting though, the point it gets across by the Mandarin just as a name, an image for which the real villains can shield themselves with shows that all is not as we see in today's world, some things are not quite as they seem. So now, with the Mandarin out of the way, it's just Aldrich Killian who is played exceptionally well by Guy Pearce. Killian comes across as a sly and devious man who can so easily sneak around doing what he pleases as he is hidden by the Mandarin, which makes the audience feel a stronger dislike towards him as he is never pulled up for causing carnage and lets the Mandarin take all the blame.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, but if there is one reason it's marked down it's because of the premise of the plot, Xtremis. Even for a movie series which included alien invaders it seems far fetched and silly to me. By this I mean, not the idea of it, but how inconsistent and 'unbeatable' it is. One minute it only takes a little explosion to kill those corrupt by it, the next Iron-Man has to blow about nine holes into Killian to eventually kill him (an overstatement, but my point is clear). This little thing is why it has been marked down because lets be fair, it is a major plot point, however should I hear a reasonable explanation for it's inconsistency I would re-consider my rating.<br/><br/>To sum up, the film exceeded my already high expectations through it's excellent characterisation, brilliant emotional connection and clever quirks. I would have to say this is the defining Iron-Man of the series, which leaves the audience wondering, what part will Tony Stark play in Avengers 2?"
"moviexclusive","8","116","209","24 April 2013"," A welcome return to form, this trilogy capper overcomes a weak start to impress with unexpected buddy chemistry, surprising plot twists and exhilarating action
","Tony Stark might be at his best with his gadgets, but ironically his movies are best when he is without them. 'Iron Man 3' is a perfect demonstration of that – for the first 40 mins, Stark is the same arrogant, cocksure person he was in the self-important 'Iron Man 2'; and then after crashing and burning in his damaged suit in the middle of a wintry expanse, Stark is forced to start over, and that rebirth brings back what made the first 'Iron Man' so infectiously entertaining in the first place.<br/><br/>Indeed, you've been warned – don't expect 'Iron Man 3' to be firing from all cylinders right from the get-go as 'The Avengers' did; rather, the road to that payoff is slow and bumpy. This is a 'post-Avengers' Stark, traumatised by his near-death experience closing the Chitauri wormhole back in New York. At the expense of sleep and his relationship with the ever-lovely Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Stark throws himself into work – which to him means further refining his 'Iron Man' armour. In the meantime, he leaves the heavy lifting to Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle), commissioned by the President to fight terror in the War Machine suit (basically the 'Iron Man' fighting machine but in the patriotic colours of red, white and blue).<br/><br/>Col Rhodes' latest target is a terrorist going by the monicker of 'The Mandarin', who has brought his war to home soil after targeting US installations abroad. Only when his former driver cum good friend, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), is fatally injured does Stark sit up and pay attention, and in an ill-advised and egotistical move, reveal his home address in an outright challenge to The Mandarin. That, as you would already know from the trailer, leaves his oceanside home decimated and Stark in a barely functioning suit in the snow-covered wilds of Tennessee.<br/><br/>Up to this point, a lot of what is meant to pass as wisecracks is exchanged as dialogue among Stark, Potts and Hogan, but the smart- talking isn't particularly amusing or engaging and gets increasingly tiresome after a while. But as we said at the start, it is precisely when Stark is forced to start over that the movie starts getting into the groove. Abandoning the slick and sleek mechanical tricks and gimmicks, the middle act settles into a surprisingly old-school act in a small-town-USA where Stark had meant to visit to investigate a recent incident which he suspects is linked to The Mandarin.<br/><br/>There, some of the sparkiest repartee unfolds between Stark and a young kid he meets, Harley (Ty Simpson), who will not only enable him to overcome his PTSD but also become an unlikely pre-pubescent sidekick. The rapport between Stark and Harley significantly enlivens the film, with the 'connection' (there is a special meaning to the quotation here) between them perhaps the most poignant relationship developed here. Thankfully, the delightfully warm and witty midsection only makes the film better from here onwards.<br/><br/>Surpassing expectations of a straightforward good-versus-bad showdown, veteran action movie screenwriter Shane Black and his first-time feature film writer Drew Pearce engineer a couple of elegant twists, including an ingenious revelation on the true identity of The Mandarin. Not to worry, we're not in spoiler mode here, but suffice to say that it is probably the very reason why Academy Award-winning actor Ben Kingsley was enticed to the role. And with that surprise comes the action that you've been waiting for from this summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Black, who is making his sophomore feature film, offers up two eye- popping set pieces. The first sees a daring attack on Air Force One in mid-air, leaving 13 people in free-fall and a truly exhilarating sequence where Iron Man gets to play 'barrel of monkeys' with all of them and guide them to safety. The second is the elaborate and game- changing climax – not only for the fact that it is the first and only time in the whole movie that we see the Iron Legion in action, but also because it comes to a startling conclusion that re-establishes the dynamic between Stark and Potts. Both are even more astounding considering Black's last and first movie was a crime caper called 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' that never would have primed you into thinking he was capable of such spectacle.<br/><br/>But one supposes that Robert Downey Jr must have seen that potential in Black to recommend him as the candidate to take over Favreau, the familiarity between actor and director paying off in how the former trusts the latter to take the character in a different direction. While he was vulnerable before, Stark did not have the same attachment as he does here with Potts or the same sense of introspection that is evident in his voice-over. In turn, Downey Jr. gives his best performance as Tony Stark/ Iron Man yet, with a newfound sense of frailty that develops convincingly into humility to match his heroics.<br/><br/>Disagree if you must, but we always loved Stark more when he was less full of himself, and a refreshingly new aspect here is the buddy element that sees Stark pairing first with Harley and then with Col Rhodes. In particular, the finale sees a rousing partnership with the latter – both Downey Jr and Cheadle clearly enjoying trading quips and barbs at each other while saving the day. And given how the 'Iron Man' movies have been at their most rousing when Stark rebuilds himself, the last shot of Stark beginning a new phase in his life bodes well for the future of the franchise, especially if it is to continue its life outside of 'The Avengers'."

","It's a first day buy on Bluray no don't! There's no doubt you will enjoy this film. The direction is well perfection. It has far too many cool action scenes and dialogue that it can not fail. The trailers don't show you a thing from the film besides the house scene. But when you think something is the way it truly is then you are wrong. It is a great film that I will be paying $25 dollars for. The film provides many references towards the avengers and at one point there is a cameo by the one and only Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers. List of Superhero films in my favor. Top five....there not only MArvel films. <br/><br/>1. Iron Man 3 2. The Avengers 3. The Amazing Spiderman 4. The Dark Knight 5. V for Vendetta"
"sirdavidofthecourt","3","613","1214","27 April 2013"," How could they mess this up so bad?
","This is my first review and I'm writing it because the critics are all praising this film so much.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, if you like Iron Man in any way and/or are familiar with the mythology, do not pay to watch this film. This is a poor excuse of a plot that outright spits in the face of fans and destroys one of Marvel's most powerful villains. Seriously, the Mandarin is Tony Stark's antithesis; their conflict was always the symbol for magic vs. science. Like Joker's insanity contradicts Batman's great use of logic. In Iron Man 3 they ruined him so bad only a reboot could save the character (and believe me, I hate reboots as much as everyone). The Mandarin is now used as a joke character with the main twist just playing for laughs (or in my case, tears). This guy should have ten powerful magical rings that alone could rival the Avengers' powers combined. Was this ""adaptation"" really the best thing to do? Magic CAN be done on the big screen, they've done Norse Gods! Ten Rings are nothing compared to that...<br/><br/>Other than that, the film still wouldn't be good. Shane Black writes comedy action films, only this time the comedy is much more cringe worthy and not really funny, and the action probably sums up about 20% of the film. The main plot-device for armor malfunctions, power-downs and or stupid failures is so overused I was wondering how could they ever fill up 120 minutes without it. The actual Iron Man suit is so underused that you'll think this is Bourne or Bond you're watching. Also noteworthy: If a film relies on poop jokes for a quick laugh, it got as low as it'll ever get.<br/><br/>Also, I must say Rhodes (War Machine) needs a plot arc. He's a tool. I love Don's work in the role and think he's charismatic (as are RDJ and Gwyneth), but he needs to have some kind of a story.<br/><br/>Other new characters' besides the Mandarin are really hit and miss. This series' villains really have become one-note. We all know the bad guy is the one wearing the fancy suit that wants corporate power and tries to take over. Special mention goes to Maya, that one person who changes her mind all the time and leaves the film never having stepped in in the first place.<br/><br/>Wait, I'm not done yet. There's also a kid ""side-kick"" and you guessed it. He's in an hostage scene! Well, that's some good innovative writing right there! All in all, this is as bad or even worse than X-Men: The Last Stand. Beware of the actual ending that retcons everything about Tony's back-story. I don't know how Marvel green-lighted this script, I really don't! I know any fan could have done it much better!"
"deflep318","4","584","1162","3 May 2013"," I do not understand how this script was OK'd by Marvel
","I would have gone into detail and actually clicked on spoiler but there is no need. Looks like at least 100 people did that already tonight. So I am just going to hit the high notes and the low notes and call it a night. <br/><br/>The good It was an OK movie. Not great, not good. but I got to see explosions and hear one liners. <br/><br/>Pretty good acting by the major players. Kingsly particularly was great with what they gave him. <br/><br/>Stay for the ending credits for a small laugh<br/><br/>The bad<br/><br/>This script sucks They completely retcon'd a major villain and a major organization. Screwing them up for any future marvel movie. Seriously screwed the pooch on that. <br/><br/>This was a Tony Stark story, not an Iron Man Story It appears that Tony must have got some shield training because now the rich guy that only knows how to blast people and tackle people acts more like a cross between Macguyver and Hawkeye then Iron Man.<br/><br/>They screw up several major plot points from the first two movies such as why Tony has a superconductor in his chest to begin with and the weapon systems war-machine uses.<br/><br/>Finally, Where the hell is Nick Fury. Iron man does not need to have Nick Fury in his movies. Except when that movie basically deals with domestic terrorism on a massive front. If you see this movie you will see a part specifically where iron man calls out a major bad guy in the press and says bring it on I will be here. In the marvel universe there is no way in hell something that public would not have shield all over it. Especially since Tony Stark basically builds their cool stuff."

","Tony Stark(Robert Downey JR) is having problems sleeping after the events of The Avenger(2012). He throws himself in his work, putting strain on his relationship with Pepper Potts(Gwyenth Paltrow), then a new threat named The Manderin(Sir Ben Kingsley) a terrorist who is bent on domination.<br/><br/>Okay there is a lot to this movie then what you saw in the trailer, you probably will be surprised or be very mad, that is up to you. But I enjoyed this, Robert Downey JR is still pretty good has the charming but flawed hero Tony Stark/Iron Man. So was Gwyenth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. Sir Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall also shine in there roles. It also had great effects and great action. In this we learn it's not the suit that makes Tony a hero, but it's Tony himself that is a hero."
"zo_axe","4","332","656","25 April 2013"," This is not Iron Man, nor is it the Marvel universe.
","First of all, I would like to say that I have been an IMDb user for 4 years and 4 months now and this is going to be my first movie review, which makes me kind of sad because it is not going to be a very positive one. <br/><br/>This movie starts off with a very good promise, a promise also given to us in the trailer. It was supposed to introduce Iron Man's toughest villain 'The Mandarin', show us the state our world was left in after the events in 'The Avengers' and develop the Iron Man characters, that we've come to love so very much, even further. Instead Shane Black and Drew Pierce decided to make a ridicule of the true Mandarin character from the comic book and gave us an uninteresting villain, almost altogether ignored the consequences of the Avengers movie (that should be an important issue at this point) except for some hinted psychological issues Tony has, that weren't developed at all just like all of the side characters that seemed to exist just because they were there in the prequels. <br/><br/>But the biggest issue were the so obvious plot holes that defy all the logic set up by the prequels and 'The Avengers' which leads me to believe that the writer/director Shane Black and co-writer Drew Pierce didn't even see the afore mentioned movies before writing the script for 'Iron Man 3'. How can these 'enemies' melt the Iron man suit if Thor couldn't even scratch it with lightning which achieves much higher temperatures; how can the same people rip off parts of the Iron man suit if Thor barely dented it with his mighty hammer 'Mjolnir', ergo Thor is just a giant pus***; if it was so easy for Tony Stark to remove the shards from his blood stream why didn't he do it in the second Iron man movie when he was facing immediate and painful death from the exposure to palladium radiation, and so on...<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, it was good but nothing spectacular. <br/><br/>The script wasn't very good. There were some funny one liners but by the end of the movie there were so many of them it just left a bad taste. <br/><br/>The action and the special effects were fine but didn't serve much purpose since the storyline was so illogical and uninteresting. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, this movie would be good if it were a stand alone SF movie, but since it is connected to all the marvel universe movies that came before it it simply isn't. It would seem that Shane Black and his crew couldn't find a way to deliver the promise given to us by the creators of the afore mentioned marvel films.<br/><br/>So if you must see this movie wait for the blue-ray because in my opinion it isn't worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>I give it a 4 out of 10 stars only out of respect for such great actors as Robert Downey Jr., Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, Ben Kingsley and so on, which could have made it such a great movie with the right script in hand and the right director in the coaching seat."
"DoubleCshinobi","8","28","46","15 May 2013"," One of Marvel's best SEQUELS! IGNORE the haters!
","I'm gonna be honest; I'm not a big fan of Marvel. I thought this was gonna be another action-devoured, hero-glorifying crap that Marvel usually does with many of their hero characters in movie sequels.<br/><br/>However, when I found out Shane Black was directing this one, who by the way is a veteran filmmaker in the action genre (known for screen writing Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, etc.), I decided to give this one a chance.<br/><br/>I must say that I was SO not disappointed! This movie beginning to end was exciting and engaging, with great pacing and everything a decent superhero story needs to keep smart audiences interested. Allow me to elaborate: <br/><br/>Without any real spoilers, in this story, the machine-industrial billionaire Tony Stark is constantly faced with anxiety and mental distress as the result of his relentless work and constant political/terrorism-based issues that pose a threat to him and his girl (who we all know by now is who he cherishes the most). You can see the great character development as the plot continues to unfold how his arrogance and childish attitude in the past has affected others. Now, those sins have come back to haunt him, and he must deal with more than just The Mandarin. Away from home, with a nearly shattered Iron Man suit, and no signs of his wife, Tony must struggle against his own fears, uncover the mistakes of his past, and redeem his actions in order to be at rest again.<br/><br/>A lot of times, directors of sequels face the issue of either copying the same style from the previous installment or trying something new. People would complain either way, but hear me out, do NOT listen to all these haters. Personally, I LOVED this new style of Iron Man. I totally digged the intense atmosphere and the beautifully epic music score by Brian Tyler, who is always one of my all-time favorite soundtrack composers.<br/><br/>Acting is more or less the same level from the previous two. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as the infamous Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley made a very dark, menacing Mandarin. Even Guy Pearce does a great job, as I could not recognize him at first glance.<br/><br/>Cinematography and CG animations are on point, though some may argue it gets weak sometimes when it comes to the bad guys. Being an amateur filmmaker and editor myself, I can only imagine how many hours it must have taken to render scene where all the Iron Men arrive (no, if you saw the trailer already, that wasn't a REAL spoiler).<br/><br/>So why are people hating this movie? It's simply different. We live in a world where the type of entertain Hollywood markets is not the same as the substance the original comics or works of literature may illustrate. However, even among those who haven't read the comics, the top two complaints I hear are: 1. There's too much action and nothing really new about the story. 2. Iron Man is not wearing the Iron Man suit enough.<br/><br/>Are you kidding? The amount of action for this ACTION film was rational, and it kept the pacing better than the previous installments, not leaving much time in between for audiences to breath (which I guess can be considered a good or bad thing). Sure, it's not completely original story-wise, but since when has any superhero movie aside from Nolan's Dark Knight demand for ingeniously creative depth? And why would you want to see Stark constantly rely on the suit!? That would make him like every other of the crap movies Marvel came out with - superheroes that are perfect and always rely on their powers/abilities to solve everything.<br/><br/>There's even a moral theme to this movie on how even the smallest mistakes/wrongdoings can create the biggest impact on one's life. In fact, as a human race, we naturally ""create our own monsters."" The very first scene of this movie established this theme and it was well-played out in supporting the villain's intentions and background.<br/><br/>Movies that give me the worst impressions on Marvel include Captain America, Spider Man, Fantastic Four, etc. In those movies, the hero(es) always seem so perfect and good at heart, being misunderstood and mistreated but eventually recognized thanks to their new superpowers. Hollywood has murdered that cliché concept. I'm sick of it.<br/><br/>But thanks to this movie, Iron Man has shown that there's more to him than just being a hotshot billionaire who wears an powerful robot suit to battle. With a variety of creative action and intense scenes, he utilizes his mind, his integrity, and his struggles against internal anxiety. A man that makes mistakes, takes the pain he feels from the results of those mistakes and uses them to strengthen himself and defeat adversity. A character that shows vulnerability and relatable weaknesses in spite of their powers, how much wealth they possess, or how talented they are. A character that changes himself not to just ""save the world"" but to save the things in life that are truly important - love, happiness, people, moral wisdom, etc. THAT is what I call a true hero.<br/><br/>Just avoid the haters and avoid having too much hype. As long as you don't go in with super high Oscar-winning expectations and treat it as a typical family movie, you will definitely enjoy it as a thrilling ride with a brilliant, yet simple plot. Till this day, Iron Man is still my favorite Marvel hero."
"foreverknight47","10","79","145","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 delivers in spades.
","Saw IRON MAN 3 last night and it was superb. It was the sequel IRON MAN 2 should have been but wasn't and the perfect extrapolation of life after AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The set pieces are suitably awesome and the acting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down to the tiniest bit part (there's a jewel of a cameo from a guard that upstages even Downey's comic timing). The script gets the balance between the epic and the personal just right and Sir Ben delivers two performance for the price of one and both are genius (can't say more - spoilers!). Mr Downey Jr also manages to show even more of the complexity of Tony Stark. Just when you think there's no more to be fracked out of that particular mine, he goes deeper. The writer set out to deliver a fun story and that's exactly what it is. It draws you in from the first moments and doesn't let go. What more could you possibly want?"
"BeatleFloydZeppelin","5","321","641","3 May 2013"," Better than I expected, but worse than I'd hoped.
","The first Iron Man movie changed the way comic book adaptions were made. It (for better or worse) began the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" that climaxed with The Avengers. This is the first marvel movie to be released after The Avengers, and in many ways it proves that the series is still going strong, however, it is far from perfect.<br/><br/>ACTING: 8/10<br/><br/>The acting from the main cast members is great. Robert Downey Jr. continues to be the perfect Iron Man, I just can't imagine a better suited actor. His comedic timing is perfect, and he allows Tony Stark to be lovable while being a total jerk. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle don't get a ton of screen time, however, they are wonderful when they do. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall are all fantastic and underused. The rest of the cast is perfectly adequate, however, there seems to be a theme of casting great talents and completely under using them.<br/><br/>WRITING: 3/10<br/><br/>This is the biggest failure of the movie. The comedy works well (partially thanks to Robert Downey Jr.) and the action scenes are good, however the plot hidden behind the popcorn fun is plain awful. I have never really liked movies that deal with ""super soldiers"" and ""protecting the president,"" and this movie deals with both badly. The technology written into the series continues to become more and more ridiculous. And the twist is both easy to predict and manages to reduce the main villains role to nothing. Finally, the scene after the credits is a bit of a let down as it gives no hint towards the direction of the series. <br/><br/>DESIGN: 6/10<br/><br/>The design is just as good as previous films in the series, which is to say that it fits somewhere between satisfactory and slightly above average. The tech looks great despite its lack of plausibility, and the wardrobe and sets fit the overall tone of the movie. <br/><br/>EFFECTS: 10/10<br/><br/>The CGI is near perfect in this film, and there is a ton of it. There are scenes where Iron Man's suit magnetically attaches to Tony in separate pieces and it looks totally convincing. The explosions and impossible technology looks great too. <br/><br/>MUSIC: 4/10<br/><br/>The soundtrack in this movie is awful. Hans Zimmer has inspired many with his booming and electronic score for Inception and the Batman franchise. This concept has been replicated a hundred times since those movies, and in lesser hands it is nothing but a loud mess. This is the case with Iron Man 3. The score is loud and booming, and completely forgettable, dull and repetitive.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>This movie is mindless, unimpressive, forgettable, action packed... and thoroughly enjoyable. It is a great summer blockbuster popcorn movie that will leave your mind as soon as you leave the theater. That being said, if you liked The Avengers and Iron Man 2, you will likely enjoy this movie as well. Overall, I give it a 6.2/10"

"billygoat1071","9","174","341","24 April 2013"," Bigger and Badder
","There is a difference between Jon Favreau's Iron Man films and Shane Black's Iron Man 3. The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun. It's not the best of the franchise but it's still one of its great films.<br/><br/>It's bigger and louder compared to the last two. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character. His backup are also as charming. For the villains, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce take a little camp and they seem to enjoy it, but Pearce brings it to the table in the end.<br/><br/>Shane Black takes the director's chair this time. He is known for Lethal Weapon and the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He gives a brand new direction to the series. Unlike what the promotional posters and trailers have shown to us, the film is still not that dark toned but it has more serious threats. Black knows how to balance the serious and comedic moments. The first half though takes the roots of the original by showing Stark's imperfectness. The rest is simply an easy redemption. It's a clever move for a sequel that is suppose to be bigger than its predecessor. The action is thrilling as it is suppose to be. One of the film's memorable action is the scene(briefly shown in trailer) when Iron Man is trying to save a bunch of falling passengers from a plane. It is a sequence that is simply electrifying. This comment might sound like a hyperbole, but whatever, it is unobjectionably breathtaking. Then there's more at the climax where you'll get a taste of glorious explosions.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 tricks the audience for a deeper theme. That certain theme was solved way too easily in the end and the film rather focused on staying to the natural tone of the Avengers universe and that's fine. Besides, we're already done of seeing superheroes fall and being defeated throughout the film until the climax. The whole point is that great heroes become better heroes thanks to their weaknesses. The most noticeable thing you would spot here is when Iron Man's armor is keep crashing and falling apart and Tony's anxiety caused by what he did in The Avengers. It's comical but it's an interesting speculation. Many would still say the original is the best because it is indeed better in plot and character development, but for those who are seeking for better action will definitely love this as well. It is just way too fun. Iron Man 3 may not be the most compelling in subject but it's already a compelling experience you'll get in an action blockbuster."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","63","115","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 is damn good.
","With comic book movies, there is a repeating cycle. The first one has our attention. The sequel, most of the time (in the case of Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight, X2, etc.), outdoes the original. But then we are eventually faced with the third part. In some cases (The Dark Knight Rises), the third part kicks ass. In most cases (Spider-man 3, X-Men: The Last Stand), they are the weakest. Luckily, this is simply not the case for Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>The film takes place after the events of The Avengers, and Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. He's losing sleep, he's having anxiety attacks, and he is slowly becoming distant from his faithful girlfriend Pepper (wonderfully played by Gwenyth Paltrow again). But it only gets worse when a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley, putting on a chilling accent) starts wreaking havoc across the globe.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce shows up as a scientist named Aldrich Killian (what a villain name), and if you know anything about Guy Pearce, you can assume Aldrich isn't very nice. Rebecca Hall, who is very underrated might I add, shows up as Maya, a scientist girl that Tony met in the 90s. And Don Cheadle reprises his Iron Man 2 role as Jim Rhoades, Tony's best friend. There are a lot of plot details that I will leave out because I want you to see Iron Man 3 with an empty mind, otherwise it can't be enjoyed.<br/><br/>I was feeling a lot of things throughout Iron Man 3. I was really into it in the first half hour. Then, these weird fire people showed up, and I thought, ""Oh God, are we watching Thor?"" (I actually love Thor, but I found the blend of fantasy at first off). But as the film went on it all made sense and I accepted it. Then, I was also feeling de ja vu, because I felt like Killian and Mandarin were fairly similar to Justin Hammer and Ivan from the previous. But that is one of the wonderful things about Iron Man 3: It's unpredictable.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is damn good. The heart and soul of this trilogy is Downey Jr., and here is is at his best doing what he does best. Iron Man is my favorite of The Avengers, and really, could you blame me? Downey's amazing. What helps this time is the fact that this one is directed and co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Black has a gift with blending action with humor, and this is easily the funniest of the trilogy. It is also the best acted.<br/><br/>I had a total blast here. Is it as good as something like The Dark Knight trilogy? Well, if you know my stance on that trilogy, then that answer is obvious. Is it as good as the first two? Yes, and maybe even better. The film has a great energy, a great sense of humor, some terrific surprises and some terrific action sequences that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to give comic book movies a 10/10, mainly because I have such a high standard when it comes to them. Yes, perfect comic book movies exist. Is Iron Man 3 perfect? Not quite, because it doesn't exactly have the themes that the perfect comic book movies acquire. In other words, I wasn't moved by it. But that's okay, because the Iron Man trilogy isn't meant to be taken as seriously as some others, and so they shouldn't.

","This was released yesterday in New Zealand and after the Avengers i was really looking forward to the so called ""phase 2"" of movies about our favourite superheroes starting with Ironman 3. Unfortunately for me this movie took a backward step. It was fairly slow but it also did have plenty of action. The story was simple, all the special effects were fantastic and RDJ did his thing again owning the screen as IM. The downside for me was the vulnerability of IM and the lame enemies. I thought that it was great that Tony Stark was pushed to his limits but would have been better against a different foe, someone challenging on the technical side maybe. Instead we have some people that can annoyingly rejuvinate over and over again. They reminded me of the ugly vampire people on Blade 2. And the biggest downer was how easily IM's suit was trashed. My daughter asked me after leaving the cinema ""how come ironmans suit keep breaking so easily?"" And shes right. The lame bad guys seemed to overpower ironman quite easily and the amount of suits that were ripped to shreds left me wondering, are they made of plastic now? Considering the types of opponents hes come up against in previous movies IM 1, IM 2 and Thor and all the aliens in Avengers, its quite a shock to see the suit torn apart like that. It just didn't make sense. We all love Tony Starks Ironman suit and all the little gizmos in all the previous movies but unfortunately this time around, the Ironman suit wasn't that Iron at all:("

","i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.<br/><br/>even though i use to be a comic book fan, i am also a movie fan too! i see this movie in the same light that the critics do and i would actually give this movie an 8. you see, if you just ignore the huge change they made to the main villain compared to the comic, then the movie stands up very well on its own.<br/><br/>come on people, how can you not like a movie with a cast including : will sadler, miguel ferrer, rebecca hall, guy pearce, robert downey jr,don cheadle and more and everybody looked like they were having fun doing this movie. besides that you also have a very strong message about private corporation sponsored custom made terrorists. that is a very real and scary threat, all you need is one big nut-job in a high position to do so.<br/><br/>the special effects are worth a mention, they were spectacular and for people that said it was slow and not enough action, i say phooey, it had as much as the previous two and the pacing i felt was better also.<br/><br/>the movie had a nice intelligent script and very competent actors and if you are a fan of twists in movies, this one has a few.<br/><br/>so...all you iron-man comic book fans have to try to cool off and watch this movie and see and relate to it as a movie and then give your opinion. for me personally, this is the 4th time i've watched the movie and unlike the other comic book movies this one seems to get better with every viewing.<br/><br/>if you were to leave the comic book fans out of the voting( there is a lot of them it seems ) and just leave it to the critics and fans of movies then this movie would at least be an 8 on IMDb."

"joecartwright-409-272985","8","19","30","2 October 2013"," A brief review of Iron Man 3
","****This Review may contain spoilers**** Iron man 3, a good film from the point of view of a non-marvel viewer like myself. No doubt it was wildly successful, and personally I found it funny, action packed, had a sense of girl power delivered nicely from Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) towards the end, and was just a thoroughly enjoyable film. Although from the point of an avid marvel fan it was a true disappointment, stripping The Mandarin (Ben Kinglsey) of his original evil ways and making him and idiotic and useless tool that is part of a bigger plan; not only that but they got an actor as highly talented as Ben Kinglsey and wasted him on a role with little meaning. However I did really enjoy the comedy The Mandarin brought which complimented Killian Aldrich's (Guy Pearce) evil and malevolent ways. Moving on to the most important person; Tony Stark – played by the one and only amazing Robert Downey Jr. He is hilarious and has brought back another astounding performance from the original Iron Man. While everyone else delivers a great performance, Robert Downey Jr really makes the film how good it is! However it was quite annoying that in the film Iron Man, he spent a little amount of time actually in the suit being Iron Man and more time being Tony Stark. While this is good, I'd still prefer to have seen more of him in the suit, being IRON MAN! This is only a minor bad point and didn't have too much of an effect on the overall film. Like I said it was funny and action packed and just really good to watch. It had impeccable editing and exceptional special effects, plus the Eiffel 65 theme tune was so great! Going back to the view of a Marvel fan, the film was an utter disaster. If you go into this film and expect to see an accurate representation of what was delivered in Stan Lees famous comic books then you will be greatly disappointed. 'The Mandarin' is reduced to nothing more than a druggy who was found on the streets and brought in to act the role; the only good thing is he was played by Ben Kingsley. While it did add an element of humour I still feel it was a bit of a let down from what was expected. Also with him being made into a joke it stripped the film of its main villain and left an empty hole which could only be filled by a true evil source. The whole plot of the film was good, well thought out and followed on nicely from the two previous films – which were also amazing – and continued the whole theme of the trilogy perfectly. Also it was well connected to The Avengers which was good but unless you'd seen The Avengers, like I hadn't the first time I saw this film, then it got a little confusing and felt like I missed something in the second film. This was just a minor setback and was quickly fixed with a little background info from a friend. Finally I felt this film was extremely good, a little confusing but nothing too bad, very funny and I enjoyed it all the way through. From my point of view, a non-marvel fan, it was a great film; but from a serious marvel fan it was a serious let down. I'd recommend that if you want to see an action packed and really good superhero film then this is for you. But if you expect to see an accurate and close follow to the comic books then this isn't really for you. One last note is the final battle, this was seriously amazing! The special effects in it, the amount of money spent on it just everything! The pyrotechnics were something else and just I loved it all so much! One of the best scenes from a film ever."
"aesgaard41","9","19","30","11 September 2013"," Iron Man Soars And Fails On Different Levels -
","I think it was in ""Last Action Hero"" that the kid sidekick told Arnold Schwarzeneggar's movie character that by the third movie, everything is supposed to get harder, and that's very much obvious in ""Iron Man 3"" because Robert Downey Jr.'s character of Tony Stark spends more time out of his suit than he did in it in both the first two movies. Once more dipping into the franchise of Marvel Comics, a terrorist named the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley is threatening the world, and it is again up to Tony to stand up to defending the planet, only he is not going to be helped by his teammates from ""The Avengers."" Tony is assisted by Don Cheadle as War Machine aka Iron Patriot and the rest of his iron brigade that by this movie he has developed to operate by voice control. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts actually gets more to do than just scream and be a victim; she actually gets to wear the suit and become the Iron Princess. The movie and plot are rungs above the first two films with a lot more going on. Experiencing a bit of post-traumatic stress after the aliens in ""Avengers,"" Tony proves he doesn't need the suit as he deals with a number of genetically enhanced assassins led by Guy Pearce who can actually burn through the suit via a genetic quirk that amped his healing factor. (Does Wolverine know this chowder-head stole his gimmick?) Watching the movie, I can't help but wonder if Tony has ever seen a zombie flick; why doesn't he just shoot these people in the head? There is no way they can regenerate brain cells. Once those things are lost, there is no coming back. Beyond that, ""Iron Man 3"" is beyond exemplary, setting new standards for all superhero flicks coming up or in production and establishing that it really doesn't matter who's in the suit, just what you do with it. There are a few more deaths than usual, and several jaw-dropping moments, and Downey's quips and the fact the movie itself doesn't take itself serious make it more than appealing. My only fault with it is that Tony was going to come to Tennessee, he could have stopped by and said hello. My advice: leave the genetically enhanced assassins in California."
"royzuidema","8","19","30","20 August 2013"," Iron Man 3, a perfect sequel to The Avengers (!) & Iron Man 2
","I watched Iron Man 3 with a low expectations due to the mostly negative reviews. After watching it, I have actually no clue why all those reviews are so extremely negative. Of course a third movie is not the same as the movies before, there have to be changes because without them everyone would complain about the movie being boring and the same. And of course the plot twist regarding the Mandarin are somewhat.. let's say unexpected. A lot of people also said that the movie was really unrealistic, I can imagine why they say that but after The Avengers I thought the reality had already gone. Iron Man 3 is indeed a sequel of Iron Man 2 but also (not to forget!!) of The Avengers. And please don't say flying aliens from another dimension are realistic..<br/><br/>Therefore I'd like to talk about the positive parts in the movie (which are the most parts if you ask me) and by discussing those parts I'll keep in mind that Iron Man 3 follows Tony Stark after dealing with the events in The Avengers. The thing I really love is that we see Tony Stark as a person, not only as a character that controls the Iron Man suit. Tony dealt with a lot of problems in The Avengers, he even almost committed suicide to save the world, something that he wouldn't have done in Iron Man 1. This is a major example of the change of Tony Stark as a person. What would you guys think? That after almost killing himself he would just be the same old Tony Stark. That after seeing aliens and other things he (the technician who only believed in the laws of physics) thought weren't possible he would just be cocky, humorous and afraid of nothing. That (!) would be unrealistic. <br/><br/>I think Iron Man 3 is the perfect sequel to Iron Man 2 and The Avengers just because it follows the growth of Tony Stark's character. The Manderin could have been a lot cooler, I'll agree with you on that point. But I do think this is a plot twist that no one saw coming, which is the definition of a good plot twist in my opinion."

From start to finish you are thrown in to lots of action, twists and turns. This film will not disappoint all you hardcore Marvel/iron man fans.There are some big twists, which really make this film that bit more exciting. For me the most impressive part of the movie were the visual effects, which you would expect from such a film as this. They really push the boat out with huge explosions, gun fights and all the usual extras. I do believe this will be one of the biggest films to date. Definitely worth an 8 out of 10."
"genisis-03735","1","10","14","11 August 2016"," Wait, What?
","I have been watching iron man since I was about 14 and read the comics from time to time. So when the films came out i was exited. But iron man seems to have this thing where it looks like a good solid film until it gets to the last 10 minutes of it.<br/><br/>So when Iron man 3 rolled around and I seen the trailer, It looked amazing! Now I know all about the mandarin and his background story . But when I seen Ben Kingsley in that green robe and the rings with the top knot, Bricks where shat in the best possible way, Even although he didn't look like a green Ming the Merciless (Praise Be) I knew from what I had seen in the trailer and the acting skills of Ben Kingsley that he will pull it off no problem.<br/><br/>All I wanted was to see Tony Stark pushed to the limit by his arch nemesis the mandarin.<br/><br/>But no.<br/><br/>What did I get instead? Tony Starks crappy suits that run out of power and get ripped apart by human torches, I thought the comic book title was the invincible iron man, Not, Holy crap nobody sneeze or fart up in this joint because my cardboard suits will fall apart.<br/><br/>Then the part where he spends time with that kid.WHY! You wasted about 15 minuets of mandarin and iron man fighting.<br/><br/>But I can forgive all of that. Because the mandarin was still the scary bad guy and with the voice of Ben Kingsley and the look he gives the camera when he's on the screen, I was still into the film.Just.<br/><br/>Then the unbelievable happened. The mandarin is not the real mandarin. You want to know how to mess up a film? That's how! It was Guy Pearce's character, remember him? Me neither. You had one job and you where doing it just fine until that part. I didn't care if he had no magic powers or wasn't green and or Asian, the whole terrorist thing was working and I was OK with that.<br/><br/>But then you fecked it all up by making him a dumb generic character that gets defeated by Gwyneth goddam Paltrow in spandex. He. Is. The. Mandarin. He can rip tony stark suits apart with his bare hands without any use of his rings! Witch according to this film anyone and their granny can do.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film is so stupid. Tony can't build a suit worth a dam and he doesn't even care! No one gives a dam who Guy Pearce's characters name is or his crappy back story. See I can't even remember and that is a whole different realm of blasphemy because it's Guy Pearce! You wasted Guy Pearce you c**ts.<br/><br/>Look I can even make a better story line. The mandarin and tony fight a big corporate war that nearly bankrupts tony and then he realises through some kind of epiphany who he is and what he's all about! And that the mandarin has bee using one of his mental powers to screw with his mind. Then the mandarin dons his robe and rings and tony gets his new super awesome suit and then they fight and smash the place up for about a good 20min. Then tony gets the upper hand but only just. There you're done."
"Leofwine_draca","4","10","14","29 February 2016"," Dull, dull, dull
","I thought the second IRON MAN film wasn't bad at all, a certain step up from the wonky first instalment, but this third outing for the superhero is one too many. IRON MAN 3 feels like a bloated and superficial comedy with all of Robert Downey Jr.'s annoying wisecracks coming to the fore and not along else.<br/><br/>If I had to describe this film in a single word, it would indeed be 'bloated'. The running time is bloated as are the endless CGI action sequences, which go nowhere and add nothing of any entertainment value to the screen. Downey Jr. gives a lazy performance, while the script is even lazier in bumping off key characters only to bring them back five minutes later in supposed 'twists'.<br/><br/>My interest was briefly raised by the appearance of Guy Pearce, but even he doesn't seem to be very good here, and the less said about Ben Kingsley's over the top acting the better. If you like childish action, lots of bonding with that annoying kid from JURASSIC WORLD, and a general lack of momentum and direction, then IRON MAN 3 might be the film for you."
"ajinkya-nazare07","4","227","455","27 April 2013"," Most disappointing marvel movie EVER!
","Let me start by stating the obvious. The movie was super-hyped, the trailers misleading and the story turned out to be something else (and not good at all). Shane Black must have thought that the twist about the Mandarin would blow people's minds but the only thing it did was cause frustration and disappointment. What was he thinking while destroying and ridiculing the best and most menacing villain in the Iron Man universe?! What in the world happened to his 10 rings and every ring having a different power? Imagine if the Joker comes out to reveal that he's just some joker hired from some circus and the real mind behind him is Sal Maroni! To make things worse and humiliate the Mandarin, Aldrich Killian says ""I am the Mandarin"". Seriously, Shane Black has totally destroyed what could've been a 9.0+ rated movie instead turning it to be a comical mishap. And plot holes.. Plot holes everywhere! His suit is supposed to be made out of a gold and titanium alloy and it breaks into pieces when it gets hit by a truck?! It felt more of a love story than a superhero movie. If he knows he can summon all his suits, why did he wait to call them in the climax instead of doing that when his house is getting blown to shreds? That is not Iron Man, he doesn't wait to destroy when he knows he already has the firepower. Robert Downey Jr. has delivered a good performance though. Ben Kingsley is totally wasted! I don't know why he even accepted the role. Aldrich Killian can never look as demented as the Mandarin, especially after the reveal, and so even a great actor like Guy Pearce was wasted. And for a seemingly ""most important thing in"" Tony Stark's life, Pepper Pots was not seen much in the movie and in the end she's the one killing Killian! WHAAAAAAT?! In all, the movie is certainly NOT for the dedicated comic readers who'd literally scream after the stupidity of Shane Black destroying the Mandarin and making a small character like Aldrich Killian the prime antagonist. He should have just stuck to the original story line by modifying it such that it didn't affect the Mandarin-Iron Man rivalry. Extremely disappointing movie. Wouldn't watch Iron Man 4 (if it is coming out at all) unless it was directed by someone else."
"sosuavesmooth","9","20","32","11 June 2013"," Remember what the movie represents, conclusions and endings.
","I was beyond excited to see this movie, and I believe it fulfilled all of my expectations. A lot of people were disappointed because he only spends little under half an hour in the suit, and even then, its just the shell. <br/><br/>What you have to remember when watching this film is that it is the finale of the Iron Man trilogy. Its not necessarily about the action, its about wrapping up the characters stories and closing up any loose ends. This movie does that.<br/><br/>Look at the Dark Knight trilogy, its exactly the same. The first movie introduces the characters and sets up the second film (which is typically the best film in regards to what people want from it). The second film is what makes your inner 8 year old scream in excitement. Although Iron Man 2 didn't fulfill that, it was more about advancing Tony's suit and his role as Iron Man. Then the final movie is about the character learning who he really is and what he means in all of it. Tony struggles post Avengers, and this movie displays his resolution of that event while also taking on the Mandarin. It ends his story, just like The Dark Knight Rises concludes its trilogy. <br/><br/>I loved the movie, the only complaint I had was how the technology that lets him control his suit with his mind makes the suit seem like it can be blown apart really easy. In the first movie he got flat out motorcycle punched and his suit was intact, but now he can just punch it with his fist and it shatters?"
"avsroxbronxfan","9","20","32","3 May 2013"," Marvel's best Iron Man movie
","This was a great movie, and I actually think it's the best Iron Man movie. I wasn't big on the beginning of the movie, but I think it gets deep and really interesting when he's flown to Tennessee. His house was bombed and all his Iron Man suits (except for a protocol) were destroyed. The one he wears when he's flown was injured in the battle. For most of the movie, he's actually not fighting as Iron Man. He's fighting as Tony Stark. He grabs a gun, and actually has good combat skills too. He manages to fight off the Mandrin's henchmen very well, even without the suit. This was a very risky move, but it works out very well if you ask me. He shows that he's not some weakling and if you take away his armor and weapons, he would be an easy target. He shows that he's a tough guy underneath as well. I'm glad they took that route. Before this movie came out, Robert Downey Jr. said ""Iron Man 3 won't be a serious movie."" I see why he said that. There's a lot of funny moments in this film, even though this isn't labeled as a comedy.<br/><br/>One problem I had with Iron Man 2 was that there wasn't much of a story to it, or that much action. I see that one as build-up to The Avengers. This one, however, was completely different. Nick Fury actually isn't in this movie. They mention the parts of The Avengers like two or three times, but that's not the focus of this movie, and that's a great thing.<br/><br/>So far, this is my favorite film of 2013, and you guys should definitely see it. I'm very glad I saw it, and I will see it again."
"rocks-patel","1","145","285","26 April 2013"," Disappointing. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!
","I hereby write a review in complete frustration after thinking about this movie. <br/><br/>What did Shane Black do? OH GOD WHY?! <br/><br/>The complete hype of Mandarin, the dark scene where Tony carried his suit, what I thought came out all disappointing. <br/><br/>You think there's a Mandarin with 10 rings power? NO! The Mandarin is complete joke here. <br/><br/>First of all, Here, Aldrich Killian says, ""I'm Mandarin"".. Aldrich Killian and the Mandarin were never the same person. I mean I was like ""Whaaa?"" The part of me just got died when Tony enters in house looking for Mandarin. <br/><br/>Why do they muck around with the already established story lines? They really should have kept to the basics of the Mandarin story line. In a word disappointing!<br/><br/>The suits of Tony broke every time. I mean, the suits aren't suppose to be like these. Aren't the suits suppose to resist the thunders by Thor's and all stuff? One of the suit here just broke by Truck clashing. ""Whaaaa?!"" <br/><br/>In terms of story and comic book alignment, Ironman 3 is worst of the three movies."
"The-Seeker","8","15","23","25 July 2015"," Not without flaws but still a hugely entertaining ride.
","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>I'll dive right in and start by addressing the obvious elephant in the room by which I mean Iron Man 3's many questionable plot points and outright flaws. Following on from 2012's stunning dream team-up The Avengers, Iron Man 3 had the unenviable task of picking up the pieces and going solo again. <br/><br/>My first nitpick is Tony Stark's PTSD regarding his flight through a wormhole above New York. A man who has an innate ability to predict the future (for aside from his mechanical genius that is Stark's 'power') would surely be well equipped mentally to cope with the revelation that aliens are indeed out there. His breakdown due to this one factor is something that doesn't smack of the comic book Tony Stark. I simply don't buy his anguish. <br/><br/>Another jarring choice is the difference between pre-Extremis Killian and his super- powered version. A more subtle physical performance for the pre-enhanced version would have been preferred from Guy Pearce. And whilst on the subject, the level of power that Extremis gives its subjects is pushed just too far. Rapid regeneration and the ability to heat up to 1,000s of degrees is just taking things too far to remain wholly believable. These guys make the T-1000 look tame. A little more restraint is all I'm asking. <br/><br/>Another nitpick is the last line which was changed from the scripted one. One of the film's better ideas is taking Tony Stark and stripping him of his suits but even without them he's still a guy who can make something out of nothing and survive, he still is Tony Stark yet the closing line of ""I am Iron Man"" as opposed to the original line of ""I am Tony Stark"" is a bizarre choice and in a way prevents Tony's story arc coming full circle. <br/><br/>These are personal nitpicks and some may see other major plot points as flaws and whereas I once did, I've now come to appreciate some of Shane Black's more bold choices. So let's deal with the main one, The Mandarin. Whilst I was with the majority initially and hated the big twist now I see it as a stroke of genius and very brave writing. Killian himself addresses the matter when he says, ""You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a Bin- Laden, a Gaddafi, The Mandarin, you hand people a target."" It's all there in that one line, The Mandarin was the ultimate decoy. And let's be honest about the Mandarin from the comics, he's an outdated Fu-Manchu racial stereotype that borders on being offensive. And let's not take any credit away from Sir Ben, as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery he's just pure entertainment. <br/><br/>What IM3 gets right it does so with aplomb. The film's humour is spot-on most of the time and typical of a Shane Black film. The three main action scenes (there are lots more besides) are a masterclass in frenetic, well staged and jaw-dropping action. The helicopter attack on the Malibu house is superb and the Air Force One skydiving rescue scene is phenomenal and one of the greatest set-pieces I've ever seen, the majority of it filmed for real with only minor CG enhancements. The final House Party Protocol battle is the stuff of fanboy dreams and is wholly satisfying. Apart from Tony then blowing up all his suits that is. Bum move Stark, you might need those soon!<br/><br/>So in summary it's a film that fires along at a cracking pace and thoroughly entertains if you can ignore some of its more questionable plot choices. For me it's the most entertaining of the three Iron Man films and one that I initially disliked but have now grown to love. It stands up to repeat viewings as much as any of the best MCU films. I still lament Marvel's avoidance of some the darker elements from the books relating to Stark's alcoholism which would give RDJ an opportunity to really stretch his acting muscles and give extra depth to the character. The film's mis-steps are often significant and have irked many a hardcore Marvel fan but they're mostly forgivable when you take into account just how very high those many high points are."
"mianovalic2","9","15","23","23 November 2014"," Not perfect,but very well made.
","I was very surprised with people criticizing this movie at first, because of the Mandarin twist many people are saying it wasn't as good as they expected it, well we all have different opinions, but to criticize entire movie because of the villain twist which actually fits the movie way better or simply not liking it is somehow in my opinion...well, screams a person never pleased with anything and is very pessimistic and as well as much as I hate to say it didn't ''get'' this movie. *SPOILER ALERT* Let's start off by Tony's panic attacks, considering that in the comics he struggled with alcohol for the younger audience it is way better to make him simply have anxiety issues other than let them see a hot mess drunk Stark, and oh well, he's a normal man, New York left a mark on him, it's understandable. The reason why his suits were a lot ''weaker'' is because they were prototypes, the original 7 or 8 suits he has were way stronger but they couldn't get attached to his body whenever he calls them and didn't have the new special features that he gave these new suits, he didn't yet perfect these suits and do every little detail right when he got attacked, when his house got destroyed the suits we know and see were also destroyed, but the House Protocol was this perfect back up plan he saved for the big moment, he saved it for the moment he will need them the most and that IS to save the president, if he used the protocol straight away when they attacked his house it wouldn't make any sense. Now the villain, as much as I know about the real Mandarin from the comic books, he just in my opinion wouldn't fit in this movie, still they portrayed him as a lunatic terrorist, and no matter how intimidating he looks, he's just another terrorist, and Tony has fought them in the first Iron Man, so this wouldn't be that big of a problem he would find his location and find a way to kill him, Killian is different, his problem with Tony is more on a personal level, and look at it this way, the man has learned how to ''upgrade'' humans DNA, and we all have seen that while it's not perfectly upgraded, after becoming extremist it is very hard to defeat it. This was the first time the villain actually was maybe smarter than Tony, this was the first time Tony had to show off his skills outside of the suit, this was the first time I wasn't so sure will he win at the end, and in my opinion that is what makes this movie very well put all together, finally we see Tony Stark is not invincible, he isn't perfect, he isn't a non emotional son of a bitch that only cares about himself, he takes risks, he makes plans years ahead, and well, his suits are not a distraction or a hobby. His suits are him,he IS Ironman. CGI was incredible, every action scene was well done, the ending made up for few plot holes which every movie has. 9/10"
"hasserbond","8","15","23","25 January 2014"," Overall, Iron Man 3 will divide many avid comic book fans, but is still a fun, exciting, and damn entertaining conclusion to the trilogy.
","Heres the story; playboy billionaire industrialist engineer Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is recovering from his battle in New York against aliens with the help of the Avengers, Marvels cannon of action-prone and muscle bound heroes. He's previously rebuilt his body after being held captive by Middle eastern extremists, in the process created a metal, enemy pulverizing suit, equipped with flying jets and energy blasters of course, defeated his crazy competitor, a vengeful, bird loving Russian, and now an alien race. Bottom line: the man's had his fair share of ass-kicking. This understandably, is beginning to effect him. He's having anxiety attacks and the fact that a supposed terrorist labeled the Mandarin is targeting civilians, and maybe even some friends of Mr. Stark, isn't helping. Sure enough as the story progresses, his pals, president, prodigy, love, and life are on the line. With out giving away many of the films twists and turns, Tony ends up somewhat back where he started and must find the tools to save his fate before time runs out and you know the story. Or do you...? <br/><br/>The good: Iron Man 3's action sequences dazzle with ""Marvel-ous"" (sorry couldn't help myself) visual effects, but the real show stealer is the films extremely clever, frequently hilarious, and awesomely self aware humor. Shane Black peppers the script with so much chewable wit and varying, unexpected twists that you can't help yourself from having a great time amidst the violent chaos, even though some may find the jokes distracting. I beg to differ. RDJ owns the role and steals the show as Iron Man once more. Per usual, he adds in his perfect mixture of narcissistic snakiness with evolving dramatic struggles, but never takes it all to seriously. Not only does he do well, but the entire cast all are fairly strong and add their fair share of laughs, deliciously evil or humorously likable moments, and seem to be having a good time as well. <br/><br/>The story is thick but presented in a well paced and orchestrated fashion and it strings together the explosions in a clean juxtaposition (oxymoron?) with it's reveals and character developments. The special effects are top notch and immerse the audience into the fast paced action sequences, and they also carry the torch on from The Amazing Spiderman in which the SFX are a slight notch more realistic and crisper than previous Marvel outings of the past 3 years. And now for the direction, while Shane Black doesn't completely steal the show visually, he sure as hell puts his personal stamp on the film, and I welcome it. He has taken the previous material and blended it with his different style and humor and created what I believe to be a more unique and quirkier superhero flick that delivers much of what it promises, but surprises as well in areas you wouldn't expect. Many die hard comic fans will be angered or even infuriated by the liberties Black takes with the source material, but again as a non-comic book reader, you won't hear any complaining from me. I love his ambition and some of the daring choices he makes along the journey. In conclusion I think that he has tied an equal parts goofy but still satisfying bow on the explosive trilogy, and has made me excited for more Marvel outings to come. <br/><br/>As a side note, go into it with an open mind, stay after the credits, you won't be disappointed!"
"iam_tonystark","9","15","23","13 October 2013"," A Big Hit!
","I thought that Iron Man 3 was a smash hit! The movie shows that Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. is truly a superhero, and shows that he does a lot more heroic qualities of Tony Stark. The previous Iron Man films were shown by the perspective stand point of Iron Man, but in this film shows a lot more of Tony Stark. <br/><br/>The special effects of IM3 was amazing! It made everything just come to life, it made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the movie. The special effects also made the movie so much more suspenseful and intense, I didn't want to stop watching it! This movie is now one of my favorites!"
"lois-mckinder","8","15","23","2 October 2013"," Good but could be better
","The film is really good its has plenty of action adventure and humour. The budget was $200 million and the Box office was over billion which shows the success of the film.<br/><br/>The film beings with a flashback on one New Year's Eve Tony Starks humiliates Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce. Years later explosions happen in America which leaves Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who was Starks body guard and directed Iron Man 1 and 2,in a coma, Tony threatens the people behind it, which then leads to his home being destroyed, he then finds the people who are responsible after taking him and Pepper Potts hostage. All he has to fight with is his new prototype MK42.<br/><br/>The director of Iron Man is Shane Black who is known for his films based on Christmas, and started the film on New Years Eve which is around Christmas time. <br/><br/>One good thing about this film are the Visual effects. Also, the humour used in the film keeps the film entertaining. The tension created also contributes to making this film worth to watch. And relationship with Harley, who was the young boy, shows emotional side of Stark which helps us understand the character more.<br/><br/>One bad thing about this film is the uncovering of the Madrian because some of the audience may be expecting a real villain. Also before the film came out the teasers shown people dying and more action but didn't happen as much in the film. The ending of the film is disappointing as it ended and resolved itself quickly."
"iitb-pranav","8","15","23","16 May 2013"," Great technology imagination, awesome special effects and cool acting
","Human beings have always tried to see beyond the future. We extend our imagination beyond our limits. And when any movie offers a visual treat showing some of the best science fiction stuff, we just love to enjoy watching it. Isn't it? Iron Man 3 offers just the same. After Avengers thrilled our eyes, Iron Man 3 gives us a fabulous treat by taking the Iron man technology to the next level. Frankly, Iron man 2 didn't offer much of the variety in terms of entertainment. It felt like just continuation of Iron Man 1. But Iron Man 3 takes the suit to the next level and gives a completely different entertainment factor. Movie starts with glimpses of Stark's past that would establish its connection with the main story. Main story starts with the terror threats and series of bomb explosions executed by a terrorist named 'Mandarin'. Story also introduces in parallel a scientist working on human DNA upgrading. Tony is developing new versions of his Iron Man suit. Soon circumstances project Stark as a rival of Mandarin. Movie offers many unexpected turn of events and some eye-catching visual effects as it progresses. Some of the scenes like demolition of Stark's home, Stark rescuing people from plane crash and fight of Iron men army are unforgettable. RDJ is awesome as usual. It feels like he is not acting but he is Iron man himself. Among others, Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic appearance. Though the role is short, it offers lots of shades in his characters. In all I would say, this is a must watch movie for fabulous special effects, awesomely eccentric RDJ, good story and a nice climax. Don't miss this one."
"YJLcool","8","89","170","25 April 2013"," An entertaining superhero film that surpassed its predecessors
","Iron Man 3 is a fast-paced, entertaining sci-fi action thriller that turned out better than its disappointing predecessor. <br/><br/>This time around, there's no distracting Avengers subplot and the main focus goes to the main character instead. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is at his best and fits his role perfectly as the arrogant, smart-ass Tony Stark by delivering sharp witty dialogue that make the film downright hilarious. Great round of applause for the people who's responsible for thinking up the various ways Tony can put on the suits in the film, well done!<br/><br/>However, the film crossed the borderline of science fiction and science fantasy. There are things in the film that's simply could not happen in reality under any circumstances, which some movie-goers might find it hard to accept. As a person who knows the cartoon and comics, the direction the film took for the characters and the ""Extremis"" story arc is questionable. Some Marvel fans/purists will find it unacceptable, but for casual movie-goers, the plot is great and it's really a personal story about the titular hero. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 showed that it's not just a superhero film, but a smart comedy film as well. So, in the end, does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit? Well, you damn well know what the answer is after finish watching this film."

","""Things are different now, I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you.""<br/><br/>Since Shane Black has signed to do Iron Man 3 I have been so excited for this picture, and i was already excited enough for Marvel phase 2 after the Avengers. Teaming up once again in his second outing with his Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang lead, and it does not disappoint. <br/><br/>A typical Super hero story, The international terrorist The Mandarin arrives on the scene and causes mayhem across the world, and may have help from some scientist acquaintances from Tony's past. For me Iron man's greatest strength is the casting of Robert Downey Jr. He encapsulates the character so well, the charisma,the humor, the ego so well. If this is to be his last appearance in a stand alone Iron Man. I for one can not think of anyone around at the moment who could take over the role,especially in the inevitable reboot of the franchise. Getting back to this film the cast of iron man has always been top notch with great support characters played by Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and i could go on. This sequel hasn't gone down the usual route of recent sequels. Not going darker but keeping fun, not going bigger and louder (don't get me wrong there are some big action set pieces) but stripping Tony of the suit for large parts and focusing on the character. There is decent action to be seen, with the destruction of Tony Stark's home, for me being some of the best 5 minutes of intense action i have seen for quite some time. Also Iron man keeps it's good humor and puts in a decent amount of laughs. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie is where i find some problems, as it quite predictable and never built any sense of dread, that the bad guys could win. The bad guys in this film The Mandarin, Aldrich Killian and there Extremis Super soldiers. Which are a major improvement on previous Iron man villains. Seem very intimidating and imposing, but the motivation for there crimes seems a little fuzzy.<br/><br/>A good film by Shane Black in his first foray in to comic book/action, and if it is Downey Jr's last. It's not a bad way to bow out."
"Wormholeninefanpage","8","22","36","24 December 2014"," If you love the comic books you'll probably hate this movie.
","Me, not a fan or follower of the comics, love the MCU. You may have seen reviews negatively discarding this movie. It's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Showing from my score I loved it, it takes more of a different turn than the first two with the story which is about Tony and developing him as a character.<br/><br/>First of all, the writing great (what do expect from Shane Black). The witty dialogue and one liners had me gut busting with laughter. Even the twist that I'd hate to spoil is pretty funny to even be considered a comedy. Most of this is due to Robert Downey Jr. turning in another performance as Tony Stark, the likable a**hole. The supporting cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, who is a good villain but just no Loki or Joker level.<br/><br/>The action is well directed too, showing Tony can kick a** with or without a suit. There small shootouts and fistfights along with your big budget stuff you expect from Marvel include a very tense attack on Air Force One. The CGI is great too.<br/><br/>People have been constantly been nitpicking at this movie, relax, it's not every movie where it is required to analyze every part of the plot and story. It's just a bit popcorn munching, summer blockbuster fun. Not f****ing Citizen Kane."

Tony Stark Alias Iron man, affected with PTSD, sets out on finding and  eliminating Mandarin, and Afghan terrorist who is spreading terror in  the USA and who interferes in Iron man's life.

The film is simply action packed. Stunts and effects all around 2  hours, and has lots of cheeky dialogs too.

"Remyghanem","9","39","69","28 April 2013"," a lot of SPOILERS so don't read it if not seen!!!!
","A LOT OF SPOILERS SO DON'T READ IF THE MOVIE IS NOT SEEN, I POSTED THIS VIDEO TO EXPLAIN WHY, IN MY OPINION, THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST IRON MAN MADE. <br/><br/>I put it a 10/10, because it , it had everything needed, a main storyline, with a lot of secondary story lines, life isn't what it always seems, this was the best example, USA made mistakes just like every other country, NOBODY and nothing IS PERFECT even tony stark have his own issues, and he not just IRON MAN but he's a genius, uses his brain and environment to HIS advantage. and terrorism aren't what TV tells you (literarily) , and he don't only have Tony stark life shown, but everybody else's, we have secondary story lines, just like the real mandarins ( the twist of the movie... not what we all thought he were, what the TV showed them was just a BIG JOKE. the real one is always hidden... think about it) , and other peoples (fanboy, the little kid, the ex, Happy etc...), that they are trying to show us that there not only ONE superhero vs ONE villain, there're other people who are here to help, like the weird fan guy in the van scene, like the little kid, with just one snowball he saved tony starks life, but also pepper who terminated the Mandarin in a very sexy way. And even James Rhodes who save the presidents life on his own. every body and everything is important to the movie, we have people going to do the right thing with what they've got because they want to help people other than themselves that makes them good people, and other people going to do the wrong thing because of their own selfishness that makes them bad people. The secondary character were here to show us that other people are having their own lives, with their issues and tendencies.<br/><br/>The humor was genius especially with the scene when tony starks leaves the kid, and the kid was trying to mess with him, the second the kid said that you were going to leave me like my father I Actually prayed that tony would say YES, because I (fuckin') knew that the kid was just messing with him, kids living on their own, tend to learn and be more mature than normal kids living with their parents.<br/><br/>The twist was never seen before, terrorism is not what people think it is. just like in homeland series with the couple who were being terrorist, it's not what alway Arab vs occidentals ( that's would be a racist thing to say..). it was a very objective movie, it's not a good vs evil. it's people making choices, actions and living the consequences, it could be a good thing for them ( like the little kid's surprise at the end, or a bad thing like the vice president being arrested, even if he did it so help his daughter, sacrificing a whole nation for a personal thing is acting a very selfish way. you would say that it was his daughter, but if you look at it, even if her leg would come back, it would be a bloody leg, just like bloody money is bad. so helping someone you love by hurting someone else is not good (simple as that).<br/><br/>SO there you go: The story was awesome, action was awesome, humor was awesome, acting ... nothing to say, music was awesome, etc etc... the movie is purely awesome. There were a lot of character development just to show us there not just a one good guy vs one bad guy, we have everybody struggling with their own personal issues that is the main reason why, I had to put 10/10, the other was because of haters putting 1->6/10, if they didn't like the movie it's because they didn't understood it, it's OK not to understand or not liking it because it may not be your thing ( it's a shame, it's like not liking beer or nutella....), but people who are insulting it because they didn't understood it are... being BAD people."

Also he could find the ""rings"" later , or he could be covering for the Mandarin. There are plenty of ways he could come back.<br/><br/>Yes this film has a little lack of action but the story is brilliant how Tony Stark grows as a character so much. The Mandarin could quite easily be brought into The Avengers or The next Iron Man film.

","Spoiler free review:<br/><br/>Its not really worth going much into detail, after all this movie follows the classic RDJ - Stark formula. For me and the audience, it was just as good as it was first presented in Iron Man 1. It keeps you entertained along the movie, some good laughs here and there, cool tech, Decent action sequences, etc. You can't really hate the character, his quirks and gadgets regardless of the plot.<br/><br/>The trailer and the first part of the movie sets you in a dark atmosphere not seen and experienced in the 2 previous installments. You know that very soon things will get serious and bad for our main characters, the downfall is imminent. But then as the movie progresses, one keeps expecting some real trouble; a ruthless, merciless and powerful villain to reign over the story...And it happens of course, (without revealing anything), it just that is really nothing special, really. The plot ends being flat and its just as rewarding as Iron Man 2 plot. <br/><br/>Positive aspects: -New tech and gadgets: It is shown and comes across the story in unpredictable moments and ways. Really fun -I liked the soundtrack, it gave the movie more depth and feeling. I think it was better than previous installments, only it got repetitive at the end of the movie -A+ visuals and effects -Bad ass Suits and actions<br/><br/>Negative: -A lot of the plot aspects are left behind mid film. Some of them are poorly handled and explained and are just thrown or taken out of nowhere to keep up the pace of the film -villain does not delivers 100%: A superhero movie is not only about the main hero, the villain is just as important.<br/><br/>Comic reader or not, it will be fun film. Just don't expect anything big that will leave you talking and thinking about the matter for a couple of weeks. When you walk out of theater you will be pleased for sure, the movie is worth it after all. It just that its not what many expected and it will just leave you with a big: ""Thats it?"
"taiji-huang","1","177","356","27 April 2013"," disappointed with the mandarin
","I am completely disappointed in the portrayal of the Mandarin. The Mandarin, being Iron Man's archenemy and all, turned out to be a persona that Killian (Guy Pierce) invented and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was nothing more than a decoy. This made me extremely angry considering that I have always liked the Mandarin from the comics. In my opinion, Killian completely differs from what the Mandarin actually is and this also leads to the problem of whether the Mandarin still exist in the movie universe. The action scenes were spectacular but that is about it. The plot twist that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was just a decoy was definitely meant to be one of the main points of the whole film. However, I just did not like it at all. And everything that follows the plot twist was just action. What I really wanted was a Mandarin based on the comics to carry the plot forward. While I think it's quite unfair to judge a whole movie based on a single character, the portrayal of the Mandarin completely destroyed the film for me and I am extremely disappointed with Marvel/Disney for changing the character."

","There is a moment in Iron Man 3 which will be a big influence on whether you enjoyed the movie or not. At the time of its release, this midway twist proved to be quite polarising, with many critics and fans revelling in the clever direction of the story, whilst others despaired at a Hollywood mishandling of an iconic character. Either way, Iron Man 3 will have you talking about it by the end.<br/><br/>And so you should; because, even setting aside the divisive twist, this is a hugely entertaining comic book movie infused with a wonderful sense of humour, a breakneck pace and some truly spectacular action sequences.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Tony Stark/Iron Man facing a new threat known as The Mandarin whilst juggling his relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and keeping Guy Pearce's creepy scientist at bay. It seems like there is a lot going on but by keeping the focus squarely on Tony, director Shane Black is able to keep the narrative from becoming incoherent, and more importantly, retain its sense of fun. <br/><br/>Downey Jr. is completely at home in the role of Tony Stark. He throws out one liners and insults with such ease yet achieves a sense of vulnerability not yet seen in the character. It is his most assured performance as Tony and one can only hope that he doesn't stop here. But it is not just Downey Jr. on form here, as Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, and most notably Ben Kingsley deliver fantastic performances<br/><br/>With the success of Avengers Assemble, and the decision to make this movie the first of Marvel's 'Phase Two', it would be understandable if Black was feeling any pressure, but it certainly doesn't come across on the screen. It may have been tempting to try and better Avengers Assemble by going bigger, flashier and louder; but wisely, Black chooses to rein in the more ridiculous aspects of comic book movies, and delivers a film which is more concerned about the man inside the suit, not just the suit itself. That is not to say there is not a lot of action; there is and it is eye popping, but in between the explosions and stunts, we get a chance to spend time with Tony and see what makes the snarky billionaire tick. The fact that it proves to be just as exciting and interesting as the segments with the suit is a testament to both Black's script and Downey Jr.'s performance. <br/><br/>A bold and surprising take on one of the most popular movie characters since Jack Sparrow. Filled with exciting action, hilarious one liners and one or two unexpected plot turns, Iron Man 3 will have you grinning throughout its 2 hour runtime."

Ben's performance radiate such a power that hopefully the audience remember his role. Even that the twist got ""huh?"" feelings but it definitely not made the role worse. Its just tell how smart the story is. I like that the villains are not one-dimensional the characters. <br/><br/>Overall the cast is perfect as usually in Iron Man movies. Gwyneth Paltrow showed more than the skin. She did good job and the script offered more than scream and the hero saves in every scenes. She actually acted and was equal with Downey Jr and others. Example The Amazing Spider-Man crew should take advice that how can write good role for female. Don Cheadle's performance was smooth and perfect partner to Tony Stark. I would see him War Machine solo film.<br/><br/>The special effects looked cool, realistic and the crew doesn't went to over-the-top. Only the final battle needed more imagination. But still the movie is smart and effects are better than in Man of Steel movie. Marvel Studio films are like one big movie. That' why we have to look these movies with a bigger scales. The first Iron Man saved Downey Jr career and he has taken recently many different roles. I think that this was his final Iron Man solo movie to him.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is the perfect ending to the Iron Man trilogy. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Hollywood bosses should think more than twice that do they want continue with the character or bring new the characters to the big screens. I feel that Downey Jr will look another projects after The Avenger 3. His performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man Is so memorable that it will hard to any actor replace the role."

","""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) is having some severe traumatic difficulties stemming from his recent combat experience depicted in ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately, he doesn't have time to resolve these issues because a terrorist by the name of ""the Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) is targeting him, his wife ""Pepper Potts"" (Gwyneth Paltrow) and ""President Ellis"" (William Sadler). Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see ""The Avengers"" or possibly one of the other two ""Iron Man"" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can.

His company is doing fine, his relationship and life not so, partly due to his dealing with anxiety attacks after the New York business referenced in the Avengers Assemble. He has also made friends with another armoured character called Iron Patriate or War Machine, played quite nicely by Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>All this continues onward as Stark has to deal with The Mandarin. The Mandarin appears to be a shadowy terrorist who strikes on American soil, in particular one attack which destroys the Mann's Chinese Theatre. He takes it upon himself to investigate further and finds that the Mandarin and the forces behind him are not all they seem.<br/><br/>Stark goes out on a limb and challenges the Mandarin to bring the fight to him, in an act of rather crazy bravado. The Mandarin reciprocates affording Stark and us the opportunity to see his new designs in action as one of the most complicated action sequences occurs. <br/><br/>After seeing his house destroyed, Stark takes himself out to the wilds and finds more about Killian. Killian is not all he seems. The end of the film is a blaze of action set pieces and loose end tie ups, including Stark's operation to rid himself of the shrapnel trying to kill him. <br/><br/>Whether Tony Stark returns or not is up to the producers. I disagree with many of the reviewers of this film. Ironman 3 is a load of fun. It has a crazy plot and humour, which is so often missing in super hero type movies particularly in the Batman ones. Downey Jnr is such good fun and all the cast do a brilliant job. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is an especially nice touch, whilst Guy Pearce continues to show us what a fine actor he is. <br/><br/>This only managed an 8 cos I want more films."

","Iron man is one of my favorite heroes from Marvel universe.

But not just any story - it had to have action, drama, mystery, suspense and romance. Well, what can I say - in that case Jake would have loved Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>The movie was packed with technological genius stuff. If you are a techno geek like me and enjoy cool gadgets you will enjoy this movie. As always it had scenes of Tony working for inventions, JARVIS, many suits and even more which I don't want to spoil.<br/><br/>The center again was Tony's and Pepper's romance, which was very touching and lighting up girls' hearts (guys, here's your excuse to take your girlfriend to this movie. Of course if your girlfriend is also a techno geek like me, she will be the one dragging you there) But it is great that Pepper is not just a simple bystander who just yells for.Tony, she's the girl in the middle of the action and always ready to protect her man as Tony is ready to protect her. But it's not just puppy love - they have arguments, they push, but they pull even harder.

He is the mechanic as he calls himself - the guy who fixes everything, the guy who makes everything work.<br/><br/>I won't even talk about action, because there's plenty of it. The comedy is also greatly put in between the action and romance.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't want to spoil anything.

","Let's start off by saying that IRON MAN 3 ensures a future to this ever so entertaining franchise. The 2nd movie did seem to be on full throttle whilst the e-brakes were on creating some critical friction where as the latest addition which makes this trilogy potentially even more lucrative. However Robert Downey Jr did sign up for only 3 installments and this maybe the last time we do see Tony Stark rolling solo. This being said the 48 year old superstar has said that he is hoping to play more of Tony Stark in the future. It's just a matter of time until we figure out if it will only be with the Avengers or simply on his own!<br/><br/>Two things about this motion picture is extremely are appealing to me. <br/><br/>An entirely new breed of nemesis with the inclusion of the Mandarin (not the fruit) is the first. The second one is having Shane Black take over the director's chair from Jon Favreau.<br/><br/>The Mandarin<br/><br/>A bit fruity isn't it? I feel The Mandarin is more villain than Vanko and Stane thanks be to his theatrics. He is more realistic and grittier than those before. The reference and the cut scene from the Middle East will connect you with the first movie making this explosion of action feel more IRON MAN. Sir Ben Kingsley is 100% the meanest nemesis in the Marvel universe. Loki to me feels smaller in my mind standing next to the fearful Mandarins persona. There is only so much that I can talk about the Mandarin without spoiling the entire movie for the reader. Once you watch it you will realize it and those who have watched it already will simply agree.<br/><br/>Shane Black<br/><br/>When you talk about Shane Black taking over from Jon Favreau the first question is why? Monetary decision? Creative Decision? Bottom line the change worked for the trilogy. Blacks worked with RDJ before and it's even fair to say that RDJ got a push into the stardom following KISS KISS BANG BANG. Black accepts the facts and realizes that Iron Man certainly cannot go bigger than THE AVENGERS since it's the story of Tony Stark and this man's only super power is hi mind. Hence IRON MAN 3 becomes entirely about Stark following the entire New York City incident. Black focuses on the Man and not on the Suit. He exposes Stark and brings out the sharpest gifts to the test. He tests Tony Stark's gifted mind. Bravo!<br/><br/>Expect a combination of continuous action a gradual yet intense climax and a world of 21st first century CGI at its best. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this in 3D. I will assure you that it will be more enjoyable in 2D at this point of time in technology.<br/><br/>Happy viewing.<br/><br/>TITLE: IRON MAN 3 DIRECTED BY: SHANE BLACK STARRING: ROBERT DOWNEY JR, SIR BEN KINGSLEY, GWENYTH PALTROW, JON FAVREAU, DON CHEADLE & GUY PEARCE RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 130 MINUTES"

I would really like to say that Guy Pierce's character was very convincing. Sir Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was very surprising. Other then that, I would definitely see this movie again.

The jokes aren't funny and they fail in emulate the style of Avengers and Iron Man 1. But the hype is high and the people won't notice the errors in a first sight of the movie like happened with TDKR and even with Avengers. And my question is: how a guy who built the most powerful weapon in the world does not have a defense system more effective in your own home?

"williammcdill","4","148","296","16 May 2013"," Overrated!
","I am a huge fan of the original Iron Man, and was extremely excited about going to see this film! But alas, I was also extremely let down when I did. And while Iron Man 3 was not all the way terrible, mostly due to Robert Downey Jr.'s usual stellar performance, it certainly wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination! <br/><br/>This installment tries to match the humor and heart that made the original such a standout success, but fails miserably with lame jokes (that come way to frequently), and ""touching"" moments that just come off as halfhearted and insincere a midst the never ending barrage of pointless, over the top action scenes (yes, even for the genre).<br/><br/>The antagonist(s) of the film were a major disappointment. Trying not to ruin anything, it seems as though the films creators tried to invent a ""new"" superpower for audiences that are becoming more and more inundated with superhero mythology, and while their goal was a commendable one, their execution was sorely lacking. These ""new"" powers, which served as more eye candy than anything, just make absolutely no rational sense whatsoever(again, yes, even for the genre), and in the end, destroyed the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which keeps us engaged in a story. <br/><br/>But, in my opinion, the ultimate failure of the film was the ""plot"", which comes completely unraveled, and devolves into an utter mess by the end of the film. While I have to begrudgingly admit that I did enjoy one of the more original aspects of the story, which again, I won't go into detail about as to not spoil anything for those still wanting to see it, in the end it just wasn't near enough to save what promised to be such a great film. <br/><br/>The trailer for Iron Man 3 did indeed seem to promise a rise from the ashes which was the franchise's disappointing second installment, but once again it just served as yet another example of a Hollywood that's become more obsessed with marketing than making quality films. And while it's not at all surprising, I for one loath the fact that this, at best, mediocre film made the money that it did, as it will only serve to reaffirm the consensus in Hollywood that things like storytelling don't hold a candle next the sheer visceral experience of huge explosions and corny ""one liners"", especially when they're filmed in 3D!"
"williampsamuel","8","27","46","7 December 2014"," Not as good as the original, but close
","Five years ago, Tony Stark hit the big screen in style. Smart, action packed, and brilliantly acted, Iron Man was the best Marvel Comics movie yet. But the follow up two years later was something of a disappointment. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, and it certainly had its moments, but it simply didn't capture the awesomeness of its predecessor. Now the third installment has remedied most of its flaws, delivering summer entertainment that's fully satisfying, if not quite equal to the first film.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is not the kind of movie to waste much time on set up. From the get go it's clear that all is not well for Tony. He's got his suits and the woman he loves, his company is on stable footing, but there's a shadow looming over him. Because there's a new enemy striking at America from the shadows. A terrorist mastermind who can attack anywhere, anytime leaving no trace but broken bodies and smoldering wreckage. When challenged, he will stretch Tony to his very limits, taking everything that Iron Man can throw at him. And his name is Mandarin.<br/><br/>This is what every fanboy has been waiting for. As great a villain as Obadiah Stane was, the first movie still left one question in the back of my mind; what about the Mandarin? Where is Iron Man's oldest and deadliest foe? This question became more pressing as Tony battled B-list villains like Whiplash and Justin Hammer during the second film. Well now the arch nemesis is here, along with AIM founder Aldrich Killian and a small army of super powered enforcers. And when we finally meet him, he's the absolute last thing you would expect. Purists will no doubt complain about how far the Mandarin has been taken from his source material, but I've got to say that the version they've come up with here is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot line is also excellent by summer blockbuster standards. Though it draws on key points from the recent Extremis, Haunted, and World's Most Wanted story arcs, the story here is completely new and rarely predicable, even to those who are well read in the comics. The villains' scheme is truly masterful, and there are some excellent twists and suitably shocking revelations towards the end.<br/><br/>And of course there's plenty of action, and it rocks. By now we've seen that Tony can take on nearly anything in his armor, which is why the movie does the smart thing and forces him to go without for an extended period of time. With only bits and pieces of his tech to help him, the tension is greater and Tony has to rely more on his wit and skill than massive firepower. Of course there are some awesome action scenes when he is suited up, particularly the mid air rescue sequence. And the best has been saved for last in a massive free-for-all involving Tony, Rhodes, Pepper, and more than a dozen sets of armor against the Mandarin's forces.<br/><br/>This is a very fun movie. Robert Downy junior is as awesome as ever, and he's been given a lot to work with. That's not to say that Iron Man 3 is perfect. I never really bought the whole panic attack thing, and I'm not sure the movie needed a pint sized sidekick, though I admit he did produce some good comic relief. And it just didn't feel quite as slick or as evenly paced as the original. But it comes very close, and it's definitely one of the better movies you'll see this summer."
"etpzachry","9","28","48","4 May 2013"," Exceptionally well done and fun the entire time.
","I'll try to keep this brief because there are a lot of things I can say about the movie. First off, it's not like the comics. That's fine, it's not the comics. It takes ideas and themes from comics and makes it into something new. That's not a problem, it's just something new. If you had a problem with the spider in SpiderMan being genetically altered instead of radioactive, this is not the movie for you. The only complaint I can actually manage to form is that Tony Stark seems to have an issue with anxiety throughout most of the film and then it ends up going away because he begins tinkering around, even though he has been tinkering around the entire film. I'm not sure if it even goes away, because he seems to have no problem when faced with a real threat, only when he is out in public with no imminent danger.<br/><br/>Graphics are amazing as always, I had some issues with the 3D being out of focus sometimes in the corner but I'm assuming it was a projector problem. Story line was easy to follow along with and I personally think well managed. It's very eventful and I can't really recall a moment that was boring. RDJ really does make the movie though and does an amazing job of keeping every scene lively and entertaining."
"brando647","9","17","27","7 December 2013"," One of the Best Marvel Films and a Perfect Start to Phase II
","There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.<br/><br/>The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.<br/><br/>Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.<br/><br/>As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start."

This film is the best movie, by far of the Iron Man series, and of every series of super hero movies. It has the action and sci-fi content, the dramatic content, as well as the humor to almost classify it as a comedy. This movie also proves that Tony Stark does not need the suit to be a successful hero, he can more than handle thing with only his wits and his knack of creating things.

So if you want to laugh, you will love it, but if you are expecting a nice action movie, than you are gonna have a bad time. The action scenes are about 20 minutes in the film, they are pretty good, but only 20 minutes? If there were at least half as many as in the Avengers, i would be really happy. The mandarin, one of the main evils in the comics is just a junkie actor. And the last scenes? Tony blows up his armors and gets his reactor out of his chest, because he has been cured?!? What will Disney put in the next movie (if there will be one)? Unicorns and princesses, musical scenes?

","Or OTT as some like to say/write. And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I'm thankful for that. I was so excited after ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", but unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.<br/><br/>Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I'm glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.<br/><br/>But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn't expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another ""Black-ish"" element that is added to the mix.

"PWNYCNY","6","139","278","11 May 2013"," Mediocrity abounds.
","This movie has lots of special effects and lots of noise and lots of excellent actors, but it forgot to include one thing: a story. Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?"
"temujinmandarin","1","18","29","4 December 2016"," What a JUNК!
","As you can tell by username, I'm a fan of a certain comic book character whom this (terrible) movie have ruined. However, I don't want to make it look as if the only thing that is wrong with this movie is how it mishandles that character - hell no. This movie is bad, no doubt. But the reason why it's bad has nothing to do with the way this movie mishandles that particular character. My main gripe about this movie is the script. The script is awful by all accounts. I understand that not every comic book movie can have a well-written script that is on the level of Nolan's Batman films, but I at least expect something tolerable. This? This is JUNК! A big, stinky, poorly put together JUNК. The characters are inept caricatures with no personalities. The story is basically Incredibles meets Lethal Weapon, but only it's not as fun or entertaining as those movies. It must really suck if you as a screenwriter can't make your own movie and you have to steal ideas from lame cartoon that was made decade ago. But besides terrible screenplay - make no mistake - the movie has the most incompetent direction imaginable. Even with a bad script you can make decent movie if you are capable filmmaker. Unfortunately, whatever credentials Shane Black had in the past, it doesn't matter here. Here, his awful direction is unbearable. The tone is flimsy, the character interaction is lame, the story structure is poorly connected. If you had told me that this movie was directed by a crippled dog with a brain tumor, I would believe you. But, what is also terrible, is that Robert Downey Jr. doesn't care anymore. His acting is mediocre at very best. There is no emotional impact from his acting. It feels very superficial and forced. And now, imagine, that besides all those glaring problems, you also have the twist with the main villain - The Mandarin. The Mandarin twist in this movie is the equivalent to this: imagine if you had big pile of crаp, and then on top of that pile of crаp someone would had poured a bucket of pіss. That's basically the definition of Mandarin's twist in this movie. All in all, if you want a good Iron Man vs. Mandarin story, that is fun, entertaining, smart, and action-packed, go get trade paperbacks of Enter The Mandarin, Dragon Seed Saga, Hands of the Mandarin, Revenge of the Mandarin, and The Future. Those stories are what this movie should've been."

","These nerd purists make me laugh. ""It doesn't follow the comics"" ""It doesn't follow the previous stories"" ""It doesn't...blah blah blah"" These nerds should talk about what this movie Does. The movie is a success in every sense of the word. Huge box office, amazing effects, great, enthralling, clever storytelling-this film has it all! If you like the Iron Man movies, you will love this one because it is simply the best of them. Downey is so fun to watch-he can take any line and make it funny, quirky or touching as the moment merits. Paltrow is also fun-a great match for Tony. The villains are amazing to watch-the CGI fire effects, the constant surprises-all good fun. See it now-the best Marvel movie to date."

","You can judge from my rating (9 out of 10!!) how much I loved this movie. Watched it yesterday and and found it simply awesome. I have seen earlier sequels of Iron Man too and I think this was pretty amazing it not the best and most importantly i found it an advancement over others. The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also liked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for those suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew, technical team, designers and directors are making the movie great. Cast wise everyone played a pretty good role but there were two who stood out - one of course Robert and another Ben. Overall Superb Job and hope we get to see some more action, better movie in Iron Man 4!!"

","I watched this movie with my friend in the theater, and I thought it was fantastic! Iron Man 3 perfectly blends comedy, drama, and action. So what if it doesn't follow the comics? I kind of like it when movies don't go by the book and change things up to make it interesting. Robert Downey Jr. brings back the acting we saw in the first one, in the second one, he was really only playing the douche persona that is Tony Stark. The effects was really good, and I normally don't go for effects. Plus, without giving anything away, all I'm going to say is the way the movie wrapped up was perfect, it was a heck of an experience! <br/><br/>I just ask that you don't listen to any friends who did read the comics, and just go and enjoy this great superhero movie!"
"JamesMitchell451","8","18","29","12 August 2013"," A great beginning to phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Iron Man 3 had a lot to live up to, coming off of, one of if not the, best superhero movies ever. Does it succeed? Yes. Marvel's ""Iron Man 3"" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?(Disney) The script is really good, it contains great dialogue, a good interesting plot, great humor and wit, and a bad ass plot twist (More on that later). Robert Downey Jr. is once again incredible as Tony Stark, and everyone else in the cast does good in their roles as well, especially Ben Kingsley. And the film also contains some bad ass action scenes and great special effects. Now to address fan complaints. First of all: This is a look at Tony Stark's character, a look at in his inner demons. Those of you complaining about him not being in the suit enough: You are damn morons. Like, you really need constant action? And now the big one: The plot twist (Spoiler Alert!!!! Please move on to next paragraph if you don't want the plot twist laid out of you). This is a movie IDIOTS!!!!!!!! Naturally they are going to change crap. Let's be honest here: if they had stuck to the comics, and had a stereotypical Chinese terrorist going ""Ah, Iron Man, ah"" China and the rest of Asia would have been in an uproar. You know why? Cause the character of the Mandarin was based off of Asian stereotypes. And comic books and movies are a completely different medium, you have to expect some stuff to change. And the Mandarin story line in the comics was honestly pretty cliché and predictable. This is THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE, not the comics. You want the comics? Read the comics. There are a few problems though: The true villain is kind of generic, and the pacing of the film is a little bit too fast for my taste. Iron Man 3 is a great summer blockbuster, a great entry into Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that kicks it off with a bang, and a worthy follow up to the Avengers."

","It's a great movie very different than the other two. Honestly I was surprised by the plot by it was a positive surprise. only thing I hate is the end in which they remove that thing out of his heart. that act makes you question: ,, What the hell was he waiting till now?!"" Like if he wanted to do that to protect the only thing he loves Pepper he could done it earlier. But it's only mine opinion so enjoy the movie because take everything bad aside it's still a great movie 10/10 <3 all of the movies with RDJ are great, so no matter how bad or excellent it is it's always all about him <3<3<3 love him love him love him !!!!!<br/><br/>The best part is always the first one, so I get this crazy feeling that every trilogy has lame end. If nothing else I enjoy in his Audi R8 and etc. and awesome suits. It's kinda weird that Pots actually wears the suit, like, OMG I want that too, but one thing brings me down and thats the fact that it's only a fiction LOL !!! I like the 3D version and no matter what they gonna end up with in Avengers 2 everyone likes Tony <3 Stark <3 so me too VERY MUCH,just kidding...or maybe not !... <3..."
"thydarkangel","5","145","292","29 April 2013"," More Iron Than Man.
","Let me start of by saying I am a big fan of Iron Man. The first movie as many of us know was gold, followed by a pleasing but lacking Iron Man 2. There was a lot of hype leading up to this third installment of the Iron Man series and I admit I was caught up in it. Having seen IMDb brand it a score of above eight and several movie critics give it a decent score I figured, naively, that it was almost going to be a sure thing to be a great film.<br/><br/>Sorry to say guys, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was ultimately a disappointing experience. There are a number of reasons, but the main issues included grandiose action, cop outs in the plot, and a distancing from the comic itself.<br/><br/>Shane Black seems to have taken up the 'Baysplosion' (a term relating to the overuse of explosive effects by director Michael Bay) mantle in a very big way. This is a man with an action pedigree including the Lethal Weapon series, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Last Action Hero, and The Last Boyscout to name a few that he has been associated with. He still managed to create a film with too many action scenes that were often excessive. The result was a disconnection between non-action scenes, leaving plot and character development to be drowned out by fight sequences that became tedious and silly to watch. All of this could have been avoided via Shane Black exercising a lot more restraint which, coincidentally, may have given said action scenes greater impact without interrupting the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Another major offender in Iron Man 3 were the convenient escapes. Multiple times we see Tony or loved ones in danger only to have his suit fly in to save them. While I get it is Iron Man and that the suit will at times save the day, the number of times this occurred sucked away a lot of the movies tension. <br/><br/>Finally without putting too fine a point on it as I have no desires to spoil, there were a number of divergences from what was in the comic to how the story played out in the film. It is a Hollywood film and I understand this will happen, but usually they do it for the right reasons. Here what was changed seemed to be a lesser, more confusing version of what was originally an enjoyable, logical journey. Go figure.<br/><br/>Anyhow,its how I felt walking out of the film and still feel days later. I'm not going to go on about what good points there were as this is more a review of grounding some peoples high expectations for this film, in the hopes it may better their film experience. I write this only wishing I'd had something similar to have read before going in."
"discard001","6","153","310","4 May 2013"," ""Unbelievable""... but not in a good way.
","This was a Disney/Marvel collaboration. Perhaps one problem was that it was too much Disney and insufficient Marvel.<br/><br/>The thing I was conscious of at many points throughout the movie, was that in ridiculously violent fights between unarmored and unprotected simple flesh and blood humans... no one gets hurt. In Road Runner cartoons, when the anvil flattens the Coyote, it's quite funny due to its ludicrous overstatement. But the real parts of a movie involving humans -- which are intended to be believable -- really need to remain believable... or it's asking too much from a mature audience.<br/><br/>As a Science Fiction lover, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of immersion into a new idea. I loved the first IronMan, and have watched it many times. So I will gleefully imbue a robotic suit with any levels of strength and power the story may require. That's fine. Bring it on. Thrill me. But I know the limitations of an unaided human body. We all have one. And what I saw far too much of, against human flesh, was a level of coyote-flattening violence that was utter nonsense.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I have no doubt IronMan will break US domestic box office records, as it already has overseas, I think that ""Oblivion"" was the far better movie so far this summer.<br/><br/>/Steve.

"azeeliramli","1","81","157","27 April 2013"," Style but no substance. Worst Iron Man ever.
","The Dark Knight trilogy has set a benchmark for other comic book movies to follow. Not just in terms of action, but also on story-telling. It is proof that you can make things grittier and less campy without sacrificing box office performance. Outside comic book, Skyfall comes to mind. You may lose younger audiences but will more than make it up with the increase of adult viewers searching for quality. I know Iron Man 3 will never be as good as Nolan's Batman, but I clearly don't expect it to be so flatly disappointing as this.<br/><br/>First, the good points.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of action. Spectacular sensory overload. Hardcore Iron Man fans will love this.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is perfectly cast as villain. This guy is underrated.<br/><br/>Funny extra scene between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. It appears at the end of long main credit, not after the 'animation' credit earlier.<br/><br/>Stan 'The Man' Lee does appear in this. Something I look forward to in every Marvel's movies.<br/><br/>Enough. Now the bad points.<br/><br/>The theme is grittier than previous movies, but the twist around two thirds of the movie about Mandarin is very anti-climax. The director spent considerable screen time developing Mandarin's back story and building up the stress and anxiety among the audiences, only to blow it away. Twist works if the audiences being led to think of something, only to be proved wrong later WITHOUT sacrificing the quality of the character (Bruce Willis' Dr Malcolm Crowe in The Sixth Sense).<br/><br/>The story has many plot holes. Many scenes on project Extremis and the soldiers experimented with it left me thinking, yearning for more information. Early in the movie, Pearce's character talks about using the untapped potential of the human brain but the director fails to develop this idea further and connect it to Extremis. How they manage to explode? What gives them the amazing physical prowess? Why they turn orange? Bla bla bla...<br/><br/>I love Iron Patriot and the new colors, but he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>Mark 42 is supposed to be superior than others. But some scenes will show how weak and fragile it is (breaks into pieces when it hit a lorry on a bridge, when hit a container crane at a port, a child snaps Mark 42's finger easily). Perhaps the intention is for some comic relief, but clearly not funny at all. It undermines the grittier feel of this movie overall and the seriousness of a particular scene specifically. I understand that Mark 42 is still in prototype mode and not battle-ready, as mentioned by Jarvis. So why is Tony Stark gambles his life by using it? Better to use older but battle-ready suit. He clearly has plenty to choose from (Iron Legion).<br/><br/>The comic book movies has been getting more divided these days. On one hand, we have Christopher Nolan's quality adaptations like The Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel (hopefully!) which combine style and substance. On the other hand, we have 'others', which offer only style, with the intention of making big bucks easily by shamelessly cashing-in on popular and established franchises. Iron Man 3 belongs in 'others'.<br/><br/>A story has a beginning, middle and an end. Again, kudos to Nolan for ending his Bat-trilogy before it gets irrelevant. Every director must have balls to do this. Better to exit when you are on top. I hope this is the end of Iron Man movies. I don't give a sh*t anymore about Marvel's Phase 2.<br/><br/>Now bring me MAN OF STEEL!!!"
"jeremy-shaw569","9","19","31","31 July 2014"," Iron man 3
","In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1. Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and I'll skim through them quickly. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movies head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly) is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man,and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie has; where are the rest of the guys? Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun bad guy. But this all changes with a plot twist that totally makes you do a face palm. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and is hard to take seriously. There are other plot holes that I'll avoid talking about due to spoilers and length, but there are a few more. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave off that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but still was awesome in his own way.<br/><br/>Now, with that all being said the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, and between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the face palm moment). While the action makes up for possibly the best parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie."
"MovieSonic","10","19","31","10 December 2013"," Excellent comic action film; watch it!
","It took me ages to watch this because of all the conflicting reviews. I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).<br/><br/>Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.<br/><br/>Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.<br/><br/>10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent."

","The movie relates deeply with the previous 3 (including the Avengers) and the psychological state of Tony Stark in the whole movie made sense and gave a fair share of events! Can't really complain of anything, the originality in the development of the plot as an extension of what it followed tops everything else. The humor was there, the love moments were there, the action was there and on top *spoiler* Bruce Banner was there :D Gotta love these two together, glad Marvel is feeling the same way. Really really really excited to see how his return will be played out for Iron Man 4 or The Avengers 2, I have complete faith in there brilliancy with writing. <br/><br/>Good work Marvel."
"allie_joseph176","9","19","31","22 May 2013"," I don't think people get it. Or maybe I missed something.
","Everyone is complaining about the villain in this film and about how it wasn't a real villain and that they didn't follow the comic books and I some what agree. They don't follow the comic books exactly because they everyone would know what would happen. I read the Iron Man comic books and I love what they did with the film. But while everyone is getting mad at the villain I think they are missing the point. I (and maybe it was just me) thought #3 was more about Tony and how he grew from this and his problems. While the villain was apart of the story I just think it wasn't supposed to be all about the villain. This film looked at what was important to Tony his suits or an actual life like with Pepper. There is a lot of action but I think people need to look past that and see that there is a lot more going on then just things blowing up. It was a lot different then the other films because you actually saw Tony on a struggle that wasn't so easy to overcome while also dealing with himself which you didn't see in 1 and 2."

"g-bodyl","9","20","33","21 August 2014"," Here Begins The Post-Avengers!
","Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film to be released since 2012's mega-hit, The Avengers. If this movie is any indication, I think we are off to a very good start. All things considered, this may be the best film in the Iron Man franchise to date. The story arc keeps getting better, especially when Tony Stark takes off with Nolan-esque emotions and of course, with the rather infamous twist that I happened to like. The CGI is the best of the series and that is evident in the action-packed scenes involving all the suits. I guess it's true that better technology means better effects.<br/><br/>Shane Black, known for his extraordinary writing skills, directs the third installment in the Iron Man franchise. Several months after the events of The Avengers, Stark has not been himself as he suffers from post traumatic disorder. But he must get into gear quick as a terrorist organization known as 'The Mandarin"" begins to create havoc in the world.<br/><br/>As always with the Iron Man films, the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on as Tony Stark. Despite his depression at times, he manages to keep the clever wit that we all love. Gwyneth Paltrow has some shining moments as Pepper. Ben Kingsley makes a very fine addition to the cast as the Mandarin, and of course having talents like Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall helps as well. We also might have to keep an eye out on Ty Simpkins, the young boy that Stark grows pretty close to. He may be a star one day.<br/><br/>Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed, character-driven film and it continues the success of above-average superhero films. Scores of people bash on the twist, but I think it was excellent and it added some light-heartiness to the movie. I liked the addition of a voice-over because it seems to have added more feeling to the movie. The CGI is excellent and those flying suits were a great achievement. Now with Iron Man 3 behind us, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment. I rate this movie 9/10."

","IRON MAN 3 is just plain awesomeness. I think Ben Kingsley did such a good job that I think I'm okay with the feel steering away slightly from the comics.<br/><br/>I am excited about Robet Downey Jr coming back in an Avengers film and playing this character. He has done is so skillfully that quite frankly, I am not sure who they are thinking of to do it later. IRON MAN 3 features so many unique amazing costumes that I was just so pleased with the design aspects. a good movie all around. There are a plethora of suits that show up that fans will be pleased who can name them all.<br/><br/>Pepper Potts, is probably the most dynamic character in the film, and I don't want to give anything away, but she challenges Iron Man in a way that reminds me of Superman/WonderWoman dynamics."

","The director of this film called: "" Iron Man 3 "" is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****"
"kunalkhandwala","9","20","33","8 May 2013"," We couldn't have asked for a better sequel...
","Tony Stark suffers from anxiety and insomnia. He spends hours and days developing prototypes because he is insecure, now that he has someone to care about. With that and other references to the New York incident, Ironman 3 follows 'The Avengers' rather than its previous installment. Shane Black's version depicts the vulnerabilities of Tony Stark, his intelligence as a mechanic, his powers as Ironman and his heart as a lover boy. Essentially, Black exposes our hero to a ruthless villain, leaves him without his suit and tech to reboot him and puts him back into his armor, to cause mayhem with explosive action and shocking visual effects. We couldn't have asked for a better sequel.<br/><br/>The Mandarin has exposed himself on American television through videos of his terror acts, causing much concern in the Pentagon. Tony Stark is restless, sleepless and anxious after barely escaping the wormhole in New York. While his love life seems quite balanced, his real focus is on his R&D of prototype armor suits. When his bodyguard, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is critically injured after an attack by the Mandarin, he issues a public challenge to the terrorist and declares his home address..... arrogance is thus topped by overconfidence. The charming Malibu home is destroyed in a brutal attack by armored helicopters but there are no casualties as Pepper is saved by Tony's automated suit while Jarvis flies him out in his unconsciousness to the mapped destination in Tennessee where he was to investigate a prior Mandarin-related explosion. With his armor's power now depleted, Tony seeks help from a local fatherless kid who keeps his secrets but nags him about the New York incident. There is no paternal relationship forming here. In fact, Tony is as unkind and indifferent to him as he could be. Together with the newly painted Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Tony finds the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), only to realize that Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) is the real villain who simply used a theater actor to create a terrorizing figure. His partly successful experiment was the Extremis virus, that could regenerate limbs, provide super strength and generate heat upon desire. The only flaw was that the subject could randomly self-explode. <br/><br/>After the recharging of his suit and himself, the Ironman rescues passengers who are in flight towards Earth, off Air Force One in a heroic 'barrel of monkeys' formation. What follows thereafter is an engaging showdown above an oil tanker (that had its own tale) between Aldrich's self-exploding specimens and Tony Stark's army of quickly summoned Ironmen prototypes. Even though the Ironmen fall as disposable droids, it is their arrival onto the scene of battle, in formation, that draws the bells and whistles. A definite, epic cinematic moment.<br/><br/>While the story might be incongruous at times with other characters walking in and out without much background or conclusion, it strays from driving Tony Stark into self-imposed darkness.Tony Stark, behind the mask, is too proud of himself to become an introvert. As a result, Shane Black's writing and direction is aimed at building up from one action sequence to another.<br/><br/>His writing also reflects Stark's self-referential, witty and pompous attitude which couldn't have been delivered better by any other than Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>The stunning visual effects around some novel, thrilling sequences are the highlight of course. Notably, the explosive attack on Malibu, the Air Force One rescue scene and the climactic mayhem are simply astounding. The background score blends well with the pulsating action while the technology depicted in almost every scene is deliciously futuristic. <br/><br/>What makes Ironman the most loved superhero on the big screen is Robert Downey Jr. The personality he infuses into Tony Stark is uncannily the one you will ridicule for being arrogant but silently, it is the one that you wish you had. The charm, wit and swagger of the rich, resourceful genius is delightful to watch and when all this goes inside the suit, it adds a dimension to a metallic superhero that couldn't be possible without such an actor. Downey Jr. is so awesome at being Ironman that we might mistakenly expect Sherlock Holmes to summon his suit rather than Watson. Gwyneth Paltrow is a great balance to Downey Jr as a beautiful, mature partner who loves the metal face as much as she loves the flawed billionaire. As Pepper Pots, she has more vitality in this film than she did in the past. Don Cheadle spends more time outside his suit this time and he makes us feel sad when none of the prototypes were programmed for him in the midst of the climax. Sir Ben Kingsley depicts a chilling villain when required and a comical actor when he can, with equal finesse and credibility. Guy Pearce brilliantly portrays another fine villain who can confront the likes of Ironman (which isn't easy). His menacing plans and apathy to those around him make him an easy villain-to-hate.<br/><br/>Ironman 3 brings an entertaining jolt to the series and does so in grand style. Along with Downey's knack at being the armored hero, the exemplary visual effects enhance the film's thrilling action sequences. The story is paced well enough to keep the entertainment up and the witty dialogues make things all the more enjoyable. Ironman will become a billionaire at the box-office and Tony Stark is the reason because even if you take his house, his love, his toys and wealth away from him, he is still Ironman.<br/><br/><ul><li>9.003 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","The biggest hit of the summer was Disney's ""Iron Man 3,"" which made $408.6 million domestically and $1.2 billion worldwide. Huffington Post I guess the people who didn't like the movie didn't understand the complexity of the plot. It was twisted and so unpredictable, that's what made it so interesting. I was so relieved to not have to sit through another formula film. In the dollar theater now and your still able to see it in 3-D. It was packed in the theater and it has been out for a long time. I was really pleasantly surprised. Considering I haven't seen the first 2 I thought I might be lost but not at all and the technology was so incredibly fun to watch. The action was not to long and drawn out and it was funny to. Must See!"

","I was looking forward to see what happened to Tony Stark and Iron Man especially after the events of The Avengers, and while I enjoyed it, I felt the whole movie was a bit overlong, but the ending knocked it out of the park!

A fantastic movie that will help lead these Marvel characters into ""Phase 2"" - so bring your family to the theater and enjoy and exciting movie!

","I went to avengers then irony man 3 double bill on the imax and least i got to see one good film. This film felt like a show reel for rdj. There was so much comedy, not enough of marvel comics in a film and my highlight was watching someone drop a full bag of popcorn.<br/><br/>If it was a comedy action film without the marvel label then maybe a higher mark. Also without giving anything away the clip at the credits was also bad and totally irrelavant.<br/><br/>If this is marvel phase two i'm turning to DC least we get a dark storyline related to the comics.<br/><br/>I feel that Disney may have had a say in this too much and maybe this is why we see lethal weapon 5 in superheroes costume."
"scott-sw","9","13","20","26 April 2015"," The Best of the Iron Man
","Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise. Despite the animosity of many fans, they overlook the gems that make this one really outshine the previous installments. Tony Stark must face himself, his fears, his doubts, and his own anxieties. Troubled with PTSD from the New York incident, he reminisces about duping a quiet, brilliant man and turning him into a desperate, psychotic killer. Stark must deal with this in his present state, which is straining his relationship with Pepper Potts. To deal with his problems, he tinkers with his suits, and hides from reality. Reality hits hard when the Mandarin strikes. A terrorist, the madman is responsible for various bombings in the world. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. Rhodes, now the Iron Patriot, seeks the Mandarin while Tony Stark starts on his own trail that leads him to Killian - who has a unique tie to the Mandarin. This leads to a lot of adventure, excitement, and emotions. Many people have griped that this was the same plot as ""The Incredibles,"" but plot devices are often borrowed from other sources. What really makes the plot work, though, is that not everything appears to be what it seems. Another plot strength is we see a more human Tony Stark whose liabilities cause more problems than his strength. He does have to work through the problems of the unintended consequences of previous actions. The one plot weakness was the use of a boy, Harley. Ty Simpkins does play him well, but it seemed unnecessary and a device used to grab kids into the picture. There are a couple of other plot holes and devices that are hackneyed, but the movie still works for a couple of other reasons. One is Robert Downey, Jr. Face it, Tony Stark was the one he was meant to play. He does it well. In this one, he shows some true acting by taking it to another level where Tony Stark has to face himself and reconcile his narcissism and grandiose ego juxtaposed by his PTSD. We also have good performances from Gwenyth Paltrow, Jon Favareau and the villain. Another strength is the direction that takes the plot evenly, and producing a good story with real characters that are not overplayed by the special effects. Iron Man 3 is definitely a good movie, and a rare oddity where the third in a trilogy is the best of the bunch."
"JulianTheIronManMintz","9","13","20","9 February 2015"," Excellent film that doesn't deserve hate
","What's wrong with Iron Man 3? Is it too action oriented, not enough? Is it too melodramatic? Is it the comedy (or lack thereof)? I think the problem may not be the movie itself, but that a good portion us of are comparing it to The Avengers. Well, why not? It's a sequel, isn't it? Shouldn't it be bigger, funnier or more dramatic? Well, yes and no. What we're forgetting is that it's not so much a sequel as follow-up. It is, in fact, a sequel to Iron Man and Iron Man 2 (which IMHO is a good movie even with its many many flaws). I could go on about the well written characters and great performances, how the whole ""Going back to Tony's suit less roots"" is brilliant and adds more depth to the character, how the film is actually non cliché, how it took an introspective look into the mind of Tony Stark, it gave us more of what really makes Iron Man the man inside or just the suit or even a combination of the two, it helped to move along the greater universe, while still managing to have great standalone quality, it has plenty of depth to it itself, fantastic action with great effects, the sense of actual threat with the Mandarin's character to the the point you know you don't wanna mess with him when you hear that name (at least until the plot twist/reveal which I enjoyed simply for the risk it took and the guts it had to go outside the comfort zone of movies, the casting of Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy pierce for well written villains, brilliant mixture of humor that isn't the least bit forced with drama we care about, pepper not falling into the stereotypical love interest formula and kicking serious butt in the end, the witty and fast paced dialog, and overall a sense of good comic book fun that everyone can enjoy. But those first few sentences alone defend this movie and why it doesn't deserve any hate or bashing."

"Bmiceter","9","13","20","6 September 2014"," Marvel At Its Best
","This movie is an example of Marvel at its best, especially for what they have been trying to do with the Iron Man/Tony Stark.<br/><br/>From the beginning, this was a story about the human not the superhero. A man constantly at war with himself, who he is, and who he wants to be. After the events of the Avengers movie, Tony finally breaks. The man who was always calm and in control, finally breaks. This truly peels the man out of his armor, both literally and figuratively. This is the first time that we see Tony Stark as himself and get a look inside his head. It really is fascinating and refreshing to take a deeper look just how fragile a man truly is underneath their facade.<br/><br/>At one of the low points in his life, where he is set off by 6 year olds, and withdrawals from those closest to him, it takes something truly drastic to come out of his funk and become the best person he could be.<br/><br/>The best scene I have seen in any Marvel movie is his talk with Pepper in the garage about the after math of New York.<br/><br/>This is truly Marvel at its best. 9/10"

","I thought the film was really good but the only negative thing I have to say the actor who played the mandarin and the president was really Not good at acting apart from that the acting was brilliant especially the actor who played tony stark. I'd just like to say the mark 42 iron man suit was amazing !!!!! And the person who made the suit for the film has a an amazing, creative mind. PLEASE bring another film out just to make the iron man film come to an end for example making tony stark die. Or a bad guy detonating a nuclear bomb that is going to kill millions of people and tony and the bad guy have to fight to the death and tony has to stop the bomb detonating and ends up killing himself just to stop the bomb"
"Rico_besselaar","5","104","209","23 April 2013"," Over the top, slapstick, holes and a hideous suit!
","Right where to begin, the high tech stuff Tony makes in this movie is righteous over the top but so overdone you can see the plot holes. Like a remote suit that come flying towards you when you make certain moves, it can travel almost a thousands miles without losing a lot of power, while traveling in the suit to a certain point drains out all the power. This was bit weird, next the suit is really ugly. <br/><br/>In Iron man 1 and 2 the comedic relief of Tony was brilliant, and next to the Hulk in the Avengers amazing, but the same as the equipment some of it over the top and it became more a bad comedy then a action pack. In this movie Tony has some issues left over from the avengers, but never really gets in to this. Same as the Extremis virus not much is told about it that it can regrow limbs and makes a big bang. I expected more from the villains, it had a nice touch but the could have made a different approach on the mandarin and thought the war machine explanations about why Rhodey still could keep the suit and all was a bit weak.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie was the ending, and no i don't mean the credits, but the part with Tony talking to Banner. So if you ask me just wait for the DVD/bluray/torrent is available cause it was'nt worth the money."

","Saw the midnight showing of Iron Man 3.....why do they muck around with the already established story lines??!! They really should have kept to the basics of the Mandarin storyline....in a word disappointing! <br/><br/>No Mandarin and the ten rings of power, the Mandarin character in this film is a bit of a joke. Extremis was supposed to be given to stark which enhanced his capabilities...not in this film. Aldrich Killian and the Mandarin were never the same person!! Why fuse the two characters together ? Also Iron Mans armor was too easily broken in this film. How can Iron Man survive a one on one with Thor and survive lightning which can reach 30,000c, yet in the film it disintegrates at 3000c.<br/><br/>Good points, good humor, action is well done.<br/><br/>Its OK to watch but don't expect them to stick to the basics of the Mandarin and Extremis story lines."
"bryank-04844","8","14","22","23 August 2015"," 'Iron Man 3′ is a great addition to the Marvel universe, and might be the best 'Iron Man' film yet.
","Since 'Iron Man 2' proved to be less than stellar back in 2010, this third adventure for the Marvel hero returns with a much-needed boost of attitude and character. 'Iron Man 3′, which can be also considered a sequel to ''The Avengers', takes us through many twists and turns and tons of new Iron Man suits. Director Shane Black tosses away some of the wham-bam action to focus on the quick-witted humor and our hero's internal struggle with crippling panic attacks. I have no doubt that this will be a fan favorite of the franchise and will light up the box office something fierce.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau serves only as producer this time, but appears as his recurring character Happy Hogan. It's known that Favreau turned the opportunity down to direct this new sequel (as well as 'The Avengers') due to creative differences with Marvel. Shane Black is famous for writing the screenplays for 'Lethal Weapon', 'The Monster Squad' and 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'. He made his directorial debut in 2005 with the wonderful modern noir 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', starring Robert Downey. Jr.<br/><br/>As we've seen in his previous scripts, Black has an uncanny talent for writing stories with serious situations and characters, while at the same time being silly and over- the-top. The formula works, and is perfect for a comic book movie like 'Iron Man 3′. Tony Stark continues to belt out cynical remarks and make us laugh, even in the most diabolical situations. This cross between seriousness and sarcasm seems to be a trait of every character, particularly Stark and Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who both show their much different sides in and out of their respective suits.<br/><br/>We start out with Stark narrating a past event from New Years Eve in 1999, where he attended a party in Switzerland with fellow scientist Maya (Rebecca Hall). They run into the odd and clingy Aldrich Killian (an unrecognizable Guy Pearce), who wants to talk with them about something new he has developed. In perfect Stark fashion, he stands Killian up for a one-night stand. We cut to present day at the Stark mansion in Malibu, where Stark has not been sleeping and spends his nights tinkering with his Iron Man gear.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the head lady in charge of Stark Industries. Head of security Happy Hogan (Favreau) follows her around and makes things run almost too smoothly. Stark himself can't be bothered with any of the bad news in the world. He's too preoccupied with his panic attacks and fumbling with new Iron Man related projects. Even mass bombings around the world and the hacking of the world-wide television networks by a bin Laden-type terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) don't seem to phase Tony.<br/><br/>As Pepper is at the office, a now handsome and suave Killian tries to persuade Stark Industries to team up for the old project he tried to get off the ground back in Switzerland. Pepper turns him down for reasons unexplained, but things seem a little off. Then, maybe hitting too close to home these days, a bomb goes off at the famous Hollywood Chinese Theater, killing a bunch of people. Amongst the victims is Happy Hogan. He's survived, but is badly injured.<br/><br/>This sets Stark off, which leads the terrorists to show up at his mansion with a swarm of heavily armed helicopters that literally destroy everything. (It's not a spoiler if it's shown in all the trailers.) Tony regroups in Tennessee without any fancy gadgets or an Iron Man suit. For a good chunk of the film, he has to rely on his brains rather than his machines to fight back. He even has the help of a lonely kid (Ty Simpkins), as they slowly figure out what is causing these bombs and who's really behind this terrorist regime.<br/><br/>This is my favorite Downey performance of any of the 'Iron Man' films. While still the same snide yet funny, charismatic yet somewhat offensive hero, Stark is forced to be the hero he has become without any of his usual money, technology or resources. In one scene, he reminded me of Batman, as he used his intelligence and bravery to scale a mansion and easily take out his foes. Then we have Stark being his brash self, who's not above calling a kid a pussy or threatening to run him over with his car. Downey just owns both Stark and Iron Man. I believe this was the role he was born to play.<br/><br/>Cheadle is also great as Rhodes this second time around. He gives more depth and insight into both sides of his character, Rhodey on the one hand and War Machine on the other. Pearce shines here too. I haven't seen him do such a great job since 'Memento'. Kingsley looks like he had a ball with this role. Every time he appears on screen, I yearned for more. Paltrow has much more screen time in this sequel, and we finally get a glimpse into her relationship with Tony.<br/><br/>It's truly great to see Tony Stark rise to the occasion without the suit and deal with the deep-seated issues that have plagued him since the beginning. The script is witty, funny and smart, with brilliant and memorable performances from everyone. The film has some stellar action scenes on land and in the air that will leave you on the edge of your seat, drenched in sweat and wanting to see more.<br/><br/>In true Marvel fashion, stick around until after the final credits scroll to witness a few more minutes that are quite amusing. 'Iron Man 3′ is a great addition to the Marvel universe, and might be the best 'Iron Man' film yet."
"andrewnmiller","10","14","22","28 April 2015"," Marvel's version of The Dark Knight Rises.
","After watching the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers, I thought that Iron Man 3 would be just more of the same with lots of action and not a lot of story. Man, was I wrong. Not only is this movie the best out of the Iron Man trilogy but it's also one of the best MCU movies period. From it's witting and humor to it's darker story and how it delves into the character of Tony Stark, Iron Man 3 is a truly phenomenal comic book movie.<br/><br/>Following the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark has been suffering from PTSD and has been having nightmares as a result; meanwhile, America is under attack from a terrorist group led by The Mandarin and after Stark makes a threat to the fanatic on national TV, his entire world is destroyed and Tony must use his knowledge and inventiveness to rebuild his life and find those responsible.<br/><br/>Rather then John Favreau directing this time, Shane Black takes over and brings a much darker tone to this film while managing to to juggle all the somber moments and the comical moments with ease while also showing us how we can create demons in our lives, but, we are also able to dig ourselves out of the messes that we create. I've heard a lot of people complaining that this film focuses too much on Stark and not enough on Iron Man, I personally like my superheroes to be more human and have depth to them, not just flying around in suits kicking ass all the time not to mention I loved seeing Tony step out of the suit and be a sincere person. The film does such an excellent job diving into Tony's psyche showing us the effects of the Battle of New York on Stark and how he's having a rough time handling all these new surprises like the presence of aliens and the fact that he's a superhero and is beginning to fear that without his suit, he's unable to protect those he loves from danger and as the movie moves along, he is required to use his brains and intellect to crush his opponents, and eventually, it is he who makes the suit not the other way around, echoing the worlds that Steve Rogers asked Tony in the Avengers that even without the armor, Tony is still Iron Man. I've also heard a lot of people complain about the Mandarin plot twist, personally I loved it and it worked really well because mostly because I went into the movie knowing almost nothing about what would happen so when the twist came at me, I was shocked but not in a negative way. The way the director and the writer had Killian produce a false extremist to frighten the whole country in order to lure interest away from himself but also to aid his own agenda is nothing short of mind-blowing and is easily one of the best plot twists since the I am your father twist from Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>As with the first 2 movies, the cast is sport on: Gwyneth Paltrow is a fine contrast to RDJ as Pepper Potts, not to mention she gets to be in on the action rather than be a clichéd damsel in distress. Don Cheadle doesn't have a lot of screen time in the movie as Col. James Rhodes, but he still does a wonderful job and I loved how Black creates a Lethal Weapon type relationship between Rhodes and Stark. Jon Faverau is also wonderful as Happy Hogan. Guy Pearce is fabulous as Aldrich Killian and while he does come off as a little underwhelming at times, I found his performance quite threatening throughout the film. Even Ben Kingsley did a great job in this film, he is very intimidating when he's The Mandarin, but when it's revealed that he isn't the Afghan terrorist, Ben goes to town and he is clearly having a great time with the role, but it's Robert Downey Jr. who makes these movies worth watching. By now, Robert has become the personification of Tony Stark/Iron Man so much that I can't see any other actor playing this role but him. The persona that he injects into the character is perfect. The charisma, humor and charm that Downey brings to the role is a treat to watch and it adds an element to Iron Man that wouldn't be possible without him in the role.<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning, The musical score by Brian Tyler is truly fantastic by being much more foreboding then the previous Iron Man films, but is also much more musical, plus the main theme is a total joy to listen to. The humor is also wonderful and while a lot of people whined about that too, it makes the film a lot less dark and gloomy and more fun to watch particularly the banter between Stark and Harley Keener, and yet the humor never distracts from the more somber scenes and at the same time, always feels welcomed. While there isn't a lot of action in this movie when compared to the first two, there are some stand-out moments like a bold attack on Air Force 1 in mid-flight which leads to a thrilling action scene where Iron Man has to save several people floating in mid-air and fly them to safety. The other is at the end where we get to see all of Stark's suits in action.<br/><br/>I will say that Iron Man 3 isn't the horrible movie all the nay-sayers have been labeling it as, I really loved this movie and the direction that it took with it's story and it's message. So, ignore the crybaby fanboys and give this movie a watch. It's certainly one of the best comic movies of the last few years."
"Kodymovietalk","8","14","22","20 April 2015"," This is an AMAZING MOVIE!
","Ironman 3 was a cinematic experience. So many people bash this movie because they didn't accurately represent the Mandarin character like in the comics! The hate is absolutely ridiculous! This movie has a great script, witty dialog, breathtaking action, an amazing story and dives deep into the Tony Stark character. Ironman 3 is a very Tony Stark driven movie. It brings back some of the magic from Ironman 1. The movie shows Tony's intellect and how smart he really is. It shows that he's not just a man in the suit, but a great intelligent person. The movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and characters. The twist with the mandarin was brilliant and I didn't see it coming. Many people hate on the movie for this, but I found it very funny and clever. It was a very ballsy move by marvel, but paid off in the end. The movie also does an okay Job of blending dark themes and the humor together. I will admit not all the humor land with you, but works for 90% of the time. In the end had so much fun with iron man 3, it wasn't as good as the first, but was still a worthy sequel"

","Cast: Robert Downey Jr. , Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle<br/><br/>Director: Shane Black<br/><br/>Synopsis: Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as the ""Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist"" industrialist Tony Stark in this third installment of Marvel's Iron Man films, the seventh movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the ""Battle of New York"" in The Avengers(2012), Tony finds himself experiencing the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, while a new villain, the Mandarin (played by Sir Ben Kingsley) terrorizes the entire United States with mysterious explosions. Tony gets pulled into all this as his own life is threatened by the Mandarin, and embarks upon a journey that makes him realize his true priorities.<br/><br/>Review: Marvel Studios brings to us another humour-packed, superhero action movie, this time directed by Shane Black, where the audiences get to experience another adventure of inarguably the most admired hero in the MCU.<br/><br/>The movie is set 6 months after the battle of New York in The Avengers, and Tony has pretty much adapted to the changes that have taken place in his life, or at least he thinks he has. He has been affected by the events of The Avengers much more than he has realized. He has taken to his ""hobby"" of designing and building his Iron Man suits of armour pretty seriously, so much so that his relationship with his love interest Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained by the amount of time he spends in his workshop tinkering with his machines. To add to his troubles, a terrorist who calls himself the Mandarin has scared the entire US by mysterious explosions all across the nation, leaving no traces or clues behind for the intelligence agencies. Tony gets unwillingly pulled into this series of events full of twists and turns as things get ""personal"" between the Mandarin and himself. During his pursuit of the Mandarin, Tony realizes what his heart actually holds dearest and what his priorities are.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr proves yet again why he is regarded as the ""face"" of Marvel's Cinematic Universe franchise. With his witty one-liners, his sarcasm and his fluency with even some of the very technical terminology, it's almost impossible to find any flaws in his portrayal of the egoistic yet likable industrialist-cum-inventor. His timing and dialogue-delivery have been excellent as always.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow plays the beautiful Pepper Potts for the fourth time and she gives us no reason whatsoever to question the choice of the studios in casting her for the role five years ago. From managing the Stark Industries to standing by Tony's side as he struggles with the changes taking place around him and villains that threaten their lives, she is a complete package.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle plays Col. James Rhodes/Iron Patriot (the re-branding of the previously called War Machine), while Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan. Both these actors have done justice to their respective roles by supporting the storyline.<br/><br/>We also see a few new characters like Maya Hansen (Tony's ex-girlfriend) played by Rebecca Hall, Aldrich Killian – a forgotten face from Tony's past played by Guy Pearce, and the new villain - the Mandarin played by the brilliant Sir Ben Kingsley. While they all have been great in their respective roles, we would have liked to see a talented actor like Rebecca Hall as a more significant character in the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline has been a tad different from the earlier Iron Man movies, with lots of twists and turns, and much more emphasis on Tony Stark's out-of-the-armour character. The movie has just a bit too much humour in it which at some points takes the mood of an action movie away, but it is more than made up for by the exciting climax of the movie. A refreshing change was to see Tony team up with the kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), an innovative move by the writers and the director which certainly paid off by keeping the audiences engaged when the movie would have strayed off from its theme uninterestingly.<br/><br/>The background score is one of the best aspects as it remains in your mind hours after you have left the cinema. There are no complaints with the special effects department, which you would expect from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Tony voicing the words ""We create our own demons..."" and the story progresses as not just another superhero adventure, but with the larger theme – how each one of us can fight the demons that reside within ourselves and become what we really want to be.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, a great watch for superhero-movie fans and a treat for the followers of the MCU."

It's almost unbelievable what they're accomplishing in a timely fashion, while retaining quality in their product.<br/><br/>Iron Man 2 did not meet the usual standard, by any stretch of the imagination. If you think about it, the sequel retells the same story as The Great Mouse Detective.<br/><br/>Mind blown?<br/><br/>The third's different.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the fights and action sequences are spectacular. Elaborate cinematic moments are captured through beautiful camera-work and near-perfect CGI.<br/><br/>And boy oh boy the story's gripping. It's packed with tension and emotional.<br/><br/>Here's what works about the fourth installment (counting The Avengers) in Iron Man's narrative arc.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a deceptively small but tight cast.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is easily the weakest part of this film.<br/><br/>I'm kidding of course. He's perfect as always.<br/><br/>Some critical opinion has been directed toward the adoption of voice-over narration so late in the series. While this claim's easily permissible, it's just as easily argued.<br/><br/>I never considered the voice-over out of place, and it's certainly not off-putting. It's a much more personal story with a character whose heroism we've grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>One might even say the narrative's improved by the voice-over.<br/><br/>Stark feels locked up inside his own head. He's a thinking machine without enough waking minutes left in his lifetime to reach full potential.<br/><br/>He is afraid. He literally awakes in midair; the audience and Tony become conscious of it simultaneously.<br/><br/>This scene utilizes a noteworthy camera technique – as if the audience is watching from the interior of the iron faceplate.<br/><br/>And it's all interwoven seamlessly.<br/><br/>One might find these plot points contrived. I would disagree on these grounds: From what other material is the writer supposed to draw? He is bound by restrictions set in pre-existing narratives, and anxiety over these issues is exactly what a Tony Stark in our present reality would be struggling with.<br/><br/>Shane Black deserves a hearty round of applause for not only directing; he's also credited as one of the writers.<br/><br/>Has Don Cheadle ever been less than delightful?<br/><br/>Again I find it hilarious no one noticed Terrence Howard's replacement in the second until way after the third. (For more on this topic, read my review of Prisoners.)<br/><br/>There are the moments where Jon Favreau's character (Happy Hogan) is so funny, you're certain the painful comedic moment's imminent. And of course it never shows up. Favreau's spot-on.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce turns in a transformative performance as Aldrich Killian in two separate timeframes. Even though he's more an unknown, he's as good as the rest.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is excellent. I'm surprised looking at her cinematic history, because she hasn't done much outside this role.<br/><br/>I think Paltrow's really great in this film, and her character's one of the reasons Iron Man 3 goes above and beyond.<br/><br/>Pepper is supposed to be the lovable and dependable love interest. Tony's constantly struggling to physically protect her while maintaining their relationship. As a fan of the comics, that's all I'd expect from her portrayal on the big screen. But there's a scene where Pepper ends up inside the suit and actually protects the unarmored Stark from certain death.<br/><br/>That's great writing and the moment's touching, fun and empowering. It also serves to satisfy the snootier audiences who require such details.<br/><br/>And as a final note, speaking of good writing, Ben Kingsley is an excellent villain.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're a fan of the comic books or superhero movies, Iron Man 3 is a spectacular film for audiences of all sorts."

","IRON MAN THREE came as a pleasant surprise: better than the second installment, it's a perfect blend of comic book super-heroics and Big screen sensibilities. Robert Downey is at his best. The writing helps. So do the fx, which are 100% believable. (Even seeing the ""human chain"" dangling over the Cape Fear River when the movie was being shot here didn't prepare me for the sequence: it's mind-boggling.) This was one of the few times that watching the movie was as much fun as reading the comic books. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back. The scene following the end credits was by far the funniest (and the best) of the ""tag"" scenes. (And Stan Lee's cameo- as a lecherous old man watching a bikini contest- was great.) Hollywood finally got one right..."
"XweAponX","10","14","22","28 September 2013"," Hands of The Mandarin In Extremis
","After watching Joss Whedon's new ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" Pilot, I stuck this in my VLC Playlist and let it roll again. I had seen it a few months back so it was a fresh Experience.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau remained as ""Happy Hogan"" but he gave the directorial reigns to another actor-turned director, Shane Black (Who was ""Hawkins"" in ""Predator""). This was not a mistake, as this film uses everything from the first two and builds on them, so there is no real flavor of change.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is the same Tony Stark left from Iron Man Two and Avengers, and his dialog with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and ""War Machine/The Iron Patriot"" (Don Cheadle) is the same argumentative banter as before.<br/><br/>I was expecting the look of Stark's Malibu Residence to change, but no- It's exactly the same, including Stark's robot ""DUM-E"" (Which sports a Dunce Cap in the beginning of this).<br/><br/>This Story is a marriage of two classic Iron Man themes: ""Hands of the Mandarin"" and ""In Extremis"". The Mandarin and The Ten Rings were some of Iron Man's first enemies. But the character of Tony Stark is much the same as it was ""In Extremis"" - In Iron Man 2, we saw him gulping down ""Green Machine"" drinks, here, he is having full blown panic attacks, which are impairing his functionality. Last time we also got to see the ""Suit in a Briefcase"" and these all came from ""In Extremis"".<br/><br/>But here, all the stops have been pulled out, nothing is held back. I have to admire the sheer difficulty of producing this, it is very hard to pick out CGI, and that's the way it should be.<br/><br/>The greatest thing in here is Pepper, she is less than the Normal Frail ""Damsel in Distress"", she has already taken over running Stark Industries, she was ready to be more than merely Stark's Secretary or Girlfriend.<br/><br/>We have two unrelated crooks: The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the head of the AIM think-tank, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce). Needless to say, they look great. But one of them is misdirection and cover for the other. Which one? And the fact is, we aren't even guessing this duplicity until it's in our face.<br/><br/>Shaun Toub once again shows up as Ho Yinsen, but it's in a scene of 1999 where Happy has long hair. Remember Yinsen told Stark that he had met him after giving a speech while being drunk: This is that event. Rebecca Hall is Maya Hansen, reminding me of Shelley Duvall. She is another variable in this equation.<br/><br/>The Mandarin is taking credit for a number of bombings around the country, no evidence of Bombs can be found at each of the sites. ""When is a Bomb not a Bomb?"" - That's what Stark is in the middle of figuring out, but he gets interrupted and sidetracked to Rose Hill, Tennessee.<br/><br/>Where he meets a Kid, Harley Keener who helps him with a ""Bully"" (James Badge Dale - ""Savin""). He also gets to meet a Flame, Stephanie Szostak (Brandt) who has ""the hots"" for him, but he lets her cool off on a telephone wire.<br/><br/>There are more convolutions in this film there there are in a Brain, well placed and true surprises. It's a rare thing to have that happen in film these days.<br/><br/>More is going on with the character of Stark than the usual explosions, Repulsor blasts, and arguments with Pepper and Happy. His previous behavior had created Demons that he has to contend with here. He has to be Iron Man without the benefit of his Armor. But that's how he became Iron Man in the first place. So he's back to digging himself out of a hole with his mind rather than gadgets, although he has to visit a hardware store and make a few gadgets.<br/><br/>The merging of the two story lines has created an alternate reality from the Comics, where Mandarin was a different character than this. But the use of The Mandarin here, shows influence all the way back to the first Iron Man movie so there is internal consistency in the three efforts.<br/><br/>The trick with these Marvel Movies is creating action shots where iconic imagery from the comics can be used. In all four Spider Man films, these are the poses of Spidey as we web-slings across New York's Skyline. With Thor, it is the Image of him holding out his Hammer in Mid-Flight. Here, it is the image of Iron Man's Crumpled Headpiece on the ground in the middle of a flame, as well as his default pose with fist striking the ground. This movie gives us plenty of those images.<br/><br/>Rebecca Mader excels as another Bad Girl, look for other cameos.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all three movies in this franchise, so far this has been my favorite. Now all we need is a 4th movie where he has to fight Ultimo."
"Meven_Stoffat","9","14","22","4 September 2013"," Marvel's Avengers Phase Two starts in style, as Iron Man's trilogy draws to a satisfying close
","Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, ""things are different now, and I'm a different man"". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.<br/><br/>Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in ""The Avengers"", and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.<br/><br/>For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.<br/><br/>What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.<br/><br/>Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>In short, Iron Man 3 is the worst of the film and it does have some flaws, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It's both a blazingly exciting action epic and a character study that deconstructs Tony Stark's character very cleverly. Even if you find tons of things wrong with the sooty, you'll still enjoy it for the fun it offers."
"neo_701","4","88","175","26 April 2013"," Disappoiting, very disappointing
","Well, many things have been said and told in this review section about Iron Man 3, so let me add my comments as briefly as possible ... Once again, there *will be SPOILERS*!<br/><br/>The Good: - The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here. <br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI. There are some scenes, two especially, which are groundbreaking: the attack on Tony's house and the rescue of the Air Force One passengers. The rest is outstanding as well. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fun. Some of the lines are hilarious, the British jokes (about soccer, Downton Abbey, etc) refreshing. Robert Downey at his best, again.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad: - The plot. The Extremis storyline, the Mandarin, Tony's panic attacks: There is so much stuff to make a good, even a great storyline. And then THIS? I bet everyone who reads this, have seen dozens of movies similar to the showdown and to the revealing of the baddie's masterplan. Come on, after ""Avengers"", we expect more, we expect better! <br/><br/><ul><li>The villains. Guy Pearce is OK, but only OK. Viewers were waiting for a brilliant, scaring guy and get someone who is ... OK. And the Mandarin??? No. F***ing. Way. No. Just NO! Nuff said.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Ugly: - This is no Comic Movie. Why? Because the director is no comic freak, you can see it and feel it in each and every scene. There are more than two hours of film and Tony is in his suit for how long altogether? 10 minutes? I know this movie want to focus on Tony Stark, not his alter ego. But so did the first part and it was a comic movie in the sense of the word. This one is a comedy perhaps with good action sequences, no more and no less. Shane Black may be a good director, but he doesn't know what to make out of comic book stuff. Some examples: The Iron Patriot is wasted as is the whole character of Rhodey. The permanent changing of Iron Man armors for Tony is lame. As is the mind(?) controlled Mack 42, because it gets boring to see it flying around after the third time. And then, there is the Mandarin. Who at Marvel could approve to this ""twist"", for crying out loud??? Which comic fan can possible like it??? I was looking SO forward to an epic showdown between Iron Man and his nemesis - and then came THIS?<br/><br/>OK, that's where I have to stop. By the way, the 3D doesn't contribute to the action scenes. My advice: save some bucks and watch the 2D version. Or even better: Don't watch it if you're a comic fan. Not even on Blu-ray."
"niteshmoundekar-795-767788","1","87","173","27 April 2013"," Why use Mandarin name just to get publicity
","Ironman 3 is about Tony Stark, no doubt about it. It tires to go deep into character. The problem starts with the villain. First they show Ben Kingsley as Mandarin and then they ridicule the comic book villain. They should know Mandarin acquired 10 rings from crashed alien space ship. He could have been portrait as per his known comic character and not some low life druggist.<br/><br/>From all of the Ironman series, this is the most pathetic. Fooling the audience is not the art of film-making. There has to be story behind. <br/><br/>Lots of decision of Tony Stark is seen as whim. First he destroys all of his Ironman suits and robots and in the end he say he will be Ironman. What is the point of making Pepper Potter as one of the genetically modified fire character, just to be cured after 5sec. <br/><br/>There was reason behind not removing shrapnel from Tony's heart. This was the main reason why he became Ironman. That was the origin. If he could have been operated upon then why Ironman1, Ironman2, Ironman3, etc.<br/><br/>Lots of flaws and just tone of visual and cranking noise and exploding humans. What is this? Its Ironman 3"
"arkayen666123-457-256414","3","92","184","7 May 2013"," Horribly disappointing
","I went into this movie with high expectations, but after seeing this movie, I've come to realize a simple fact; Now that The Avengers has been made, the story of Iron Man can't really be done anymore. We've already seen him taking on hoards of alien invaders along side a god, a genetically enhanced super-soldier, and a monster that can throw tanks. Putting him against a human opponent isn't going to be exciting anymore.<br/><br/>The movie suffered from a lot of flaws. It's easy to assume that certain creative licenses they took with certain characters will be the one thing most people remember about this movie. There are plot points throughout that are brought in and then tossed out. A plot line involving someone's serious coping problems is absolutely cast aside around the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>The villain himself is also very weak. It's impossible to talk about the villains though without spoiling the movie. If I were to try to at least creatively put it, I would say that the villain(s) of this movie kind of end up feeling a little bit like a Scooby-Doo type of situation. That's all that needs to be said about that.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say this movie isn't worth seeing at full price. Matinée, and if you really feel the need to see it in 3-D, no it's not really all that good in this movie. It's got some depth in a lot of scenes, but most of this movie takes place in dark or closed in spaces so there's not a whole lot to do with it.<br/><br/>By far the worst movie in the trilogy. Might be the beginning of a terrible post-Avengers trend in the other Marvel movies."
"johnmuir76","6","132","271","5 May 2013"," Downey Jr. always good, plot not so much
","I would say this is the weakest of the 3 Iron Man movies. Downey Jr. is good as always, but the plot is a hot mess. The movie could have developed a bad-ass villain to rival Iron Man 2's Whiplash, but perhaps decided it couldn't pull it off and left us with Iron Man fighting some real lame-o's. There's a lot of plot holes and internal logical problems in the story. The special effects, as always are good, but I felt disappointed by the end. The supporting characters were fine (Ben Kingsley does well with what he has to work with), but unfortunately its the same damn plot in every action movie this summer about the President or VP being in danger, which makes you feel like they're not even trying."
"dinuks","1","102","206","26 April 2013"," A Disappointment - Wait for the DVD
","Shane Black has done to Iron Man what Bret Ratner did to X-Men. <br/><br/>I went to the cinema looking forward to see Ben Kingsley play a ruthless Mandarin. Instead, it all turns out to be a joke, and the Mandarin, Iron-man's arch-nemesis turns out to non-existent. So much for all the hype in the trailers. The writers probably thought they were smart in putting such a drastic plot-twist, but instead I left the cinema feeling deceived and disappointed. As someone already mentioned, they should just have just stuck to the established storyline.<br/><br/>If that wasn't enough, there were a host of other things wrong with this movie. The one-liners got painfully annoying. Loud explosions are expected to compensate for half-thought out action scenes. <br/><br/>The plot was half-baked at best with a lot of holes. First AIM is selling Extremis to the Mandarin, then it turns out he wants to create supply and demand to sell it to the government, and next he's killing the president and ""moving on"". As many others have mentioned, then Iron Man who was able to withstand Thor and his lightening melts in 3000c heat. Warmachine gets disabled because a woman touched his hand. The iron suit, which is supposed to be powered by the arc reactor, a limitless power supply, needs to be charged like your iPhone.<br/><br/>The only part I liked about the movie was the slideshow at the credits."
"vikingfan-126-976360","3","113","230","12 June 2013"," So so disappointing
","I can't believe I'm actually giving this movie a 4. After seeing the first trailer a few months ago I was stoked. It looked great and this movie has the best villain in the Iron Man universe and Ben Kingsley playing him. What could go wrong? Well, a lot did. The director Shane Black is not who I would have chosen. He just seemed like an odd choice. The music from the beginning of the movie didn't work, the flashback at the beginning seemed odd. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, they brought in witty one line humor one by one that made it feel more like a cheap action comedy than an Iron Man film. The PTSD problems were annoying. I'm still wondering why Rebecca Hall and Don Cheadle were in the movie. Their parts were pointless. Other parts like the suit needing to be recharged for days before being able to be used again, the truck destroying his suit, and the ""cripple fire people"" rendering the suit unusable with a single touch were just laughable.<br/><br/>The worst parts though were the twist with the Mandarin. Like I said, he is the best villain of Iron Man and they had an Oscar winner playing him. Why didn't Black leave him alone, give him his 10 rings of magical power and let Kingsley show us his acting magic? <br/><br/>Nobody ever explained to us about the crippled fire people, and even if they had I probably would have missed it being as outraged as I was. And then the end of the movie. Iron Man was barely in his suit as it was and then we get to see more of the dumb robots instead of what we paid to see.....THE ONE AND ONLY TONY STARK AS IRON MAN! <br/><br/>Then, the part where Pepper is in danger and Tony is telling Jarvis he needs a suit. There are a bunch of suits flying around and the boss of them all needs one and none come and pepper falls. 2 things could have possible happened. 1- Jarvis gets Tony a suit and he rescues Pepper or 2- one of the robots rescues Pepper, but no, 3 happened and Pepper fell just out of Tony's grasp making me shake my head. <br/><br/>Then the worst scene of the movie when Pepper turns into a super hero and does this cool ninja jump to destroy the suit trying to kill her and then magically uses the iron man suit to kill Killian. This was an Iron Man movie. Pepper saving the day had to be the most dumb idea ever.<br/><br/>The last 5 minutes made me hate the movie more. Tony has surgery to remove the shrapnel. If this was an option, why didn't it happen in the first film? Why did this even happen at all!? And then pepper has the magical surgery that got rid of her super powers. How? I do not know. And Tony destroys all his suits and gives all his toys to the boy. <br/><br/>Only good parts of the movie were saving the passengers from the plane (again though, Tony Stark was using a robot) and the credits at the end were pretty cool with the scenes from past films.<br/><br/>This may feel like a lot of rambling but I'm not happy still, 3 weeks later."

Or we should rather called it a movie about Tony stark, the new McGyver?<br/><br/>Countless Plot holes and illogical nonsense then starting to emerges, from the uselessness of Yinsen, to the 'what the hell is the usage of mark 42?!' seriously, in the avengers tony uses the mark 6 and 7 armor against chtauri (a very powerful race of alien) and Thor (God of thunder) and it didn't even brake. But in this movie, a little scratch from the 'heat guys', and it goes kaboom! WTH!? all the armor in this movie is supposed to be stronger than Mk 7. Oooh, and it goes on... How in the hell could they just hack and control War Machine armor that easily? why does Rhody wore a green polo shirt for work? Why does Maya, a scientist that spends so many years in a dedicated work, become so undecisive after just one or two sentences from tony stark? Why didn't tony removes the chest reactor in the prequel movies if its that easy? WTH is happened to pepper?<br/><br/>And as if that isn't enough... They broke The Mandarin, Iron Man arch nemesis.. and AIM too I swear to God.. if I could cry, I'll cry..<br/><br/>As for the jokes, it was funny, at first Then, you'll get sick from the overdose<br/><br/>Well, overall I give it a 5 out of 10 stars for the actors, actions, and special effect (although it was not that spectacular)<br/><br/>Maybe we should ask, is this movie really suitable to be exist as one of the story in the marvel universe?"

"khanbaliq2","8","15","24","30 May 2014"," An electrifying but provocative comic-book film.
","Iron Man 3 is another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's somewhat different from the two Iron Man films before because Shane Black replaced Jon Favreau as director. Favreau's influence on the film is evident, and he appears in his role as Happy Hogan, now Stark Industries head of security. Iron Man 3 offers just as much popcorn entertainment as Favreau's efforts. It's a more interesting film than Iron Man 2 (2010) because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has to rely on his smarts and innovation instead of his firepower as he faces forces beyond his control. Iron Man 2 is a solid, enjoyable sequel but it was a bit of a letdown after Iron Man (2008). In Iron Man 3 the screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce takes unexpected turns for a superhero movie. Purists may be upset by the changes from the comic books, but the surprises are actually neat. The big reason why this works is because the new actors, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, James Badge Dale, Ty Simpkins and Stephanie Szostak, deliver memorable performances. Downey, Jr. is as good as ever, and he handles the humor just as well as in the terrific crime-comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). But Shane Black didn't bring only his clever comedy to Iron Man 3. He maintained the series' playful tone without neglecting Stark's struggle. He also delivered spectacular action set pieces in which Iron Man gets to put his abilities to good use, like in the dizzying action sequence involving Air Force One. Iron Man 3 is definitely the funniest Marvel film yet, but the drama involving Extremis is no less effective. The visual effects for the film were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. Thanks to the excellent CGI we get to see the good-looking suits that Tony Stark has been working on. After the events of The Avengers (2012) he didn't spend all his time brooding because of his posttraumatic stress disorder. Brian Tyler contributed a good, bombastic music score for Iron Man 3. It features a memorable theme, and works well with the drama of the film too. I've seen all the Marvel films in a theater and, just like all of them, Iron Man 3 wasn't a letdown. The action, the comedy, the drama, the acting, and simply the intelligence of these films always make them enjoyable. Producer Kevin Feige was influenced by RoboCop (1987), something that makes it clear what his formula is. I definitely recommend Iron Man 3. It's a strong finish to a good trilogy."
"trevor-mcinsley","10","15","24","31 January 2014"," Excellent. Ignore the Comic Nerds.
","I enjoyed the first Iron Man film and the Avengers. The second one was alright. This one is just excellent.<br/><br/>A lot of the negativity here seems to stem from the fact that the 'Mandarin' is meant to be some kind of evil wizard in the comics and he is not in this. That sounds completely ludicrous. If that genuinely is the plot of the comic books then it only reinforces the reasons I have never got into them. The portrayal of his character in this film is genuinely clever and touches on some proper world issues. If he had 'magic rings' it would have been a total joke and if it stuck to what he apparently is in the comic books then this film would be quite dreadful as a result.<br/><br/>Another complaint appears to be related to the film focusing more on Tony Stark than Iron Man. Personally this is the reason I found the film so good. Superheroes are kind of silly and I never had any interest in the subject until the modern films which bring them down to Earth a bit. You only have to watch an old Batman film where they are just running about in brightly coloured spandex and compare it to the more modern ones to see this much.<br/><br/>In this film Tony Stark feels like a genuine person. He overcomes weakness before he can triumph as Iron Man and it is ultimately his creations which save the day and not him. In this way it feels like the story has grown up and come full circle. I actually found it surprisingly poignant at times whilst still being a clever and enthralling story.<br/><br/>If this were just two hours of Iron Man flying about the place shooting at stuff as so many people seem to have wanted judging by the reviews then it would be pretty boring. This is sort of one of the issues that the second film had. You knew he would win out and he essentially had an arsenal of super weapons to hand so there was no question as to how that would play out. This film has him facing genuine adversity.<br/><br/>I cannot find fault with this film. People are ticking off a huge list of issues with writing, acting and even the music. In reality they are just hurt because it is not true to their precious comic books. I can understand that to a degree. I hate the Hitchhikers Guide film because it simply does not live up to the books or radio series. However when your complaint is that the super villain isn't some kind of genie I think you have to reassess your stance. If the Mandarin was the same as in the comic books then this film would have been dreadful. Seriously dreadful. I mean properly ridiculous.<br/><br/>As it stands I would say this is the best film of the trilogy and easily on a par with the Avengers."

","Iron Man 'Three'. I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the ""twist"", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it's the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we're living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it's media manipulation. It doesn't over-do it; and the actor's revelation is just splendid. I can see why it'd p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.<br/><br/>This would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end. What is an otherwise highly entertaining and smashingly-though-darkly absurd climactic battle on a bunch of naval ships, which is that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) decides to blow up his remaining suits. It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it's *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it's not a question of if but how much).<br/><br/>And yet, aside from this, it's a fun summer movie that takes some real chances – Ben Kingsley, nuff said – and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian, doesn't stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we'll get to in a moment)."
"BA_Harrison","9","18","30","11 January 2015"," Comic-book cinema how it should be: fun!
","So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.<br/><br/>Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn, means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.<br/><br/>I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they are as enjoyable as this one.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."

","I feel sorry for all those people in other industries (e.g. video games, toys, comics ...etc) who spent millions betting on some sort of continuity, this film ruined all the character / universe building that the last 3 films (inc. Avengers) tried so hard to establish...Nice one Shane....<br/><br/>For some odd reason the ironman suits have been dumbed down, before they were capable of withstanding direct tank shell hits, being hit by a god's hammer and even being sucked into an engine designed to lift an aircraft carrier but now they explode into pieces when hit by a bus or kung- fu chopped out of the sky ( I know Extremis can make hands burn up to 3000 degrees but surely they wouldn't melt suits as easily like that, in the second film the armour gets tangled in an 'arc reactor' electro whip which probably generated temperatures as hot as the sun and they were still able to hold their own ~ an example of broken continuity).<br/><br/>Tony Stark is now embarrassingly thick. Initially I liked the character development at the start, he's got some sort of post traumatic stress syndrome and he is regretting his flamboyant chauvinistic lifestyle which has intentionally put Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan in the line of fire, he even says to Pepper, in an emotional scene, that she is the most important person in his life..so when the 'techno-corporation- terrorists' come to attack his Malibu House ~ which you would expect to be slightly more heavily defended, in light of him having secret technology that everyone wants! he dances around in a prototype suit knowing too well that he could activate all his other suits via Jarvis and overwhelm 3 attack helicopters. Even when the attack was over, why couldn't he get into a working suit and/or assign a suit to look after Pepper AND/OR ask Bruce (aka. THE HULK) (who appears in the end credits and who he is chummy with) to help out on this quest. --Sigh--<br/><br/>In light of the logic explained above, the rest of the film doesn't make sense. At any time he could have called in another suit, or asked any of his Avengers friends ( we are constantly reminded about the success of the Avengers in this film) to help out. <br/><br/>The ending is truly terrible. The bad guy (Killian) gives his hostage (Pepper -obviously) super powers --why--(lol!) who, Lo and behold, saves the day! It is also revealed that Tony has all these awesome suits under his command, why he made them is never explained! ~which is a shame as Disney could have released a new toy for each suit (..but why would kids want a toy which features for 2 seconds and then blows up?). Worst of all Tony then proceeds to self-destruct all the ironman suits and throws his arc reactor carelessly into the sea ~ completely undermining the whole 'keeping my technology secret' theme from the other 3 films. <br/><br/>I guess they could salvage Ironman by taking the Dallas approach, Tony wakes up relived that the events of this film was just a horrible nightmare."

","After being totally thrilled by The Avengers, I didn't expect exactly the same amount of greatness in ""Iron Man 3"", yet I still needed a solid story to keep me interested. There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.<br/><br/>The plot consists of a terrorist called the Mandarin threatening America's safety and teaching its president and people a lesson. After his friend Happy Hogan is put into a coma thanks to one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony vows to strike back. But after an attack from his enemy leaves him homeless and weaponless, Tony must find a way to stop his foe's plans while reevaluating his troubled existence. Downey Jr. hits the ball park once again with his Stark character showing his usual playful charm, but also his vulnerability at times. The events that took place in The Avengers take a heavy toll on the character and RDJ plays it quite professionally. Other characters were sort of a bore to me with Pearce's Killian as an exception. The plot once again fails to make sense, making it more comparable with the second rather than the first. Overall the film entertains and the visuals combined with the leading man's appeal make for an enjoyable time, however when it comes to the story it doesn't come close to Marvel movies like the first Iron Man and The Avengers.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"

","Minor Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Rarely do I pinch myself in the middle of viewing a movie to find out if I am dreaming or not. More like a nightmare, this movie was a forced cash grab with no true intent to continue the Phase 2 marvel universe. I am not sure what the purpose of this film is. RDJ feels like an auto-pilot version of himself jumping from suit-to-suit in an endless dizzying display of CGI. Pepper Potts is in this one too, I loved her in the others but you can convince me that someone like Pepper can go through all that and not have some PTSD herself?? Oh, on that issue, how does Tony go through 3 previous movies total...and only experience anxiety on his last adventure. Don Cheadle was very good. Although I felt that War Machine (Iron Patriot) was a little underwhelming. And now, for the big one, the supposed Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. THE WORST AND MOST HORRIFYING TWIST A PERSON COULD EVER THINK OF!!! What would of happened if they did that to the Joker in Dark Knight or Loki in Avengers or Bane in Rises. The same thing I guess, a titanic outcry in the community of comic book lovers who rely on movies like these to convince the masses who don't have time to read the comics that there is something to love in this universe. The non comic book fans who actually like this movie now think the Mandarin (an insanely awesome COMIC character) is now a joke. A really really bad joke. Its bad. Real bad. And don't get me started on Guy Peirce. I cant stomach writing this review for much longer. Just don't see it in theaters. Red Box it. Netflix it. or even better Don't See It."

","Overall, it was pretty terrible. They tried being too funny, the new suit was stupid, War Machine didn't do anything except kick doors down, and Tony Stark barely fought as Iron man. <br/><br/>Most sequels are made to be better than the movie before it, but this one almost went a step backwards in comparison to the second film. Less action, villain was stupid with the whole paid actor bit. They keep trying to find more creative ways for the suit to be put on, but I thought they should have just left it like they put it on in the first Iron Man. My vote for biggest disappointment of the summer thus far. Especially after Marvel put out a great movie like the Avengers, I can't believe the first follow up to that was this poorly written and lack of action movie."

Mandarin I saw on the trailers but that was just a decoy, not only for the film, but for us too, for he is not the real villain in the movie! The real villain is this stupid guy that invented this injection turning you into some kind of zombie-t1000 type of human being!!!<br/><br/>This movie doesn't really need a detailed review so I'll be brief.<br/><br/>Pros: The cgi, the airplane sequence where Iron Man saves a bunch of people and how he achieves that(because THAT'S what heroes do)<br/><br/>Cons: the stupid ""zombie"" plot, everybody's acting except Ben Kingsley's, the fact that the Mandarin was not the villain but just an actor, the flashback setting the beginning of this stupid story back in 1999, Pepper Pots being too involved in the film, Tony Stark being too involved with Pepper Pots (reminded me of the Maguire-Dunst failure in the 3rd Spiderman), Tony Stark and the little kid, some mediocre jokes, Tony Stark having anxiety panics (I didn't like Robert Downey's acting there either), Iron Patriot, Tony Stark's new way of wearing the suit (it looked cool in the trailer, but it really wasn't, plus it didn't make sense that he could summon the suit from 3000 miles away!!!!), Stark's new way of controlling the suits without wearing them (this really spoils the whole idea of Iron Man, although generally a smart thought)<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the first 2 Iron Man movies (and of course the Avengers) you might want to skip watching this one at the cinema and save your money. Rent it once it's out on DVD. Let's see how the new Avengers film rescues Iron Man from the mud Iron Man 3 has let him sink"
"biancasteinbock29","6","69","137","25 April 2013"," Confusing and poorly explained plot
","I am a massive Iron Man fan, always have been. I was so excited for this movie and the trailer looked amazing. And the trailer was one of the problems.<br/><br/>The trailer portrays the movie one way, which is unfortunately nothing like the movie. The movie revolves around Tony Stark, and NOT Iron Man, which i was i was expecting to see. He's barely ever in the suit, and even when he is, you're not sure if he really is because of his new technology. The new technology seems over the top and poorly explained. <br/><br/>I don't really know much about the comic book series which left a few gaps in the story. Details were left out, especially regarding the virus. <br/><br/>But the ending was by far my least favourite part of the whole movie. He's no longer Iron Man? How is that even going to work? What is going to happen in Avengers 2? And even if i can get over that stupid ending, if he had the ability to fix himself, why didn't he do it in the first movie? Or when he was almost dying in the second movie and have to make his own element? It makes no sense. He was always a genius and it seems he always had the ability to do that, so why didn't he earlier? Just because of Pepper? <br/><br/>Overall, I didn't hate the movie, but it was nothing like I expected or hoped and was a severe let down after how well The Avengers was done. An average end to the trilogy, definitely my least favourite, but still worth seeing if you're an Iron Man fan."

Iron man 3 presents the audience with one of the worst story lines for a villain that i know off, No background information a pointless twist (spoiler) The all powerful presence of the Manderine in the trailers is reduce to a stage actor hired by a group of so called terrorists in order to hide there true identity, along with this the villains themselves have to be even more far fetched that iron man himself.<br/><br/>The Film as moved from a Plot orientated film to that more concerned with making the audience laugh and gaze into the high octane action sequences, which don't get me wrong are incredible but seem to lack a certain relevance seeing as the film is meant to bring Tony Stark back to basics as in the creation of Iron Man in the first installment. The plot is weak at best.<br/><br/>I've never noticed the difference in a film due to a director change as much as this, Jon Favreau's leading absence can be felt throughout the quick witted and fell placed humor is missing and replaced with endless cheap gags and the clever plot evolution present in IM1 and IM2 is not existent.<br/><br/>So all in all if your looking for a quick watch everything blow up and laugh about it film this is for you, but if your looking for the iron man you've come to know from 1 and 2 you best hope he finds himself in time the second installment of the Avengers."

I had high hope after The Avengers and wanted to see what Marvel had to offer and it did not live up to the hype. The film might as well have been called Tony Starke because he is rarely in the suit. The whole thing with the kid was ridiculous, i do not know what Shane Black was thinking when he made this film. It was worst than Iron Man 2 and i thought that film was bad. Robert Downey Jr as always puts in a great performance as Tony Starke its just a shame the same cant be said for the rest of the cast. Don Cheadle who i like was ruined by the director in this movie jumping out the suit in a polo,jeans and trainers was quite ridiculous and also the scene at the end with the president was just so unrealistic. Paltrow resumes her role well except the ending which i felt there was no need for. Pearce puts in a great performance as always but like i have said before the director ruins it.<br/><br/>The whole Mandarin thing was terrible after aliens turn up in Avengers surely they could do the real Mandarin from the comics as he is Iron Man's arch enemy. Don't bother watching the post credit scene nothing special is shown.<br/><br/>Overall great acting all round,some laughs but i felt the movie needed more action and more Tony Starke in the suit. In my opinion the director Shane Black has put a damp mark on the Iron Man franchise for me.Worst Marvel production film to date and can only hope Thor can save my hopes in Marvels phase 2 plans."

","Nothing says cool better than ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist""! After the huge success of the Avengers and the high quality of this film, there's not a hero more at the top of his game than Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man.<br/><br/>By now everyone knows that Tony Stark's powers all come from his suit of armor. That along with his money, genius and unmatched wit are what make him larger than life. Tony's intellect is the key to his super powers and the brilliant foundation for this third movie. Hot on the heels of The Avengers, this was the perfect time to focus on Tony Stark the hero and the man. Seeing Tony interact with Thor, Bruce Banner and Captain America was indeed awesome but this back to the basics and return to Tony's world is just what we needed to see at this juncture. They perfectly remind the audience that his intellect that is really his super power. The amazing armor advancements we see in this film all stem from that fact. Yes, over three other wonderful films we've seen Tony exhibit an unfathomable understanding of technology but nothing like what's on display in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, there's a great deal of technology and action but it's wonderfully balanced by character and drama. Tony's command of sarcasm and his genuine wit have never been used better than it has been in this movie. RDJ charms the camera in every scene but what really brings out Tony's charm and gives the hero's story that extra interest is the character of Pepper Potts. Their relationship certainly has grown over three movies and in Iron Man 3, Pepper becomes even more important. It's one of the many reasons why this film lands above every other third film in a franchise that I've ever seen. Tony's love for Pepper and his obsession with technology and protecting her with that technology is moving and quite deep. It certainly is unique for a summer blockbuster to deliver those kinds of layers.<br/><br/>The stakes are very high as everyone from Pepper to Happy Hogan to the President of the United States is in danger from what will be considered the best bad guy to hit the screen in a long time. The Mandarin is amazing. He's not a jump off the screen kick your butt type of cheesy villain at all. He's crafty, diabolical and truly menacing. Speaking of layers, the ending of the movie will amaze for its plot as much as for its intensity and that's all I'm going to say about that subject. Also, Pepper is not a ""damsel in distress"" by any means in this film. This is where Iron Man lands above most other characters (Spider-Man for one). Pepper's roll and how she deals with the danger and what she becomes over the course of the film will surprise but please a lot of people.<br/><br/>Every side relationship works here, even the new characters that are introduced. The kid from Tennessee that interacts with Tony will get a LOT of buzz but I was just as impressed with the Rhodey stuff. That relationship is SO much better here than in Iron Man 2. Unlike Iron Man 2, there are incredible new characters that actually mean something to this plot and not to the next film down the line. There's a real focus on Tony's mind, body and spirit and the importance of protecting the most important relationships in life. It offers great balance to go along with great fun. This is NOT a dark brooding film at all which is great. It has many tones and does give us the humor and fun to go with a more complex take on the character. They just nailed it here.<br/><br/>In terms of where they go with future movies, who cares at this point? Sure everyone will want more after seeing this movie but that's Avengers 2 problem and something to dream about later. Right now, enjoy this thrill ride because I know I sure did."

Tony Stark fighting bad guys in his hi-tech suit, right? Well IM3 has very, very little of that and plenty of super hero 'down-time', as can be expected in such genre pieces where the screenplay doesn't know how to deal with the fact that the central character can't be in hero mode throughout.<br/><br/>From having recently dealt with an alien invasion in 'The Avengers', Tony Stark is in comparatively dreadful form as an Iron Man whose gadgets repeatedly malfunction, and are more like aluminum foil than iron, based on how easily some of the bad guys manage to damage and destroy them.<br/><br/>IM3 is reasonably entertaining though, with some very enjoyable and witty lines delivered from time to time but unfortunately that's about its best feature.

"Ziya90","1","42","82","13 May 2013"," The inappropriate tone and motivation for a comic book movie make it the worst
","Unfortunately, Iron Man is the worst installment of the trilogy by far because it works more like a parody of Iron Man. I had expected something different, brilliant, genius etc. from Shane Black, ""a breath of fresh air"" but instead the movie was like an unlikeable parody as said with lots of further disappointing material! Despite I didn't find the first Iron Man film perfect, masterpiece etc. at least it was cool and solid. Yes, if I have to define the first Iron Man film with two words, that would be cool and solid! The second film was found mostly disappointing including me, because the main problem of the second movie was there was no ""spark"" in the movie (no pun indeed), it was lack of spark, suspense and excitement and it was more like a comedy drama than an action packed film. However, this is much worse. Most of the film consists of comedy, a little drama and Tony Stark without his Iron Man suit! In the first half, there is almost one big action sequence and that is the best sequence of the whole movie! The sudden attack part. Then, in the second half, there are a few action scenes more, but all of those are boring or unappealing. The main villain of the movie is like a joke, a result of a work of terrible writing, it wasn't genius, it was ridiculous. Probably the producers including Shane Black wanted the movie to be like The Dark Knight Rises. More realism less fantasy. More drama less action, but Iron Man 3 fails, because it doesn't work in this universe. There are more villains in the movie and mostly they looked ridiculous that somehow reminded me Superman 3. There is one more important villain in the movie and that is dated and cliché. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think that if there are many villains in this movie, then the movie is going to be an action feast. No! Also, if you expect a bad-ass villain, I am sorry. In this movie, Tony Stark develops a new technology related to his armor and there are some twists about that. What a terrible, uninspiring idea! There are some moments that kill the spirit or the philosophy of Iron Man, there are some far fetched or exaggerating moments near the end related to Pepper Potts etc. etc. As for Mandarin, Kingsley's performance was amazing, what an actor! As for Jon Favreau, I think he is better as a director than ""funny moments"" tool as an actor. The movie is not funny, it tries to be funny in contrast with the first movie. The first movie was natural like spontaneous, the second and the third one just pushed too far. The first half of the film was pretty boring and uninspiring like the second half of Iron Man 2? Focusing on Bruce Wayne more rather than his alter ego Batman could work, I hate that either, but in this movie, it becomes the fatal mistake! Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie, it has not comic book feel at all, the cinematography is more like a flat comedy movie except for the visual effects and don't expect Tony Stark fighting as Iron Man throughout the movie! He rarely wears his costume, mostly he runs around as Tony Stark like a detective! The climax of the film was like The A-Team (2010) with some uninspiring action scenes. By the way, the misleading trailer is just another story! Ohh, Tony Stark in the hospital, Ohh, wait, lots of action, this time it looks like a darker film etc. etc. Also there is a big, real big plot hole near the end of the film (if you saw the movie, you know what I mean) In addition, the movie tries to be politic rather than entertaining or fanciful which is beyond terrible! And this is just a guess, the young boy could be The Iron Man of the future like ""Young Indiana Jones"" when Tony Stark gets old, ""quits the job"" or dies. It was just a sense from me."

","*Contains Spoilers* I can't believe this film was even considered with this obnoxious storyline. Mandarin, Iron Man's arch-nemesis, is made to look like a complete useless idiot. Their intellect (in the comics) is evenly matched but Iron Man 3 showed us that Mandarin was working on his project for 13 years and could not figure out a way to stabilise it where Tony Stark almost figured it out in one night, when he was drunk. He later figured it out completely to save Pepper, without breaking a sweat. If that wasn't enough of a kick to the groin, Tony has reoccurring stupid decisions throughout the film. From giving the terrorists his home address to taking the only suit that wasn't combat ready to trusting a little kid with his only suit to destroying all of his 42 suits for no reason. One another major thing that annoyed me was his constant panic/anxiety attacks. It was just painful to watch a hero cower and replay memories of himself from the ending scenes of The Avengers, added nothing to the story and was just useless. If anything, shouldn't one of his priorities be to keep all the suits in case of alien danger, the thing he kept cowering about? There was also major inconsistencies with Mandarin's henchmen and the damage they could do to the suits. <br/><br/>I gave the film a 3/10 because the action was good, no other reason. I recommend to only see this film if you are a person who has no care for Iron Man or the storyline or logic in general, and just generally enjoy violence."
"EvolBob","2","88","186","25 April 2013"," Not an Iron Man Movie
","Iron Man 3 was shown midnight Wednesday 24th (Tuesday night New Zealand time): This is my warning for American audiences.<br/><br/>Lets dispense with the no spoiler spoiler, to not spoil the movie I should tell ya what happens. 1 It is NOT an Iron Man movie - it looks like one, and it has Robert Downey Jr (doped to his eyeballs), but Iron Man never takes off - I'm still waiting! 2 The storyline is written by an extremely unimaginative 3 year old. 3 All the actors in this movie are appendages to RDJ. 4 The plot holes are so numerous they all merge into a Black Hole near the end to completely obliterate any remaining trace or concern we might still have for whatever happens next. 5 There are a lot of explosions, so if you ever start to wonder what might happen next... now you know. The director Shane Black obviously likes them and uses them liberally in exchange for any story. 6 The special effects suck. 7 The only 3 things that failed were: The acting, the screenplay, and the script. This movie was everything 'The Avengers' was not. IM3 is described as an Action Sci-Fi Thriller, which is a pity as RDjr thought he was in a comedy. Go on, go see this piece of waste effluent, and near the end you will be rooting for the bad guy. I'm sure all who were part of the making of IM3 suffered greatly."
"abhishekms_89","6","43","85","26 April 2013"," The best crew member was the guy who edited the trailers!
","OK, for starters I would like to tell all the RDJ fans I'm sorry. You may find this review harsh. I was on the edge of my seat when I saw the trailer, then the theatrical release and the extended look. I was sleep deprived, hungry and had to go to 2 different cinemas before I could get tickets for the first show. So you could say I was pretty excited about the latest release from Marvel. But my reaction, post credits, was of only disappointment and agony.<br/><br/>The movie starts off well getting the audience intrigued. But it's pretty much downhill from there. I really liked the amount of pointless explosions that occurred, very frequently throughout the duration of the movie. Though it wasn't that great in 3D. I mean, we have come to expect a whole lot more from movies shot in 3D in this day and age. Happy was good, and may be one of the only characters who stuck to his role from the previous two movies. The plot is rather foolishly simple and actually misleads the audience for most of its duration. You get to see a lot more of Col. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and in a much more defined role. He was not in the movie just to be in it this time, he had purpose, skills and an insane looking armor (very different from what it is actually supposed to be **Iron Patriot**). Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) was intense in some scenes in this movie, one of the few pleasant surprises that this movie had in-store for us. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), ""the Botanist"" and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), played their parts pretty well. Not much was expected from Hall's character but she delivers, and Pearce portrayed his character well. <br/><br/>Which brings me to the two big elephants in this review. Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ) and the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley). For one, you get to see a whole lot more of Tony Stark in this movie, with his alter-ego taking the back seat for large durations in the film. You get to see a side of Stark which we seems to be contrasting to the facade we have seen him portray though out the franchise. I think the ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director and first time Iron Man director has tried to show a ""human"" side to the ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist"", Stark. I am not sure if the popularity of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy has sparked off this need for directors to show this dark and gloomy side of their protagonists, but let me tell you this much, with Batman, it worked, with Iron Man, it wasn't really the best idea. It was gruesome to watch Tony struggle with PTSD and other highly human elements in him. The Mandarin, oh God The less I speak about him, the better. I have no idea why Sir Ben Kingsley decided to do this role and how Stan Lee (yeah he does have a cameo, look out for it) allowed it to transpire this way. There is a very brutal end sequence, which tries to redeem the movie, but it is too little too late. I, however, did really enjoy the last few minutes, but only because of the pure awesomeness of Iron Man that was shown in those scenes. Expect some shocks.<br/><br/>Another very very disappointing moment was when we heard no AC/DC playing in any part of this movie. I waited till the end for the after- credit scene (yes, there is one), and was shocked to not be able to listen to a single AC/DC tune. Another characteristic element of Iron Man stripped in this movie. <br/><br/>A disappointing start to my list of summer blockbusters. I hope the upcoming Marvel movies pick up the slack and make up for this tiresome experience. A movie to be watched with low expectations and only for the fireworks. Not close to Iron Man 1 by a long shot. Kudos to the editor of the trailer for making this movie like this seem desirable.<br/><br/>I give it 6/10 just for Happy Hogan."

The answer is ""to take revenge from the Stak!!!"" The Stark made their own enemy!!!!!!!! So the whole idea about the story is a recycle. But not just recycle, it is a variety show! When Ivan Vanko activated his machine first time in ""Iron Man 2"", I hold my breath... all my mind was the idea like ""Holy Crap!! Things are going down!!!"" .......

Making fun is good, but not good enough!! The worst party, this story is not about how Tonny Stark be a better man/hero. It is just about how Tonny Stark fit into Pepper Potts's demand!

"Mandeth","1","37","72","1 May 2013"," Iron Man 3: Shane Black's tribute to Lethal Weapon
","Just saw Iron Man 3 and the problem with the film isn't The Mandarin, which Stark himself calls ""Embarrassing."" <br/><br/>The movie actually lacks continuity with the previous Marvel films featuring Robert Downey JR. as Tony Stark/Iron Man in some very big ways. Up until this film Tony has been brilliant and resourceful. And the Iron Man armor has been a powerful weapon. But in this film Tony is a guy with a big mouth who isn't all that great with the suit and his suits seem like they're made of aluminum scrap. And there are various times in the film where Tony's once amazing tech is reduced to malfunctioning junk just for cheap laughs. <br/><br/>It also seems like the creators of Iron Man 3 forgot that Tony Stark's mini Arc Reactor powers his various Iron Man suits. The mini Arc Reactor was the driving plot point of Iron Man. It's what everyone was fighting about and it was ripped from Tony Stark's chest by Obadiah Stane and used to power Stane's Iron Monger weaponry. Later Stark recovers the mini Arc and places it back inside his chest. It's still there in Iron Man 3, yet Stark runs around looking for ways to jump start his Iron Man armor after it's damaged.<br/><br/>There's also no explanation as to why Tony stays in Tennessee as if hes stranded and why Tony labors on repairs for his damaged armor when later we find Tony has had dozens of fully operational Iron Man suits hidden in California, that he could summon at any time. And why did Tony don his only non operational suit after daring terrorists to attack him at home in California, when he had many ready to go suits in his basement and bunker? <br/><br/>We learned in Avengers that Tony's artificial intelligence design; 'Jarvis', also exists in the NYC Stark Tower and can manufacture suits without assistance. Yet in Iron Man 3 he only exists in the Iron Man armor after the Malibu home is destroyed. Another bit of Iron Man canon that is ignored to keep Tony stranded in Tennessee and stuck with a damaged Iron Man suit. <br/><br/>Tony's Iron Man armor has survived direct hits from missiles, being run over by a car, SHIELD Heli-Carrier propellers, Thor's hammer and many violent crashes in previous films but in Iron Man 3 it is shattered by a collision with a semi truck and later in the climatic battle, multiple suits are ripped apart like wet tissue. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, the creator and writer of the Lethal Weapon series. And much of this movie breaks the cannon of 2 Iron Man films and Avengers, just to morph Iron Man into a retread of Shane Black's glory days writing scenes for Rigg's and Murtagh.<br/><br/>Shane Black became friends with Downey JR. while they worked on Black's 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'. It was Downey JR. who pulled some strings within Marvel Films to get Black his Iron Man 3 gig. Marvel did itself and it's fans a great disservice handing such control of it's Iron Man franchise over to Black who in turn used it to pay homage to himself and to his Lethal Weapon series."
"paul-murray-4","2","58","120","27 April 2013"," Flimsy. It was so bad.
","With superhero continuities, I like to split the review into 2 sections.<br/><br/>1) The film itself<br/><br/>As expected with these big budget movies, the visuals were excellent. (Adult) Acting was good all round. I'm afraid that's the only positives I can think of. The pace was uneven throughout, making it difficult to get into the film or empathise with any of the characters. The comedy was so poor it was uncomfortable. <br/><br/>A particular storyline which was unnecessary was what I'll refer to as 'the boy'. It felt like a cross between Home Alone 4 and young Anakin in The Phantom Menace. Nothing else needs to be said on that.<br/><br/>2) Superhero continuity<br/><br/>I'd like to distinguish films like Iron Man and Batman because of their sense of realism. However, in Iron Man 3, there was no real explanation of the Extremis' ability to regenerate and raise their temperature to 3000 degrees, or explode. It was just ridiculous. Let's assume Tony Stark is a genius and did make these suits, there's just no way these 'badguys' can raise their body heat that high without their blood boiling for example. Ridiculous. <br/><br/>This is what really grinds on me. WHY WAS HIS SUITS SO FLIMSY?! Avengers Assemble, withstands multiple blasts from alien technology weaponry and sustained lightning from the God of Thunder. But in this film, a hot hand can smash right through it! No, I'm not having it. I want an apology from everyone involved in writing the script."
"ScottBang","Null","58","120","21 April 2013"," GREAT balance GREAT movie, it gets everything right!
","Iron Man 3 is BEYOND a typical summer movie. It's everything an entertaining movie should be, and much, much more. There's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The brilliant, hard-drinking, fast-talking, now traumatized superhero charms from opening scene until the last.<br/><br/>The movie gets everything right but maybe its number one strength is the fact that they cover new and exciting ground. Downey again brings a winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Don Cheadle certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is not what he seems and wonderful. No one, not even the villains are one dimensional characters. Guy Pearce is perfect in his role and, at the end, you can see why he was cast. Gwyneth Paltrow and Rebecca Hall certainly add sex appeal but beyond that they also deliver real performances and truly deep characters. This is Pepper Potts best film by far and is every bit the perfect match for Stark. The interaction and the relationships all work well and are truly a highlight of the entire movie. All the dialog is superb. You would expect nothing less from a Shane Black film. This ranks right up there if not surpasses Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.<br/><br/>A lot of superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. IM3 is somewhat dark but keeps in line with the wonderful tone already established for this character and universe. Again, this movie's creators mix everything so well. It leans towards dark but touches heavily on every other tone and emotion. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialog than most other movies have ever delivered, regardless of genre. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib as ever but there's something bubbling under the surface that we haven't seen before. He never loses his likability and grows in to something more than what we've seen. That's true character turn and development in a summer film!!!! What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every plot turn carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. In terms of action, what we came to expect in Avengers is delivered here as well. Iron Man kicks butt again and again, he's not alone. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker.<br/><br/>What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man 3 is now officially in the running for best movie of the year, again regardless of genre."
"tobygumbrill","1","61","127","28 April 2013"," Wow, just when you thought it wouldn't happen again...
","X-Men: the Last Stand, Spiderman 3, yup they've managed to somehow **** it up again, just when you thought the visionaries behind Marvel have learned from the previous mistakes, they go ahead and screen this awfully paced, tacky, gigantic disappointment of an Iron Man film, just when people thought the second film was ""bad"" I wouldn't even believe to consider this film as a part of the series. Now, I understand that to cast such a brilliant actor such as Robert Downey Jr to play such a character as Tony Stark, it has to consist of the occasional comedy and slapstick humour, but in Iron Man 3 they pretty much packed all the so- called comedy they could, despite this supposedly being the last Iron Man, and I know, I wasn't asking for another Dark Knight Rises, but a little serious action and emotion once in a while seriously wouldn't of killed them, especially *SPOILER ALERT* If Tony Stark gives up Iron Man, which by the way, was totally out of the blue and was not built up to such a conclusion at all, back to the pacing, I couldn't be more confused by what's going on when, one minute Tony and Pepper are having a couple's argument of a giant stuffed bunny *sigh, I know* next minute, no next second, his mansion gets missiles blown at it by the Mandarin's orders, oh wait, *SPOILER ALERT* there is no Mandarin, they literally made a weak joke out of one of the most serious villains in Marvel history, yes turns out Ben Kingsley plays a stereotypical, washed up British actor, living under the ""role"" as the Mandarin.<br/><br/>Words can't even describe how disappointed I was at this point, sure they made humour out of the fact that the trailers built the Mandarin up to be an awesome, mysterious, bad-ass, perhaps what could have been one of the greatest villains ever acted out in history, but it was unfunny and just awful, and to add insult to injury, the villain we got instead was a scientist with a grudge, yup there is also a sudden back story, of course instead of referring back to the first two films, they just pack a whole new storyline in one film. 1999: a dorky fan-boy named Aldrich Killian got turned down by Tony Stark and 13 years later got his revenge on Tony as the bad guy by unleashing havoc, remind you of anything? Yup, they totally ripped off the storyline to The Incredibles, funnily enough the humour in this film was about equivalent to that of a Disney Pixar film, only difference is I can watch Toy Story without cringing. Not only was the villain bad, the action scenes were beyond annoying and consistent, if it's not Iron Man making a monkey chain of civilians to save the day, it'll be him busting into every suit he can of the 42 he suddenly owns, before each and every one of them either explode randomly or fall to pieces due to the many rip-off's of Johnny Storm (Fantastic 4). But seriously, Tony's entered so many suits in one film, the whole unique point of Iron Man just doesn't exist, and all I can see him as is (in the words of Cptn. America) just a guy in a suit, or a tonne of suits. Especially considering that both Pepper and Rhodes can apparently put on the suits as well.<br/><br/>I could summarize many, many more points about this film, but I'm limited to 1000 words so I can only do so many another would be the kid, yup there's a kid, I had no idea where the storyline was going at this point, all I could see were more demon people exploding, correct me if I'm wrong, the movie was in fact unbearable to watch, but when it got to the point where Robert Downey Jr started bonding with this 9 year old, whom of which apparently has been abandoned by both his parents, all I could see it as is a bad family flick starring Dwayne Johnson. To conclude everything I've mentioned, bad twist, bad plot, bad pace, bad villain, bad action, bad ending, overall just a horrible excuse for a superhero movie, I am beyond shocked that this movie has such a high rating, might just be because The Avengers set such a high bar, or perhaps some fans just can't let go of what could have been, anyway as much as I love Iron Man as a whole, this film in particular has to be downsized to its rightful grade"
"Vikram19867","4","37","73","26 April 2013"," Good Action sequences. Disappointing Villain. Jon Favreau would have done justice
","After going into the theater having seriously high expectations, I was disappointed. Not to outrightly dismiss the movie, let's discuss the pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is just brilliant. He breathes life into the character like no other. Undoubtedly one the reasons why i was generous with the 4 star rating.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ben Kingsley as Mandarin. OMG! He gave me goosebumps. He's the reason I watched the movie. Those Aviator goggles, that terrifying militant persona and the ten rings. He nailed the Mandarin look. Extremely disappointing how they turned down his character. Trevor? Seriously? Here was an opportunity to deliver one of the greatest villains in history, and they turned it down. Shame on you Marvel.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The short lasting, but quite outstanding action sequences were immense fun while they lasted. Although Jon Favreau put the CGI to much better use, this movie did well too in that department. The Malibu mansion take-down was action-packed and filled with tension, because at the back of it all, was Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin. You could feel his inclination for terror in every strike, and the gravity of the attack because he wanted to kill Iron Man for good. It wasn't Killian that terrified the audience, it was Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Also, The finale, ruined of course by the lame extremis Killain villain, was still pretty action packed, and pepper potts kicked some major ass!</li></ul><br/><br/>Now, the Only Con, the final blow, which ruined the film for me and my expectations, is this:<br/><br/><ul><li>Adrich Killian as the Mandarin?! Why, Shane Black, Why? Iron Man comics have had some really good plots and story lines and Killian could easily be the Mandarin with the extremis powers he possesses. But God, how can you just dismiss Ben Kingsley's Mandarin? How? That crazy accent, the furious terrorist demeanor, those ten rings, did that mean nothing in the end? He is Iron Man's nemesis, not those jerk off extremis soldiers. They may stand as good foes, but an incredible villain has been wasted, and it is a pity, for my faith in comic book movies has been lost again, &amp; it would now take another Christian Bale comic adaption to revive it. Extremely disappointing.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, good action sequences, great chemistry between pepper and stark, Guy Pearce plays Killian and the extremis villain well, but disappointing character development regarding Maya & the Mandarin, and a great villain wasted, which ruined the movie for me, greatly over weighing all the pros. Watch it once for fun's sake."
"dynastyofdisgust","1","19","34","3 May 2013"," Epic, epic, epic.... disappointment!!!! Save your money!
","To begin with, I really enjoyed the first two Iron Man movies. I'm also an avid comic book fan. However, I do understand that things can't be exactly the same in the movies as they were in the comics, and I see why, it's pretty self-explanatory. What they did in this movie was just plain STUPID. Spoiler alert, but truth be told the only thing that can be spoiled is disappointment. The first, I think hour of the movie was actually going well. They present the ""mandarin"" (notice the quotations), we don't see much of him, but we see enough to think ""damn, this guy's no joke"". They set him up as this ruthless terrorist, and of course you think he's the main villain. You're wrong, and I was wrong, it turns out the character that Ben Kingsley plays is actually a drunken idiot actor (yes, an actor playing an actor) named trevor who was hired by the real main villain i.e. Guy Pearce's character to make these stupid movie clips to send to the media that show 'the mandarin' committing terrorist acts, and that is NO JOKE. Now I know that The Mandarin isn't super well-known, and that Iron Man doesn't have a particularly revered cast of bad guys, but neither does The Hulk, and they managed to make The Abomination pretty awesome in The Inredible Hulk. The character Yinsen; who helped Tony Stark make his first armor in the first movie, makes a small appearance in a flashback, then he is completely not even heard of again. Now I think it would have been pretty cool to see how Yinsen was involved with The Mandarin, since he was captured by The Ten Rings terrorist group (Mandarin wore ten rings by the way), and then maybe have Tony Stark go back to fight the Ten Rings camp and discover their true leader; The Mandarin, something along those lines. Something that involved the Ten Rings, Yinsen (since he did have a cameo), and of course THE REAL MANDARIN. The fact that they made him look so menacing at first and then reveal him to be a hoax is extremely tasteless, whether or not you were looking forward to The Mandarin, what they did was STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, and plot holes galore. You might even notice how they're trying to emulate The Dark Knight Rises, if you've seen TDKR that is (TDKR was awesome though). Another threequel bites the dust!"
"t-russon","4","41","82","25 April 2013"," So many bright points, but such a disappointment.
","Casting: Great Editing: Glorious SFX: Consistently very good with a few small exceptions not worth mentioning. The rest...<br/><br/>First, I am not a comic book fan in general, I prefer prose and rate the first Iron Man (2008) as well within my top10 films from the last decade and loved Iron Man 2. Having seen the trailers and felt the build-up for the last several months, I went to the cinema barely able to hold in my excitement. I was bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>This is a strange movie in that there are many excellent elements which are unfortunately lost in a morass of sluggish pacing - I actually said to myself ""I'm bored"" at one point. The pacing issue is mainly due to the entirely unnecessary second act which feels like it's there to give the character some space and realise his potential/clear his head. Unfortunately, it actually just wastes a massive amount of time not really doing anything to forward the plot. <br/><br/>The character of Tony Stark, while obviously deeply affected by the events of The Avengers, is completely changed with almost no sign nor hint of the character in the first film. All I can say about this is thank the celluloid gods that we have RDJ at the helm to lend his incredible charisma to the lacklustre plot. <br/><br/>Another good point deserving of a whole paragraph to itself: GUY PEARCE! He brilliantly delivers a phenomenal performance which again, helps carry the bloated, lukewarm story and lets the viewer ignore the almost total lack of real back-story for the character. <br/><br/>The Mandarin is the biggest disappointment I've encountered since all of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Attempting to avoid spoilers, all I can say is that it's nothing to do with Sir Ben Kingsley whose performance is probably the best in the whole movie, but the way the character is used. <br/><br/>The technology, obviously such an enormous aspect of the film, has its role massively changed from that of a tool to almost an annoying hindrance. <br/><br/>I recall hearing somewhere a while ago that the new director, Mr Black would take us to a darker, more emotional place with this film. I hadn't expected that the darkness would be literally having many scenes at night and emotions would be people crying. I was expecting great things that would allow us to follow Tony Stark as his Iron Man armours improve and he sorts his head and priorities out. In the case of the former, things have become more flashy for sure, but apparently at the expense of reliability and durability. For the latter, remember the more mature, healthy Tony Stark at the end of The Avengers? Sorry...<br/><br/>I would say ""Come back Mr Favreau, all is forgiven"", but he did an amazing job and there's really not much to forgive him for, so I'll just say ""BRING BACK FAVREAU!""<br/><br/>Go in to this film with VERY low expectations and you'll be pleased. For those among you who don't care about plot and just want flashy action and SFX, you'll be happy. This is unfortunately not a people-film and there's scarcely enough depth to fill a saucer.<br/><br/>Not without bright points, but ultimately such a crushing disappointment."
"n-m-bertin","3","35","69","29 April 2013"," Rubbish...
","Iron Man 3 is just a melting pot of a lot of plots in the comic books. It's pretty clear that the main goal was to introduce A.I.M., to use it later in other Marvel movies, but other than that, it's chaos.<br/><br/>Yes in the comic there's an arc with a villain capable of regenerating himself, and some human bombs. But not an army of fire breathing demons or something... Yes in the comic there is an arc where Tony Stark uses all his old armors, but they're not in autopilot, he has to pilot them himself, all at once, and that's what was brilliant. Here it's just for show, and it's ridiculous. Yes there is an Iron Patriot in the comic, but it's the Dark Avengers' version of Iron Man, with Norman Osborn in it, AKA the Green Goblin, when he was head of the new version of SHIELD after the Skrull disaster... Obviously they couldn't do this, since they killed him in the Spiderman series... so why bringing the Iron Patriot like that ? It's pointless and pathetic...<br/><br/>So, does Tony Stark evolve ? Well not really... Since they refuse to show his alcoholism on screen (but apparently don't have any problem showing terrorist attacks a couple of weeks after Boston lol...), all they could do was introduce some couple problems with Pepper... Well guess what, it doesn't work. I don't know how Guy Pearce got convinced to play in this, but he makes for the worst villain ever. No depth, no motivation, it's very badly written. Making a hero work isn't that hard, the hard part is making a villain work... The joker and Bane were quite good in the Batman series, but in the Iron Man series it's a succession of awfully written characters. Even in all the Marvel movies, there may be only 2 descent villains : Loki and the Green Goblin. That's it. Magneto and the Abomination were kind of fun, but the rest are appalling : Bullseye, Sandman, Whiplash, the Red Skull, Sebastian Shaw, etc...<br/><br/>Secondary characters ? Rubbish as well. War Machine/Iron Patriot brings nothing but laughable pity, Jon Favreau's character is totally out of place, Pepper forgives everything and transforms into a superhero at the end (the arc in the comic book was again so much better...), Rebecca Hall's role could simply have been erased it's so useless, and James Badge Dale delivers a pale copy of X-Files' super soldiers...<br/><br/>I watched it in IMAX 3D, and frankly, it wasn't worth it. The 3D is just as bad as in The Avengers : the movie is clearly not made for it, it's just a post production effect, not a desire from the director to shoot it in 3D. Same with the IMAX scenes, nothing pops out like the scenes in the Batman movies or the last Mission Impossible. All in all, it's one of the worst Marvel movies ever. Even Thor was better than that."

"ebranlol","5","33","65","26 April 2013"," Nice Effects, Lame Story
","So, first off, I was and still am fairly happy with the way the first two Iron Man movies were done. They made sense, established the characters etc. This movie... falls flat on that front.<br/><br/>1. The suits? Everyone who has seen the previous movies knows how much punishment Iron Man's armors can take before falling apart. In this movie, the upgraded new versions of the armor seem to be made of cheap plastics - what was able to handle tank shots and heat over 20k C° is now being torn apart by mildly enhanced people who can heat themselves up to a top 3k C°. That's not much of an upgrade, is it now?<br/><br/>2. The new characters? There are some.<br/><br/>The one night's stand woman who is later reintroduced as a corrupted genius working for the bad guys, and is only a part of the plot so that the Extremis could be HALF-explained? She regains her sense of righteousness after Tony Stark speaks about three sentences to her.<br/><br/>The Mandarin, who was set up in the trailer so awesomely as the main antagonist? He's just an actor in the movie, a ""mascot"" for the terrorist group - he didn't even know he was working for terrorists! Compare that to the comics' Mandarin who is using alien technology and is Iron Man's archenemy...<br/><br/>3. The plot?<br/><br/>Is full of holes. What is the Extremis? If Tony Stark could have removed the piece of shrapnel from his body whenever he felt like doing so, why didn't he do that in the first two movies? If the armor suits need to be charged from external sources, why does he need a super-powered magnet- generator in his chest when a low-powered one is just as efficient? How come that the armor pieces can fly more than a thousand kilometers at extreme speed without losing much energy but the full suit loses most of that after a shorter flight?<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed by this movie. It felt slow, there wasn't much character development, the enemies were lame and felt weak, the jokes got tiring very fast, and the ending seemed like something that was attached to the story during post-production. The hype it got before release also did not help with this. It is not a bad movie, but I would not recommend it for fans of the comics or for multiple re-sittings."
"stargatesam","Null","48","99","22 April 2013"," Wonderful! They absolutely played this one just right.
","I love the fact that Marvel knew ""we can't go bigger than we've just gone."" Meaning that to try and follow Avengers with bigger wild action would have been futile. So, they went in a unique, deeper and more powerful direction. Sure there are stunning action sequences but everything is in context of a greater theme and the entire story. They absolutely played this one just right. They let The Avengers sit on its own and didn't do anything but feed off the momentum and actions of that film. <br/><br/>Everything here is focused on Tony Stark and his immediate universe. Avengers 2 is the last thing on anyone's mind watching this and, as much as I loved Avengers, that's a good thing. Everything needs to kind of re-set and take a breath. This movie is NOT concerned with being connected to anything larger or having Nick Fury come in and solve or oversee anything. The events in The Avengers are addressed but only felt as to their effect on Tony's psyche. This movie is about Tony Stark's journey after we've seen him last. It really does perfectly explore his character and develops him deeper than we have seen since the first act of the very first film. It really is the perfect way to go and everything is exceptionally well done."
"Theusualguy","4","36","72","1 May 2013"," What was that
","Wow. This movie really didn't capture anything that was special from the first iron man. The gritty-comedic tone set the bar pretty high from the get go, then iron man 2 was released and it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 however, was even worse then the second one. 6 extremely bad issues with the film:<br/><br/>1.) Comedy If i wanted to see a comedy, i would have seen a different movie. NOT IRON MAN 3! This movie is nothing more then snippy one liners and referrals to the avengers (which are funny at first granted, but get extremely repetitive?). 2.) The suit/s. This not a spoiler so yes. In the trailer you see Gwyneth Paltrow in the suit. Firstly, what is the point of Tony stark if his butler can use the suit, let alone Rhodey who pilots his own suit. Very silly. 3.) The portrayal of the Mandarin. If you've read the comics (like me) the mandarin uses rings to control three space alien dragons and has utmost powers. (In the film this unrealistic measure has been toned down a lot)Though to the point of where one of iron man's toughest villains has been disgraced. see the movie and you will understand where i'm coming from. 4.) Plot holes. To give nothing Away, the consistency of plot holes is unbearable, and so easily pick up!5.) That Disney feel to it. This movie is like a family comedy, if you want to take your kids to a family action movie (yet there is little action in this one) take them to this one. 6.) Unnecessary characters. In this movie there is a child, okay, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS THAT THE MOVIE FOCUSES ON! Disney what have you done to iron man. <br/><br/>So in reality don't see this movie unless you want to see what I'm talking about 4/10"

","I agree with other comments that on a superhero movie you do not want an excessive amount of ""drama"" nobody cares about. This is (after Hulk) probably the worst movie Marvel had done.... You can tell they changed the director, and that this is not on the same track as the previous two. I had great hopes on Sir Ben playing The Mandarin. It was not bad, but more screen time instead of the tiring Guy Pierce could have improved a poor product. It certainly makes me wonder if I will spend money on the upcoming Thor, Captain America,etc. I paid for 3D only to find around 15 minutes of it, badly used and non-spectacular.

","The Good - RDJ is great as usual and is well supported by the remarkable Guy Pearce. Some, and only some one-liners hit the mark. The action and visual effects are a dazzling treat to behold. And that's the end of it. There is nothing else in this movie that is truly good to write home about.<br/><br/>The Bad - Where to even begin? This is one awful movie that shall take the studio a lot of soul-searching and fundamental reworking (irrespective of how much money this movie rakes in), in order to even attempt getting this great superhero franchise back on track. The direction is so shoddy that any recently passed out film school alumnus could have done a better job. The plot, characterization, story arc, and narration is simply all over the place and meanders along a confounding, restless, and disoriented path.<br/><br/>Hardcore comic book fans and Iron Man aficionados like me will certainly spew vitriol at seeing Mandarin - one of the greatest comic book villains and one of the fiercest adversaries of Iron Man - being reduced to a mere gimmick. The character's gross misrepresentation simply cannot be overlooked. Add to this, the character of Aldrich Killian - who in reality is nothing more than a minion and a small-time foe of Iron Man - being given superiority and control over Mandarin, and any mildly interested follower of Iron Man will begin to wonder if it would have been more prudent to hire some avid comic book fans to harness this script.<br/><br/>Even objective moviegoers without any predilections towards the comics, will be left largely dissatisfied at the total decimation of the narrative structure. This film is like a Hollywood 'Singham' or a 'Rowdy Rathore' in a superhero mold - that's how bad it is. Its nothing but a shrewd attempt to milk the cash cow and surreptitiously deliver insipid milk in a glossy packet to the unsuspecting audiences.<br/><br/>Those who've been comparing this rancid somnolence to ""The Avenger"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - two of the greatest superhero movies ever - and those who claim that ""Iron Man 3"" amalgamates the tones of both the aforementioned films, have either been bribed handsomely by the producers or perhaps they have watched a completely different movie. This film is more analogous to such superhero stinkers like ""Batman & Robin"", ""Catwoman"", Spiderman 3"", ""Green Lantern"", and ""Superman Returns"".<br/><br/>Quite simply, one of the worst superhero movies ever, and a real blemish on the reputation of the classic 1st installment and the vastly superior 2nd installment."

"Neejan","6","38","77","26 April 2013"," Tony Stark's beating heart is back
","The first Iron Man movie, five years ago, was an immediate blockbuster mainly due to the casting of Robert Downey Jr. The smooth-talking actor with all the irony he had to offer fitted the eccentric billionaire (and philanthropist) Tony Stark perfectly well. The sequel three years ago looked somewhat worse, but last summer in The Avengers, Downey Jr showed that he is still the most beloved superhero.<br/><br/>In Iron Man 3, a well-aimed joke still manages to break the intense heat emitted from the various scenes. Thanks to director and screenwriter Shane Black, who has previously worked with Downey Jr in the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, there is a neat balance between action and humor, just like Iron Man from 2008. Although Black uses this technique way too often in the first half hour of the movie, making it look like the Lethal Weapon series, the sheer fun stays and more importantly it does not interfere with the primary plot.<br/><br/>However, action is key throughout the movie. Now a topical issue, a series of bombings startle the American people (Boston is not one of the affected towns in the movie). The attacks are claimed by a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Surprisingly enough, he has not been portrayed as a Chinese but rather a Bin Laden-type of guy naturally characterized by the beard.<br/><br/>The Mandarin has been brought forward as a strong villain who simply wishes to teach the people of the United States a lesson. I am not really a fan of the comics, so purely looking at the Mandarin on the screen I can say that Ben Kingsley has done extremely well in his portrayal. After some tragic events (I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you), Iron Man literally invites the Mandarin to his residence in Malibu: the game is on.<br/><br/>Noticeably, Gwyneth Paltrow who plays the lovely Pepper Potts has more action scenes than in the two previous movies together. I do like that. It brings more drama to the big screens and it also emphasizes the developing chemistry between Tony in person or suited-up and Pepper. Added to this triangle are new characters who make Iron Man 3 still original and suspenseful apart from the main storyline. This is not a dark brooding movie at all.<br/><br/>In the end though, of course, everything and everyone is related in some way or another, but Iron Man 3 has got enough surprises and twists up its sleeve to make us forget about the classic Iron Man we once knew and the hero that he has become. The actors have performed beyond my expectations, especially the Mandarin who instantly gave me the creeps. The movie regularly refers to The Avengers, but even if you haven't seen that one you won't miss out on anything.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is up until now the best movie from Marvel Studios. Surprising twists, humorous sneers and bombastic action scenes: Tony Stark's beating heart is back."
"nitheeshas91","2","37","75","30 April 2013"," One of the worst superhero movies ever.
","I'd like to keep my reviews short and sweet. So here it goes: Iron Man 3, really not worth the hype. First of all, we rarely see Tony Stark in his suit. Even when he gets inside one, the suit gets messed up real soon. Second, there isn't much to watch in the movie except the scenes we saw in the trailers. Third, the idea used in the story line seems stolen from another movie, whose name i won't like to reveal as it may become a spoiler, maybe. The 3D effects wasn't any good, but for that, i should probably just blame the movie theater. Ah whatever, the movie sucks. No big visual treats + an ordinary story; put together, one of the worst superhero movies ever."

","I gotta say Im a big fan of MARVELS movies and of course the comics, with that in mind, sadly speaking as a big fan i have to say this is the WORST MARVEL MOVIE EVER DONE, i mean forget about the first HULK movie which was OK, but with a lot of room for improvement, this movie takes the word SUCK to brand new level of SUCKINESS, why I MEAN WHY !!! did they had to choose this muppet of a director AKA Shane Black he HAS DESTROYED THE IRON MAN FRANCHISEE IN AN SPECTACULAR WAY, WELL DONE YOU GIGANTIC DUSHBAG.<br/><br/>The movie is nothing like Ironman 1, or Ironman 2, in which they actually deliver an action movie not a poorly written and directed movie like Ironman 3, you don't see nothing but a glimpse of what was shown on the last 2 movies, the storyline is crap, they ruined a great iron man villain in this case the MANDARIN, the holes in the story are major since the iron man 3 movie as the other 2, are connected to the MARVEL universe = THE AVENGERS movie, so i mean the suits in this movie break only every 3 seconds with a scratch, and on the Avangers the suit (which you would expect is better now in Ironman 3 cause time has passed and obvious improvements have been done) could resist and actually give a 400% power capacity when Thor threw a lighting it didn't melt, or stopped functioning, so... i mean there are just about tons of holes like this on the movie and you don't get that amount of action that your (or at least me) craving you wait and wait and wait a bit longer and what you do get? NOTHING a long with a lot of Disappointment.<br/><br/>So guys don't spend your money is not worth it, and even if you get to see it for free you will still feel like you have been robbed, and i cant stress this enough maybe cause my favorite MARVEL superhero is iron man and seeing how this dushbag Shane Black has DESTROYED one of the best franchisees of marvel, hopefully in the next Avangers they will save what is left of Ironman. And if there will be another Ironman keep simple guys Jon Favreau has done pretty good on the 1 and 2 one, so really is that hard to see?"

I try and pretend Iron Man II didn't happen and The Avengers was INCREDIBLE but this is a really poor movie. The humour is not through the usual one liners but through silly scenes. They wheel out Air Force One and the whole scene is a complete time filler that does nothing to move the plot on - it's just clichéd and gratuitous. For the first time in a Marvel movie the best scenes are all in the trailers and the rest is actually completely miss-able. There is so much wrong it is hard to talk about it without discussing the plot. It really is poor and...and...I can't believe this script was okayed.

"stevesonlineplace","1","35","71","30 April 2013"," 'Iron Man: Low Battery'
","I went into this movie with an open mind; not being prejudice against mainstream superhero movies. But it was just as horrible, generic and predictable as expected.<br/><br/>The theme and feel of the movie is all over the place. One minute something serious happens regarding a bombing, smash cut to an attempted witty one liner. Are we meant to be taking this movie seriously or as a joke! Continuity is also disjointed. All of a sudden random people know how to fight like a superhero, billions of dollars of research and equipment are blown up for pretty firework like explosions, and one minute the Iron Man suit is pretty much indestructible, then it can be ripped off the protagonists by mere civilians.<br/><br/>The movie should have been called 'Iron Man: Low Battery'. The entire movie Stark is trying to find enough charge to keep his suit functional. And no, it's not because it uses some fancy power source. Simply hooking it up to a car battery is sufficient. How can such an advanced suit be developed, but not a proper power source! Also, where is the US military! The bad guys seem to be able to fly around the country shooting at Iron Man with no worry of being shot down or attacked by America's military.<br/><br/>Lastly, talk about a pro-American movie. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this movie was produced by American news channels combined with the government. Everything has an undertone of 'America, we are the best'. The 'bad guy' is a Middle Eastern terrorist, surprise surprise. This is almost a movie to justify America trying to be the world police.<br/><br/>Clearly these are not my type of movies, but it's exactly like every other superhero movie where you have bad guys, good guys and you already know who's going to win."
"vamsivamsi2","7","34","69","27 April 2013"," Nice movie. But could be better..
","In every movie, the Iron Man takes my breath away in his advancements of his suits, his weaponry, Jarvis (his A.I for his armour). But this movie makes all the others (yes.. including Avengers) look like a child's play. He upgrades the suit till Mark 42 which is like the coolest armour ever. His A.I, Jarvis also gets updated to a level that it can control the suits without any involvement of a man inside the armour. So, when it comes to the visual effects and action you get more than what you asked for.<br/><br/>Now, coming to the story, it could have been better, especially with the Mandarin story. The twist was so lame. It seemed like they wrapped up the story too quickly and without any clear reason, tony stark simply throws his whole Iron Man life away. I know it has to end but it could have been handled better.<br/><br/>Now, the cast. Robert Downey Jr is, as always charming and witty. His one liners have always impressed me and you could expect some of the best ones in this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce are okay. Ben Kingsley has a little role but he managed to throw a little humor in the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie and I will recommend this to every one. It will provide a few good laughs and some mind blowing action scenes."
"dragonsmoke315","1","52","111","3 May 2013"," Worse than Superman 3
","I don't know what movie other people saw, but the IM3 I saw is utter garbage. I don't mind the Mandarin twist; the comics version is outdated and too silly to work on screen.. The most obvious problem with this movie is that Iron Man is almost never in it. Sure, Tony Stark is in it a lot, but do people really go to see an Iron Man movie to see RDJ run around with a gun? Even Cheadle gets de-armored for so much of the movie that for a while I thought I was watching Die Hard 3 instead of IM3: two middle-aged guys with guns running around and making banter with each other while stuff blows up around them. <br/><br/>I really felt I was watching Marvel self-destructing. So much for their movie supremacy over DC. There will be comparisons made with The Dark Knight Rises. Like TDKR, IM3 focuses more on the man inside the costume. Unfortunately, this just doesn't work as well with IM3. For one thing, Tony Stark just isn't as interesting as Bruce Wayne. Bruce without the costume is still Batman, but Tony without the armor is just a snarky guy with a silly goatee. The armor is half the character! Furthermore, during the few moments in IM3 when Tony is (sort of) Iron Man, he is portrayed as comically ineffective. Somehow Tony has gone from a genius who designed an armor that allows him to stand his ground against Thor to an idiot whose armor falls apart when someone breathes on it wrong. <br/><br/>SPOILER: Still not convinced? Try this on for size: Pepper defeats the villain after Tony fails miserably and repeatedly. She gets super powers for a few minutes. I kid you not!<br/><br/>Furthermore, another reason IM3 fails is because IM3 doesn't remotely approach TDKR in filmmaking quality. Shane Black is not in the same league as Christopher Nolan. Nolan's masterful pacing, stylish visuals, and use of camera movement and sound make TDKR gripping even when Bruce is not wearing the cowl. That is why TDKR is engaging even when Batman is not on screen (which is a lot). Black's direction is plodding and unimaginative by comparison; much of the time, I felt like I was watching a bad TV show instead of a movie. <br/><br/>SPOILER: Also, the ending will really enrage many fans. The most disappointing part of the movie is the way the ending makes Tony seem like a selfish jerk again. Didn't he become Iron Man because he wanted to atone for all the harm he had caused by selling weapons? His trajectory so far has been from selfish jerk to selfless hero. Now he gives up being Iron Man so he can enjoy his life with Pepper? And because fighting aliens and terrorists is scary? What kind of a hero is that? At least Bruce had the excuse of being physically unable to continue as Batman in TDKR.<br/><br/>I really hope that producers and studio executives make more of an effort in the future to cast actors who are willing to commit to these characters for the long haul. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon is rumored to be less than pleased by the position this leaves him in with the Avengers sequel/s. I don't blame him. At least the next Thor and Captain America movies look promising."
"jpblackwell-1","4","30","60","1 May 2013"," Such a disappointment
","I have to admit, that from the trailers I thought that Iron Man 3 looked really promising. Unfortunately, Marvel and Shane Black let us down.<br/><br/>The first Iron Man film rocked. The second one was disappointing, but it grew on me. The third does neither of these things. Some seriously poor story decisions left me shaking my head in disgust in the cinema. Too many non-jokes, not enough action and a serious step backwards as far a Marvel Studios is concerned. They compromised their coolest film franchise for cheap laughs.

"abbottsam","4","30","60","28 April 2013"," Read this before you rate/write a review for Iron Man 3
","Visually amazing, but slightly insulting to the audience.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3, which is seemingly only set a short time after The Avengers and Tony Stark is up to Mark 47 armor! Yet Tony only has Mark I to Mark VII on display in his garage and uses the new Mark 47 as his new ""daily drive"". Mark VIII to Mark 46 are apparently stored in a secure sub- basement level below Stark's garage. All prototypes; Stark's intentions for use of these 39 armors are never revealed, although there are some hints. Poor hints, but hints.<br/><br/>Never-the-less, 40 armors in the space of about a year = what the hell? He did quite well with Mark III to Mark VII for four years, 2008-2012. To go from seven (in total) armors in four years to building 41 (in total) in one year seems unrealistic and stupid.<br/><br/>The reasons given is that Stark is paranoid since the events of The Avengers. Gods and Aliens and threat of wars from powers unknown to human kind plague Stark's mind. He is losing sleep and spends all of his time building suits to suit different purposes depending on the kinds of threats the earth might face in the future.<br/><br/>But this makes no sense, as it appears since The Avengers that Iron Man has basically been retired by the Iron Patriot (War Machine/Rhodes), which also makes no sense!<br/><br/>Where was Rhodes during the events of The Avengers? No reference for this was given. Why did the government feel the need to put such faith in the Iron Patriot program when it was Iron Man who led the defence against the invasion in The Avengers?<br/><br/>The Iron Patriot armor was obviously new (as the semi-restored Mark II armor was now back in the Stark Garage) and obviously Stark tech. Why did Stark build a specific set of armor for the government? Throughout Iron Man (2008) Stark said he was done building weapons for the government. Throughout Iron Man 2 Stark said he was never going to let anyone else get hands on his technology and the government specifically ""can't have it"". Now all of a sudden we are meant to believe he just up and decides to build a new set of armor for government use? I don't get it, sorry.<br/><br/>Where was SHIELD and The Avengers? Surely they would have been on hand regarding these major acts of terrorism and presidential threats? Or at least on hand or around to assist Tony in his various moments of crisis'?... Particularly Captain America; he's already a Government sanctioned super hero. Where was he? Was painting the Iron Patriot in Captain America's colors a slap in the face to Capt Rogers, especially considering again, he was instrumental in the defence against the alien invasion. Again, where was Rhodes and why the focus on Iron Patriot?<br/><br/>Extremis was OTT.<br/><br/>The Mandarin twist was stupid.<br/><br/>Why didn't they tie The Mandarin into the foundation they laid with 10 Rings from the first Iron Man film?<br/><br/>Mark 47 was an extremely unreliable unit for a piece of Stark tech. Why didn't he use one of the Mark VIII to Mark 46 suits as his ""daily drive"" while the Mark 47 was still in beta testing? What was with the power issues hinted throughout the film? Are these suits not powered by their own individual arc reactors? Is that not self-sustaining energy? This makes the whole Mark 47 storyline (damage and repair etc.) really quite stupid, un-understandable and weird. Bottom line could Tony have not used energy from his personal arc reactor in an emergency type situation? So what was with the hooking up of Mark 47 to freaking car battery to ""charge it up""? Am I the only one asking this stuff?!<br/><br/>If Tony had 39 other suits just hanging around in lock up, why did he use The Avengers damaged Mark VII to meet up with Rhodes for a meal?<br/><br/>Why did he use a suit at all to just meet up with Rhodes? Doesn't he usually drive most places as Tony Stark?<br/><br/>Why was Mark VII just parked there out the front, open? Couldn't anyone just hop in there and take off? Or at least throw it on a trailer and nick it?<br/><br/>I don't understand why someone with Tony Stark's resources couldn't get all of those suits out of the ocean sooner Like, straight away.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley is the best actor in the world.<br/><br/>I'm all for humor, but the chance for a darker, more epic end to the trilogy was missed – we won't get that chance back.<br/><br/>If Tony was so paranoid about further invasions and threats to Earth, hence building 41 suits in total in a year, why then destroy them all on a whim because Pepper has a whinge about Tony not spending enough time with her?! Priorities Pepper, jeez! And Tony, letting a woman tell him what to do?!<br/><br/>If it was so easy to take the shrapnel out of Tony's heart, why wasn't that done as soon as he was rescued in 2008? Why go through all of the trouble of creating a better arc half way through the first film, then palladium poisoning and a new element and core in the second film? Especially considering from Iron Man 2 onward all suits had their own independent reactors and didn't run off of Tony's anyway. So in theory he could have done away with a personal arc a long time ago it seems Sorry, it all just seems like a gigantic waste of time and has destroyed the credibility of everything that came before it in the first two films?<br/><br/>I feel like writing and alternative Iron Man 3 just to highlight what they could and should have done.<br/><br/>This movie was weak and nonsensical (and deep down, you know it)!"
"Havgar","4","26","51","29 April 2013"," A lackluster, disappointing, cliché-ridden experience
","I'm writing this review in the hope that you read it before you see this film, and that you do NOT see this film. As such, I won't spoil the plot for you.<br/><br/>I am not a comic book fan, so I had no expectations going into this movie, except what was promised by the trailers, and of course the previous Iron Man movies. I enjoy good movies of any genre equally, so I was really not prejudiced in any way. I thought the movie was pretty terrible, and very underwhelming and disappointing overall.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>Acting. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always. Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce are both predictably solid as well. The rest of the cast does not stand out, but overall the acting was a high point of the movie.<br/><br/>That's it. The acting (particularly RDJ) was the redeeming feature of the film. It's for that, and the good production value, that I rated this a 4/10.<br/><br/>Now, onto the bad.<br/><br/>The plot. It's convoluted, uninspired, and just plain boring. The movie is not about Iron Man being awesome, it's about the drama in Tony Stark's life as he tries to get over his near-death experience in The Avengers. The film plays out like a drama, with a bunch of weak sub- plots pulling at it from all directions. It's predictable at every step of the way, and it never really gets anywhere.<br/><br/>The dialogue. This movie strives hard to be funny. Tony Stark in particular is throwing one liners left and right throughout the movie. It works a few times, but more often than not it just falls flat. In any case, you've got a lot clichés again, especially when it comes to how Tony's inner struggle unfolds. Weak and very boring.<br/><br/>The action. There is little more action in this movie than there is in the trailer. In fact, I'd say the trailer makes the action look a lot better than it does in the movie itself. The action scenes themselves are OK, but very few for an ""action"" movie.<br/><br/>The trailers are selling this as a dark, almost Nolanesque look at Iron Man, but it's not that at all. It's just a pitiful mess that doesn't know what it wants to be. There's very little Iron Man in this movie. Whenever Tony gets into a suit, it breaks down or malfunctions right away, and it suddenly feels like his tech is being manufactured on a boat somewhere.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that whereas Iron Man suit(s) were few and unique, in this movie he goes through perhaps 15 of them, making them feel more akin to pairs of sneakers.<br/><br/>To wrap this up, I would say that if you found what the trailers are presenting to be interesting, you will probably be disappointed. If you liked Iron Man 1, you will be disappointed. If you enjoy action, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>This overly long movie will present you with seemingly hours of exposition. What's worse is that it's so predictable, that you feel like you've seen it all before even after the first few frames. Given another chance, I would never go to see this in the cinema again. It's just not worth the money."

","I was lucky enough to see a screening of the film last night and all i can say was that it was AH- MAZING! There was a great narrative and the use of visual effects was amazing. The work that was put into make the film truly shows which is what made it amazing (besides the actors of course). Robert Downey Jr was amazing because you got to see a different side of him (i won't say more because i don't want to spoil it), but honestly he truly did kick it up a notch acting wise (at least thats what i think from the previous one). There are some big twists (which i won't say what once again because of spoiler alert) which if your a hardcore fan of Marvel might be 50/50 about it. For the people who love action you will truly love it the visual effects that were used made this film truly amazing! For me they truly kicked it up a notch from the previous Iron Man when it came to the visual effects used in the action sequences! Overall i thought it was a truly amazing experience and loved the film very much! And will watch it again! 10/10"
"Verdugo85","9","4","5","28 March 2018"," Better than Iron Man 2 but I wanna talk about The Mandarin..
","Iron Man 2 could've been better, I still like it but Iron Man 3 is an improvement. <br/><br/>Now, I wanna talk about The Mandarin. Alot of fanboys and trouble-making Marvel haters got their panties in a bunch trashing Iron Man 3 only because of the whole Mandarin thing. Yes, thats the only reason why yall hate Iron Man 3, I dont care. I get it, Ben Kingsley was The Mandarin based on the trailer and marketing but the twist took nothing away because he was never The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's character was just a washed up British actor getting paid to play a role pretending to be a terrorist in the media. The real villain is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), he's the mastermind who used ""The Mandarin/Ten Rings"" as a decoy to protect his illegal explosive experiment. Killian and his company ""AIM"" were the villains. Killian claimed to be The Mandarin but he really wasnt, although he did have some traits of the character but he created his own version.<br/><br/>And NO! you dont need to watch the One Shot ""Hail To The King"" short film with Ben Kinglsey to learn that a real Mandarin exist in the MCU. He was already hinted in Iron Man 3 long before the short film was considered. <br/><br/>To quote Aldrich Killian ""Because the second you give evil a face, a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, and you hand the people a target."" There you go. That wasnt so hard,eh? The real Mandarin/Ten Rings are still out there. They had nothing to do with the events of Iron Man 3. The One Shot ""Hail To The King"" short film was not an apology, it was to shut you spoiled brats up."
"tjsdomer2","4","4","5","10 August 2016"," Hollow Like a Fortune Cookie
","Iron Man 3 struggles to consistently excite in the way that The Avengers did. There are several impressive scenes, including on Air Force One, but as a whole the plot feel jumbled. Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, and Gwyneth Paltrow all return, along with Jon Favreau. Ben Kingsley also jumps on the scene as Iron Man's nemesis, the Mandarin.<br/><br/>One problem I have with the plot is it feels too much like Iron Man 2, with a jealous scientist trying to sabotage Iron Man for the control of the arms trade. Similarly, Iron Man's identity crisis and PTSD seems redundant and a bit unconvincing. Another major complaint I have is how the film treats the Mandarin, which I feels betrays the source material and misses an opportunity to create a truly magnificent villain. Rebecca Hall's character comes across as unnecessary, and despite being a fine actress, she does not add much to the plot.<br/><br/>Overall, Iron Man 3 tries to make some political statements regarding the war on terror and political accountability, and also does so with Tony and Pepper's relationship, but does so ineffectively and haphazardly due to the other flaws in the film and only gets 2 out of 4 stars."
"paulsbest-er","3","28","56","2 May 2013"," Why need Iron man when you have Plastic man!?
","The movie is an entertaining movie with Robert Downey Jr, lots of action and some funny scenes, but overall it is a major disappointment! This is mainly because of two reasons – Weak, useless suits and useless stupid people that got some kind of superpower because they were injected with some virus, vaccination or something.<br/><br/>The stupid mutated people with super strength, regenerating bodies and bodies that can reach 3000 degrees completely owns iron man suits(from here on plastic man suits). In the final scenes the main villain with this vaccination superpower destroys countless plastic suits and ultimately plastic man is left with nothing – he is even without his plastic! <br/><br/>If I remember correctly plastic man fought on par with Thor (A demi god), Thor fought on par with the hulk and hulk owned Loki (Another demigod), thus these super humans is stronger than any demi gods, the hulk and thus far stronger than the avengers.<br/><br/>So my conclusion is, we do not need the avengers if there is an alien invasion, in fact we do not need any help what so ever, all we have to do is make a few of these super humans and they will own any aliens trying to invade our world!<br/><br/>Thus rather not waste your money on this movie; it completely destroys the iron man concept and image as a superhero! His new image is PLASTIC man according to this movie!"
"whoa17","8","37","77","25 April 2013"," Iron Man 3 is great conclusion to the trilogy
","In 2008 we were greeted with one of the best comic book movies which is Iron Man, then in 2010 a sequel happened and it kinda felt of a mixed bag. So is the latest installment in the Iron Man franchise able to live up to the awesomeness of the original or will it be the worst film among the three? Read on below.<br/><br/>Story: The story is a continuation of 'Marvel's The Avengers' and I must say that the story for this movie is probably the smartest story that Marvel has ever told. The ideas and plot points were completely fleshed out and the story was told in a way that can get you entertained while thinking at the same time. This movie didn't have the need to add any more aspect to make the story better, the plot points was just perfect and was explained well, and also it also just stick in telling one story.<br/><br/>Acting: The performances of the actors here is very authentic, it felt like you are just watching something that is in front of you. It was nice to see some more action from RDJ's Tony Stark without wearing the suit and the same thing goes with Don Cheadle's James Rhodes. I also liked the performance of James Badge Dale, Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, Dale played a very menacing 'right hand' and both Pearce and Kingsley played their role excellently. Despite my praise for the performances of the actors, I also have my gripe with the development of the characters, some of them felt like they was just there for the sake of being present in the movie and I also think that some characters even got over-hyped. This is where this latest installment failed in, the development of characters because some of the characters felt really rushed and sometimes inappropriate. It was also nice seeing Jon Favreau back as Happy Hogan, good thing their is no bad ties in there and I felt really glad that I didn't get irritated by the kid (Ty Simpkins) in here, though his performance was not great, it wasn't bad either.<br/><br/>Action/Violence: This is an action-packed film, plain and simple but even though it has straight action, I don't think it was all that violent. In my opinion this installment has more action scenes than its predecessors and also each action scene was executed well, it kept the film at brisk pace and more importantly it was an aspect in the film that made it a whole lot entertaining.<br/><br/>Visual FX: Hands down, the best effects I've ever seen in an Iron Man film. It looks very natural and authentic and you can clearly see that a lot of work and effort has been put in this movie to be visually stunning. What I liked with the effects in this film is the usage of both CGI and practical effects, I mean practical effects is still the best way to go but when someone is falling you probably might want to add some CGI in it (I know senseless rant).<br/><br/>Music: I didn't bother much with the music but all I can say is that it helped the scenes to be much more meaningful and it added some depth into it. I miss hearing AC/DC in this film though.<br/><br/>Cinematography: This movie also delivers on being the best shot Iron Man movie (well, for me though) and with a little help from a CGI it was good overall.<br/><br/>Direction: One of the best aspects in this film is having Shane Black working behind the camera. I am a huge fan of all his films and seeing him take on this character was very exciting. It is not hard to tell that this is indeed a Shane Black film because, one, despite the seriousness of it in every trailer, the humor is very present in this movie and is probably the funniest Marvel film to date. Two, the buddy-cop formula is also present, you can sense this chemistry within the partnership of Tony Stark and James Rhodes. And lastly, three, the dramatic depth, even though this was a humorous movie, there is some depth in the dramatic scenes as it felt very moving and you will cheer up for the leads.<br/><br/>Overall: I will say that 'Iron Man 3' is not better than the original Iron Man but it is definitely on par with that and definitely surpassing its predecessor. To top it with great performances from the leads and villains, the amazing visual effects, and the very entertaining action scenes and smart lines, this movie makes it the perfect conclusion of the Iron Man trilogy. I am positive that this is surely one of Marvel's best efforts and I give this a 4/5."
"sandeepoke","3","24","47","29 April 2013"," Help!!! Somebody save this franchise!
","What were the makers of Iron Man 3 thinking? Do they take their audience for fools? Maybe we are.<br/><br/>As we flocked to see a screening of this movie at a local Imax 3D theatre, I was filled with a lot of expectation. But as the movie progressed (?) with a wafer thin plot (most unbelievable!) I found myself squirming at the ludicrous and forced twists and turns. There are very obvious plot holes... how do the bad guys find out where Stark lands after he escapes when his Malibu residence is attacked? How does Pepper survive a 200 foot fall? <br/><br/>I was appalled by what Ben Kingsley is made to do on screen. His rendition of Mandarin is laughable when you realise who he really is. Why would such a senior thespian stoop so low? Some critics had equated his role at par with the Joker. But trust me, he is nowhere close. All the film makers have achieved is to make a caricature of Kingsley. Ugh!!<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. looks stoned most of the time and I wonder whether he really believed in the storyline. At the end credits there is a voice-over of RDJ which hints that 'He is very much the Iron man'....is this a hint for part 4? I shudder at the thought.<br/><br/>Somebody really needs to rework this franchise."
"freemantle_uk","8","39","82","1 May 2013"," Shane Black hits the Mark
","Phase One of the Marvel Universe Cinematic was a massive success for Marvel Studios, leading to a Billion Dollar film, The Avengers. Now Marvel has a new test for Phase Two, starting with Iron Man 3, with new blood being brought in the form writer/director Shane Black, who manages to import his comedy style to the comic book genre.<br/><br/>It has been months since the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions. The result is he makes a suit that he can control with his mind. As this is going on, America is suffering from a new wave of attacks from a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), using explosives that seemingly have no traceable parts, forcing the American government to rebrand War Machine to The Iron Patriot. Even worst Stark past comes back to haunt him as a man he stubbed in 1999, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) creates a revolutionary bio-tech technology that could be the next leap for humanity, healing people with ease. But a side effect is it turns people into living weapons. When The Mandarin forces attack Stark's home, Stark is only left with one damaged prototype suit with little power and he has to use all his knowledge and skill to find out what The Mandarin and Killian are up as they attack Stark's loved ones as well as face up to his past.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 does feel very much like a Shane Black film, having his trademark style of dialogue and humour and uses a Christmas setting. It is to the point that Iron Man 3 becomes more a Black film then a Marvel film and a little bit like the Batman Returns of Marvel film with its focus on Stark and his resourcefulness and the villains and less about Stark in his suits. Stark does keep his trademark wit and intelligence and Downey does make the role his own, like he's done in the previous films. But the other characters also get a fair share of the comedy.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is Black's second film as director and he shows a great confidence behind the camera. He keeps the Marvel look and style, while still managing to make a film that is completely his own film and proves he can handle the special effects and action set pieces. Some of the fist fights and close quarter action were edited a too quickly, but that is made up for by the variety of action, particularly the final battle with the multiple Iron Man suits. Iron Man has very different threat to what he has had in the past, biologically altered super-heated people which have strength and the ability to melt metal: it is certainly different to men in iron suits and there are more menacing because of it. It also serves as a way to expand the type of sci-fi the Iron Man series can explore. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts also has a few moments where she gets to be a badass. On the action front, Iron Man 3 is the best in the series so far.<br/><br/>The trailers for Iron Man 3 made it out to be a very serious, darker affair, to the point that I personally nicknamed it ""The Iron Man Rises"". But it was a bait and switch and Iron Man 3 is a very humorous film throughout, having plenty of witty lines and well timed visual jokes. Black does a fine job at balancing out the comedy with the darker and serious scenes and elements, skills that Black developed since his early writing days, which makes for a fun blockbuster experience.<br/><br/>The biggest controversy that Iron Man 3 has to offer is the portrayal of Iron Man's arch nemesis The Mandarin. Of course he was not going to be the ""Fu Manchu"" stereotype that he was in the comics and international politics (as well as film markets) have changed, so changes had to be made: but Black's does take it to extremes as he puts his own spin on the character. Some may call it a clever postmodern twist, subverting conventions about villains and their portrayal in Hollywood film, others will call it a betrayal of one of Marvels most famous villains.<br/><br/>Because of the change in world politics since Iron Man was first created and the theme about the War of Terror was used in the first film Iron Man. The War of Terror theme has been brought back, The Mandarin acting like an Osama bin Laden like figure but Black and Marvel look at the hypocrisy of terrorist leaders who hides behind their 'ideals' whilst living in comfort and how they would use anything to try to morally justify their actions.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a fine additional the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a solid follow up The Avengers. It is stronger then the previous entry in the Iron Man series which was too reliant on comedy and very character heavy. Shane Black does bring a fresh approach for the series and once again, Marvel Studios has begun the Summer blockbuster for 2013 on the right track.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

Why the villain has no contigency plan for the case of ANY of his plans failing - and they fail the entire movie); 9 - Stark READS A FULL REPORT WHILE DRIVING!!! 10 - Patty the daytime hooker has a more detailed report than the military - yeah, because that didn't fit the pattern, right... (Rhodes declares to Tony they have no clue of what is going on, while the mother of a presumed bomber has a full report with detailed info?) 11 - EXTREMIS MAKES NO SENSE (It regenerates people's injuries...

"Ibuk","5","38","80","25 April 2013"," All in all a bitter disappointment
","I haven't reviewed something on IMDb for quite a while but after seeing Iron Man 3 today I felt compelled to express my thoughts on it. First of all let me say that this is my first 2013 release that I've seen. I really liked Iron Man and also quite liked Iron Man 2 so I was quite looking forward to seeing the third instalment. This is the first Iron Man movie Jonathan Favreau didn't direct, I really feel that if he had decided to direct the third instalment we would have been given a better movie than this debacle. All in all I frankly thought it was positively dire on all levels. The returning cast members I felt weren't really up to scratch. Special mention to Paltrow who I've always felt was badly miscast as Pepper Potts. The villains I thought were incredibly poor in this one. I really felt there was no meat to their characters whatsoever and no special character trait that would make them awesome villains. Pearce I thought was disappointing but the biggest disappointment was from Ben Kingsley. He basically did what he's been doing for years, pimping himself for Hollywood in substandard movies in insignificant roles that do nothing for his career. To sum my thoughts in one sentence I just felt it lacked the emotional power of the previous Iron Man movies, I didn't really care for any of the characters. <br/><br/>Without giving too much away the one thing that surprised me was the conclusion. I can only hope that my next cinema experience is better than this one, although it wouldn't have to do very much to surpass it. All in all a very bitter disappointment. My rating for Iron Man 3: 5.5/10"
"grizzleyturn","Null","33","69","19 April 2013"," Iron Man 3 delivers in every way possible.
","The makers of Iron Man 3 used Avengers as a springboard and focused solely on Tony Stark's world. In that context, they held nothing back! They delivered everything and to my surprise, a lot of it I did not expect. How many third films can you say that about? They dared to forge a new direction for a lead character that's been a pure hit in three films, including Avengers. (The scene after the house attack that had him crashing states away and interacting with that kid who doesn't really relate to him as anything but Iron Man was special!) So, kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Hall, Pearce, Kingsley and especially Shane Black! What a film! Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic ""down time"" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 delivers in every way possible above and beyond the popcorn fun you'd expect. There's no doubt that positive word of mouth will again carry another Avengers related film because this was as much fun and as well done as any Marvel film and that includes the big dog Avengers."
"AfterBuzz","Null","38","81","20 April 2013"," Just A Great Movie! Delivers Depth Of Emotion And Tremendous Fun
","Yeah, he can still fly!!!!!! There's no doubt, IM3 is one of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory and certainly one of the better number three films in a franchise. This movie picks up from Avengers and shifts gears in such a great way. Its depth of emotion and character combined with tremendous fun means this could very well be the best solo character comic book movie ever produced. Yes, I know that's saying a lot these days in an era where hero films are all over the place and especially when multiple sequels often struggle. That's exactly why it's worth the effort to write this review. People need to know that they need not be afraid of the number three because this movie is superb in every way and tops even the original Iron Man. The finale here may be the best action scene of the year and the story points that lead to it are handled exquisitely. I'm so glad Marvel learned from the last two films in that regard. The ending battles in both Iron Man movies should have been longer. Here, the whole third act is intense and completely compelling without crossing in to video game action type territory.<br/><br/>Overall, I simply adored everything about this movie. I did enjoy the original Iron Man a ton because it was refreshing and new. What's amazing is that they managed to almost re-invent the character here and deliver something fresh again. I honestly wasn't expecting that to be the case. I would have been happy with more of the same but this is actually better. Kudos to everyone who made this film for pulling that off."

","This movie is an obvious attempt at making some quick coin off of a successful franchise. I'm not sure it's even worth the $1 rental at Redbox. Seriously, if you didn't see this one movie in the entire Avengers franchise, you probably wouldn't miss it at all.<br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes, I knew it was a bomb. But I held out for that little clip after the credits because usually they are pretty cool. Trust me, the 2 hours of garbage movie are not worth wading through for the miserable clip at the end.<br/><br/>I stayed for the entire movie because I wanted very badly to think it would get better. It never did. It just got worse. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because there were probably 4 funny quips from RDJ in the movie that might have been worthy of half a star each."

","Oh man... this is so good in an unfamiliar way. It has rekindled the spark of a teenager trapped in the shell of a cynical adult movie goer.<br/><br/>In a race that began in 2008 to be crowned Hollywood's Coolest and Most Awesome Superhero Movie, the score is now 3-1 with Iron Man on a two- point lead. <br/><br/>The screenplay, co-written between Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) and Drew Pearce is cleverly penned and packs the right punch for an action movie. By drumming up the significance of Tony Stark's development from previous films (The Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2) without losing grip of dramatic unity as a whole; Shane Black (also the film's director) conceptualized a heroically simple, winning formula.<br/><br/>Another satisfying aspect of Iron Man 3 (and this converts to audience payoff at the end of 130 minutes), is the sweet simple fact that narrative does not detain viewers with unnecessary exposition and scenes. The big bad guys waste no time playing mind-games for the sake of delaying a final showdown, thus one-upping other blockbusters where it counts. Ergo, no shortchanging and an effortlessly fluid plot.<br/><br/>Things kick off with a flashback to 1999 during pre-Iron Man days, establishing Tony Stark's first meeting with future adversary — a then crippled scientist named Aldrich Killian. Desperate for resources from Stark Industries to develop experimental virus ""Extremis"" (yet turned away so unceremoniously), sets off rising malevolence from Killian (played by the unforgettable Guy Pearce, even more loathsome here than when he was hateful Charlie Rakes in Lawless). There's also brazen, immediate threat from a grim terrorist leader (Ben Kingsley's prowess and versatility in full glory here as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery) — bent on blowing up America at whatever cost necessary. And for what it's worth, I like the spin on Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) damsel-in-distress anticipated — compelling touch to an otherwise archetypal character.<br/><br/>To further inject urgency in the conflict, Tony Stark wrestles with the aftermath of New York (from The Avengers) and taunts The Mandarin on national TV, further exacerbating his wrath. A strike against Stark's mansion hatches a loosely comedic, coming-of-age with 10 year old Harley — it is here that leading man Robert Downey Jr. ingratiates himself as one of the best personality actors in Hollywood — incensed with moral rage at the right moments, oozing unsentimental smooth in others.<br/><br/>I had fun spotting flashes of nostalgia in favorite superhero moments (Spiderman, Superman, Batman and even Transformers) throughout the show as well, and still can't believe they destroyed a fine looking limited edition Dora the Explorer digital watch. Nor of the fact that a highly entertaining movie just ended. What a generous, high-octane hell of a ride.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"

The entire marvel universe to draw inspiration from, an all in all it ends up like a hollow effort. They must of handed this to someone that didn't had the knowledge of marvel universe. It's a painful experience to bare witness of the fact that the director didn't know what to make with the characters...Paltrow is a fluke, not the right cast for this character, and whats up with her getting so much screen time?? coherent, and the villains...And the villains?! Whats up with them? Zero depth in their purpose and drive...And the mandarin character?? so many dollars to destroy an epic marvel character and stripping it from its essence.

","Best thing first, apart from the performance of Robert D. Jr. which is top notch and the s.effects, watching this movie just made me feel how good is the Nolan's trilogy on Batman . Its the writing the passion of the director that lacks in IM3. Initially the film promises but develops into an average affair with no depth and punch. Ben kingsley looked perfection personified in his portrait as the terrorist image, which was later goofed up in plot twist. The air force one diving scene for example was brilliantly picturised but lacked the impact. A problem with current action movies is fast skipping of frames during action sequences(also with transformers series). For some time now, with movies like the avengers(a poor 3 scene flick!) and IM3 the studios are just gonna make huge money. kiddos to them."

Newsflash, they didn't other than a few panic attacks that amount to nothing, it just seem crow-barred in, so you know, we the audience can see he's struggling with previous events -_- The Villain The Mandarin was nothing more than a Joke and nothing as he should be or what he was meant to be like (The mystic! Which would have been more interesting). Thats actually possible too, making a strange character interesting, look what they did with Bane in DKR. They could have done that with Mandarin, I really did not like Guy Pierce as the Villain. At all, he was boring, annoying and just unsatisfying, he's not someone I'm going to remember for an incredible performance or anything remotely quotable. He just lacked a decent agenda.<br/><br/>It was a big come down after the Avengers. It risked nothing and was nothing more to cash in to the Tidal wave Avengers caused, I was expecting something interesting something that would blow me away, nothing in this film moved me, you could see everything coming aside the crap twist with Mandarin.<br/><br/>When I first see the trailer, I thought it was going to be a dark story, something that was going to be deep and powerful and not just 'another sequel' I wanted to love this film, but I just found it poor, there was NO real motivation in the plot, would have been more interesting if Pepper was the one in the Coma fighting for her life rather than some dumb ass security guard just so they could do a gag about downtown abbey at the end.<br/><br/>Also they did an entire scene that was probably the best part of the film that never frocking happened and I HATE S*** LIKE THAT! It's like a slap in the face and p****** me off! It was one of the best scenes and possibly the best part of the film and it was ruined.<br/><br/>The entire fight scene at the end was turd, It was like a 5 minute toy advert! Look at all these cool suits to collect kids! Which apparently we are led to believe he built all of them because he couldn't sleep, but these same suits couldn't help during the initial attack because they clearly needed something big for the finale. I thought the film was called 'Iron MAN' not 'Iron MEN'.<br/><br/>Now I didn't expect this to be on the same Level as the Avengers, but I expected it to be good as a individual super hero film, The Dark knight Rises came out after the Avengers and did 'it' right, but this, this should have been, could have been so much more. The plot was just messy, scenes felt drawn/padded out (The part where Stark is tied to the table and they use the same gag several times pf-ff) However like half the script and dialog in the movie, it's nothing more than a 'Joke' and As Banner says after the credits 'You lost me right after the Elevator' It's almost as if they knew.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this to Iron Man fans? No.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this to people who just want to see Robert Downey JR dally around for 2 hours? Knock ya self out.<br/><br/>Oh, and Joss Whedon, reportedly said after watching Iron Man 3, ""How do I follow that"" My advice Joss, do the bloody opposite."

","Unfortunately IM3 was not as good as the previous movies of the trilogy. Its more an Audi advertisement, with a very weak scenario. I think its a very good movie for little children (ages 11-15) but for grown people who are old Marvel and DC fans, its not good... RDJ on the other hand is doing what he does best. His acting is funny and saves the movie sometimes. However having panic attacks wasn't so convincing Mr RDJ. About the IM suits, lets say that they are too many and very easily destroyed. Oh you charge IM suits? I thought that the arc reactor supplied the power, not a car battery... disappointing at least. And RDJs only friend Jarvis was uncharged also OMG! Please Hollywood be more creative! We love Iron Man, don't create lame scenario just to end the trilogy with a happy ending. I saw the movie at my local theater and I was not pleased...

"marc5477","2","17","33","19 May 2013"," I saw it yesterday and already forgot what it was about...
","Maybe I was just not in the mood for a brainless movie, or maybe the movie was significantly less interesting than average movies, but I just didn't like it. It had no substance. No interesting characters. No interesting plot. It was just scene 1, scene 2, scene 3 etc etc without anything really make me care or even want to know what will happen next. It was... boring. Now honestly, despite being a big comic fan, I never particularly cared for Iron Man as a character. I found him uninspired and prototypical. He wasn't bad, but he was always boring in comics, and now in movie. I definitely enjoyed the 1st Iron Man more than the 3rd but the 2nd and 3rd were snore fests and all the tech and actions didn't help one bit which is a double whammy because I am also a huge sci-fi fan on top of loving comics but I just couldn't enjoy this movie. Again I cant put my finger on it, but something was just off. It was not fun."
"etjames97","4","17","33","1 May 2013"," Disappointing
","It is safe to say that the Iron Man franchise has worsened through each film... this film was truly awful and by far the worst one. The previous two films were solid parts of Marvel's phase 1, but this monstrosity is a weak start to Marvel's phase 2.<br/><br/>The film started off okay, exploring Stark's inner troubles and the increasing disturbances of the mysterious terrorist, The Mandarin. Ever since the implications of The Ten Rings I've been looking forward to The Mandarin appearing in one of the films, as he is Iron Man's arch-nemesis. Even though he looked nothing like The Mandarin, I did enjoy Kingsley's portrayal in the first act of the film, but the character was completely destroyed half-way through. The Mandarin was made up to be a fake and it utterly wasted the character and Kingsley's acting skill. Instead Guy Pearce became The Mandarin and it finalised my thoughts on how they ruined such an interesting character. The reasons behind Tony's capture could have been explored further, but the Ten Rings just became a wasted concept.<br/><br/>The dullness of the Extremis story didn't help the film at all. Extremis allowed plot holes to open, revealing weaknesses and mistakes as it did so. The Extremis soldiers felt just too familiar resulting in forgettable fight scenes, in particular the last battle scene. The uninspired Aldrich Killian was just the same as the previous villains, wanting revenge and power. Plus the mundanely boring Maya Hansen was just an extra character that added nothing, except the excuse for another Extremis scientist other than Killian.<br/><br/>Another disappointing factor was the suit time. Tony Stark was in the suit about three times throughout the film, meaning there was less Iron Man heroics. I felt Tony Stark was weak in this film. He didn't even manage to defeat the villain. It was up to Pepper, who was probably in the suit more than he was. And even when the suit was flying around, I was unsure about whether he was actually in it because of his new unexplained gadgets. This made me feel cheated out of seeing a proper Iron Man film where Stark is out on the field actually bothering to save people. To me, the lazy plot development just reflected onto Tony Stark.<br/><br/>But to be fair, this film does have parts that are worth watching. The relationship between Rhodes and Stark was very strong and consistent throughout the film, but Rhodes' screen time was minimal so their interactions were limited. I also liked the relationship between Stark and Harley as it showed a side to Tony that hasn't been explored in the previous films, a more human side that is forced to live with civilians that know him as Iron Man.<br/><br/>The film was unambitious and the excessive jokes made it into something it wasn't meant to be, where The Mandarin played the laughing stock. This film has also relied too much on the success of The Avengers, with Shane Black under thinking every part of the film whilst not realising how good it could have been even with all the unanswered material he had. Instead, the third film was a mess where the excitement from the previous two had been sucked away and replaced with an everyday superhero movie with no sense of danger or anticipation. Fans might be disappointed and general movie-goers will be entertained, but as a fan I feel there is no hope for an Iron Man resurrection.<br/><br/>I give it a 4 out of 10 because it deserves no more and no less. It does have moments that happily differ from the other two, but there are just too many brainless errors for it to live up to the others."
"ticket_for_one","4","17","33","1 May 2013"," The Iron Man 3 comedy show
","Jon Favreau directed the first two instalments and although second film wasn't as well received as the first, there were no continuity issues, because the themes and tone in both films were the same. For Iron Man 3, Shane (Lethal Weapon) Black is behind the camera. When it was first announced he would be helming this, the overall consensus was that he would do better job than Favreau did with the second film. I like Shane Black and I think his screenplay work for the Lethal Weapon series and Last BoyScout help define the action genre. There's also Monster Squad, which happens to be a personal favourite of mine. But with Iron Man 3, he's seriously dropped the ball. Apart from being the one of the most hyped up, marketed movies to come out this year. It's also one of the worst superhero movies I've seen. So two categories, GOOD AND BADhere goes!<br/><br/>THE GOOD<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is great as always. He continues to show us that this role was tailor made for him. This is much more of a Tony Stark movie than it is an Iron Man movie. Stark going through a rough time after battling Loki and the Chitauri warriors with the Avengers, starts experiencing nightmares and anxiety attacks and for the first time we see Stark vulnerable, questioning whether or not he can continue as Iron Man. Downey Jr handles this side of Stark's character very well, and at the same time still manages to use Shane Black's script, with a dash of RDJ improv and come up with some hilarious one liners.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt his best performance as Iron Man/Tony Stark. How do his supporting cast members do? Well with the exception of Paul Bettany, who plays his faithful computerised butler Jarvis, everyone else is found wanting. No really, they either look bored or don't say much at all. The set pieces are incredibly well done and the finale at the end is by far the best of the series. There are loads of visual pyrotechnics and great direction from Black, who does a solid job capturing the muscular set pieces on display.<br/><br/>THE BAD<br/><br/>The main antagonist played by Guy Pearce is the worst villain of the series. At the start of the film, Tony Stark rejects his idea for a nightcap with Rebecca Hall. Another talented actress wasted in this mess of a film. Anyway, the rejection fuels his passion to use everything he has to get back at Stark years later.<br/><br/>So over the years he turns from science nerd to suave megalomaniac, making the death of Iron Man and Tony Stark his number one goal. OK great, but as a villain he was terrible. There was nothing remotely special about him and as bad as Sam Rockwell was in the 2nd film, Guy Pearce (who is an amazing actor) had no real presence as the films antagonist. James Badge Dale who played his main henchman, didn't have much to say but his look alone was scary enough to suggest that he would've made for a better villain than Pearce.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow, just tag along and William Sadler, who I haven't seen for years plays a simple President of the United States. The actual Extremis story that derives from the comic book doesn't translate well into film and a lot of the scenes with Tony Stark trying to find himself in some hick town in Tennessee are long and boring. However, the banter between him and the orphaned kid (Ty Simpkins) who helps Stark find his way, was very good and kept me entertained before the eventual finale.<br/><br/>THE MANDARIN! The hype surrounding who would play this iconic character, kept fans on edge for months. Ben Kingsley was confirmed and we all rejoiced hearing that the same man who played Don Logan in Sexy Beast and The Hood in Thunderbirds would play the Mandarin. Sounded like a great idea at the time, but his inclusion is primarily the reason why this film, in my eyes, is such a failure.<br/><br/>No spoilers here. Let's just say that everything you know of the Mandarin, doesn't even see the light of day in Iron Man 3. Of course we're never going to see Fing Fam Foom or the 10 rings of power he possesses in the comics. But the least they could've done was make him look formidable or terrifying. What we get is Ben Kingsley collecting a pay cheque and ruining one of the most hyped films of 2013 with a truly shocking performance.<br/><br/>The comedic tone of the film just doesn't sit right. And Black's script, as funny as it is at times feels like it belongs in a different film. Oh and did I mention, minus the excellent set pieces, it is a complete and utter bore fest. What a terrible way to end a trilogy! But I guess any Marvel film following on from the behemoth that was the Avengers had a tough act to follow. Continuity wise, it runs well with the Avengers time line, hopefully anchoring Thor 2, Capt. America 2 which will follow behind the much anticipated Guardians of the Galaxy. See I know my stuff. I just hope I'm able to banish the memories of this load of garbage before then.<br/><br/>Netflix reserve list? Watch this at your local and let me know me know what you think.<br/><br/>I think it's this year's Transformers 2.<br/><br/>ticket-for-one.com"

","It didn't deliver on full fronts from what I was expecting. But it did have some great moments too. Iron Man 3 takes on a different tangent from what one would expect going in to watch the movie, which itself is the highlight. But at the same time it lacked on many fronts on a whole. The movie was more about Tony Stark than Iron Man especially portraying his vulnerable emotional side, left me less like watching a superhero movie. From a super-hero point of view it was a let down (although there was one good action sequence towards the end with all the voice recognition metal suits). I felt Guy Pearce had the stronger role in the movie than Stark. The Mandarin twist was a surprise and the teaser sort of took away some intensity from the movie. Gwyneth also had a good role which was good to see. And a special mention about Ben Kingsley - his acting was really great in it!! <br/><br/>Overall: It didn't leave me excited as the 1st part did. It was more funnier than intense. <br/><br/>Overall 6.7/10"

(i don't want to talk about because of the spoiler alert) Ben Kingsley was ""perfect"" his performance was amazing, and i haven't read the comics, so as to the twist i was actually surprised This movie tried to be more of Nolan feel then previous, (it tried to tame on being more real) which it failed. It still posses its laugh component, and probably more funnier then the second iron man. the only real issue for me was the bad guys abilities, and the way the fought (once you watch it you will get it) but it was still enjoyable movie. it has its usual cool new gadgets, lots of laugh, visually spectacular, and full of action. i give it 7.5/10"

","Movies: Some people love them and discuss them, some people just watch and care little about them. In the end this makes a huge difference to a movie review. Iron Man 3 is a movie for those who don't really care.<br/><br/>If you love the character of Iron Man, other then being just something else to watch, there is little else to be found here. In many respects its like watching Star Wars: Episodes 1-3 or The Hobbit. It's dressed in a pretty package but there is no heart or longevity in the gift. The fact that the series may wrap up with this film leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, much like the disappointing The Dark Knight Rises. Also, a message for Disney: if you water down important adult story lines, in favor of the mass market, a little thing called originality and integrity is what will be lost in the long run."

He can withstand tank attack, hit by a supersonic jet, Thor hammer and thunder but his armor cannot withstand his girlfriend punch of 3,000 Celsius. What is he doing dumbing around after Extremis touched him? They paralyze him? He is in an armor for god sake. This is a total insult to Iron Man suit... <br/><br/>His weaponry are also too weak in this movie, he cannot punch a guy flying through air like what he did in his first movie, his replusor can't blow a guy's head off and his suit can be recharged without the need of his arc reactor.<br/><br/>On the bright side, if you doesn't factor in that this is an Iron Man movie related to the previous 2 movies, it provide quite an entertaining show with Tony Stark try to work his way out of trouble given all the limitations he is facing.

Everyone else has said it all. Great actors in a poor script, botched continuity and no relation to the epic history of the marvel heroes we grew up with.<br/><br/>I can't believe I sat through to the very end of the credits to watch the end trailer. I was really hoping/expecting/praying that the Ben Kingsley character would don his power rings and reveal he was the true Mandarin, escape custody and begin summoning his death squads back to him (which is what I thought these ""fire"" people were at first). That would've been a killer plot twist that ""might"" have made this movie worth watching and been a good setup for IM #4.<br/><br/>PS to one reviewer: Tony getting the shrapnel out doesn't stop him from being iron man. The miniature Arc Reactor was a power source to keep the electromagnet running to keep the shrapnel from entering his heart, and also powers the suit. Now, it just powers the suit. Even in the comics, the issue of Tony's weak heart eventually went away.<br/><br/>I could've/should've waited for this to come out on Redbox....I took my kids and blew way too much money for this...Marvel owes me that money back - just like FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer!"

","Less of a superhero movie than a Tony Stark show in an action comedy mode, IRON MAN 3 is energetic but suffers from unnecessarily bloated screenplay while the comedy element borderlines into near parody.<br/><br/>After the record-shattering (box office, that is) of THE AVENGERS last summer, I'm sure a lot of fans are eager to see how Marvel is going to move on with their Phase Two project -- starting with the highly-anticipated IRON MAN 3. The good news is, IRON MAN 3 is a minor improvement over the tepid IRON MAN 2 (2010). Unfortunately, just about everything in IRON MAN 3 is an overkill -- the plot is heavy-handed and the humor is too broad while the superhero element is surprisingly a bit too grounded for its own good (you know it when you see it).<br/><br/>Director Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau from the first two IRON MAN movies) does a credible job handling his first big-budget Hollywood movie. He knows how to stage a few exciting action sequences as well as delivering his trademark of witty one-liners. You can say IRON MAN 3 is the funniest of all three movies and this is especially made possible by the ever-charismatic Robert Downey Jr. As the ego-centric and now-anxious Tony Stark, Downey Jr. is often funny yet engaging enough to root for his character. I must say this is the best incarnation of Tony Stark I've ever seen so far. One surprising element that I never thought possible is how Black delivers a great buddy chemistry between Tony Stark and Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle). They immediately reminded me of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON series (where Black used to write the first two installments). That's not all, Downey Jr. also has a brief but memorable buddy moment with the talented Ty Simpkins who plays Harley during the Tennessee scene.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Shane Black is more interested to feature more Tony Stark in person than the Iron Man itself. On the surface, it's a bold reinterpretation from the usual IRON MAN movie but I'm sure a lot of fans and moviegoers alike are expecting an IRON MAN movie, not a Tony Stark movie. Then there's the radical change of the bloated plot written by Drew Pearce and Shane Black himself. Apart from trying too hard to cram a lot of subgenre into a 130-minute length, I was particularly shocked to find the surprise twist halfway through. Let's just say it's a total cop-out the way how they treated a certain character in this movie. As for the two featured villains, Ben Kingsley's The Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian are sadly unmemorable. Even the post-credits scene this time around, let's just say, doesn't get you excited all over the place.<br/><br/>Overall, IRON MAN 3 is a middling effort and it's quite sad to see Shane Black fails to capitalize the full potential of a superhero genre.<br/><br/>http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/iron-man-3-2013.html"

Surely the screenplay is still OK and there are some not-expecting moments in the movie. And finally the movie can't be bad having Paul Bettany just for voice-role! The actor's squad is cool in deed and they did a great job playing roles and mixing jokes with quality stunts.

"The_Celluloid_Sage","6","2","2","6 April 2020"," Serious let down
","Writer and screenplay supremo Shane Black (lethal weapon, Last Action Hero) helms the third installment after Jon Favreau could not agree terms and had a falling out with Marvel. This is actually only his second directorial feature after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, so not terribly experienced in that department but as a script writer he certainly has some great credentials and credits to his name.<br/><br/>We start in nineteen ninety-nine in switzerland, Tony Stark (Downey Jr. in a more subdued role this time around) gives us a brief monologue of his past where he meets Aldrich Killian (a good Guy Pearce) and how is actions subsequently created a monster without him ever realising or knowing. we also meet Maya Hanson (The Prestige) who is a gentic botanists who is close to a breakthrough with cellular regeneration.<br/><br/>For the rest of the film we follow Tony who has developed severe anxiety issues while churning out new Iron Man suits left, right and center. His latest suit, the Mark 42 provides the majority of the laughs in the third film and congratulations are in order to give a suit some semblence of 'character' and almost make it life-like in itself. Unfortunately this is where most of the humour is left as this is a very different film to the first two offerings we got.<br/><br/>We also get a lot more story in this one too, with really only two big action scenes to speak of. I do have to admit that at times this does drag out somewhat and meanders around, never really seeming to have a direction or true focus. This is also a much more personal film regarding Tony and those around him. There are some real poignant moments and it almost all seems more of a goodbye and farwell film than anything else.<br/><br/>As for characters, Happy (Favreau) is back and is ridiculous as ever. He has a more prominent role this time but it is limited to the start of the film. He may not have been directing the third instalment but it is good to see his character as he is always likeable. The Mandarin himself is an interesting concept as a terrorist wanting to wreak devestation on america but takes far too long to really get to him and just starts to becomes annoying eventually. Kingsley though is brilliant as always in his role.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle as Rohdes takes a ratrher large comfy back seat until the final act and william Sadler as the President is very much wasted, his part really could have gone to anyone and it would not have made much difference. Pepper (Paltrow) also has much less to do though they somewhat redeem that in the final explosive scene by literally turning her into a semi-God capable of kicking even Tony's ass.<br/><br/>I also persoinally didn't feel that turning the film into a kid family movie half way through worked either. I can see why it was done but really, there could have been a hundred other ways of making the same point and message. It just threw me out for a while and I think Black missed a beat there in all honesty. That pretty much sums up this third Iron Man film though, while not a bad film it never really reaches the heights of the first two films.<br/><br/>The soundtrack from the first two films is also missing and altogether this just feels and looks like a different beast. The two big action scenes are very well done (especially the assault on Tony's house) but they are perhaps too few and far between. The quich wit and one-liners are also largely missing and what there is, is certainly not to the quality of the previous films.<br/><br/>Overall this is an odd film in the Iron Man and Marvel franchise. After a couple of near misses with the Hulk and Captain America the films were getting more solid, culminating in The Avengers. With this, they appear to have taken a step backwards again. Not a bad film but rather perhaps a different film than we were maybe expecting from Marvel given the style and substance of the first iron Man films.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Sage's Rating: 6/10"

Having said that, it was a small price to pay as I totally enjoyed this new take on the Iron Man series and definitely felt entertained the whole time.<br/><br/>To say as some have said, that there was little humor in this, that's the part I don't quite get. I found it very funny throughout and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was still clever, irreverent and just plain hilarious in his dialog and I found myself giggling and laughing sometimes outright. <br/><br/>One particularly funny scene is when he's talking to super fan Gary in his van. Gary who says he's patterned his whole look after Tony, shows him a tattoo on his arm of a man. Tony says, ""Uh.. A Hispanic Scott Baio?"" LOL! Then says, ""Oh I'm sorry is that me?"" Gary says yeah and says ""I had them do it off of a doll that I made."" LMAO! 
Not only that, even that bad guys had a few funny lines. As Tony, two thirds of the way through the movie corners one bad guy from up on a balcony, the guy sticks his arms up in the air, drops his weapon and says, ""Honestly? I hate working here, they are so weird!"" LOL! (Tony doesn't shoot him and the guy slips away.)<br/><br/>Plus I was mesmerized by the plot and sequence of events from the time I started watching until the end of the movie. It was interesting seeing Tony from a new perspective. The fact that he loses his home and is basically homeless and presumed dead by the majority of the world and oh yeah, then there's Pepper who he's separated from and after all that, he's suffering anxiety or panic attacks, Not to mention he has to fight the bad guys without his suit at various points through over half the movie. With everything that's going on he never falters for very long, he just picks himself up and keeps moving forward.<br/><br/>I thought it was a great movie, Great acting, Ben Kingsley in particular was superb as was Robert Downey Jr. There was corruption in high places as well which is no big surprise, with lots of drama, yet also containing a lot of humorous moments. Exciting action and phenomenal special effects round everything out. In one scene near the end of the movie it spectacular as Tony does an air rescue. I've never seen that in any movie before.<br/><br/>So this may not have been as great as the first Iron Man but it's very close and it definitely held it's own. I enjoyed it start to finish."
"yaxleycratler","8","2","2","8 August 2018"," Better than the last and almost as good as the first!!
","Not bad at all. Tony is still dealing with the effects of the Manhattan battle through PTSD and fights it throughout the movie like his own personal demon. The bad guys exploding with Extremis I thought was kind of cool, but they only exploded when necessary to advance the plot, if they a had done that to Tony whenever they saw him there would be no movie. Maya Hansen was a useless character throughout the movie. The Mandarin was super cool up until he was some British actor, I thought it was kind of disappointing, but then Killian was the Mandarin just didn't make sense. Guy Pearce was also a good villain despite what they made him into. The scene where Tony saved everyone from falling out of the plane was cool and the ending fight scene with all the Iron Man suits was pure awesomeness. I liked the movie a lot despite some of its problems, it is still a worthy movie."

","Very misleading movie that tarnishes iron man. The first was a really tight, well made simple film that actually had a lot of heart, this is a meaningless overcomplicated, under boiled mess. Ben Kingsley is the best thing in this and his character, literally, is a joke. Perfect example of a bad sequel, the plot was non existent. This whole 'marvel' thing is now getting a bit out of hand...<br/><br/>I don't really know what to say, I'm obliged to write some more, so here goes...This film is the superhero equivalent of 'transformers, revenge of the fallen, not just in terms of sheer ineptitude but also script. 'The Mandarin' is an amazing character, totally ruined here, right thats ten lines, don't watch this movie, xx"

","While RDJ, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce do a good job with their performances they are tied to a luck lustre script.<br/><br/>The plot is just lame and the action scenes are rubbish. <br/><br/>As others have noted I'm not sure why Iron Man's armour kept on falling to pieces versus the unconvincing villains he was facing when it did quite well against Thor and alien marauders.<br/><br/>And what was the point of introducing the Iron Patriot armour? I sincerely hope Rhodie isn't going to replace Iron Man in Avengers 2 because his character is poorly developed and pretty useless. <br/><br/>Oh and thanks for destroying Iron Man's greatest foe The Mandarin. MARVEL what were you thinking? I had thought that IM3 might have introduced the infinity gems which would have set up a confrontation with Thanos in Avengers 2...but obviously not. <br/><br/>Also an opportunity lost to introduce a new female character who could join the Avengers...perhaps Carol Danvers? Iron Man taking on the Kree/Skrulls would definitely have been better than the boring unconvincing villains in this offering. <br/><br/>I am presuming this is the end of the IM franchise and probably just as well if this is the best they can come up with. Nobody is expecting a superhero movie script to rival MacBeth but this was just poor. I hope MARVEL haven't fallen into their reoccurring trap of going for quantity over quality and the next Thor movie is a worthy sequel... and surely Cpt. America Winter Soldier couldn't be any worse than the first one?"

"slicedbread117","7","16","32","26 August 2013"," Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Kicks Off With a Suitable Entry.
","In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice in this movie is that it's moving in a different direction than the previous Iron Man films, and this is largely due to a new director at the helm. While Jon Favreau was in the chair for the first two movies, and continues is role as Happy Hogan, Shane Black was chosen to direct the third entry in the beloved Iron Man series. The movie takes a less grounded tone, and while many viewers will enjoy the direction that Black as taken the series, it's safe to say that a majority of the hardcore comic book reading audience will fail to enjoy the movie in the same way.<br/><br/>Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and they hit the film pretty hard. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movie's head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly), is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man, and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released, I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie presents; where are the rest of the guys? <br/><br/>Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun antagonist. But this all changes with a plot twist that completely leaves your face buried in your hands. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and it's hard to take seriously. There are other minor issues such as pacing inconsistencies, but nothing else deprives the film like the aforementioned twist. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but luckily was entertaining enough to prevent the entire film from nosediving. <br/><br/>With that all being said, the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. Tony Stark deals with his inner demons following the events of The Avengers, and this is an interesting part of the film, one that forces Tony to change his character and have you rooting for him to ovecome. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, almost too plentiful, but between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the horrible twist). <br/><br/>While the action is without a doubt the finest parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie. <br/><br/>To conclude, Iron Man 3 might not live up to Iron Man 1, but how many sequels do? Yes there are some huge plot holes but the seamless blend of entertaining action and comedy plus the fantastic acting save the movie from being a train wreck. Iron Man 3 is a solid and respectable entry in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe and it is currently the 4th highest grossing movie of ALL-TIME. Casual superhero movie fans will probably enjoy more than others, but even for the hardcore, Iron Man 3 delivers an entertaining movie that I wouldn't skip out on.<br/><br/>7/10"

That's it...SERIOUSLY, THAT'S ALL !!!!<br/><br/>Let's move to the bad things: EVERYTHING!!! E-VERY-THING!!! I'm gonna' start by saying that, the guy(s) who made and edited the trailer SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE DIRECTOR. Seriously, whoever made the trailer is a guy with vision.

","I am a huge super hero movie fan. I loved the Avengers, brilliant. This movie was very disappointing. To begin with, the trailers and posters were quite deceptive. I expected so much more. I like the idea of Tony suffering mentally from the events of the Avengers but this film did not explore them very well. Probably the most disappointing parts of the film was the Mandarin and the extremis virus. Very poorly done. The Mandarin is a fantastic character and enemy of Ironman. To say they wrecked things in this movie would be an understatement. <br/><br/>Ben Kingsley was brilliant as was Guy Pearce. I anticipated Guy Pearce's role to be much smaller but he was almost all through the movie. He is very good.<br/><br/>There is the expected comic relief from the Marvel movies and I laughed hard at times. Robert Downey Jr has excellent comedic timing and delivery. <br/><br/>I wish those responsible for this film didn't take so much license in interpreting the Ironman story. I think they may have wrecked it. I don't see how there can possibly be an Ironman character in future movies, be that Avengers part 2 or Ironman 4 etc despite the closing credits stating Tony Stark will return. He will probably return, just not as Ironman.<br/><br/>Marvel, I am unhappy. Please redeem yourselves with a brilliant Avengers 2."
"smn-678-48817","3","17","35","6 May 2013"," Pretty Bad
","I'm going to start off by saying that I was a huge fan of ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"" but this one really sank the series down. This was the ""Spider Man 3"" of the Iron Man series. First off, this movie is way longer than it needs to be in which I mean not only by actual length (130 min) but by plot structure. Where the previous two films were filled with humor, action and suspense, this one leaves you depressed and wanting more. This is by far the least humorous of the three and if anyone has seen the previous films, they would know that humor was essential to the success of these movies. The new director here tried to take a chance and ultimately failed by screwing up what was essentially a good formula for these movies. It almost seems unnatural that this movie takes itself so seriously when the others were fairly light-hearted. The direction of the other two films was great and there was no need for such a change-up in the series. Easily the biggest let down from a superhero movie since ""Spider Man 3""."
"3xHCCH","6","23","50","25 April 2013"," Too Much Hype Can Disappoint You
","First comment, the rating. In our country, this film is rated G. However, a scene that suggests a man's head was shot and the drugged prostitutes in a Miami mansion are hardly general patronage. This is PG-13 at best. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie. The hype and anticipation for this movie was incredible. The biggest chain of malls in this country had every single one of its movie theaters showing this film! Admittedly this made expectations for this movie to be as high as ""The Avengers"" last year. ""The Avengers"" made good on that hype, but ""Iron Man 3"" did not.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and his conflict with a mad scientist named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who has developed a powerful virus called Extremis who can give fiery powers to those who can withstand its painful incubation. At the same time, the President of the United States was abducted by a mad international terrorist who calls himself ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley). When the Stark cliffside mansion was destroyed, his love Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) was abducted and his Iron Man suit severely damaged, Stark has to rely on his own cunning, his good friend Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and geeky boy from Tennessee (Ty Simpkins), to control his panic attacks, get his armor fixed and flying, in order to save the President and save Pepper too.<br/><br/>The action sequences were all very masterfully executed. I enjoyed the unbelievable ""Barrel of Monkeys"" sequence in the sky among people sucked out of Air Force One. Of course, the explosive and fiery finale on the waterfront was really awesome, with all those powerful incandescent Extremis soldiers and all those Iron Man suits we see in the commercials. I just felt though that the talky sequences between these action scenes are too prolonged and could be boring even. I even felt that Ben Kingsley was undeservedly wasted in the role given him. The comedic one-liners were not too funny, but the physical comedy parts by Downey were much better and funnier.<br/><br/>I thought this film was 70% Stark, only 30% Iron Man. I felt this film was too long and could be edited to tighten the suspense and streamline the storytelling more. The ending sequence was nicely ambiguous. The extra scene after the very long closing credits was funny with a surprising cameo appearance, but it was not so exciting to suggest what the next Marvel film was all about. (Or does it?) Overall, ""Iron Man 3"" was just alright, but not really worth all the hype given it. Temper your expectations."

"dragonmysterious","6","12","23","27 April 2013"," Shane Black insulted the bad ass Mandarin.
","Because its an Iron Man film, I don't want to dishonor it. The first Iron Man film was incredibly well done. Its origins follow the comic very well. They referenced Mandarin here and there and set up the stage for the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. The trailers felt as if an epic fight between Iron Man and Mandarin would break out. I don't hate the film at all seriously. The script was very well done. From the start to the end, the script was pretty good, with comedic one- liners here and there. BUT halfway through, Shane Black decided to give us a kick in the balls. What was the point of all that hype with the trailers if we didn't even get an epic showdown between Iron Man and the Mandarin?<br/><br/>When Iron Man entered Mandarin's room, I was all ready. Ready for the epic battle between Iron Man and Mandarin. The fight that I've been waiting for ever since Iron Man 3 released its trailers. But the only fight I got was Shane Black giving me a kick in the balls. The beginning of the movie showed a bad ass Mandarin. I believe that Ben Kingsley would have been an awesome Mandarin.(As portrayed in the first half of the film). Mandarin is one of Iron Man's most formidable adversaries. Indeed, that twist was a smart one, but it should not have been in an Iron Man movie. I admitted that I laughed at that scene. (Not because I enjoyed it but because it was funny.)Throughout that scene, I was hoping that Mandarin was only putting up a scene and preparing to strike at Iron Man. I was extremely disappointed. I wanted an awesome Mandarin vs Iron Man fight scene. Seriously if they are gonna portray Mandarin but change every aspect of him, they might as well change his name to the British or something.I was really disappointed. All that Mandarin hype led up to nothing!<br/><br/>The Extremis was done interestingly. The plot focused more much on Tony than the suits. Iron Patriot was.. not really necessary in the film. It was basically just an upgraded War Machine suit. I thought Pepper would become Rescue but I guess not. However, there were some scenes which reminded me of other movies. (The airplane rescue scene reminded me of Bane's attack in the beginning The Dark Knight Rises). Also, the ending scene where Iron Man wanted a clean slate. (Just like Batman in TDKR) This will either lead to him changing his mind to appear in Avengers 2, or he gets replaced in Avengers 2. Shane Black tried to make things up by making Guy Pearce say ""I am the real Mandarin"" It didn't make me feel any better than I already felt. In the comics, Aldrich Killian is just a scientist and NOT the Mandarin. The Mandarin doesn't use Extremis, but uses his ten rings and his henchmen. He screwed up quite a bit there. One bad thing was that they didn't showcase the many suits that he had. When the suits started flying in, only a few prominent ones could be noticed. For example, they only showed the Hulkbuster armor charging forward for a ten seconds. I'll give it fifteen (cos I'm nice). I would love to see the Hulkbuster appear while Tony narrate the names of the suits. Though that might not be exactly possible cause he was busy fighting. So there were many suits with names and abilities that weren't introduced. And all of them got blown up to make fireworks. Quite a waste. However, I did like the action scenes. <br/><br/>I know it may not be fair for me to judge the whole movie based on the portrayal of one character, but what might have become the most epic scene in Iron Man history, or should I say Marvel history became a letdown to all Iron Man fans. I would much rather see a dark movie, without all the comedic elements and see the REAL merciless Mandarin in action against Iron Man. Why isn't comedy under one of Iron Man 3's genres? In conclusion, they should not have put Mandarin in the movie at all or at most, as deleted scenes. If they wanna make up for it, they should do Iron Man 4 where Mandarin breaks out of prison using his Ten Rings and explain that his scene in Iron Man 3 was actually a facade. That would be cool. If not, they really insulted the Mandarin."

"beefyegg","1","21","45","10 May 2013"," One of the biggest disappointments in film
","This film is no longer going to be known to myself as 'Iron Man 3', no. It shall from this day forth be known as the single biggest disappointment I have ever had the heartache of sitting through.<br/><br/>I thought Iron Man 2 was bad and after watching Iron Man 3, and deciding it was in fact worse than the previous film, I've decided to reevaluate my opinions of the Iron Man trilogy in general. Was the first Iron Man any good? I'm starting to think it wasn't and I just got myself caught up in the superhero craze.<br/><br/>But back to the matter at hand, anybody who tells you that this movie is anything other than bad is lying to you. It was atrocious on levels I can't even begin to explain. What Marvel have essentially tried to do here is recreate The Dark Knight Rises, however they've executed it with about as much skill as a dog at a snooker table. Let's evaluate the similarities.<br/><br/>1. Both characters lose a key British 'servant', if you will, midway through the film. Batman loses Alfred in The Dark Knight Rises and Tony Stark loses Jarvis. 2. Both characters lose all of their possessions and have to rely on their own cunning genius to solve the matter at hand. The difference here is that we're told very clearly how Bruce Wayne is capable of fighting his way out of trouble whereas Tony Stark miraculously learns karate between Iron Man 2 and 3 without any explanation what so ever. 3. They both have sidekicks in the film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character and the useless little boy in Iron Man 3. The difference this time is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character carried out a significant role whereas the boy in Iron Man 3 was absolutely and 100% unnecessary to the plot line. 4. Both Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne are thought to be dead in the film by being defeated by their enemy. 5. Both characters return to the scene with a dramatic gesture to defeat the character that had previously beaten them with no difficulty on either part.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 had so many problems, it's difficult to cover them all in a quick review on IMDb so I'll just start to list off as many as I can. They didn't once explain to the audience what the syringe actually was or why people were having such a reaction to them that they were blowing up at random intervals. If you're going to have something like that in, try to explain it to the audience before hand. There was a fire breathing man. I'll give you a minute to accept that fact... A fire breathing man. Tony Stark spent far too much time outside of his suit than inside. They might as well have called the film ""Not so Iron Man."" They tried WAY to hard to make the film funny and failed in every aspect. Out of about one thousand (no exaggeration) one liners, there were 2 that I laughed at in the whole film. One of them was said by Jarvis and the other by some random enemy. Surprise, surprise the ""funny"" Tony Stark character is not funny in the slightest in this film which is just another major disappointment.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is so bad I wouldn't go and see it again for free much less pay for it. I'd rather excrete in my hands and clap."
"klwiley","9","21","45","4 May 2013"," Top 3 Reasons to see Iron Man 3
","Here we go, and don't worry...No spoilers here.<br/><br/>1- Tony Stark has been one of the best developed characters on the big screen, comic book movie or not, it's hard to argue. In the Avenger's Captain America said to Tony ""Take away the suit of Armor and what are you?"" I think this movie was almost created to answer that question. This film does really show what drives Tony and how even without the suit, he IS Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, you will see how all the events of the first 2 IM films and the Avengers have shaped, molded, and changed Tony, for better or for worse. Like I said, one of the best developed Characters ever...hats off to the Marvel Gang and New-comer (To Marvel films) Director/Co-writer Shane Black.<br/><br/>2- The Score, the original music composed for the Film, was mighty, pulse-pounding, and highly thematic. I'm one of those nuts who really pays attention to what the score does for a film. Most scores do well to just accompany the film, others take it to a new level. The IM1 score had a really energetic and modern beat to it, it suited it really well. The IM2 score, really fell flat for me, it did not hearken back to the score of IM1 and although it didn't take away from the film, it certainly didn't enhance it. The score for IM3 had some resonance from IM1 but brought a whole new flare, and a lot of heart. Well done composer, Brian Tyler.<br/><br/>3- The Hardware, yes I did emphasize how well the movie does to show who Tony is without the suit, but it once again shows just how genius he is with his suit...errr...in this film's case, suits. The suits are big nod to some of the awesome suits that have been created over decades in the comics, and their purpose in the film is well played out. I was particularly impressed at how the Mark 42 (The mostly gold suit that he wears in the film) was utilized, so many different scenarios occurred with it. Once again, well done, IM3 Team.<br/><br/>Now, these are by no means the only things I enjoyed, but my ""Top 3 for Iron Man 3"", there are plenty of other reasons to give love to this film, but much of those are too ""spoiler-y"". So, if you haven't already seen or made plans to see Iron Man 3, go do yourself a solid and make those plans to do so and enjoy another adventure with Tony Stark, The Armored Avenger."
"kefaluka","1","14","28","8 May 2013"," Sad
","This is my first review and I've been nearly member for 4 years or more.<br/><br/>Sorry for my English but I felt the urge to outburst my misery about this production. It is a disaster. I watched it yesterday. First of all it is not a super hero movie, it is mostly a minuscule psychological ""Analyze This"" with a twist of ten year old shrink.<br/><br/>I gave 4 points because I respect the production efforts, that's all. <br/><br/>60 percent of the movie was all about Mr. Stark trying to overcome his panic attacks and i feel totally fooled because of this. Have you watched trailers? The topic was Mandarin all over it. And then a cheap twist about Mandarin being an actor? Come on!!!<br/><br/>Mandarin is one of the most important villains of Marvel Universe, at least an arch-enemy for Ironman. Can you fake Lex Luthor? Can you fake Loki? Can you fake Venom or Dr. Octopuss? No you can't. It has a history. Tons of stories. And then a writer can dare to wipe this all out with the full million dollar support of a studio...<br/><br/>This is the mistake of the studios. You rely on the comic book heritage, the characters, the powers, the design and everything from the written/drawn world, then you decide to betray that whole thing. <br/><br/>The most astounding achievement for Iron Man in this movie (iron man 3) was to save the fallen of the Air Force Plane, the rest was totally illogical, totally boring, totally useless. You need to understand, if you are creating a fantasy world, you set the rules for it to make the world believable and consistent. You can't cross the rules easily. Especially if you'r using technology and real world referenced things in your story. If you step on them you turn the whole story to a hunter story. No one believes it.<br/><br/>Some serious questions about this movie:<br/><br/>1- How did XTREMIS subjects earned super hero powers? Regeneration OK we got it. It was the end game of the whole research program but overheating was the setback, the main problem from the beginning of Maya Hansen's research. It was the reason of subjects going boom. This means that you can't overheat any of your part with your will power without booming yourself. In fact they needed Mr. Stark's genius to solve this problem according to movie! We know a guy from The Fantastic Four who has some kind of this ability(heating his parts whenever he wants) and it consumes tremendous power. Let's pass this question, how come they have super strength? Or agility? They were like super heroes... We know that the armor of Iron Man is physically super strong, with tons of pressure power etc. How come a regenerative body can overcome it? <br/><br/>2- How come the official US Army suit, the one that Colonel James Rhodes used has no tracking signal, a super coded emergency communication line with the main base? Is it that easy to capture a super weapon? Don't play with us...<br/><br/>3- From what I understand Aldrich Killian and his company is expert about human genetics not super-war suits or electronics, and from what I understood neither Killian nor Maya Hansen is as genius as Mr. Stark so Killian can not capture or even move with an Iron Man suit. Everything has a learning span.<br/><br/>4- Let's say that somehow they captured the suit, how did they learn to fly it remotely and with a decent precision while the president sitting in it? What was the command center doing at that time? Christmas vacation? In the end this is the most important mistake of a country losing a president, isn't it? <br/><br/>5- There's a command chain in every army. If you find out the whereabouts of a 'lost president!' you don't call the vice president, you call a special Defcon alarmed SHIELD base or your superior who is a military grade general or someone to mobile some 100s of agents, choppers, jets etc.<br/><br/>6- I am not talking about the nonsense of only 2 men fighting with tons of enemies etc.. etc..<br/><br/>There are lots of things to question this movie but Mandarin was the peak. <br/><br/>In my opinion you have the material to make great movies from these super hero characters that can become legends but instead you are wasting their potentials with lose scripts, great illogical mistakes and disrespectful approach to their saga.<br/><br/>Final word: One more million dollar disappointment. <br/><br/>Note: There are movies like Rambo, Die Hard that we know that the heroes over there showing joke like super performances. But the concept tell you that these people somehow can do that and you believe that. Iron Man saga depends on the genius of a character and mainly the power of a suit. We wanted to watch this instead of Stark roasting enemy heads with a home made glove. That's why it is disappointing."

","When the movie ended, i was so furious and disappointed, i was hoping shane black was somewhere around so i can bash him in the face with my motorcycle helmet.Such a failure it was that i started having second thoughts about going to the theaters to watch man of steel.Not have really much to say that it hasn't already been posted. I went to see iron man kicking ass and what i got was a crappy suit that when it wasn't malfunctioning, or torn to pieces from super human villains as if it was made of paper, it was breaking apart like a garbage can.That was about half of the action scenes of the movie with the other half watching stark performing as james bond, jumping high walls with ease or neutralizing 2 or 3 enemies at the same time with high tech gadjets.Left me wondering if he actually needed the suit.. <br/><br/>I was expecting to see breath taking action and i ended up counting the minutes for the movie to end, just so i can justify my money and time.A mediocre action-comedy film that could be easily rented on DVD.<br/><br/>OK marvel you got my money this time let me see you try that again.."
"Jay-Avengers","3","14","28","29 April 2013"," Bad Movie
","This is my first review of a movie, and writing it only to express my displeasure on the movie Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>The movie starts with lot of promise and within minutes takes you down several levels of disappointments.<br/><br/>I first saw Iron Man as a movie, and hence not aware of various characters that are associated with Iron Man comics. However, the villain character portrayed by Kingsley (The Mandarin) starts off great, only to be reduced to a buffoon in the end. Such a shame.<br/><br/>The plot is filled with loopholes, like why Iron Man lets his army of robots stay put while his villa is being destroyed. (The scene of destruction is top class though).<br/><br/>No reasons why Maya suddenly changes her mind, and most importantly why is Pepper doing action in the end, all of a sudden?<br/><br/>A few good things - the scenes with the Kid (Harley), the final fight with Robots and Downey's acting is the only saving grace of the film.<br/><br/>Better watch this on a DVD in parts rather than wasting 120+ minutes of your valuable time at a stretch.<br/><br/>It is a big disappointment."
"kumarnov1992","4","14","28","27 April 2013"," Very Subtle Plot
","Plot - The plot was very subtle and very typical. The only twist planned(Mandarin), turned out to be a huge backfire. <br/><br/>Characters - Very disappointed to see Mandarin(Ben Kingsley) was just a huge joke. Little Harley had an abrupt beginning and end. He was used just as a filler to fill out the logic. Aldrich Killian's role was pathetic. There was nothing impressive about him or about his intentions, he is just ""yet another villain"". Only good thing was Robert Downey Jr, he played his role with a cocky attitude and a style that's very unique to him. <br/><br/>VFX - Awesome visuals in ripping Stark's Mansion apart. The last 30 minutes was a bummer, felt like I was watching transformers and a random mob war with a lot of havoc. <br/><br/>Audio - The audio quality was very poor especially the BGM (it makes all the difference), I'm not sure whether it is like it everywhere or just in the theater I saw. <br/><br/>Round up - Very juvenile in all the three genres(Sci-Fi, action, thriller) it's classified under. It gives you some laugh here and there, but ultimately leaves you with tears for having spent so much money on watching it."
"federal-historia","3","44","106","23 April 2013"," Plot Holes, everywhere
","Just a lot of PLOT HOLES. This film has so many holes in the script that makes us forget those of TDKR and Amazing Spider-Man. And I went to the cinema to see a movie about Iron Man and not Tony Stark. The script distorts the great comics series Extremis by Warren Ellis and Adi Granov, ignoring some of its finer details, such as the new capabilities of the protagonist. The plot is full of holes and the film fails to follow the comedy style of The Avengers, and many jokes falls into slapstick. Mandarin is, believe me, the comic relief. It's like if the Joker from Dark Knight was just a clown and not a maniac. The people won't see the plot holes at the first view, but, like TDKR, they will start thinking about them after get home"

","I remember watching the Iron man 3 trailer over and over again thinking ""OMG this is gonna be as good as Avengers maybe even better"". Till today i even still watch the trailer because the 3 minutes of trailer is a million times better than the actual film!!!!<br/><br/>Listen, If you are not a comic book fan then by all means this is the film for you to watch, but if you are, I'm telling you, no I'm begging you please, please do not waste your time and money because this film is a fraud. It sickens me that i actually paid money for this film. The best part of this movie is the hot dog i ate. <br/><br/>How can you make the Mandarin a stunt actor?!?!? The Mandarin?! Thats like saying the joker was actually a pastor/priest/reverend who just wanted to pretend to be a criminal! Thats like making the General Zod an African who pretended to be from Krypton. So many plot holes in this movie. How did Tony get hit by a truck, causing his suit to shatter....but remained unharmed?!?! Better yet, how can a truck shatter the suit that allowed him to stand toe-to-toe with Thor and his magical hammer. Which intelligent man with a brain like Tony Stark would call out a global terrorist via the media giving him his address just after telling his girlfriend ""I have to protect the one thing that i can't live without, and that's you"". If i was to talk about the rest of the plot holes I'll be writing a 20,000 word dissertation. <br/><br/>The Mandarin was supposed to be a formidable antagonist to Iron Man, someone who will test him mentally, physically and psychologically but instead we get a skinny guy who manages to test Tony Stark patience kmmmmttttt. And whats worse is critics are giving this film postitive reviews such as ""film of the year"". That's like saying a paralympian could run faster than Usain Bolt with his eyes closed. <br/><br/>Shane Black & Drew Pearce (writers) should not just be fired but should find new employment in the entertainment business. I will not watch a superhero film with those two or any one of them involved. They were lazy and did not care about this project. If they thought what they did was right they wouldn't mislead everyone into thinking the Mandarin was real in the trailers.<br/><br/>Good performances from key actors though."
"rykard","1","20","43","3 May 2013"," Really Bad Film
","I walked out after about 15 minutes. The movie simply wasn't fun. It jumped from scene to scene without transition, and there were entirely too many characters. The music was bad. I think the worst part was the focus on Stark's PTSD. I realize that writers and directors seem to want to try and humanize movie heroes, but superheroes aren't ordinary and I at least don't want to watch them break down; no matter how triumphantly they return.<br/><br/>From the reviews I have now read it sounds like they tried to do too much and there just wasn't enough time to do it well. I am certain many people will like this film, but it was bad enough I don't think I can ever even watch any of its predecessors again. Its an amazing piece of work that can ruin what came before."

"doug-j-eves","6","16","33","29 April 2013"," From ""Rock Star"" to ""Rock Bottom""
","Iron Man. The name itself evokes power, strength, patriarchal dominance and confidence. So why do the events of Iron Man 3 lack so much of the prowess and subtlety of its predecessors? Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) journey throughout the Iron Man franchise has taken its ups and downs, but none worse than the final chapter in this twisted metal of a franchise.<br/><br/>Set after the events of the critically acclaimed blockbuster ""The Avengers"", Iron Man 3 takes the audience on a journey of pseudo redemption and self discovery. Take away everything that was given to you in Iron Man 1 and 2: all of the sleek sexy locations, the gadgets and tech of Stark Industries and what you have left is a bleak, boring Marvel wasteland.<br/><br/>The performances by Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) are to be expected and their chemistry works well, what remains are characters that drop off into the background and annoying scenes of awkward dialogue forced with a strange undertone of the Christmas Season. Yes Christmas. I am not sure why the theme of Christmas was so prevalent throughout the film, even to a point where Stark uses Christmas decorations as grenades! <br/><br/>Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) plays a stock standard, rich evil genius convincingly and Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the super villain The Mandarin ends up to be disappointing. Most deflating are the characters played by Don Cheadel (War Machine/James Rhodes) and Rebecca Hall (Maya Hansen), serving only to push the movie forward into obscurity.<br/><br/>The redeeming features of this film lie in brief moments of comedic relief and some scenes of impressive computer generated imagery. Incorporated into the story is Stark's post New York stress, a direct result of the events that transpired in The Avengers film. This motif of acceptance and how Stark dealt with these events was very interesting, but were ultimately forgotten by the end credits. <br/><br/>Skimming over hot topics of suicide bombings and the American involvement in the Middle East, Stark's humour and wit diffuse any chance of a meaningful message. With a rather annoying twist near the last act, the film shows its true colours. Suffering from the same writing woes as Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, all the plot holes and character arch's are tied up in the closing minutes of the film. Directed by renowned screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) Iron Man 3 finishes this lackluster trilogy with a Stark attempt at trying something new."

","I'm not really sure what to say about this movie. Effects? Great. Cast? Great (although Don Cheadle looks bored throughout). Director / co-author? Clueless. <br/><br/>The Mandarin's character is completely wasted. Rather than use the hugely talented Ben Kingsley to portray a truly memorable villain, here he's been used exclusively for. . . well I'm not going to spoil it. <br/><br/>Are you a Marvel fan expecting Mandarin's rings and the powers that go with them? Keep expecting as they've been substituted with silly thermal regeneration powers. Remember how Iron Man withstood a 50,000 degree lightning bolt from Thor? Here 3,000 degree heat from villains cuts though Stark armour like butter. Remember that great scene when Hulk grins after Captain America tells him to go ""smash""? Nothing even remotely like that in this movie. Oh and stick around for the disappointing post credit scene. It sums up the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>Unlike Joss Whedon, Shane Black simply fails to bring the Marvel universe to life. I'm sure others will disagree but for me, it's not a patch on The Avengers."

","The movie should of been called Tony Stark I, for it has nothing to do with the two previous Iron Man movies. As others have said, they wasted the Mandarin character, turning him into a joke. Most of the story is about Tony's inner demons, boring!! Then they try to make the movie kid friendly by introducing a child's part to help Tony as he once again is lost in the rubble which is his life. Really, thought that is why he made Pepper his girlfriend. Was utterly disappointment with this release, seems like it was rushed and thrown together, because the story line is barely coherent. Don't waste you time on this, wait till one of your friends buys the DVD/Blu Ray, borrow it from them and then help them by trashing it."

","I'm surprised that Downey has held out this long. At some point, you have enough money and want to return to your art. He says this is his last, and I believe him. What we have in this case is him on his way out, dictating terms. And we have a pretty good movie as a result, far better that the earlier ones and leagues better than the usual Marvel.<br/><br/>He booted out the director and got the guy he worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That film found a distance between noir detective movies and self-satire that was novel, delicious. It is carried over to here. No one but kiddies can take these movies seriously, so the game is to find that space in between the world you show and the world of the viewer. <br/><br/>Usually it has to be reflectively comic. Guardians used that effectively. What we have here is more subtle, letting the genre itself be the joke. It isn't just that the villain is an actor; the idea permeates the whole world.<br/><br/>He booted out the writer and got the hot new guy, someone who understands snappy situations and narrative distance. He'll probably burn out, but here he matters.<br/><br/>He changed the formula from girl-in-distress to give Pepper some kickass scenes. And finally, he fired ILM and got WETA. So we now have some sense of spatial imagination and adventure where before we had dull bombast.<br/><br/>This adds up to a great deal of fun for me. Sure, there are a lot of things that don't make sense and are pretty dull, but they are in different places and ways than with the usual Marvel product. You can't eliminate these, but shifting them is novel, competent, self-aware and appreciated.<br/><br/>If he leaves the franchise, he will have done so with some honor, and some demonstration that he knows what he is doing. Bless you Mr. Downey."

","This is an amazing movie with a great plot, script, actors, effects, director etc. I was having an anxiety attack for half the movie. It was also hilarious. So go watch it when it comes out. And then watch it again. And try to stay till the end of the credits; the very end. Please don't read any spoilers,it will diminish the quality of your movie viewing. The new actors are so convincing in the roles that they play, and R.D.J. is as amazing as ever, as are Cheadle and Paltrow. I did not lose interest during the entire movie, it's impossible to lose focus because every single scene is so exciting or heartwarming or nerve wracking. The trailer is a bit misleading, I was expecting the movie to be dark and depressing, but it was not too bad. I was kind of expecting this movie to be a letdown, but it went above my highest expectations. I rate it equal to the first movie."
"ashutosh233","7","11","22","29 April 2013"," Not half as good as the last two.
","Just went to watch Iron Man 3...I gotta say, I am rather disappointed.<br/><br/>I won't give away any of the plot (there isn't much of one), but overall, you're only likely to be satisfied if you're expecting mindless action and admittedly superb, stunning visual effects throughout. The 3- D is OK, but it's the type where not much seems to change (except you only seeing 40% of the usual photons you would). The score is typical of such films; as for the acting, Ben Kingsley is a great actor (as far as his role allows him to be), and the rest just about manage to keep up. I was mentally comparing Mandarin to Bane in that I expected him to be a great presence on screen, and a menacing, worthy opponent to Tony Stark. However, I was sorely disappointed. The main villain in the film has such a typical, immature backstory that I could have written a better one in my sleep. Literally. I can type with my eyes shut.<br/><br/>RDJ does not disappoint, but once again, his full talent feels restrained in this one. The storyline is rambling and incoherent, and ultimately dissatisfactory.<br/><br/>The movie itself is full of tropes and typical scenarios; the humour is not as genuine or natural as in the previous installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job on The Avengers 2.<br/><br/>All in all, you're only likely to enjoy this motion picture if you thought The Avengers was a good movie. And if you're the type that can say ""The Avengers (the Marvel one) was a good movie!"" without being sarcastic, well, you'll like Iron Man 3 just fine."

Though the first two movies were awesome, this one could not compete with the former. But if we are not going to compare this one with the other two parts (obviously our expectations are sky-high), it is quite a good movie, where I might have changed my rating from 7 to 8. Although I believe Director Shane did his part good enough, but there were flaws. Robert is brilliant as usual. So, guys I suggest you to go for this movie, but try not to compare with the other two parts."
"alex_howells92","5","5","8","17 May 2014"," Forgettable film, Potentially killed the Iron Man franchise.
","I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I've always loved Iron Man and still think Robert Downey Jr was a great choice to play the character. I enjoy both Iron Man 1, 2 and Avengers and the trailers for Iron Man 3 looked great! But i was wrong, This film is one of the worst Super-Hero films iv seen. It felt like this movie was missing the charm that the first two have and the jokes felt forced and unfunny. The plot twist made me hate the film even more and the ending just left me feeling cheated. After this disaster i really cant see Marvel Studios making another Iron Man film with Shane Black. If they want to make a fourth installment then i would recommend Jon Favreau direct again.<br/><br/>This is a list of the things that bothered me with this film -<br/><br/>* The lack of AC/DC music. For me, I felt like AC/DC and Black Sabbath was Tony's thing but in this film its all replaced with Christmas songs. Not sure why, The film came out in the Summer!<br/><br/>* Tony Stark doesn't really wear the Iron Man suit much in this film and when he is wearing a suit its his new one hes working on that keeps breaking and seems to be really weak. Just use a different suit then! And the time Tony needs to talk to Jarvis the suit end up running out of power, I thought the suits run of the Arc Reactors 'limitless power', Yeah, Apparently not.<br/><br/>* Still cant understand how Iron Man can take a lighting bolt from Thor's hammer in Avengers but cant take a few punches from the Extremis henchmen.<br/><br/>* I really didn't like the fact Gwyneth Paltrow got to wear the suit and save Tony, Felt like Tony was the one who was always in Distress. The fact she killed Killian bothers me as well. She had more powers that Tony in this film!<br/><br/>*That little kid that Tony meets in that small town. It did nothing for me, I couldn't of cared any less for him. I still struggle to see why they even put him in this film, He literally does nothing.<br/><br/>*The Mandarin! I hated what they did with the Mandarin! They had created this amazing bad guy for Iron Man to face and he seemed like he really could be the biggest threat that Iron Man may have to face but they reduce this character to a idiot actor who's been hired to take on a persona of a bad guy for the media's eyes. <br/><br/>* If all of Tony's suit were able to fight during the final fight then why didn't they all come out and destroy the helicopters earlier in the film when Tony's house was being shot at and putting Tony and Pepper in danger.<br/><br/>* After the final fight, Tony just makes all his suits explode. Why? Surely he still needs them! It just seemed like a really pointless thing to do and was only done to make some pretty fireworks. Lame.<br/><br/>* I'm a fan of Guy Pearce, But his role as fire breathing nerd Aldrich Killian was disappointing. The fact that he was the 'real' Mandarin was one of the worst plot twists i have even seen in a film. He was basically out for revenge only because Tony didn't come to meet him on the roof. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was more menacing that him!<br/><br/>* have no idea why any of the writers or the Director thought it would be a good idea to add that last 10 minutes of the film when they just say that they cured Pepper of that Extremis stuff, Why Tony had the metal in his chest taken out easily, if it was that easy why didn't they do that at the start of the first film! <br/><br/>* After waiting 6 or 7 minutes for the after credit scene i was so disappointing. All the other Marvel films in this universe had great scenes leading on to the next film, This scene just made made me feel like i had wasted my time waiting for it. Im not a big fan of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce/Hulk, But hes alright but i didn't care for his cameo at all.<br/><br/>The were a few things i enjoyed, But not enough to make me consider this a good film.<br/><br/>* I found Don Cheadle more interesting in this film as the Iron Patriot. Im hoping they show off more of his skills and abilities in future films like Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>* Ben Kingsley was amazing as the Mandarin. But that turned out to be a joke so that doesn't really matter now.<br/><br/>* I liked all the different Iron Man suits, But we barely see them so i was let down with that.<br/><br/>Overall, Its the only film in the Iron Man franchise and the MCU franchise that i haven't enjoyed. After this disappointing film i doubt they will make a fourth, If they did i would still watch it since i still have hope that Iron Man could come back with better form. But i think this may have caused the end to the Iron Man solo films. Still hoping Tony gets his charm and wit back like he did in his other films for Avenger: Age of Ultron."

","Let Me Start By Saying That I Am A Huge Marvel Geek. I loved all of Marvel Studios previous movies (even Iron Man 2). These were entertaining movies that used the source material very well and adapted it to the big screen. I thought Marvel Studios couldn't go wrong ! Then I saw Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>From The Start Iron Man 3 felt off. The tone, the music, and the characters didn't feel like they fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe very well. The only thing that was working for me in this movie was The Mandarin, sure he didn't have 10 magic rings, but he acted like the comic character, and had me semi-engaged in the movie. Ben Kingsley did a fantastic job as the Mandarin ! Then as you've probably heard, they messed up the character sooo badly. They say that the Mandrain is a rasicst character then they go and make him a rasict British sterotype ? How is that any better, come on ! How over-protective are people today when the Mandarian is considered a racist character ?! How any comic fan approved of what they did is beyond me.<br/><br/>But even without the Mandrain crap, this movie is still horrible. The Actors must of lost it or something because none of them (with the exception of Ben Kingsley) did a very good job in this. They all seemed off and half-assed portrayals of the character we love. Even RDJ wasn't very good this time around !<br/><br/>The plot was also horrible. At no point did I have any interest in Extremes or Killian's character. The weird Radioactive Men Things were just boring and stupid villains that I had no interest in. the plot also contains 8-year old sidekicks, Pepper Potts as a fire monster, Iron Man magically being able to fix his heart just because he can. <br/><br/>Come On Marvel, You Can Do Better than this."

How did Marvel let this happen? I don't know where to start to tell how disappointed i am. What is the story with the random kid that he found in a house? they just keep making one cheesy joke after another.<br/><br/>Also Aldrich Killian was the worst bad guy, with no character.

"deno111","6","3","4","2 July 2014"," Flying parts of a suit and fire breathing universal soldiers didn't do it for me
","The Iron Man 3 movie is a total slap in the face to the Iron Man 1 and 2 movies. The scriptwriters tried to put something new and fresh in the movie, that differs from the first two, but in my opinion, they have flunked all the way. This script should never see the light of day. It should have been rewritten.<br/><br/>I can remember particular sections of the Iron Man 1 and 2, because they were memorable. Fighting scenes, development of the main character, plausible villains, etc. Nothing is memorable in the Iron Man 3, so it is quite easy to forget what you were watching actually. Flying suits powered by mini jet propulsion motors, biologically (chemically?) created universal soldiers, that can generate heat at 3000 Celsius, and so on, doesn't cut it in this movie. Kidnapping a US president is something that we have seen too many times and is over chewed.<br/><br/>The acting of Robert D. Jr, is great. No one else could do an Iron Man better than he did. Also the supporting cast is very good, considering they had to work with such crappy script.<br/><br/>Supprisingly the current rank of this movie is 7.4, which is quite high. I give this movie a 6, and even that is generous."

He isn't actually in it in the end, in the movie it is simply an actor playing the mandarin, i know this sounds like a joke, but its not. I don't consider this a spoiler because the movie is straight restarted. I mean its a blatant attempt to poke fun at corporate corruption but seriously we wanted to see a cool superhero movie with a climactic battle and character build up. It is a joke that this movie got a 7.7. Seriously how is this possible? If you thought 2 was bad it looks like an Oscar winning film compared to this one.

"prabhat_kataria","3","21","49","28 April 2013"," Lot of mind payed to Special effects , NONE whatsoever to the storyline
","What can i say about the movie that has not yet been said in 184 reviews...well.. A LOT! The early critical reviews are so unreasonably favorable it almost seems like a conspiracy to get the people to the theaters . Well its been happening a lot lately , early reviews being so great that people expect all these movies to be potential game changers like 'The Dark Knight'.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is a great personality , an amazing actor and the only one who breathes any life to this franchise . But a movie depending on an actor's name can never be great. An actor should never be bigger than the movie.NEVER. The movie starts like every superhero movie does , leaving you with plenty of expectations. Apparently , the experience with the wormhole has had an effect on Tony Stark and he begins to suffer from these anxiety attacks and insomnia and becomes a workaholic spending a lot of time in his private 'lab'. Enters new villain.<br/><br/>And then begin a series of action clichés all of them been done already...too many times. There were a couple of comic moments and maybe one hilariously twisted twist.<br/><br/>Other than that no attention is played on the screenplay. Things happen just because they have to in order to get to the (boring) climax.How people get where they do without any hurdles is comical. Why don't these guys learn from Mr. Nolan that the writing, story and screenplay is MORE important than the meaningless special effects.<br/><br/>There is nothing special about this movie but i gave it 3 stars simply because of the cast. Apart from RDj , the star who shines out is Sir Ben Kingsley. He simply steals the show and i wish there were more of him. The guy is a class apart and does a brilliant job as The Mandarin. Oh how i wish there was more of him. Guy Pearce is potentially wasted and so is the talented Rebbeca Hall. Gwyneth Paltrow is the same old and so is Don Cheadle. And yes there was this clichéd cute kid who served no purpose whatsoever except for making the movie more cheesy.<br/><br/>Shane Black's directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was an amazingly crafted crime comedy. With Iron Man 3 he disappoints. But the positive that we take away from all this is that IM3 is the last of the installments.<br/><br/>Regardless , like me , people will rush to the theaters to watch this and most of them will be , for the lack of a better word , disappointed ....and let down.<br/><br/>And for all those who wait for the credits to roll so they can watch a post credit scene , let me save you those 10 precious minutes to say that nothing epic happens. Let me rephrase that. Nothing happens.<br/><br/>Looking forward to Man Of Steel now."
"sashank_kini-1","2","4","6","15 May 2013"," Ironman 3 May Not Be a Bad Film. But I Found It Unbearable. Maybe When I Catch The TV Premiere, I'll Hate It Less. But What I Felt Watching The Film In Theatre Was Tedium.
","Ironman 3 is exactly how you expect the final installment in a trilogy to be – our beloved hero haunted by his past faces his ultimate test against his new nemesis, who has the upper-hand this time. Will our hero be able to vanquish his foe and reclaim his place this time too? Will loved ones be sacrificed in this quest? Will our hero get a fitful redemption in the end? All these expected questions are answered in Ironman 3, topped with a resolution that reminded me of Kevin Spacey's final monologue from American Beauty. You can even predict how the camera will move around its characters, when it shall pan on its characters' faces and the kind of expressions the characters will give at a particular moment. You may not be a musician but you'll know what kind of music will be played for the concluding part of the Ironman Series. You'll basically get everything you expected from Ironman 3, and this is the reason why Ironman 3 feels predictable. Is it a bad film? Not necessarily. Did I find it unbearable? Oh, yes. <br/><br/>In short, I couldn't bear Ironman 3 not because it was a badly made movie, but because I couldn't put up with its predictability. It's only been my second science fiction film this year (the other being Star Trek Into Darkness) and I'm already fed up with the 'seen one, seen them all' vibe I get from this genre. You breathe the same stinking air of bullet firings, explosions, bomb-blasts and missile-assaults every single time, the only difference being that the 3D brings the assault to your senses and sensibility even closer. And the worst part is that a majority of the audience has acclimatized itself with this stinking air, and this is why Iron Man 3 has made close to a billion dollars. I'm sure there's an Iron Man 4 in the nearing future; the producers wouldn't discontinue this profit-making franchise that's hot on almost everybody's minds. So much for the American Beauty-style ending! So don't fret people, you can get your supply of stinking air probably after two years. Till then, you have other options to assault your sense and sensibility, so don't panic!<br/><br/>Ironman 3 starts with Tony Stark, the face of Stark Enterprises narrating about his journey towards 'enlightenment' and a 'new beginning' with his quintessentially sardonic delivery. So at first we have a scene of the past, which happens at a New Year's party with Tony acting like the lovable jerk and ladies man as usual. He meets Maya Hansen, a scientist and is amazed by the invention she is working on – an experimental regenerative treatment to allow recovery from crippling injuries. The same night he is also accosted by Aldrich Killian, a disabled, eccentric scientist who offers Tony a place in his company called Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M) which the latter rejects, humiliating Killian. <br/><br/>Cut to some years later. Stark is working on advanced Ironman suits and spends most of his time in the basement with his artificial intelligence companion Jarvis. He sleeps little and suffers from post traumatic stress disorder due to his near-death experience (in the first Avengers film). His relationship with his girlfriend Pepper also takes a toll because of his strangely aloof behavior and because he spies on her on one occasion through his former bodyguard and head of security of Starks Enterprise, Happy Hogan. The occasion: Pepper, who's now Stark Enterprises' CEO, is approached by Killian, who's dapper and dashing now and demonstrates his brain modification experiment to her, proposing a joint alliance between Stark Enterprise and his company A.I.M. She declines his offer, finding the experiment to be too dangerous but Killian nevertheless casts a spell on her.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there is news of Mandarin, a ruthless terrorist who claims that his organization The Ten Rings is responsible for the bombings at various American landmarks. Sparks doesn't issue any public statements about Mandarin until Happy is gravely injured in one of the blasts, after which he publicly threatens to take Mandarin down. There's another conspiracy brewing up, as super-strong men and women capable of generating extreme heat haunt the country. Starks, using his advanced technology, finds out later that Mandarin may not be responsible for the blast which injured Happy. Maya Hansen, the scientist whom he slept with after being wowed by her invention years ago, returns to inform him that his boss, Killian may be plotting to kill him. The game begins for Tony Starks – will he be able to overcome his post traumatic stress disorder and become the Ironman he was before, or will this be the last we see of Ironman?<br/><br/>I know I haven't summarized the film well, but I can't really help it as my interest in Ironman 3 dwindled after the first twenty-five minutes. No doubt the screen wipes, cuts and dialogues do make the movie feel like a true comic book adaptation but I was bugged by the constant punch-lines that everyone's treating like a work of genius, bugged by the elaborate special effects and totally anxious to get out of the theatre. Maybe when I catch the television premiere of this film, I won't hate it as much and my review would be less harsh and better written. But for now, I can only express what I felt when I watched it in theatre – it was tedium."

"The_Real_Review","3","10","20","2 June 2013"," Disappointingly Bad and Insultingly Contrived
","It was as if the director was trying to make a mockumentary of a bad '70s action hero. I realized something was wrong when completely out of place music started playing at the beginning and continued throughout. Guy Pearce and his character were horrible. The ""twist"" of making the Mandarin comic relief was shockingly insulting. Top that off with Pepper's silly ""heroics"" tanks this as one of Marvel's worst movies to date.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s acting could not save this film from the script and the horrendous directing. Iron Man works when the only comedy is delivered from Downey and the rest focuses on a gritty action/drama. Not here, the director injects desperate attempts at humor from other characters - the most insulting being Kingsley and they all fall completely flat. <br/><br/>I literally got bored watching illogical scene after scene of Iron Man bumbling around or Tony Stark playing secret agent man. None of it made any sense and it just dragged on. Stark is supposed to be smart, resourceful and egotistical. So why the contrived implausible situations that make no sense? Why is Stark acting so incompetent in this film?<br/><br/>Do we really need to see another shootout on a docked container ship at night when this is supposed to be Iron Man? Has all the good script writers died in Hollywood?<br/><br/>You know a movie is bad when you have seen all the good scenes in the trailer. Next time hire the person who made the Iron Man 3 trailer to not only write but direct the next Iron Man. At least you would feel like you got your money's worth and in this case see something else."
"BinyaminB","2","10","20","1 May 2013"," Undeserving to be called Iron Man 3, the movie should aptly be named Tony Stark 3
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>As you can tell from my score, am I happy with how this movie has turned out? Definitely not! Since when was it okay to sacrifice the original source material just for the sake of comedy and humor. Is the general audience so demanding that we enjoy a few laughs in the cinema that we must make a mockery of the origins of the Iron Man characters? If you have any shred of knowledge about the villains of Iron Man you'll know that firstly I am referring to the Mandarin. What on EARTH was going through Shane Black's mind when he thought ""oh I know the Mandarin is the equivalent of Batman's joker, but for the sake of my poorly conceived plot i'll make him a badgering, drug addicted, false loony."" I will say the build up to the Mandarin's eventual fraud was quite good. It made me feel as though the Mandarin was going to be one menacing villain. However, when you build a villain up to be what he is intended to be only to tear him down to a piece of crap twist only serves to infuriate the fans of the comics even more. Sure you get a few laughs from the audience who are only there for the general purpose of being entertained by the latest superhero flick, but what do you do to the Iron Man legacy?! Marvel has started something wonderful by establishing consistent characters, stories and settings across multiple film franchises to bring them all together and make the Avengers. 20 years from now do you know how the legacy of Iron Man will be received? The casual fans aren't going to be the ones who have any say b/c they would have long forgotten about the movie. But the true comic book fans who turn what Marvel have done into a cult classic will say ""remember how Shane Black made a complete mockery of the Mandarin?"" Now back to the movie itself. What was up with the inconsistency in the power of the suits? I didn't realize Iron Man had suddenly turned into Glass Man. The fights that Tony overcame against the Extremis agents weren't even from his efforts alone. He was either controlling a suit from a safe distance, getting Jarvis to clean them up, enlisting the aid of a kid, or relying on his girlfriend's newfound super powers to beat the villains. Did the definition of hero get lost in this movie somewhere? Yes I understand that the director was trying to go for the ""I'm still Iron Man without my suit"" approach. But if you can't even display feats of heroism what the hell is that sentiment even good for?!<br/><br/>Which leads me to my last point... Way too little of the Iron and way too much of the man. This movie should just be called Man 3 or as I already stated in the title: Tony Stark 3. What is the point of calling it Iron Man when 3/4 of the time you're not even in the suit and when you are, you've suddenly become a failure and not the competent Tony Stark/Iron Man we've come to understand in IM1, IM2 and the Avengers. Yes we understand that everyone has failures, even heroes. But it seems to me the biggest feat he even achieved in the whole movie was saving those ppl from the plane, and he wasn't even in the suit! Oh and of course when he called over his 40 or so suits. But was he doing anything at that point? Pretty sure Jarvis was controlling the helm.<br/><br/>So in closing, this was a bad way to kick start the upcoming action- packed films for the rest of 2013 and I hope there are more like-minded ppl out there who realize this movie has done a terrible injustice to the comics. Please give the distribution rights back to Paramount who won't be afraid to endorse a grittier superhero take and won't turn a loved franchise into a comedy. And if you feel as I do, continue writing bad reviews on IMDb b/c it has no right to be a 7.9/10!"
"cary-forbes","6","10","20","28 April 2013"," Disappointed
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie so much, but walked away very disappointed. It's not that I thought it a bad movie, I have sure seen worse in all my years. It just left me very unsatisfied. Firstly, we have now had three Iron Man movies where a principal villain is a corrupt industrialist. Can the writers not think up anything new? I also felt their treatment of the character of The Mandarin was just woeful. The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch foe, being reduced to an almost comical character was uncalled for. They may as well have made The Red Skull a clown in Captain America. Wouldn't a big screen CGI clash between Iron Man and the true Mandarin been better, or as least as good as, the clash we ended up with in the finale of this movie? Some of these Hollywood types need to realize that we don't have to have a big song and dance to explain why a villain is a villain. A super hero movie is a fantasy adventure with lots of action, so all the villain really has to do is be bad enough for you to really root for the hero. Here's a simple plot line. The Mandarin is enslaving Chinese peasants for some nefarious plan, and the Chinese government can do nothing about it. In the hope of strengthening US/Chinese relations the Chinese government, knowing that the US has super heroes, asks the US government for help. The US send Iron Patriot, who is ambushed, defeated, and imprisoned by The Mandarin. Iron Man decides to intervene not only to rescue his friend, but to free the enslaved peasants, which he does. No corrupt politicians, no evil industrialists, just two straight up drag 'em out fights between the good guys, Iron Patriot and then Iron Man, versus The Mandarin. Simple, and something even kids understand. After all, just how many 15 year olds understand industrial espionage and the like? Just keep it simple. This movie will of course make money, it is Iron Man after all. People who have been reading about and watching super heroes for decades, like me, will always want to see them on the big screen regardless. Still, I truly don't believe that this movie deserves the box-office receipts that it will get, and judging by the reaction of the people in the cinema with us, I think a lot of other people will feel the same."
"hritrend","3","10","20","28 April 2013"," Sorry Iron Man 1

"manusanchez90","Null","10","20","28 April 2013"," The worst and least faithful in the saga! 7,25
","I am a great fan of comics, specially of those about superheroes. Ironman is not my favourite because my favourite are Spider-Man, Batman, Superman and Daredevil, but I love Ironman and its comics anyway. He is one of my favorite in the Avengers. I read lots of comics from Ironman series. Both ""Ironman"" and ""Ironman 2"" are fantastic, like the comic-books, but this one is a bit disappointing. It is not bad at all, but not at the height of the original comicbooks. I think it is the worst in the Avengers whole saga and the least faithful. The other movies from the Avengers are, more or less, of the same quality of their respectiveI comics. The pace is excellent. I was not bored at all. The lenght is almost perfect. The director did a very good job in directing the movie. He combined good action with lots of humour and good locations, like Miami and L.A. He has known how to deal with Hollywood's stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, etc.<br/><br/>The action scenes are great. It uses a lot of CGI but in a justified way (many shoots, explosions, punches and so on). The scenes in which Stark's house is destroyed is spectacular.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing and the performances, too. I love how Robert Downey Jr.portrays Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as Pepper Potts or Stark's girlfriend. Guy Pearce (another fantastic actor with an excellent career) plays the part of the main villain in a very good way. Ben Kingsley is very good as the Mandarin (the problem is that this Mandarin has different roles and personalities than in the comicbooks, which is the most disappointing thing in the whole Avengers' saga). Rebecca Hall does a decent job, as well. I must not forget Don Cheadle as James Rhodes and War Machine (Stark's best friend and another superhero). The main error in this movie is a twist in which we Ironman's fans find out that the Mandarin has different roles and personality than in the comic-books. I will not explain here what I exactly mean. I understand that one or more comics of Ironman have been published since the sixties and to addapt all that into several movies is not easy and makes us modify things, but not the essence.<br/><br/>Another important defect is that Ironman appears for just a little time as Ironman itself. I like Tony a lot, but I like Ironman in his armor even more... Some jokes may be a little repetitive, but they are nearly all very funny. Also, I missed some darkness. We cannot say that this movie is similar to ""Batman: the dark knight rises"". This is nor good neither bad, it is just that they are two different superheroes (personally, I prefer Batman, its comics and its trilogy, but love both of them). The best things in the movie are the things already explained: length, pace, the visual part, scenography, performances, cast, Guy Pearce, Roberto Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, the pace, the armors, the characters, etc. In conclusion, the real fans of Ironman will be a little disappointed, specially for what they did with the Mandarin, but I cannot say the movie is bad, simply it is not a that good adaptation. 7,25."
"reinardian","8","10","20","25 April 2013"," A Visual Feast, But a Disappointment to Hardcore Iron Man Fans.
","I'm a big Iron Man fan, read the comics, got the toys, watched the animated stuff (yeah, even the first direct-to-DVD one where he battles Mandarin possessing some girl's body). Just saw the third installment of Iron Man in all its IMAX 3D glory. I tried to love it really... see behind the flaws... honestly it was a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is based on the Extremis comics arc by Ellis and Granov, with shades of The Five Nightmares story arc by Fraction and Larroca. If you were expecting some Dark Knight mood and tone in this movie, you've got it all wrong. Among the 3 Iron Man movies, this one's got the most humor and heartwarming moments (think Real Steel). The action sequences, especially the final battle has some of the most innovative fight choreography in Superhero movie history (only second to Scott Pilgrim IMO). Love the new Mark 42 suit and Iron Patriot... and we get to see Stark being a bad ass without the armor, relying on wit, and yeah... his very own fighting skills.<br/><br/>I'd rate this 7.5 (for the entertainment factor) out of 10 The biggest problem the movie has is probably the villain... Mandarin. If you are an avid Iron Man comic reader, Mandarin is the baddest of the bad. Whenever Stark and Mandarin clash... it's a battle of epic proportions. Mandarin is Iron Man's arch nemesis, his contrapello. So disappointed in how he was handled in this movie. The Ten Rings reference in the first movie that has so much potential seem to have been forgotten in this new installment. I stayed up until the end credits, hoping for a Mandarin retribution / redemption scene, instead we get a Banner / Stark moment that doesn't really push things forward.<br/><br/>Aldrich Killian's motives are also a blur. No real focus on his intentions (maybe just create chaos). Could just be old-fashioned revenge for what happened years ago... but that setup was really lame. And that dragon tattoo... felt that it really came from nowhere.<br/><br/>I was entertained... will be seeing this movie a few more times just because I already got tickets for it. It's a nice wrap up to the franchise (they probably would cook up a fourth one though). 7.5 out of 10 rating."
"davidbeckers137","1","15","33","31 May 2013"," The suits

I have no suit, oh wait... I still have 20 suits left in my basement. Did anyone read the script and why is nobody complaining about this. Forget the Mandarin, focus on this ridiculous suit topic. And action scenes don't have to last 20 minutes either. It is actually quite annoying and makes the whole movie stupid. And cinema operators, please turn down the volume."

","I went to see this movie with high expectations, and I was not disappointed. I usually enjoy movies with Downey Jr for example the Sherlock Holme movies. In this role he was superb, with some superb one-liners in particular. Don Cheadle is another favourite of mine, perhaps not as well-known as Downey Jr but with some great performances also, in particular in ""The Guard"". The film follows the classic super hero movie format- Bad guy somehow weakens macho Good guy, Good guy fights back, eventually wins, gets the girl. Bread and butter. But what is not bread and butter is this movies genuinely awesome 3D special effects. I would recommend to anybody reading this to go and see this film in 3D. Well worth the extra money. Another very enjoyable aspect of Iron Man 3 was it's humour. I'd say I laughed out loud more times during this than during ""Ted"". The reason why I gave this 10/10 was because I went to the cinema expecting to see a superhero movie, and thats exactly what I saw. It thoroughly entertained me for 2 hours. And that sums it up. If you want 2 hours of pure entertainment, this is your film. Enjoy!"

","I haven't seen the other Iron Man movies but did have the misfortune of seeing him in the equally awful Avengers flick last year . Yes, Iron Man 3 is every bit the Stinkeroo the Avengers was if not worse . Robert Downey Jr. again plays that smug and obnoxious creep Tony Stark you either love or hate . He seems to get nothing but delight from spewing out non-stop quips and one-liners throughout the entire movie . I wasn't sure if he was doing a cheap impersonation of James Bond or was suffering from a severe case of Tourette syndrome . Early on in the film, Tony Stark's Malibu dream house sitting on top of a mountain is attacked by a squadron of enemy helicopters . After the first missile detonates inside it should have been enough to obliterate the love shack and kill Tony and girlfriend Pepper . But in true cartoon style , they are merely blown from wall to wall and just barely singed . Several more direct hits are made as the bombed out house slowly tumbles off it's foundation and falls down the cliff . By then Tony's Iron Man Halloween costume has gotten onto him as he flies away to deal with the marauding aircraft one by one . While Iron Man 3 may not be any worse than your average run of the mill comic book action movies , I just couldn't wait for it to end .

","First off I know Marvel sold they're behinds years ago,so all these superhero movies are basically made only to sell more toys and MCdonalds menu's with toys in them.But this is getting ridiculous.You suppose to root for the superhero,not be indifferent about him.<br/><br/>The movie spend a great deal of time showing how big Tony's ego is, and how he thinks he's superman =indestructable,and above everyone else,including he's own security chief<br/><br/>Than he goes on national TV and tells the bad guy to come get him and where to find him (not that hard considering everyone knows he's Iron Man. And he's house is kind of hard to miss). Which of course put he's beloved pepper in danger, when the bad guy do just that. I was kind of hoping she would get killed, but no such luck<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>****Spoiler***Spoiler******* One thing that struck me as odd, he got all this super gadgets that he can control on a whim ,yet he can't stop and incoming missile aimed at he's house? And how come in the end he could call up on all he's Armour suits but couldn't do it when he's house was under attack?? Why didn't he's suits just fry everyone off the bad guys in the end battle, why go in close to punch them, it makes no sense at all? Another thing the women who claimed to be homeland security whom Tony fights off in the bar, how come she was alive? You could clearly see her in the bunker room with the other test subjects, when they first discovered that the serum could be used as a bomb, which blew up and killed everyone in the room. That was way before the incident at the bar, so technically she shouldn't be alive. Unless the A.I.M. guy could raise the dead."

"MartinHafer","7","7","13","19 June 2013"," Decent, but it ain't no ""Iron Man"".
","I am sure that ""Iron Man 3"" will make a ton of money and satisfy audiences. But, at the same time, it delivers something that is not the original ""Iron Man""—it's got more than the original and so much less. First the more—the film has more stunts, more CGI, more action and more explosions than ever before in the series. If that is what you're looking for, then you'll no doubt be satisfied. As far as less goes, the film has much less in the way of plot, characters and, especially, fun. Now I am not saying it's a bad film—but by this third film in the series (and the fourth appearance by Robert Downey Jr. as the lead) the formula is a bit faded. Good.but faded.<br/><br/>By this installment, like his comic book character, Tony is a serious screwball. He rarely sleeps and has significant problems with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. And, at times, he seems more machine than man. Not surprisingly, his personal life is a mess. At the same time, two threats are looming—one by a brilliant but morally suspect inventor (Guy Pearce) and another from a lunatic seemingly modeled after Osama Bin-Laden (Ben Kingsley). While the Pearce plot is much more important to the film, I really liked what they did with Kingsley, as this was an injection of humor—and the film needed all it could get. In fact, Kingsley's character and performance is my favorite thing about the movie. Now the cute is isn't bad, either, but he did seem a bit like a cliché. The bottom line is that Tony needs to come, once again, to the aid of the world and in the process there are fifty bazillion stunts, explosions, MANY situations in which he could not possibly survive (yet he doeswhich makes little sense) and a lot of 3-D. Now the 3-D portion bothered me, as it really wasn't necessary for the film and didn't enhance or detract from my viewing at all. If I had the choice, I'd probably see the normal version simply because it's cheaper.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, where are the great AC/DC tunes? Instead, the soundtrack is okay but features songs by Dwight Yoakim. I am sure Yoakim is a nice guybut he's not AC/DC. So, in summary, I wanted more humor, less explosions, more plot and more AC/DC. If we can't have that, perhaps this should be the last film in the series—and the end does hint that that COULD be the case.maybe."

","First, I'd like to say I'm a comics reader for the last 30 years... although I can draw, I think the most important part of the comics are the stories. IMO, no point in good art and poor plot, but the opposite works most of the time. That being said (and Iron Man being one of my fav), I feel comfortable to point a few things about this movie.<br/><br/>I honestly was expecting a lot more. And this is not a conclusion, I felt this as I was seeing the movie. Teasers and trailers looked amazing, everything kids (even big ones like me) wanted. By the expectation, I was hoping to see a cool movie with lots of FX... all the FX are there, but this wasn't enough, the plot is too weak, poorly developed and rushed. There are explosions and armors everywhere, but not really a point for them to be there. The movie was shot in a way that looks confined, no big sets and nice landscapes too. In the end of the movie I had that feeling that nothing (that matters) really happened.<br/><br/>I'm also disappointed with the way some good Iron Man story arcs are smashed together in a plot full of things happening but for no real purpose. I recognized some armors from the comics... in the comics, the armors have a ""why"", they have a reason to exist and designed for a practical application, but the movie completely ignores that.<br/><br/>One other thing I like in Iron Man is the impossible technology based on ""possible"" technology (last 2 movies had some of this). This movie lacks this compromise with technology... the armor does things that had me thinking ""hey, how it did that? And why it had to be done that way?"", among tech things that wasn't supposed to work the way they did in the movie.<br/><br/>The main armor Tony uses is ugly. Can't tell much more about this or I'll spoiler this review, but it's ugly, what was Tony Stark thinking when he built that thing?<br/><br/>Worth seeing it? Only if you're not that familiar with Iron Man and/or want to see the cast (Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as usual, Sir Ben Kingsley is just amazing). And, as strange as it sounds, if you don't care too much about the whys and hows in technology.<br/><br/>I'm rating this as a 6 because the actors are good. By the story alone it would be a 3. At most."
"visseradw","5","18","42","24 April 2013"," Disappointing
","If you're going to see Iron Man 3, expect it to be very much unlike its two predecessors in terms of acting, story and development. It seems as though the writers forgot how to make an Iron Man movie and left us with a product that is far from what it could have been. <br/><br/>RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley and all the other actors put a lot of effort into making the plot believable, yet there is only so much a stellar cast can do with the messy, overly simplified and predictable script that they were given. Even RDJ's antics seems forced and unfunny at times. Story-wise, there's not much to it and it's safe to say they could have at least tried to make the villains somewhat menacing instead of hilarious and shallow.<br/><br/>The action sequences will compensate, right? Wrong. Even here, the movie manages to not make any sense. In Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4 (should there be one), it'd be great if the writers could agree on exactly how (in)destructible the suits are so as to not create rather sizable differences in 1 movie.<br/><br/>All in all, if this weren't an Iron Man movie it would be a sub-par action movie that nobody would really care about. As it stands, it's a sub-par Iron Man movie and people will see it. If you do, either lower your expectations or prepare to be disappointed."

","In Malibu, California, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has insomnia and along 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) on the New Year eve. <br/><br/>There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony's bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" is a disappointing adventure with a silly and forgettable story. The good cast and the top-notch CGI are unable to save this movie and are wasted in a poor screenplay. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Homem de Ferro 3"" (""Iron Man 3"")"

Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, great way to start off the summer blockbusters but it was a bit off from the way the trailers and posters made the film to be out. I had high expectations for this film and I have to say they were somewhat met. Though certain scenes were funny I honestly could not believe where the film ended up at.Trust me if you go see this film it will throw you off at some point and the post credits scene funny but disappointed a lot of people so I let you be the judge of that.

"mrs-moo-dude","4","9","18","30 April 2013"," Very Disappointing Marvel.
","First of all, the plot of this film was so jumpy - didn't know who was where due to bad pacing. One minute he's in Rose Hill - next he's in Miami. Way too disconnected,an unbalanced time frame which failed to suck me in.<br/><br/>In regards to the Mandarin plot twist - well that was just a downright insult to both Iron Man fans and Non-fans alike. WHO in their right mind allowed Shane Black to take the reigns on this one?<br/><br/>Plus the plot twist was revealed way too early, and the fact that they used a terrible comedy scene to reveal it was not the best way to get me drawn into the story. I was instead sat there with a blank expression - I couldn't believe what I was seeing.<br/><br/>Tony's resourcefulness I will agree on though - he had various tricks up his sleeve and that's what did it for me, it was one of the few things that kept me interested and one of the only parts of the film that felt like a true Iron Man movie.<br/><br/>The little kid Harley was so generic, I felt like I was watching family home alone movie again. He mainly existed to set Stark up for terrible one liners and did little else except deter the plot awfully.<br/><br/>Maya, Aldridge's assistant, could have been a much more crucial role too - the film spent half the time building her up to become a crucial element to the plot - only to throw her away after her sudden change of heart (you know, after 12+ years working for Aldridge.)<br/><br/>I understand she had become corrupted over a period of time getting lost in her work. So how can the film justify her sudden change of heart after a two sentence speech from Tony? Completely bad plot device and not useful.<br/><br/>The one liners in the film started off as funny, but soon became painfully unfunny and repetitive. It no longer felt like Stark had that classy sarcastic wit - instead he was just throwing out joke after joke which devalued his character we all grew to know and love.<br/><br/>There was so much room for deep, genuine heartfelt scripting and the film just passed these moments up to get a few cheap shock laughs from the audience - most of which didn't even have an impact.<br/><br/>They screwed this one up and I'm glad they aren't doing another one - I was happy with the ending though, it was the only way to truly finish Iron Man in style.<br/><br/>Marvel always has me leaving the cinema with an expression of awe.<br/><br/>But not this time, and for good reason."
"catohagen","4","9","18","30 April 2013"," The bastard child of Terminator 3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine
","Pre-release Thoughts: ""You know who I am."" - Yes, the third Iron Man flick! Yay! :)<br/><br/>""You don't know where I am."" - True, but I presume Marvel and Shane Black is laying the final touches on a new genre masterpiece! :)<br/><br/>Post-release Thoughts: ""You'll never see me coming!"" - You're right, I didn't. I really didn't. :( <br/><br/>Look, I am a huge Shane Black fan. I love ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang"" and thought the work he did on the ""Lethal Weapon"" films is great. Heck, I even like him as Hawkins in ""Predator"". I think the dude knows what he's doing most of the time. <br/><br/>I also really admire the work producer Kevin Feige has done so far with the Marvel properties. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, all great films. Even the flawed Hulk reboot had its moments. <br/><br/>When hearing that these guys were teaming up to give us a kick-ass third film in the Iron Man cinematic universe, my interest definitely rose. This had to be good. Also, coming out after the success of ""The Avengers"", I figured they would nail this one.<br/><br/>Then the trailers came out. Sir Ben Kingsley looked awesome as the menacing Mandarin and had some really memorable lines. In short, the marketing for this movie has been impeccable. So far, so good.<br/><br/>A few nights ago, I attended the midnight premiere of the film here in Norway. The audience was stoked. This was going to be epic.<br/><br/>Then the film started. For the next two plus hours, we were treated to one joke after another falling flat, a non-existent plot and characters that behaved completely out of style. As the credits rolled, I realized how Marvel, for the first time in years, had made a real dud of a movie.<br/><br/>In the other critical reviews here on IMDb you can read about all the plot holes, stupid jokes and bad character arcs, so I will not repeat all of them here. Just let me say that they are all right in their disdain for the choices made in this film. <br/><br/>Tony has a few scenes where he is a psychological mess and has anxiety attacks. None of these scenes really lead anywhere or happen when he is in danger, so their effect is nothing more than filler. <br/><br/>Happy Hogan is quite good as a comic relief, but is in the movie for 10 minutes total. His main objective from a plot perspective is to anger Tony to the extent that he loses it in front of the hospital in the following scene. Then Happy is out of the picture for almost the entirety of the film. <br/><br/>Pepper Potts also has a rather weird development in this film, and break well away from her arc in the other films. After falling 60 meters into an inferno of flames, she magically reappear unscathed a few minutes later. Given a similar scene with one of the bad guys earlier in the film, you could at first glance accept this from a pure referential plot perspective, but this is not a trained killer. This is Pepper Potts. <br/><br/>Adding insult to injury, she then know exactly how to avoid being shot by one of Stark's automated suits, before using Tony as a trampoline to impale said suit with her naked fist, ripping it to shreds and putting on one of its arms. Then she picks up a small rocket that magically falls out of the wreckage, hurls it at the main villain and blows it up mid-air with the hand repulsor. <br/><br/>A big applause to our new super hero, Ms Pepper Potts, Fireproof Iron Arm Lady! <br/><br/>This scene is so bad and out of character that it made me cringe. Apparently, Shane and Drew thought the same thing, as the next scene is Pepper returning to normal, shrinking with fear, saying: ""That was... so violent!"" However, they didn't change the scene in the script. <br/><br/>Then there is the Mandarin...<br/><br/>Look, I'm not really sure where to begin, so screw it. Once again I refer to the other reviews, you can read up on most of the silliness in regards to the character in those. What they did with the Mandarin and the potential in Sir Ben Kingsley is quite abysmal. <br/><br/>So, why the reference to ""Terminator 3"" and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" on top?<br/><br/>In ""Terminator 3"", the main villain is fireproof, can generate fire from her arms and is able to regenerate from explosions and wounds. So can the generic bad guys in ""Iron Man 3"".<br/><br/>The other reference has more to do with tone and atmosphere. The fourth X-men film has a messy script, with a lot of characters behaving weirdly, horrid editing, lame jokes and a twist that felt totally out of place. They also ruined the arc and motivations of a beloved Marvel character. All of these criticisms can also be made of ""Iron Man 3"". <br/><br/>Summary: <br/><br/>""Lesson number one: A great third Iron Man film? There is no such thing!""<br/><br/>This is not a great film at all. Nor a good one. The girl sitting next to me at the screening even had to ask her friends for group confirmation, not trusting her own judgment: ""That was...eh, cool,right? Right?""<br/><br/>In my eyes it's down there with the Star Wars prequels, Matrix 2 and 3 and Indiana Jones 4. In short, I don't view it as a legit movie in the franchise. It's more like an extremely expensive fan-made film, which just happen to star the same actors as the real deal. Avoid."

","The bit with the kid is probably the most nonsense of all. So, Stark breaks into a kids' basement and seems annoyed when the kid turns up to understandably challenge him, but warms when he sees the kid is clever and has made a jar-smashing potato gun as young arms manufacturers must be encouraged. The kid asks him who he is, then gives him a paper with his name and photo on the front page; didn't he look at it? Then he asks Stark his name; can't he read either? <br/><br/>Start doesn't care about how the kid and his mum are alone since the dad walked out and despite already trespassing and using the kids' equipment, demands various product-placement based items and a sandwich, and in return gives the kid some explosives to use on a bully which he only presumes exists (apparently the jar-smashing potato gun didn't ward them off) Then without informing the kids' mum and knowing he's in a bad mental state himself, may flip out and is being hunted by terrorists, takes the kid to town where he flips out and they're attacked by terrorists. <br/><br/>First he meets the mum of a bomber who just so happens to mistake him (despite him being all over the news since they think he's just been killed) for an FBI agent she happened to be meeting at exactly the same time and place, but who was oddly waylaid by walking away from the meeting place earlier and bumping into Stark, who realised she must be evil as she had a scar on her face (which incidentally doesn't make sense either as she had acquired the ability to regenerate her amputated arm but not the scar). When this fake agent tries to arrest Stark, showing a legit badge, the Sheriff, apparently drinking on the job and also unable to recognise the famous-and-just-recently-deceased Stark, challenges her, whereby she creates a scene which would've drawn attention to a years-old bomb plot which her people were getting away with up until that point. The kid is then almost killed but uses Stark's explosives on a terrorist, saving Stark's life, at which point Stark, knowing the kid is now a target and even more so as has the iron man suit, leaves him on his own without even replacing the explosives to defend himself with, basically because he's annoying. Stark then rings the kid when he's flipping out again so that the kid can remind him he can build stuff. So rather than just buying a gun to attack the terrorists, he makes a load of bombs and other stuff, which which he blows up security guards who may or may not be guarding the terrorists (the last time they tracked them, they were wrong, resulting in a mildly racist Arabic swear shop scene), in revenge for the terrorists inadvertently blowing up his security guard earlier on... because terrorism for the sake of revenge is OK.<br/><br/>So the moral of this story for mothers is; when a stranger breaks into your house, let him take your kid away to be attacked by terrorists and he'll be bought a new potato gun. As we've learned with the Jimmy Saville case, if the stranger's famous,and especially if he's rich, there's no danger. Let this be a lesson to all of us."

","This is a great movie, if you don't hate the action movie genre you'll most likely really enjoy it. If you liked Iron Man 1 but 2 not so much, you'll love 3. <br/><br/>Great acting by Downey Jr. as usual. He keeps true to the brilliant, egotistical but moral Tony Stark, now trying to cope without much success with all that happened during The Avengers (like the fact that there are aliens). Many more innovations to the Iron Man suits in this one since Stark uses that as a diversion from his troubles. Kingsley was probably underused but acted his part well, as did Paltrow and Guy Pearce. The action scenes were all non-routine, brilliant and well executed and were plenty. Jarvis kicks ass like always. <br/><br/>The plot I felt was quite good and not run of the mill at least as far as action flicks go. There was a good amount of emotional depth to the characters and their motives as well as a nice banter between Stark and some random kid he meets and a nice bit of comedy throughout the movie along with a twist in the middle and a few nice surprises here and there. <br/><br/>The 2 hrs just buzzed by and I would definitely end up watching this movie again.

","The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy. If it sounds and looks easy then one just needs to look at the many lesser films that are just a mess of CGI and emptiness.<br/><br/>This film sees Stark shut off and struggling with the mental fall-out of The Avengers film and at the same time a terrorist known as The Mandarin is staging attacks globally, building his threats directly at the US President. The plot here is quite a balancing act but it is one that it mostly pulls off. It needs there to be darker moments but for the comedy to still work; it needs there to be a serious ""real world consequences"" plot but for it to still work within the world of fantasy characters. It gets this balance mostly right and I found the film to have a good dark edge to it while ultimately still being funny and having an entertaining flow to it. Some inclusions don't work and the villains do feel like a bit of X-files at work, but in terms of providing action, thrills and entertainment, it does a very good job.<br/><br/>The cast do well but of course the film is Downey Jr's and he does it well despite having more to deliver. His conflicting comedy arrogance and haunted-psyche works pretty, mostly because of his presence and delivery. Paltrow is so-so and she doesn't have many times to mix chemistry with the star. Pearce is OK but not given enough time to justify his character but Kingsley is fun in all the different ways he is asked to deliver! Hall, Cheadle, Dale, Sadler and Favreau all give good support but the latter does feel a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>It is still a summer blockbuster, so your sights should be set accordingly, but it is a good one in that it delivers robust entertainment across the board with a nicely dark tone complimenting effects, action sequences and comedy."
"ivo_shandor","5","10","21","30 May 2013"," One of the biggest disappointments...
","I'll say this...this movie has two good action scenes...and that's it. Iron Man 3 has one of the worst twists for a comic book movie. Turns out the Mandarin isn't the Mandarin, he's an actor pretending to be the head of a terrorist group. I'm surprised more people aren't mad about this. This is blatant false advertising. We were promised the climax of Iron Man vs. Mandarin, instead we get a mad scientist who breathes fire. Our main villain breathes fire...that's the worst comic cliché you could have, especially for a movie...didn't we stop with powers like that in the 50s? I was really let down by this movie. The main villain isn't supposed to be a robot, clone or hologram. Hey guys, guess what, Darth Vader was actually just a hologram built by the Emperor...or wait, Dr. Doom was actually an alien in a body like in Men In Black? That is the dumbest idea for a villain ever conceived, and this isn't the first blatant attempt. That's just insulting our intelligence.<br/><br/>Also, you're telling me the group in the first movie have no leader, they're just some guys in the desert with no purpose in the span of three films? Has anyone noticed the trend of ""villains with a twist"" in movies nowadays? In Prometheus, Guy Pearce appears as Weyland, and no one cared he was there, and then no one cared when they revealed his daughter, for no apparent reason, and then no one cared when he died. Dark Knight Rises, Talia al Ghul, who everyone say coming, appears in the last 20 minutes of the movie, basically as a ""oh and by the way, I'm the villain."" Bane, who according to the trailers, we were promised was the villain, turns out is not the mastermind we were all promised, but a sideshow character and lovesick puppy dog taking orders... Plus Bane is killed off in the most anti-climactic way possible. Same thing happened with Mandarin in Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Mandarin is revealed to be an actor, when according to the trailers, we were all promised the fight between Stark and the Mandarin....way to false advertise Marvel. We had false advertising for two main villains in blockbuster movies. I'm surprised more people aren't outraged at these filmmakers who think they're trying to be clever. Their work comes off as jumbled and disrespectful to the source material, plus they don't hesitate to insult your intelligence. Joseph Gordon Levitt also comments about chasing large alligators in the sewers in the third movie. This is Nolan making fun of Batman and Killer Croc...Nolan thinks Batman and Superman should be realistic...these are comic book characters...what makes them so fascinating is that they are not realistic.<br/><br/>Villains aren't supposed to be revealed as a clone, or robot, or android, or someone from the future, it's a cliché that give comics a bad rap. Villains should be an imposing threat to the hero."

Nevertheless, it has some deep insights and is concentrated more on the people and relationships than the others.

More importantly, it is not the massiveness of the scenes themselves that makes them epic, but it is the choreography of the fighting. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it deepens on the relationship of Tony and Pepper, which has escalated steadily throughout the series + the Avengers.

Also, let me say up front that I do not care about accuracy to the comic books, but I do care about consistency between the movies. <br/><br/>I'll start with the good:<br/><br/><ul><li>The acting all around was good. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI was excellent. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I liked the twist with the Mandarin and the possibilities with the media distorting reality. However, I can understand the whole Mardarin twist being a negative for many people as well, especially given the fact that magical-like power had already been established previously in Thor and the Avengers. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All of the references to the Avengers movie and the references to Iron-Man 1. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The realism of Tony dealing with PTS and working through his mental struggles. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The skydiving scene was very cool. </li></ul><br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/><ul><li>Tony having the chest piece completely removed at the end of the movie. Whether or not you like Iron Man 2 or not, the fact is that it happened and much of the story in the movie revolved around Tony dying from Palladium poisoning, trying to find and alternative power source, all of Tony's reckless activities due to the idea of dying, discovering a new element to replace Palladium, etc. If he could just have a surgery and have the chest piece removed then most of that movie goes away. And, I had someone say that he was able to do it now because of the Extremis program. If that were true then that does not work either because he would not need a surgery at all if that were the case. Did all the Extremis people who got repeatedly shot need surgery to remove the bullets...no. So he shouldn't need a surgery either to remove shrapnel if Extremis was the answer, which the movie gives you no reason to think that was the case anyways. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Prior to this movie it was always made clear that the chest piece in Tony was powering his suit. They have completely ignored that fact in this movie. As a result for a lot of the movie his suit never reaches full charge and therefore is constantly in a weakened state, so he went backwards on his design. I understand that the new suit did need to have a certain level of internal power to allow it to fly to him and to allow it to suit him up, but beyond that is should have been powered by his chest piece as was established previously. I'm sure they did this to set up the ending for the removal of the chest piece, but come on. Again, another consistency issue. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As others have mentioned there is just not enough Iron Man. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All the controlling of the suit remotely. I actually liked the idea of him being able to control the suit with his thoughts, but they took it too far. There was already a lack of Iron Man in the movie, but on top of it most of the times when we did see Iron Man it was just the suit with Tony controlling remotely. This is ridiculous. A lot of the appeal of Iron Man is having the guy inside the suit. I really hope this does not become a trend for Iron Man going forward. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The craziness with Tony giving out his address on TV. Really? Because anyone and everyone who wanted to get his address couldn't find it out on their own without being told, especially terrorists who had the technology to block out the television airways and had the means to get into the President's cell phone. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tony publicly announces that he is coming after the Mandarin to kill him after Happy is put in the hospital. Don't you think he would have gone home and made his suit battle ready as quickly as possible or change to a suit that was battle ready? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When they are being attacked by the helicopters at his house he had the suits that he could have called as he did at the end, but didn't...why? Oh yeah, because it would take away from the climax of the movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The little kid brought nothing to the movie and was totally unnecessary. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Extremis group was taken too far with giving them super strength, breathing fire from their mouths, etc. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Extremis research took years upon years to get sort of working, but still not perfect. Then Tony comes along when Pepper is the only one left and in the blink of an eye he can just fix her like it was nothing, effectively wiping out a major part of the movie like it never happened. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The climax with all the Iron Man suits seemed good at first, but it was taken too far over the top.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too much humor. The previous movies with Iron Man (1,2, and Avengers) seemed to do the humor well with it coming across as natural. Iron Man 3 often times felt like forced humor for the sake of trying to get humor into a given situation.</li></ul><br/><br/>In any case, this is my opinion on the movie. I just expected more from Iron Man 3."

","I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.<br/><br/>Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.<br/><br/>As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books."
"richenstony","3","8","16","2 May 2013"," This isn't Iron man , Its SOILD CRAP
","Truly one of the biggest let downs of the year. I went to see ironman fight a bunch of bad guys , not get depression and anxiety attacks over the events that took place in The avengers film. Where all human granted , but Tony Stark is on a higher level than the rest of us. His super Intelligence really does contradict his emotions in this film. The level of action in it is so poor , i mean i timed it at 31 minutes worth of decent action and even then that wasn't to a high standard.<br/><br/>Why is it every film i choose to see in 3D ends up being a massive let down! I hate having that feeling in the back of my head craving a reboot already , because its absurd to think this brilliant film franchise would need one. But the 3rd installment was just complete pants , it made no sense and it just baffled me how a script like this was allowed to be acted out and put onto the big screen without a second thought for the Junkies who crave to see the creations of Tony Starks work. Its exactly like seeing the new bond films remove all the gadgets and trying to turn the franchise into something its not. MATURE!<br/><br/>I hope the Thor sequel prevails because this crap has really upset me.<br/><br/>24 pounds 42 pence for 2 adult tickets!<br/><br/>Refund please MR stark i know your good for it!"
"celtictony","4","8","16","29 April 2013"," Why.......
","I'm going to get straight into this, this movie is essentially the kid that killed the mother (Avengers) when born and the father (Us) will never forgive them for. OK there is a few good points I liked that Tony Stark was Tony Stark in this movie, no Armour just him also TDKR done it better but there is a few in fact a lot of bad points, like how Pepper 'Dies' and like right after it Tony says something in a rather humours tone to Guy Pierce. I'm like at this point...'Your love of your life has 'Died' and you are full of grief and your like B**** PLEASE sorta way.<br/><br/>The whole Mandarin Twist thing made me wanna spew all over the person in front of me I'm like you have made fun of the most memorable character in Iron Man he doesn't have any memorable villains and you crap all over his name. No it doesn't end there see Maya Hansen when she dies I'm laughing in the cinema because how essentially worthless she was. Also Yensid was there at the start as some sort of closure type thing which was totally unneeded. Also the plot was totally disjointed one minute Tennessee then Miami all for the sake of the plot. The Hulks transformation in Avengers made more sense than that.<br/><br/>I liked the SFX it's good but not as good as some movies. I have seen quite recently.<br/><br/>With Tony's whole surgery at the end was totally stupid when he was dying in the second one he could have got the surgery then but no it had to have some sort of end if you like.<br/><br/>Also when the vice-president got arrested I thought what are the motives for this then after thinking I realised that when the president was supposed to die he was to be the next president because he wanted power. That should have been explained before or later in the movie.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a four out of ten because I like Don Cheadle is a F****** and Gwyneth Paltrow is HOT. <br/><br/>P.S Even though i find her hot I don't agree that she is the HOTTEST Woman on Earth."

","At first I thought, hmm interesting what a nice change of direction, a mixture of a love rivalry in he brilliant form of guy Pearce, and a past from one of the many mistakes he's surly made from his drunken pre-pepper Lothario days, coming back to haunt him in more than one way than another.<br/><br/> that is until after the first public bombing, where tension and hist-aria could  obviously build reverts and suddenly its just as if the writing staff were wiped  out in the bombing, a new team took a collective unmistakable sigh at new orders, and everything takes a massive step into the predictable, special effects bonanza for the unthinking masses, where the bad guy has more in common with a t1000, or scorpion from mortal combat than man and reality, but its not just that, there is just no continuity with the bad guys where 1 shot kills an infused character, yet you get another who goes on limbless forever.<br/><br/>They could have done something brilliant here which could have rejuvenated the series, where the good guy doesn't always win, it could have helped shape countless future story lines, and done something intelligent for a  change and helped state a fact that life is not just black and white, it try's to do too much, in too little time, and its a worser movie for it. <br/><br/>The biggest surprise is the lack of humor that was a stablemate of the series it's not funny in avengers style, it's not funny period, the only real joke is after the credits, an thats only an in-joke for people who have followed the series. <br/><br/>when is Hollywood  going to realize we need something more than a half baked idea, I challenge any executive board and say a script like this isn't just not good enough any more and send it back for more for much need work.<br/><br/> I know it's an action movie, i know its a marvel, but should it be so hard to have a real, intelligent story line for a change, whilst wavy in a lot of places the avengers is a shining example of what is possible and prove that action movies can once again win awards for something other than special effects, you go into this movie expecting to be entertained, but sadly the only thing you come out with is feeling numb, even by Marvell arc standards this is poor relation.

","I was excited to go see this, yet the movie was terrible and as stated previously is more like a parody to iron man. Don Cheadle was the best part of the film. Surprising since in Iron man 2 replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle seemed terrible. They ruined the Villains and tried with out success to make iron man 3 a comedy movie rather than action. The story was slow to progress in attempt at a build up. I was left waiting for the movie to get good, just to be let down at a certain point in the film. Which ruined anything good about the film. I was tempted to leave the movie but stayed to see if they had some awesome twist that might some how magically save the film. Yet there was not one. I give this film a 1 out of 10. My opinion is that this is the worst Avenger related film yet."
"pb-kubilay","10","11","24","1 May 2013"," awesome!
","It can be the most gripping film I've ever seen. You can't get your eyes away from the movie. Acting and special effects are amazing. I am a big fan of Robert Downey Jr who had also starred in Sherlock Holmes. I also watched Iron Man and Iron Man 2. I was waiting for this movie. Some people think it is awful but I can recommend it to everybody. It is a spectacular film because it's not dull, slow and predictable. So, I suggest you to watch it. I might love this film because of the love I have towards Robert Downey Jr. The man is funny. When I watched Sherlock Holmes, I was impressed immediately too. Let's all get ready for a great film! Everybody should see Iron Man 3!"
"nagyistvanandor","3","9","19","18 May 2013"," A good superhero movie made for everyone... except the FANS!
","Its a very conflicting movie. There is only one thing for sure, if you know Iron Man and his story outside the silver screen (like from comic- books or cartoons), the chance that you will hate this movie is almost guaranteed. Its actually damn hard to write this review cause if I put a side that its suppose to be a Iron Man movie, further more a Iron Man movie including one of the most Iconic characters of the tale (Mandarin) than I could speak about many positive things. I think the actors where amazing, the story most of the time was very creative and well put together, and overall a enjoyable movie. But I can't really do that, cause its a Iron Man movie which was promoted with Mandarin, and from this view point... its a joke. And I put this quite politely. <br/><br/>If you don't know a thing about Iron Man, and the original story, and just go in the cinema wanting to watch a summer block buster, you probably going to have a good time. <br/><br/>If you know Iron Man, and go in the cinema with expecting Iron Man will face his arch-nemesis on the silver-screen. You will hate it. And you will be right too do so.<br/><br/>I only give this movie 3 star cause as I said if it would be a James Bond movie for example, the plot, ideas, story, acting, visual effects would deserve at least 7 star. But since its not, and promoted it self as something which the movie fail to deliver, or deliver it as the parody of what it should have been, spiced with some very questionable decision and plot holes it would deserve actually 1 star. It really feels like the creators where flipping off the main audience they meant to do this movie for.<br/><br/>So to sum it up: if your a fan of Iron Man, as odd it sounds you should avoid this movie. If your not a fan, and don't know much about the world and the title character you have a good chance to enjoy what the movie has to offer."
"griffolyon12","7","9","19","3 May 2013"," This is not the Iron Man film you were hoping for
","The thing with Iron Man 3 is not that it's bad, it's actually enjoyable and quite good as a whole, but after following up The Avengers, it feels as if it's a little bit of a let down.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 picks up right after The Avengers, with Tony Stark experiencing post traumatic stress disorder from the events of that previous movie. When a terrorist calling himself the Mandarin, who is like Bin Laden's evil twin, starts wreaking havoc, Tony Stark embarks on a manhunt to bring the Mandarin down.<br/><br/>The returning cast is all exceptional, with Robert Downey, Jr., once more anchoring the film with equal parts wit, charm, and heart. The new cast members, from Rebecca Hall to Guy Pearce, are all good, but none of their characters are really quite as charismatic or as likable as the returning characters, or the supporting characters from the previous Iron Man movies for that matter (I personally miss Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer). As for Sir Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, he turns in a really great performance, but I'll just say this, if you're a fan of the comic books, you will be flat out disappointed by this representation of the Mandarin. Let's just say Marvel really let one of Iron Man's most iconic villains slip through the cracks here. He could have been as awesome of a villain as Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, but Marvel just wasted the brilliant set-up for the character.<br/><br/>While the film often struggles to justify why this movie is the perfect follow-up to The Avengers, Iron Man 3 excels in asking the central question: Is Iron Man the suit, or is he Tony Stark? This is the most character centric of all of the Marvel movies made thus far, and in that arena it does not disappoint. I would wager at least 90% of the movie, Tony Stark is without his Iron Man suit and is having to save the day using just his wits, this leads to the greatest moments of the film where Tony Stark crash lands in small town Tennessee and recruits the help of a young boy to get back on his feet again. These are the moments where Iron Man 3 feels the most true and authentic to what I think Marvel and director Shane Black were going for, unfortunately the script often feels the pressure to make this a Summer blockbuster and therefore flips back into relentless action mode without ever truly giving a definitive moment where Tony gets over his PTSD. Plus, am I the only one that thinks the way Tony's suits fly around and attach to his body is getting a little ridiculous? Sure it looks cool, but come on.<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, Iron Man 3 is a worthwhile Summer blockbuster, featuring inventive action sequences and some genuinely funny moments, but it doesn't quite measure up to the previous three movies featuring Iron Man. As is evidenced by the brilliant post- credits scene, perhaps it's best just to only make more movies starring Iron Man when he's playing with the rest of the Avengers.<br/><br/>I give Iron Man 3 a 7 out of 10!"
"Troy_Campbell","6","9","19","25 April 2013"," Good, but not good enough.
","This threequel is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated cinematic events of 2013, what with The Avengers blowing everyone's mind last year. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that it doesn't live up to those lofty expectations, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing. Let me clarify straight away, IM3 is not a bad movie, it's still enjoyable and has patches of genuine awesomeness, but when judged within the recent Marvel canon, it sadly sits at the lower end of the scale. <br/><br/>On board for the first time is writer-director Shane Black, and although he largely fails to improve on the last Iron Man outing, he certainly makes some daring choices. For starters the story goes much, much darker. This franchise has never shied away from tackling tough content - alcoholism, manufacturing weapons for war, daddy issues - but the PTSD-centric plot here is the most serious yet, occasionally to its own detriment. There's plenty of well-timed (and at times hilariously inappropriate) humour sprinkled throughout, but there's still a feeling that Marvel's trademark light touch is completely missing from Black's effort. He doesn't go full Nolan, but the tone is definitely in a different, and for me unwanted, ballpark to the original Iron Man.<br/><br/>Being a superhero flick there are of course many action sequences and swathes of CGI coolness, both largely pulled off with aplomb despite a flawed employment of 3D. An opening scene featuring Tony fiddling around with a new suit has some startling subpar visual effects, however this is thankfully a standalone mistake in the CGI department with the remainder of the film boasting top notch computer trickery. The picture's first real set piece, the destruction of Tony's Malibu pad, is decent without being great, but by the time we've had a vertiginous attack on Air Force One and reached the climactic showdown boasting dozens of varying Iron Man suits, Black finally nails it. <br/><br/>Also nailing it, Robert Downey Jr embodies the conflicted, haunted genius with such confident and charismatic ease he has now reached a point where he simply is Tony Stark. Alongside him in what is her biggest role in the series, Gwyenth Paltrow clearly relishes the opportunity to not only sink her teeth into a meatier Pepper arc, but to also get among the action - stealing the single most awesome moment in the movie in the process. Don Cheadle is solid as Stark's besty Col Rhodes, aka Iron Patriot, in an underwritten part, whilst Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce are on usual fine form as, respectively, the mysterious terrorist Mandarin and the megalomaniac scientist Aldrich Killian. Although it must be said that I found the Mandarin's character twist utterly stupid.<br/><br/>This trilogy closer is a good movie, but by Marvel's standards, also not good enough."

","""Iron Man"" was one of the best superhero movies I had ever seen & ""Iron Man 2"" was a worthy sequel, despite many disagreeing. But some of the early information regarding ""Iron Man 3"" surrounding it's new, darker tone & the eventual trailers got me worried. It felt like the creators of ""IM 3"", like those from ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", wanted to go ""Dark Knight' style too much.<br/><br/>But like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", the darker tone didn't really distract from the actual film. Still, ""Iron Man 3"" doesn't live up to it's two predecessors.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's talent is just wasted as his potentially larger then life villainous character known as ""The Mandarin"" is subjected to a quasi ""Batman Begins""-style twist & reduced to a drunk actor who doesn't know what's going on. On top of that the real Mandarin, Aldrich Killian (a very good Guy Pearce)is interesting enough to hold your attention, but his motivations just aren't there. They just aren't. So his plan is to kill the Vice president & then take over the US government? Really? Is this the Avengers version 1.5 or something? Loki's ambition on a smaller scale? Ah, whatever...<br/><br/>I was also surprised by the more graphic violence in relation to the two previous films. I don't mind graphic violence when it's done with caution & wit, but it just seems out of place in an Iron Man/Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Redeeming factors are the solid performances of the actors (especially Robert Downey Jr.)& the well staged action sequences, but at the end of the day I'll probably watch Iron Man 1 & 2 more then this one."

","Iron Man 3 is a below average Action movie designed for audience with low IQ's and Alzheimer's, or both. The dialogue is so bad that it will have you vomiting with embarrassment for the poor cast, especially Robert Downey Jr. I don't know when Hollywood action movies got this retarded exactly but, there's no going back now. This is Retarded! The movie has no real drama or excitement, because suddenly the hero has up to 20 Iron Man suits flying around, remotely controlled, ruining all logic and believability. Thus making this movie entirely dull. There's a scene where he meets a kid on the street, he's 11 or 12, he helps him out, suddenly two scenes later, the kid knows how to operate Hi-Tech machinery, laptops, coding etc, and remotely helps Tony Stark with his flying Iron Man suits. Ridiculous! Laughable crap. This movie may have been written by Homer Simpson. Seriously. If you want a decent action/Sci-fi movie go see Star Trek."
"SforSmile","5","7","14","6 May 2013"," Not worthy of the hype!
","Lured into the movie theater by the very high average value of nearly 80 % at Rotten Tomatoes and 7,8/10 points at IMDb as well as by the huge box office success, I was nothing but disappointed of what, according to lots of other reviews, was supposed to be a ""witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon"" (Rotten Tomatoes), and unfortunately turned out being a - for about two thirds of the runtime - mostly dull, uninteresting, unfunny, silly, unimportant, overlong, plot-holed, Marvel-canon-breaking, and unnecessary blockbuster that, although admittedly upgraded by well-done action sequences, cannot be otherwise described than with the word: ""mediocre"" and therefore does not deserve more than 5 points.<br/><br/>Now, let me sum up the movie without giving away any spoilers: Babble, babble, babble - action sequence - more uninteresting babbling - oh, a dull twist! - more action - another forced surprise - babble, babble, babble and finally the bombastic finale with lots of explosions and a bunch of Iron Men bustling around in the air like a cluster of flies.<br/><br/>I'm sure that a great deal of more people would see the dump mediocrity of the plot if it weren't for the action scenes and most of all the charisma of Robert Downey Jr. whose sheer presence carries the movie like Atlas carried the entire globe on his back and yet he as well is far away from being as funny and entertaining as he used to be in his first appearance as Tony Stark. The so-called love story between him and Pepper Potts, tolerably played by Gwyneth Paltrow, leaves you cold as it is with the super villain who is just a huge blatherer.<br/><br/>All in all, you have to be very patient with the movie until it gains momentum during the last 30 minutes or so where you can be assured that you don't have to try finding any sense and significance in all this any more, because there never was any, but simply lean back and enjoy the action pleasantly aware that it's going to be over soon...<br/><br/>Phase two of the Marvel franchise had a weak beginning, very weak."

","I found Iron man 3 the worst one... the suit kept braking all the time, the whole movie had like a million and 1 plot holes ... the more i think about the plot of the movie in detail the more plot holes I find and the more annoyed and angered I get especially at the fact that most of this could of been avoided had they not made a joke of the main mandarin villain...<br/><br/>the trailer was also false advertising because it lie's to viewer showing a much more serious and darker film with all powerful and extremely intellectual and smart bad guy that for once has his own army yet not real...which was the main intrigue from the trailer and﻿ in my opinion the main reason why a lot of people will go to watch the movie... <br/><br/>the jokes were no where as funny as in iron man 1 or two... tony stark was a cocky funny millionaire playboy philanthropist yet sounded like an everyday person compared to the previous movies and especially the avengers where i believe his jokes and his lines were the most funny ...<br/><br/>and the whole film felt rushed or extremely badly edited as all characters were all over the place ...one minute a character is in one place and before you realize their already somewhere else with their own mood with little explanation as the pace of the movie is extremely quick in a bad way...iron man 3 is hard to follow and I found myself bored halfway as I came to watch iron man and only got him for 20 minutes of the film as he barely wears the suit apart from towards the end which was the best part of the movie... plus his suit kept braking and fair enough hit was a prototype but he had more than 40 suits that were not prototypes and were ready <br/><br/>why could he have just used the suits that were functional and ready instead ? <br/><br/>why did he not call all of his 40 suit army when the supposed mandarin was destroying his house and yet called all the suits at the end?? <br/><br/>how could iron man/ tony start so easily remove the arc reactor from his chest and the shrapnel from his heart if in iron man 2 he was dieing from the radiation it gave to his body and he had to invent his own element to fix it? why couldn't he have removed the arc reactor then when it was killing him in iron man 2 if it was so easy? they don't explain...<br/><br/>also the main powers of the bad guys were barely explained all we knew was there was this ""extremis"" virus that made regrow limbs, breath fire and burn and explode if becoming out of control... <br/><br/>what also doesn't make sense is how iron man could have been hit by Thor in the avengers using lightning and barely nothing happen to his suit yet here there people who have burning powers and could melt his suits by just touching them ? sorry but which is worse ? lightning or fire ? also<br/><br/>Thor hits iron man's suit with his godly hammer ""mjolnir"" so hard that it sends him off in the other direction only to see iron man fly back and hit Thor without any problem,s yet his suit in iron man 3 brakes to pieces when hit by a normal car in iron man 3?? that makes no sense...<br/><br/>how could marvel have accepted this script... the first movie of marvel studios with such a rushed and filled with plot holes script with so many places making zero sense what so ever...<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of 10 due to the great effects but the plot was bullshit... and believe me... this is coming from a person who is a big big fan of the marvel cinematic universe and who's favorite her out of hawk eye, black widow, iron man, captain America, hulk and Thor IS actually IRON MAN and has been waiting in patiently for this movie since it was announced only to be extremely let down...<br/><br/>i think ""shane black"" ruined this movie and they should get ""jon"" ""favreau"" back or get ""joss"" ""whedon"" to take care of iron man franchise instead as it IS their most popular and financially successful hero by FAR..."

","So I usually don't write reviews for flicks, but as a comic book fan, I've gotta speak up about this one.<br/><br/>Sadly, I was swept away with all the hype for Iron Man 3, and sadly, I can't get my money back. <br/><br/>There was a lot of potential for this movie to do great, for example: Tony is dealing with his PTSD from the New York incident (that scene where he's signing the autograph for the kids and it just comes out as ""Help me, Emma"", yeah, creepy)<br/><br/>The terrorist group that held Tony hostage in the first movie was cleverly named ""The Ten Rings"", which could have easily fit into a well written storyline for the Mandarin if you still wanted to go in the whole direction of ""Boo terrorism, yay America"" <br/><br/>Even if you wanted to stray away from the terrorism plot and pull out something more traditional for Iron Man's GREATEST RIVAL, there's tons of reference for that in the comics; you know, those paper things that the movie is supposedly based on? <br/><br/>Instead, what we got was very broken story telling, inappropriately placed comedy, flaws in continuity from previous films and plot holes, plot holes, plot holes! <br/><br/>I was hoping for this movie to be The Dark Knight for the Iron Man franchise, but sadly, I got The Dark Knight Rises."
"johnnymacbest","5","7","14","2 May 2013"," A real ass wiper.
","After the disappointing Iron Man 2, I came into this film with high expectations. Needless to say, I am profoundly and utterly in shock at how average the movie is. It's not that it's all bad per se, but the screenwriters thought that by putting lots of comedy in an action movie juxtaposed with the seriousness and verisimilitude of a Tom Clancy novel that this would work. It didn't. The little side-kick kid was absolutely terrible; although I don't know if it was a cheap gimmick to get more parents with their kids to see it, or cater to that specific demographic, I'm not sure. But they need to stop. I wouldn't have minded if said side-kick was a teenager or someone in their early 20's, THAT would've made a whole lot of sense. All I could say is what was Shane Black thinking?!?!?! This film would've been a lot better if they skimmed the comedy bits and focused more on the story and characters; especially the villains. Although the special effects and action are really impressive, they cannot make up for the uneven and disorienting screenplay.<br/><br/>I don't know what to think. Should you skip this movie? Tough choice, but all if you want is something to pass the time, then go for it.(I recommend the matinée) If you're the kind of person that wants story and character development above all else, then you will be disappointed. It's a shame really because Iron Man is a really cool superhero and the first film was a blast to watch. It's MILES ahead better than this one. You're probably better off watching the first film, or wait for Star Trek: Into Darkness or the eagerly anticipated Man of Steel. Iron Man has depth and integrity along with a high dash of wit and charm. Yes the charm is there, but there's no juicy meat."

","Iron Man 3 is first installation from Marvel Studios after more than great The Avengers. Everyone knows that is hard to go on from such successful movie, even at Marvel Studios, so they put out their strongest weapon from Avengers team, Iron Man.<br/><br/>Trailers have been promising, showing that movie will be a little bit darker than previous two (like Dark Knight trilogy) and that Iron Man will have to face his biggest enemy The Mandarin. Movie starts good with few flashbacks from the past and introducing us two of the main characters Aldrich Killian (solid performance by Guy Pearce) and The Mandarin (Sir Ben KIngsley). Like I said it started promising, first half of the movie is amazing. But then it goes wrong, really wrong.<br/><br/>I am not really familiar with Iron Man mythology, but i know one thing: The Mandarin is Iron Mans biggest enemy. He is like Joker to Batman or Lex Luthor to Superman. But what did writers do? They made horrible twist which tells us that Mandarin is just a drunk junkie actor who is payed to act a terrorist and he has no powers at all. I think that every Iron Man fan should be insulted. This was the first lie from trailers and from advertised storyline. Next thing is atmosphere. Most of people predicted that atmosphere will be dark, but it finds out that movie is almost a comedy. First that ""Mandarin"" twist, then some things in final fight but I wont spoil the movie even more. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are good things of the movie. Robert Downey Junior is amazing as always, Ben Kingsley played his role really good too (scenario is bad, not his performance). Don Cheadle gives solid performance too and he deserves more screen time. Action sequences are good.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie was a big disappointment for me because, it had so potential, but instead of that it ruined Iron Man franchise and showed no respect for work of its creators."

Fine. 5 more lines to go right? Okay. I will ensure I waste some time along with your wasted talent and budget. You asked for it. Now face my music. I promise I won't be harsh. And unlike you I will hold good on my promise. With all your experience and skill, why couldn't you see that the majority of the modern audience will not take gladly to such a deceiving trailer? I love IronMan and I love the Marvel Universe. But why? Why oh why? The storyline had so much good going for it. I feel you guys have tricked Sir Kingsley too somewhere. Favreau, your amazing and so is Black in his own right. But I guess you did not give him enough tips. You could have kept two villains and achieved a lot more. Mandarin, the arch enemy and Killian his accomplice. How could Kevin Feige even allow this? All you had to do was hold good on your word. Here's my take after I saw the movie. Mandarin: 'You'll never see me coming.' Tony Stark: Bitch Please! No one wants to see you Coming.' (Pun intended) This is me in a light mood. You don't wanna see me get rude. I gave you a 6/10 cause I belong to the industry and I know it takes a great deal. Also, I paid for 3 shows but attended only one. Unfortunate for me. Consider that a donation to make a better movie next time. I still love y'all for what you do. One word of advice from what I have learned in my short life.

"PeriSubhash","6","5","9","28 April 2013"," Suits, suits and more suits. Plot.. Plot.. what the heck was that?
","Iron Man 3 Review: This may contain a few spoilers.<br/><br/>Here comes another Iron Man movie, the 7th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director Shane Black who earlier paired with Robert Downey for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang has put commendable effort to make this one look better than the previous Iron Man movie.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr was once gain flawless as the billionaire tech guy Tony Stark. There were more suits in the movie, Mark 42 suit was the most concentrated one. Pepper Potts was good and so was Colonel Rhodes. Guy Pearce was too good as Aldrich Killian of Advance Idea Mechanics, but portraying himself as Mandarin wasn't that good. One shall not mess up with the comic plots just because you're making a movie adaptation. Good to see Guy Pearce in a fierce role.<br/><br/>Sir Ben Kingsley above all was just fantastic, his wits, humor.. everything about his role was just awesome. Him portraying as supposed Mandarin was too good until he was depicted as not the real mandarin, that made me sad. But on any day an actor like Kingsley can be the best villain especially for a Marvel character.<br/><br/>There wasn't much 3D effects and so it goes too good on 2D too. Worth watching twice but no more than that. And I still don't understand why the director/screen writers didn't concentrate on the terrorist group ""Ten Rings"" but yet chose mandarin as the antagonist.<br/><br/>There was so much room for deep heartfelt moments to bank on based on what was shown in the trailers and the film just passed these moments up to get a few cheap laughs from the audience. But the last 20 minutes were just awesome. And oh yeah.. Tony Stark gets the shrapnel removed from his heart, no more use of the palladium.<br/><br/>Expected more for a Iron Man movie but it wasn't. I hope in the future, screen writers don't depict their own comic plot lines. Perhaps they need to get some tips from Nolan bros or David S.Goyer or Joss Wheaon. Better improvement than the previous one but the first one remains the best. The Avengers was an Iron Man 3, this is just sort of a 4th one. Would like to see another IM film one after Avengers 2.<br/><br/>I go for a 7 out of 10."
"Joejoesan","7","12","28","21 April 2013"," Entertaining, but don't expect more than that
","Ever since I saw the first trailers I was dying to see Iron Man 3. And that's where it all went wrong, I guess. If you expect too much from this film – like me - you'll be disappointed for sure. Well, at least a little. Not that Iron Man 3 is a bad movie. It's entertaining alright. But especially the beginning is rather shaky. The motives of both the hero (Tony Stark) and the villain to join the party are not that strong. It's also a 'been there, done that' kinda thing. Except for Iron Man 'using the Force', his panic attacks and his love for Pepper not much has changed. But let's start at the beginning.<br/><br/>After the events of The Avengers in New York Tony Stark is restless. He can't sleep and he gets panic attacks whenever the subject comes up. Enter The Mandarin. In good Middle Eastern terrorist fashion this villain with-the-rather-strange-non-Middle-Eastern accent threatens America with attacks and other misery. This does not affect Tony until The Mandarin puts a dear friend of our billionaire hero in the hospital. And no, the victim is not Pepper (thank god!). Tony wants revenge but makes the mistake of mentioning his home address on national television. The result: the helicopter attack on his estate that can be seen in the trailer (which is pretty spectacular). Of course Tony escapes. Without his lab and with only one Iron Man prototype suit that he could save, Tony begins a quest to find the Mandarin. But very soon he finds out that all tracks lead to someone else, a person he led down several years ago and now wants to get even.<br/><br/>Although The Mandarin shows some serious terrorist actions, the tone of Iron Man 3 is much lighter and more humorous than part 2. Tony has to do some hero stuff without his Iron Man armor and this forces him to work together with 'normal' people (and one crazy fan). At the end he and James Rhodes form a nice team and they ultimately save the day. Overall there's more charm in Iron Man 3. At times part 2 took itself too seriously, I think.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that Tony had to work outside the safety of his lab and use his wits to come up with a plan to defeat the bad guy(s). I liked the character of The Mandarin, very well played by Ben Kingsley. The twist in his story was a nice one. I'm not familiar with the comics, but this one came as a complete surprise. <br/><br/>Is it a spoiler to say that the real villain in this movie is Guy Pearce? Maybe. Fact is that I did not understand his real motives to take a swing at Tony in this movie. Does he want his help? Does he want to destroy Iron Man? Or is he just after the president? Money? Something else? Guy Pearce's character, an inventor/businessman/scientist called Killian, is experimenting with altering DNA in the brain. Somehow he has created this invincible glow-in-the-dark army that can absorb energy, much like Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four. Come to think of it, there's more Marvel déjà vu in Iron Man 3. Lessons from Curt Connors from The Amazing Spider-Man movie for instance. Mutants. And in the end a female character even does a little 'Femke Janssen Phoenix' trick.<br/><br/>One last big letdown: the Air Force One scene, which was destined to be one of the highlights of the movie. In the trailer we learn that there was a hole in the aircraft and several people were sucked outside. Iron Man wants to rescue them but he can only carry four or five persons in the air. And there are at least ten victims out there! Holy macaroni, what will he do? Tony Stark's solution is pretty dumb and unrealistic. It reminded me of the space parts from Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Embarrassing, really. The 3D effects also didn't do it for me. But maybe that was because I saw the movie on a rather small screen. If you see it in IMAX it probably is much better.<br/><br/>No, Iron Man 3 did not live up to my expectations – and I was really hoping that it would. But that does not mean that I did not enjoy myself. Robert Downey is almost on automatic with his wisecracking one- liners, but his joking around still works. All the actors do well, except maybe Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan. I think what happens to him is a weak motive for Tony Stark to take on The Mandarin. Therefore, his ""This is old fashioned revenge!""-line sounds a bit exaggerated. <br/><br/>Watching the end credits with footage from not only Iron Man 3, but parts 1 and 2 as well you can conclude that even the makers of the saga realize that this should be the final Iron Man movie. What's more to tell? Although I love Robert Downey as Tony Stark I think it's a good idea to call it quits. Let's go for some other Marvel meat and let Tony rest for a while. Maybe there's one more big fight in him in ten or fifteen years' time, when he's passed sixty or so, like The Dark Knight who once returned. Or that boxer from Philadelphia who made one last comeback. But for now I would say that three is enough for now. <br/><br/>7,5 / 10"
"lukas-viniicius","8","8","17","22 June 2013"," Why can't marvel character have a good third movie?
","Okay, so we have had a lot of Marvel characters movies already and just a few of them actually got to their third movies. Spider-Man 3 and X-Men: The Last Stand were horrible and with Iron Man 3's trailers and predecessor movies we had a huge hope for that movie. And does the movie pay it back? The answer is a out loud NO. The movie fails in every possible way, the only scene we actually get a bit nervous is when the Mandarin attacks Tony's house, but we have seen this scene in every trailer of the movie. Of course Robert Downey Jr. delivers a perfect job, so does Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately for those last two the script just fails. A lot of people are having problem with the Mandarin and having it as the major complain about the movie. Of course I have a problem with that too, but this is not why I hated this movie, although it helped a bit. Shane Black would have succeed with this idea of a fake terrorist in any other movie, because it's a brilliant idea, but not in an Iron Man movie ans specially not with the most interesting and epic villain of the comics.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie doesn't make any sense when compared to the older ones, like armors that need to be recharge, making the chest reactor almost useless, or the fact that we met the Ten Rings terrorist in the first movie, we even see their symbol on the TV every time the Mandarin shows up, but in the end the Mandarin does not even exist. Don Cheadle is only in this movie because he was in the second one because his character does not make any difference at all in this movie. The villain plan is insanely stupid and not explained and the reason he wants to get back on Tony is just stupid. Also Rebecca Hall character was there just to create the Extremis and then they just waste her, I don't even remember her name. They might just have told us that Aldrich Killiam created it and so she would not even be in the movie, because she was not necessary there.<br/><br/>All in all this is just a huge disappointing movie and I am not even willing to see the next flicks on Marvel characters until The Avengers 2."
"jan_kalina","10","8","17","25 May 2013"," Is that all you've got? A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
","That is what Stark's opponent shouts at him during one fight. Stark's response is ""Sweetheart, a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner could be the name of my autobiography"". Audiences have already come to expect such witty and self-referential dialogue from the the great writer Shane Black. Who is Shane Black, you ask? Well, you may not know him but you have certainly seen a lot of his films. This man is responsible for the greatness and awesomeness of the Lethal Weapon franchise, the wise- cracking Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( which also stars Robert Downey Jr.)<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was marketed as a story where Tony Stark would meet an opponent that would break him physically and mentally. It all looked very dark and gloomy. I'm glad to say that the end result is far from a dark and gritty movie. It is actually the exact opposite. This film is just as funny and action packed as the previous Iron Man films. The main difference is that this film has taken completely different approach than any other Marvel movie. This film isn't just your typical superhero has to fight a new enemy and in the end he wins story. This is a detective story, where our favorite billionaire, playboy philanthropist in his battle against The Mandarin is forced to go on a full-tilt investigation, revisiting crime scenes, digging through evidence and even interviewing witnesses. More than just being a detective story, what makes it a Shane Black detective story is the connections to the classic noir. Tony Stark is experiencing his darkest and toughest days due to post-traumatic stress from the Battle of New York (although in The Avengers he was fine, wise-cracking and joking around), he loses his home, his hunt for The Mandarin takes him through all kinds of crazy reveals and plot twists. There's even great voice-over narration just in the likes of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. You get more Tony Stark than Iron Man. Which doesn't mean that there is less action. No, you get plenty of action scenes just most of them are Tony being out of the suit.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. has now become the living embodiment of Tony Stark. When you think of Downey, the first character you associate with him Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is just so believable in this role. I can't imagine any other actor in this role, it just wouldn't be such fun. Gwyneth Paltrow finally gets some action scenes. The banter between Downey's Stark and Paltrow's Pepper isn't that funny and light-hearted as in the previous films. Their conversations are now more serious since they are in relationship. Don Cheadle doesn't get much screen time as Col. Rhodes but this is the funnest his character has ever been. Shane Black establishes this Lethal-Waponesque relationship between him and Tony. Ben Kingsley, well, without spoiling anything you have never seen him like this. Few years ago Guy Pearce has started playing villains and bad guys. Well, I can't complain about him he is great as always but I would just want to see him once in a while as the good guy, that's all.<br/><br/>Brian Tyler's score is much more darker but also much more melodic. Finally we get Iron Man's heroic theme which is truly kick-ass and great to listen to. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is not the superhero film I was expecting but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I'm glad that all those trailers, clips and TV spots didn't ruin the film. I was a lot surprised at all the stuff happening in the film. This film is also great Christmas movie. Black explains why Iron Man 3 (just as lot of his other films are set at Christmas:""It's a time of reckoning for a lot of people, when you take stock of how you got to where you are now and lonely people are lonelier at Christmas and you tend to notice things more acutely. Well, that describes the character's story in this film quite a lot. <br/><br/>P.S. The end-credits scene isn't a tease for the next Marvel film but it gives Iron Man 3 a nice narrative framework."

It's true that Stark is witty but to turn him into a clown? Also the meat and potatoes of the movie is supposed to be about the suit, so why was Stark out of the suit for pretty much the entire movie? <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie the Mandarin destroyed Stark's home and blew up all the suits, so why did 13 suits fly out of the lower level of the house in the end to aid Stark. This movie really angered me. Did the director not watch Iron Man 1&2 and Avengers? I just wanted to scream! How can Robert Downey all this travesty to happen? What a waste."
"DJAkin","10","9","20","4 May 2013"," This is the best IRON MAN
","This movie had literally everything you could imagine. It followed the basic structure of a movie which is to have a beginning, middle and and end. I liked how the director (who is nothing short of a genius) went to 1999 at the beginning of the movie to lay down the foundation. Then it was all Tony Stark aka Robert Downey Jr. This movie had a great protagonist (Tony Stark). The antagonist was not Ben Kingsly but rather Guy Pearce. I could see this coming a kilometer away. But you be the judge. There are many things about the movie that were neat. I loved how Tony had tons of remote control Iron Mans to take on the bad guys. I also loved how Tony Stark was mostly without his IRON MAN for most of the movie and had to rely on his own ability to be a mechanic. This was pure GENIUS. I will say that the bad guys in this movie were basically an ARMY of weirdos who can turn their bodies into fire and that's about it. I wanted to see more of a bad guy. There was also the amazing Donald Cheetah. He was great as War Machine. As he was without his ""suit"" for most of the movie, he had to rely on good old fashioned martial arts. He was trained well and was shown that the enemy will show NO MERCY. I was glad that finally somebody knows this. So if you want to see a great movie in which all the actors deliver the good, on all FOUR CYLINDERS, then see this movie. Try not to mind the ""gum chewing man"" too much. As he was very annoying."
"lornloxor","1","10","23","12 August 2013"," One of the worst comic book movies out there
","There was nothing engaging in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. was obviously the best thing about the first Iron Man but here he just doesn't seem to care. I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters and I didn't feel the romance between Tony and Pepper in the slightest either. Jon Favreau was his usual unfunny self. A bad kid actor can really be the death of a movie by himself and in this movie we have a very annoying one. Unfortunately there's a lot more that's wrong with the movie besides that kid. <br/><br/>Character motivations were the absolute caricatures of super hero movies. I mean, Tony Stark ignores Killian at a party and that is the reason that he became evil? Come on, are we supposed to believe this? Come up with something more interesting and unique, please. The dialogue between the characters was extremely poorly written, it wasn't funny and witty at all like in the first one. I laughed only once (the bit about one of the baddies throwing away his gun). Otherwise the jokes were simply cheap. The Mandarin plot twist was so bad. The film went way overboard with it, I just couldn't buy Ben Kingsley's acting in it. Also, why would you essentially sacrifice a villain of Mandarin's caliber for laughs? I was really annoyed about that, they could've made a great character out of him. Then the burning people? Luckily their clothes don't burn off though. The end fight was just so overdone, they went full Transformers on it. Usually there's only one or two Ironman suits in the fights so there's at least some tension. In the end fight there's dozens and dozens of them. Completely unexciting. <br/><br/>All in all, the plot was clichéd and dull and the writing horrible. Something just felt to be terribly off with this film. The movie relies on its CGI battles to deliver thrills to the audience in hopes that the audience forgets about the horrid plot and dialogue. But how could we be emotionally invested in these battles if we don't care about the characters? Don't waste your time on this."

","After the incredible success of the Avengers it's fair to say a stand alone Marvel superhero movie had a lot to live up to. With new director Shane Black at the helm who knew what to expect from Iron Man 3 but in my opinion it was a blinding success!<br/><br/>By far the best of the three movies, Iron Man 3 is heart-racing, mouth- gaping, visually stunning and surprisingly hilarious! Shane Black has done a brilliant job, and I liked the way he focused the story more on Tony Stark than Iron Man. We see Tony as an individual.He is struggling with the fallout of the Avengers' battle in New York, his relationship with Pepper has become extremely strained, he distances himself from Rhodey (a brilliantly cast Don Cheadle) as well as fighting his own personal battles as Tony admits in the opening monologue ""we create our own demons""<br/><br/>Not giving Tony anytime to think is the villainous Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley, or so it would seem) who arrives on the scene to ""teach America a lesson"" through violent terrorist attacks. Also causing Tony problems is the shady scientist Aldrich Killian (portrayed excellently by the wonderful character actor Guy Pearce) who apparently has a hidden agenda against Tony, from the ""history"" the two have. The film is exciting from start to finish as the audience watched Tony trying to cope with these powerful new threats, his own problems, and the anxiety that arises from putting on the Iron Man suit, all building to an awesome climax upon which rests the safety of the world. No pressure then.<br/><br/>Full of outstanding effects, most notably the astonishing siege on Stark's mansion, and a brilliant script filled with zippy one liners, most seen between Stark and Harley a small boy he befriends. These scenes show Downey Jr's unbelievable charisma and abilities as a comic actor. Also hilarious and deservedly given more screen time is Stark's driver and best friend Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). <br/><br/>The relationship between Tony and Pepper is also captured well by Black , this movie feels much more emotional and human than the first two, an all round great achievement, with new additions to the cast Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall all proving themselves excellent choices.<br/><br/>Now Marvel has gotten us all excited again, we anticipate and speculate what surprises will be in store for us with the release of Thor 2 due later this year, and a teasing post-credit scene that leaves us drooling over the prospect of Avengers 2 but I guess we'll have to wait a little longer for that one."

","Iron Man 3 is one of the worst comic book movies ever made , i don't know why they had Shane black direct the movie when the Jon Favreau did a great job with the first one and decent with the second one.The main problem with Iron Man 3 lies in its story line , how it deviated from the original comic book story line , they really messed this one up and made a complete mockery out of the Main antagonist, when are they going to realize that in a superhero movie the Anti hero is as and sometimes more important than the Hero itself , the story is awful , and the only reason i gave it 2 is because of Robert Downey Jr,the people who don't know about the comic book storyline they are going to like it but those who have actually read the comics they will hate it."
"ldile","3","6","12","4 July 2013"," My word its bad.
","There will be spoilers here. This movie fails because there too many jokes and doesn't get really serious. Stark as a character will always be emotionally distant but it would have been nice to see him fell more, but all we get are a few panic attacks and flashbacks that are suddenly cured just before the climax of the movie. What was done to mandarin was weak at best. it feels the big reveal that the mandarin is an actor was well not thought of,a seriously weak twist, basically turning iron-man's biggest villain into a joke. I'm not saying the mandarin is iron-man's joker but he is a massive villain in the comics. AIM was messed up as well and how come his suit gets destroyed so easily after the avengers movie where he took Thor's hammer to the chest and defeated alien hordes with each of his getting beat up but still in working condition. I get that Shane black wanted show the brilliance of the man out of the suit but we know about his brilliance from first movie, i mean he built a frickin suit in cave. As an action flick, its great. so go watch it but I'm a fan of comics so i cant abide by this piece of crap. It killed continuity for a villain an a terrorist think tank."

","I wasn't blown away, Iron man was supposed to be a hero who is not afraid and right after he threats the villains he goes down....They should have let Sir Ben Kingsley play the negative role. The suits were mere fire cracker at the end, to show his love to the chick..... Seriously i thought the franchise ended right after his arc reactor was removed....This was a pathetic desperate attempt to show that IRON MAN is not only the Armour. Always wondered what happens to tony without his suit and used to thinks hulk is better that iron man but turns out hulk is way awesome.....Other things about the movie were great...But sadly i lost my love for the IRON MAN and hope they bring him back like fans expect to see him in Avengers..."
"pk_nayar","6","6","12","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 - Total Disappointment
","This would be the film where we finally meet Iron Man's nemesis, The Mandarin. Bear in mind, Iron Man's rogue gallery isn't really great when you compare it with the rest of the Marvel superheroes, however if there was one villain that I wanted to see adapted onto the big screen for Iron Man, it was most definitely The Mandarin. The promos & posters had me pumped about Black's interpretation of this famed villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced as the man to play The Mandarin, my enthusiasm rose tenfold. I thought this could be the best villain we've had since Heath Ledger's Joker in ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 however failed to live up to its expectations. Although I enjoyed the first half of the film, doubts started creeping as soon as Eiffel 65's annoying ""Blue Da Ba Dee"" started playing at the beginning. I mean remember how Iron Man started? AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" booming through as the US Air Force convoy drove through Afghanistan and ending with Black Sabbath's classic ""Iron Man"" as the credits rolled. <br/><br/>Yet, I still harboured hope. It was going well, the action sequences were top notch yet again. The attack on his mansion was great. Seeing the new suit in action was fantastic as well, now that Tony Stark is able to remotely control the Mark 42 suit via the microchip implants he has injected himself with. I was even OK with him then losing his suits and having to go MacGyver in rural Tennessee. <br/><br/>However, I lost all interest in the film as soon as the so-called twist occurred. The reveal of The Mandarin as nothing more than an actor hired to play the part, absolutely deflated me. The Mandarin is Iron Man's arch nemesis as I stated earlier. He is The Joker to Batman, General Zod to Superman, The Green Goblin to Spiderman & Sabretooth to Wolverine. It was a total cop-out, a middle finger to all the fans of Iron Man. <br/><br/>The reveal that Aldrich Killian is the man behind The Mandarin was ridiculous as it totally butchered the pre-established continuity from the first two Iron Man films. The Mandarin in the comics wields a mystical power in his ten rings, which in Iron Man 1 & 2 had a presence via the terrorist unit called The Ten Rings. Having Trevor Slattery, a drunk, dope addicted & washed up Cockney accented actor from Croydon, South London (who ridiculously cheers when Liverpool score against Chelsea, what the hell was that about?) play a role created specifically for Killian to control the war on terror was bordering on stupidity. Killian is a minor character in the Extremis comics so why elevate him to another in the line of techno-terrorists like Obadiah Stane (Iron Man) or Justin Hammer (Iron Man 2)?<br/><br/>Up to that point, I must say that Ben Kingsley simply stole the show as The Mandarin. His vocal inflections, menacing stare and a believe that he was meting out justice; all of that was great. Then, that twist happened, and I sighed out lout in the cinema.<br/><br/>Moving on to the rest of the characters, I really wanted to see the Iron Patriot (who is actually Harry Osborn aka The New Goblin, in the comics, but since all Spiderman characters belonged to Sony, they changed it here). James Rhodes was reduced to bit-part character here which is sad considering the calibre of Don Cheadle. <br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow took on a heavier role, in fact we got to see a glimpse of Rescue (Pepper Potts in Iron Man Armour) which was OK, although having her infected with the Extremis virus was a tad much. The Extremis soldiers were minor characters in the comics, but it was nice to see Eric Savin (Coldblood), Jack Taggert (Firepower) & Ellen Brandt even if they were adapted for this storyline and are never called by their alter-egos.<br/><br/>Aldrich Killian was played pretty well by Guy Pearce, but him having the dragon tattoos and breathing fire was confusing. Was he supposed to Fin Fang Foom? Or Firebrand? And why would they make him the founder of Advanced Idea Mechanics? We all know that AIM is an offshoot of HYDRA, so why not have that in the new Captain America movie? If would have been great to see Baron Wolfgang, Baron Zemo & MODOK!<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr, meanwhile, excelled as Tony Stark. Indeed, it is the role he was born for. He shows good emotion as he suffers from PTSD from the Chitauri invasion (slight forced but I was still OK with it). As for the end, I did not like the fact that Tony had his chest arc reactor removed. What does this mean for Iron Man in The Avengers sequel? The post-credit scene although slightly funny was absolutely irrelevant to setting up or teasing Phase 2 of the MCU.<br/><br/>The few things I liked about Iron Man 3 were as said earlier, the action sequences and some minor easter eggs/cameos like Dr Yinsen (from the first film) & Dr Wu Chen Lu (who would go on to be Radioactive Man in the comics, which could have nicely segued into the Ant Man film since they're archenemies), mentioning of Roxxon Energy Corp & seeing the Iron Legion in action (the different types of Iron Man armour in the climax fight).<br/><br/>To quote Nolan (blasphemy I know, but I'm a fan of both DC & Marvel, sue me), The Mandarin was the villain that we fans deserved, but not the one that Shane Black gave us. Instead, we got a derisory, fire-breathing Extremis infused maniac."
"generationfilm","5","6","12","3 May 2013"," Shane Black's Dark Humor and Verbal Wit isn't Enough to Save This Formulaic Ruination of the Original Comic
","Marvel's ridiculous dogmatic hold on their chosen formulaic plot structure for their films hasn't yielded the best products when it comes to their character specific adventures, especially in upholding untouchable comic book material and characters. After the atrocity that was Iron Man 2, where Jon Favreau tinkered with not only one but two villain interpretations Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo, it was clear that the reins of control might have to change hands in order to preserve the shreds of positive creativity that were rather limited. The decision to hire director/screenwriter Shane Black wasn't an odd one because his incredible sharp wit would definitely compliment the narcissistic persona of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark and has been evident before through penning the Lethal Weapon franchise and in his directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. But not even the darkly humoristic additions or the frenetic action sequences could salvage the complete bastardization of the comic in relation to the utter ruination of Iron Man's devout nemesis, the Mandarin. Basically Iron Man 3 squanders needed guidance from its comic book source by completely ignoring its merits creating a storyline that is practically insulting to dedicated readers and longtime fans. What becomes crystal clear throughout the latest Iron Man installment is that Disney, with their unfettered franchise building of Marvel material, really doesn't care about original fans and seem to be quite antagonistic towards their love of the origins and characters in the comics themselves. There's no doubt that many desensitized moviegoers will find a great deal of enjoyment through Downey's witty banter and Shane Black's kinetic yet hollow action sequences, but the limitations posed by the Marvel formula is a creative barrier that needs to be eliminated. It never mattered who was piloting this cinematic suit, whether it was Jon Favreau or newcomer Shane Black, because the real villain behind the curtain is Disney and Marvel itself since their focus on potential merchandise in gadgetry has diminished the creative soul and drive of their pictures. Franchises might make money but sometimes, or most times when it comes to Marvel films, they make fools of us all when they claim ignorance to the original comics and create travesties of epic proportions much like Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-y1 More reviews: Generationfilm.net"
"Penderworth","6","6","12","3 May 2013"," Superfluous and ridiculous
","Ah, Iron Man. To the Marvel Universe, he's the iconic philander of Malibu, California. His country praises him for the explosive weaponry he brought it. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) brings many things to his world, but he's mainly known for his ability to create peace on the Earth. As a part of the Avengers, he aided in the fall of an invasion. He also has his own adventures. But then he fell from greatness, like so many do. The third installment of the cinema's Iron Man franchise tells this story. Or rather, Tony Stark does.<br/><br/>Things spin off with a flashback. Stark looks back at something he did on New Year's Day in 2000 which ends up changing his whole perspective of things. The story Tony tells is a solid one. It's about a hero who invites an attack from a terrorist and ends up losing nearly everything he loves. The problem is, Tony isn't sure what he loves. Is it his girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) or do his hobbies come first? And so the story of love and loss goes. I'll admit I was surprised with the significant plot twists the writers threw at me, but I won't say they were all that original.<br/><br/>As with the other two Iron Man films, this one approaches humor like Tony Stark in his Audi R8: relentlessly. Most of it seems forced. The typical Iron Man humor of Stark and his converser is strong as ever, and growing very dull. Some lines aren't so bad, but overall I got the feeling that this humor just can't adapt to a different situation. Instead, Robert Downey Jr.'s character resorts to being obnoxious in any situation thrown at him. Yet somehow the next minute he is able to understand how someone feels and finish a serious conversation. It feels like it wants to be a comedy, joking about truly serious matters and even acting irresponsible in terrorist situations, much like a child. Only this time, it's so immature that the Iron Man portrayed has reached a new low, one that's not honorable.<br/><br/>The main problem with the whole film is that Downey Jr. only has so many actor cards and the new director here, Shane Black, used up his last batch early in development, leaving nothing for the rest of the film. That's why you can easily locate scattered fragments of comical behavior and when you try to put together the puzzle, the pieces don't fit. The Iron Man watcher is not looking for a family comedy mixed with some Django Unchained, but rather chasing the character Robert Downey Jr. created back in 2008. Where has that magic gone?<br/><br/>Most of the character development went well, until it got to the villain. First, he's given a short backstory at the beginning of the film, but the writers don't go into much depth. There are clues here and there as to what the man does with his life, but when it's suddenly revealed that he's the terrorist the world seeks, things get interesting. Maybe it was terrible acting on Guy Pearce's part or maybe there's just a disconnect between the director and writer, because he almost seems like he's not paying attention to his character. All I saw was a constant circle of throw, smash, choke, and walk away enraged. He had the potential of — and even seemed to strive towards — being the Joker from The Dark Knight, which is a character that every nemesis suddenly must try to be.<br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack. I love hearing a beautiful score whenever possible, but Brian Tyler failed with this composition. The music was a noisy, redundant, and even dull kerfuffle. It had its moments of excitement and there were just too many. That could have been the fault of the film itself, which was thoroughly intense, but all this soundtrack did was make me think the film would be better without it. It wasn't unoriginal, just overly-epic.<br/><br/>Like with the soundtrack, Iron Man 3 as a whole is overshot. It tries to be so great that it falls just like the hero within. Thankfully, it manages to recover most of its parts and reassemble things by the concluding ten minutes. In a nutshell, this film was disappointing. The trailers made it out to be something completely different and it had a hard time succeeding at just continuing the legacy of Iron Man. It's good this makes a trilogy because there's not a reason to keep going. Even though its lesson (heroes must fall; terrorists shall rise) has potential, the implementation isn't all it could be.<br/><br/>Still, after the credits there was a clear message: ""Tony Stark will return."""
"jopstad","4","6","12","3 May 2013"," Least favorite of the 3
","Definitely my least favorite of the 3.<br/><br/>While I love the slapstick humor of Tony Stark, they went overboard trying to make this more a comedy rather than a quality action movie. Would really like to have seen more fights with Tony in the suit, rather than just controlling it remotely.<br/><br/>Also very disappointed with the Mandarin. What should have been the best villain by far was a total flop.<br/><br/>Suits were also a let down....not nearly as stunning visually as past movies.<br/><br/>Overall: Is it worth the $10? Yes, but a let down compared to the first 2."
"KarinaGW","6","6","12","3 May 2013"," Made me want to watch Magnum P.I.
","I saw Iron Man 3 as part of the Iron Man Marathon. I have never been to a preview of this type of film where it got no applause at the end. The Star Trek preview did, The Thor preview did. The 1st 2 Iron Man movies did, as well as the Avengers movie...just not IM3. The was a bit of applause about 3 minutes before the end on behalf of a minor but beloved character...and the after-credit tag got some laughter. <br/><br/>RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle & Paul Bettany were, as always, deft with the material given to them. The guest actors were fine. Major KUDOS to young Ty Simpkins...I know they can't really bring his character back, but I loved him and Stark together. (This is the edit: I think the kid and RDJ had a real chemistry together. This does not mean I necessarily approved of some of the ""just to prove a plot point"" aspects of the dialog or some of the illogics of the plot that happened during their scenes together.)<br/><br/>I think Shane Black was a poor choice for director (and writer). I never got the feeling that he embraced that he was directing (and writing) Iron Man. It felt (ESPECIALLY the end credits) that he wanted to be directing his favorite cop show & this is what he could get. Some changes to the characters were made at the end which were both awful & rushed through.<br/><br/>Am I glad I saw it on the big screen...sure. Am I glad I saw it as part of the marathon (and, btw, bravo to AMC Theatres for the way they organized and handled the marathon)...absolutely. But, if it were to be included in an upcoming marathon, I would probably go out to dinner during it."

","OK so I was very excited for iron man 3 after iron man 2 I was hopping they could come back with something as good if not better than the first iron man. The first 30 minutes of this movie had me going and look very promising and then it went all down hill from there. This movie had nothing to do with what we saw in trailer and used the mandarin to get people to buy tickets when they never even had plans for him to be a part of the movie. Let me put it this way imagine you went to see the dark knight and 30 minutes into the movie you find out the joker is a cover for some villain that you have never heard of and that's the last of the joker. That's exactly what happened here."

","Let me just say that while I am not exactly the biggest and craziest comic book fan in the world, but with recent excellent superhero film releases like TDKR and Avengers, any one(including me) will surely have very high expectations of the film that is Ironman 3. <br/><br/>Overall, I have absolutely no complains in the amounts of action involved, with support of animated graphics that is used appropriately, it is probably the more memorable parts of the film. If I were to pick a favourite scene, I'm sure many will agree that the 40+ suits showing up during the fight at the harbour is the best there is. I like how the portray the people injected with Extremis, with lava-looking skin and eyes and all that. All the acting were done without any issues. Of course, the star of the film RDJ as Tony Stark suits him just fine, and Ironman wouldn't be Ironman without him. I should also mention Guy Pearce acting as one of the villains involved in the film, and he did a great job in his role, portraying his intents just the way the general audience will expect him to. Ben Kingsley, being the ""Mandarin"" , is heard on the trailer with a sinister and creepy voice, and there is no doubt that he will be the biggest villain that Ironman will ever face, but something perhaps more cruel is yet to come, something that is so flawed it is literally insulting, but later on in this review. Also, the airplane rescue scene was great, it shows Ironman's ability to come in and save those falling people in time.<br/><br/>However good the action and acting may be, the main dish of the film still lies with the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I know that superhero films like this attempts to follow as the comic book version in some or more scenes, but there are some flaws that are amazingly obvious! The storyline in this film actually could have been a decent one, but for some reason, they decide not to include some crucial parts which ultimately drags the rating down. My main problem with the film mainly lies with the last 1/2 hour of the film, where every scene in that period stinks worse than my smelliest feces. Let's see, after Killian was defeated by Pepper, suddenly the ""Mandarin"" got arrested? Seems legit, considering how the trailer seems so promising that he will be the most terrifying villain is any Ironman film yet.? If Killian is indeed the ""Mandarin"" or the main villain, then why bother showing this ""Mandarin"" character then? Never mind this, the part when Tony discovers that the ""Mandarin"" is really just an actor, it feels like an anti-climax right there. That is the perfect way to NOT reveal a main character that is so featured in the trailer. In fact, whoever who made the trailer should make the film, not Shane Black. Also, if the ""Mandarin"" had managed to hack into every single news channel and electronic device, then wouldn't he been able to hack and render Ironman's suit useless? Oh wait, I forgot, there's a mega difference between technology between Tony Stark and the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Another problem I have is how fragile the suits are portrayed in the film. For instance, after rescuing the falling people from AF1, Ironman's MK42 suit fell into pieces after knocking into a truck. Right. During the fight at the harbour, Tony frequently changes between suits to get around, which makes me think, are those poor quality suits that they'll break instantly to enemy attacks? Must be the manufacturer to be blamed, tsk tsk. Maya having second thoughts about betraying Tony after he said a few sentences? Right. Plans to quit being Ironman, removes the arc reactor suddenly, curing Pepper of the Extremis? Very legit indeed, plus before the credits, Tony was shown to be towing away a robot, and that he will be back. So what really is the point of extracting the arc reactor now and not 2 films before? Sounds like a familiar ending not unlike TDKR."

"s_campanale","9","9","21","25 April 2013"," A BLACK day for Marvel - Shane stamps his signature on Stark's swansong for a pulp thriller that's less spectacular but more comical
","Awash with excitement, we went to the special Midnight premiere last night at our local Cineworld multiplex in the company of all the other geeks and comic book freaks, not knowing quite what we were going to get. What we did get was unusual and surprising.<br/><br/>""Iron Man"", despite his fame within the Marvel comics' universe, was almost unknown in the mainstream before 2008, yet now he is among the most famous superheroes in the world, and associated with the resurgent Robert Downey Jr in the same way 007 WAS Sean Connery. Though he shined in ""The Avengers"", his own standalone films have been more about Tony Stark than Iron Man in the same way the Nolan Batmans and Raimi Spidermans were about Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker, and this, the final part of the trilogy, is if anything even MORE so.<br/><br/>The defining factor of this episode is its director, king of cool violent thrillers Shane Black, the man who gave us ""Lethal Weapon"" ""Die Hard"" ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" ""The Last Boy Scout"" as well as Downey Jr's own ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". Not since Ang Lee's ill-fated ""Hulk"" in 2003 has a director so stamped his personal seal on a Marvel project. This is a Shane Black adventure starring Tony Stark who occasionally becomes Iron Man and sometimes fights some people with the power of lava but mainly cracks wise and solves highly convoluted multi-party conspiracies and plots during Christmas. It is a very well made Shane Black adventure (better than KKBB anyway) and has all the requisite factors – Cool dialogue, complex plot, clever villains pulling all the strings, crooks masquerading as political terrorists to hide their real motives, torture, buddy comedy, more torture, Christmas, background roles for the women and a massive shootout in a container port at night. Downey Jr plays it beautifully and owns the film, which means everyone else just gets crumbs. This includes returning Don Cheadle as Rhodes, now flying the USAs own ""Iron Patriot"", who unlike ""IM2"" is largely side-lined in both role and action. Even Pepper Potts, Gwyneth Paltrow's own ticket to box office reinvention, is not so central now that their on-off love affair has become official. Her role is to get kidnapped and held hostage (how original!) but she is occasionally given moments to shine, such as operating the Iron Man suit a couple of times in battle and becoming a sort of super-powered heroine herself by the end (Flame girl?) Yet compared to 1-2, she is marginal, rather as she was in ""The Avengers"". Former director Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan, now head of security, and steals every scene until a bomb blast puts him in a convenient coma for 2/3 of the film.<br/><br/>The villains are a murky bunch, classic Marvel adversaries reinvented in Black-ian terms, none more so than ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) IMs number 1 enemy and the one all fans have been waiting for. He is definitely NOT the same character in the comics, recreated as a literal Bin-Laden terrorist mastermind punishing America's sins and issuing chilling taunting videos to the Great Satan. His famous 10 rings (not magical here) were already used as the basis for the Al-Qaeda stand-ins of the first film, and here he seems to be their actual leader. To say too much would be to spoil it, but he turns out to be based on a lot of conspiracy theories about the late Bin Laden, and will likely antagonise some Marvel fans. His co-villain is another IM favourite, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) alongside Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), both brilliant and originally well-meaning scientists who get the cold shoulder from a pre-redemption Stark at a funny 1999 New Year's eve party intro in Berne (Yinsen was indeed there as he said in part 1) and become both bitter and successful enough in the intervening years to make life hard for him now. As in the comics, they have formulated ""Exxis"", a regenerative healing property that can also turn their subjects into fiery mutants or worse kill them. The ""regenerative miracle drug becomes accidental super weapon"" idea is used so much better here than it was in the lame Lizard of last years ""Amazing Spiderman"", and also creates the private army of super powered war veterans that make like tough for Tony, especially head henchman Savin (James Badge Dale) They are the only other sci-fi fantasy element in this film, and seem oddly out of tune with this otherwise straight thriller.<br/><br/>Action scenes are sparse but interesting, none more so than the helicopter attack that destroys Starks plush cliff-side palace (more massacre than battle) and the rescue of falling passengers from Air Force 1, both featured heavily in the trailers, as is the final container port battle featuring a fleet of radio-controlled suits based on previous versions taking on the Exxis army, but it is an oddly uninspiring affair. There are also some shoot-outs and alley fights in more traditional Black tradition.<br/><br/>Running themes include Tony's existential angst over the supernatural events of ""The Avengers"" that blew his comfortable preconceptions away and a sense that HE is becoming the suit rather than vice versa, with the fully formed IM often seeming alive, a friend he sits down and talks to. The ending suggests closure for the current Iron Man series, though in Bond-ian style the credits promise ""Tony Stark WILL return"". Also look out of the obligatory after credits scene featuring Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner that puts the whole movie into an interesting new perspective.<br/><br/>It is not the most fantastic superhero film ever, but it is a bold and left-field end to a trilogy, stronger than IM2 and an enjoyable experience, especially for Downey Jr and Shane Black fans."
"alucard_castlevania86","6","10","24","26 April 2013"," Disappointing Start For Marvel
","Came back yesterday from Iron Man 3 and overall, I have to say another disappointment for so far<br/><br/>The biggest mistake for me was The Mandarin character. I mean the guy was suppose to be some badass dude going out to rule the world but in here, he was nothing more than just some whinny loser who doesn't even do anything than just talk most of the time and where the heck were his famous 10 rings. Tony Stark was OK but I would really have liked to see more time screening for Iron Man rather than Tony Stark. Guy Pearce in my opinion was way stronger than Stark and if it wasn't for all those iron man suits showing up to him in the final battle (which I thought was kind of cool by the way), he would definitely have lost against Pearce. Another disappointment was the Iron Patriot who in my opinion didn't get a lot of screen time<br/><br/>The story however was quiet good. Its trying to show how Tony Stark can deal the problems that he gets himself in without the Iron Man armor. However, it did rise a lot of questions as well like why was the setting of this movie around Christmas but shown during Summer. Just didn't seem to fit<br/><br/>Another thing that was shockingly disappointing was that if Tony Stark was really a genius, then why did it took him 3 movies (including The Avengers) to figure on removing the arc reactor on his chest? Still, the action scenes did make up for some of my complains but I was still kind of disappointed"
"paul_haakonsen","7","5","10","15 August 2013"," Non-stop action from start to end... And it was just brilliant...
","As I am not overly much fan of superheroes, then the ""Iron Man"" movies so far have been quite entertaining as it is not really a superhero as per se.<br/><br/>This third installment of the ""Iron Man"" movies is fast paced and action packed right from the very beginning, and the movie just grips your with an iron fist, pardon the pun, and just never lets go. The movie explodes in a fast pace of action and adrenaline, and there never really is a dull moment throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>It was really nice to see the Tony Stark character evolving away from the stereotypical cocky playboy type that he was in the first two movies. Sure, that trait is still there, but it is more toned down now and giving way for a whole new aspect of the character. And Robert Downey Jr. does embrace this change quite well and bring is nicely to life on the screen. And these panic attacks that Stark were having were really a great touch to the character, given the aftermath of what happened in ""The Avengers"". Thumbs up for this path of developing the Stark character.<br/><br/>The story in ""Iron Man 3"" is about a terrorist known only as The Mandarin who has an agenda against the Unites States of America, and when Stark openly challenges the terrorist before all the media, Stark finds himself in over his head as his world is literally brought down. Past opportunities have come back and are more potent and dangerous now, threatening to obliterate Stark and Iron Man all together.<br/><br/>Storywise, the ""Iron Man 3"" is just as exciting as the first two movies. And the effects were off the charts, as they were in the previous movies as well. Everything here is really done so nicely, and I personally loved the variation of details and design we got to see on all the various versions of the Iron Man suits.<br/><br/>The cast, as usual, did a great job, and Robert Downey Jr. did carry the movie once again.<br/><br/>However, I didn't really care much for the villain and the powers that he had. I just had a hard time wrapping my head around how one would be able to superheat one's body to melt metal and cause no harm to the flesh of their own body. By altering the DNA codes apparently, as it was put in the movie. Sure, it looked cool and had some nice effects, but it was just a little bit too far fetched to buy into. And honestly, when Aldrich Killian (played by Guy Pearce) breathed fire, I was ready to get up and turn off the movie - it was just too much. Luckily I didn't, otherwise I would have missed out on one amazing action movie.<br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy action and/or superhero movies. Lots of actions, great acting, good character development, cool special effects and witty humor from Stark."

","Let just say its a flick that you can kick. Overrated on IMDb. why? 1.Way out of the comics plot line or we can say not real iron man(IM) MOVIE but it's more like IRON LADY in the end. 2. A Villain u don't see coming literally..c'mon be true to ur trailers at- least. It feels Like cheated after watching it. 3. Not a bad ass iron man, not a geek one either, not even the playboy charm.. but a puny & lame one.why?? he CANT defeat a villain with magma like powers even with 10+ different suits, wasted all around, see i don't buy it IM is a geek, can't build a freeze ray gun & integrate it with the suit, it'd be so Dumb in the movie, he has it in the comics already. 4. Lastly they kept the heartiest nature of IM to impress small kids 5-10 yrs old. <br/><br/>May be they're the target audience."

In the next scene they come at him with three choppers. his house is leveled everyone survives. Tony uses a beta version of his suit that doesn't work at all. Even though he has access to all of his other suits.,including the one that auto deploys that was used in the Avengers. He cant even take out the choppers.<br/><br/>He winds up flying to Tennesse from LA during all this, becomes isolated from his mansion for some reason. stays in Tennesse with a kid in his shed. Charges his armor with 110 volts, really? The power comes from the ARC reactor, who writes this? Of course the kid has a father who abandons him. Like we haven't heard that before. Come on Disney!!<br/><br/>While this is going on,. Rhodey goes after the villain, he gets no where and is taken out in about a minute. Doesn't even put up a fight, the villain gets his armor off him and running on another guy in what is minutes. Maybe Jarvis was asleep.<br/><br/>We find out there is No Manderian just a clown want to be. Which wasn't surprising at all. The guy in the suit is the Mandaran, but not the villain with the rings that we know. Instead a washed up guy that Tony dissed 13 years ago.<br/><br/>Tony gets to LA, and become James Bond without a suit and with his shirt wide open arc glowing, while trying to be evasive. At the same time the villain comes up with the scenario that the president should die because he let an oil rig free after a spill, who would have thought that one up? Really!!<br/><br/>Tony sends for the other 40 automated suits, and you start thinking cool, but you knew it would fail. All you see are suits falling apart out of the sky for no apparent reason. Not even using any of their weapons.<br/><br/>Tony gets to wear about 7 different versions of his suit, in about five minutes, at the end, only to have them fall off like a banana peel.<br/><br/>Then when its all over thanks to Pots using one re-pulser blast on a grenade against a villain who absorbs heat. Minutes later Tony orders Javis to destroy the remaining suits. He knows that the villain is dead this time for sure, really he does, for sure. Next scene Tony gets all the shrapnel out of his heart, something he couldn't do in two movies. He cures Pots, because he just can, and throws his arc battery into the ocean, because he doesn't have a Best Buy nearby to dispose of it properly. Downey is done with the role, so let's leave it in shambles.<br/><br/>Thats the story.<br/><br/>Preview of Avengers 2, Ironman gets called up by Nick, says hey I don't have any armor, cant help ya this time. Good cameo scene for the end of Thor."
"DustinRahksi","6","5","10","5 May 2013"," May be the worst Iron man film.
","Don't bother reading this if you get butt hurt over negative comments on a film. It's 2:00am and I am p-ssed off. The movie was great for the first hour, I was loving it, aside from the BS writing. That twist, that stupid twist that ruined the whole movie. Lets give you a back drop. You've seen the trailer, it looked dark, it reminded me of the Drak Knight Rises. The Mandarian, he was the equivalent of Bane, more Badass and powerful than Stark. I mean the Mandarian was a big part of why I went to see this instead of waiting for the Blu-ray to come out. He could have been one of the best villains in the last decade, but they threw that idea straight out the window, just for a little comedy. This film should be in the comedy genre instead. Cheap humour, to be honest, I didn't find it that funny, but the general audience sure did. They tricked the audience, and how does the audience react, oh it's just a joke, lets laugh. I bet the writers thought they were real clever when they wrote that twist in. It's sad, up until that twist, the Mandarian was dare I say scary, just like Bane. Those news broadcast worked. Ben Kingsley was perfect, until he just turned out to be a drug addicted actor. Instead we get some generic douche bag villain, with little to no motivation for his cause, he comes equipped with atrocious dialogue as well. I'm sorry Guy Pierce, but your character was bargain bin quality. What else is there to complain about besides the worst twist in cinema history, lame as lame can be villain, and kiddie humour. Well apparently the iron man suits are made of paper mache, they fall apart like roast beef. But in the avengers, it can withstand any abuse you could imagine putting it through. This movie is just bad all around, even though I don't like the avengers, I at least have to say that it was miles better than this film. Here is what you have to do, watch the trailer before you go see the film, go see the film, and make up your mind on whether you were tricked, mislead, disheartened or just insulted as a viewer. I was all of those. This is this the same old 9 year old friendly marvel we all know. I would love to know what the fans of the comic thought of the Mandarian twist."
"anasnajmie","6","5","10","2 May 2013"," Disappointing. Could have been better.
","I love Iron Man series. I love Tony Stark's antiques. And because of that, I am going to be harsh for its review. In my personal view, this movie falls below average for Iron Man series. I know the director is not the same as before, but Jon Favreau is the executive director (and also acted as Happy Hogan). He should not let Shane Black downgrade Iron Man 3 below the standards he set for the previous movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The movie is still visually stunning, the music score is still great and RDJ is still awesome as he can be. But the story left something to be desired. I'm not following Iron Man comics, but I know for a fact that The Mandarin is one of Marvel's greatest villain. He is supposed to be Iron Man's living antithesis, like how The Joker is to Batman. But in this movie, The Mandarin was ridiculed so bad it is there in the movie just to become a joke. The Mandarin is a junkie? A theater actor? Please In the comic, he has these ten magical rings he got from a crashed alien space craft! And by the way, Aldrich Killian is NOT The Mandarin.<br/><br/>Speaking of Aldrich Killian, Guy Pearce played his character brilliantly. Whether his portrayal of the crippled Killian in 1999 or his new sinister personality, he did the job convincingly. Although I hate how the movie portrayed Mandarin, Ben Kingsley acting is superb. He literally acted two different characters; one as the terrifying Mandarin, another as the drug addict, stupid, actor of Mandarin. Just look at how he changed his personality, his tone, his body language. Superb. RDJ did his usual best being Tony Stark, although he is more serious this time, following the direction of the movie. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle get less air time, but that's their role, as supporting actors.<br/><br/>The movie tries to set a darker tone to Iron Man series, and its focus is to show that Tony Stark is still Iron Man even without his armor. It attempts to display that Tony Stark, although weak without his suit, still can save the world. It also wants the audience to see that Stark is a changed man now; more responsible and dependable unlike his previous character (womanizer, irresponsible, immature). Clearly, the events of The Avengers has really traumatized him, that he now suffers panic attack, and obsessed to build so many automated Iron Man to protect his lover Pepper Pots. Do not be disappointed if you don't see much of Iron Man in action. However, the battle scene at the end of the movie is overloaded with Iron Men to make up for that.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is that, the Mk-42 suits is completely useless. I know it is a prototype, but come on, you fight Loki and his aliens in The Avengers using Mk-7! Why Mk-42 so easy to go kaput? Which reminds me, the previous movie was so awesome because it showed Stark upgraded his armor (with the help of JARVIS) using his out of the world technology. In this movie, apart from the armor can break (easily) into parts and attached the Tony Stark's body, the Mk-42 is nothing compared to Mk-7. <br/><br/>Not to mention that he can ACTUALLY remove his reactor on his chest quite easily. I remember though in the previous movie, he could die if he tried to remove the reactor; in fact he said he is cursed by it. Fast forward to Iron Man 3, the reactor is removed in 5 seconds scene. To close the review, this movie should be named Tony Stark, instead of Iron Man. Really, Tony Stark has most of the air time compared to his suit.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 6/10. Disappointing from Marvel. I won't stop you from watching it. It is still enjoyable to watch. It still has many actions to watch (albeit less from its predecessor). I just felt that this movie could be even better, if the plot is tidier than now. Lastly, do not watch in 3D. Waste of money. Not many scenes really stands out in 3D."
"wesleymjacobs","5","5","10","1 May 2013"," With Extremis & the Mandarin, this SHOULD have been better. Thoroughly disappointed!
","I've just returned from the cinema after watching, what was, one of my most anticipated movies of the year. I'm actually still confused as to how i feel about this movie - Iron Man 3 threw me off completely!<br/><br/>Firstly, I love the character, I love Iron Man, I'm a huge RDJ fan. So, walking into this movie, having followed the press, media hype, studio comments, etc. I expected a dark (""more grounded"") story as we were all promised with a storyline working off of the Extremis storyline (which was absolutely brilliant) and pitting our favourite billionaire playboy against his greatest arch-enemy and (as Marvel studios said) ""an ending bigger than The Avengers"".<br/><br/>Walking out of the cinema I realised I had watched a pseudo-comedy with not a whole lot of coherent action and a fake baddie!!!! Most of the action is so watered down with one-liners and comedic interludes that it does not gain any traction. Don't get me wrong, there's great spectacle and some very cleverly put together set pieces which really are awesome, however, they live like islands in the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The 2 greatest disappointments, however, are the way in which the Extremis storyline was adapted and even worse, the Mandarin's re- invention. If you're familiar with the Extremis storyline, then you know that Tony gets injected with the Extremis virus and this, basically, allows him to raise the stakes with his suits. What IM3 eventually sells us is Tony's post-Avengers anxiety causing him to build his Iron Legion to fight off super soldiers. The whole selling point of Tony's next generation suits was nothing more than clever studio marketing, and that actually angers me. I kept wondering when Tony himself was going to get given a viral upgrade, something that never happened.<br/><br/>As for the Mandarin...Firstly, Sir Ben Kingsley puts in a masterful performance, a truly terrific piece of acting. However, that's where the Mandarin's accolades end. I can understand that Marvel would have to adapt their screen version of the character for film. I can even swallow (and did) that the ten rings were symbolic (and not actual mystical rings) and that there was a necessity to tie him back to IM1's villains. I can even accept that he's not oriental and that his tactics and background are a mish-mash of global warfare types. What I cannot accept is that his ENTIRE existence in the movie is that of a farce, that there is no full circle in Tony's enemies (by way of the Ten rings mentioned in the first film) and neither can I accept that really has no place in the movie! It is with the greatest disappointment that the ""real"" Mandarin was revealed in the movie, I think my heart sank and it was over for me.<br/><br/>As usual, RDJ puts in a classy performance, filling the shoes of Mr Stark like nobody else in Hollywood possibly could. His back and forth with Don Cheadle provides some of the more authentic moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, i'm disappointed. I feel as though i've been completely duped by the Marvel marketing machine and that i've been robbed of the chance to see my FAVOURITE Marvel character being pitted against his nemesis or Tony receiving his nanotech upgrade and the next generation of suits that could have been. This one was definitely a big miss by Marvel."

With Avengers, I died and went to heaven.<br/><br/>Iron man 3 brought me back to Earth. :/<br/><br/>I guess there was too much pressure on these guys. They put in everything into the movie. Not everything they had, I mean everything there is to Iron Man movie.<br/><br/>Well, the result was disappointing.<br/><br/>They should have focused on something.<br/><br/>There was Tony trying to get away from the suit, there was tony saving Pepper and the world, there was Tony building rubbish to save Pepper and the World. I mean DUDE! You built the Iron Man Suit and now you are building guns that shock people? Then yes there is Tony being sarcastic and misanthropic. There is also Tony the good and caring friend. Yeah and of course, there Tony doing the ""right"" thing at the end.<br/><br/>I couldn't really understand how three helicopters can enter US airspace and fire missiles at Tony's house and yet remain untraceable. :|<br/><br/>Prime Facie, it may be entertaining, but all in all, it was disappointing."
"kaushalsharma231291","5","5","10","30 April 2013"," entertaining ,full of action but hollow
","After the release of quality superhero movies like the dark knight, every time I watch a superhero ,i tend to compare it with dark knight.Any ways lets talk about good points about IronMan 3 :<br/><br/>1.The action:Action scenes have been short brilliantly .They are clear and no shaky camera. So full marks to the cinematography. <br/><br/>2.The Entertainment :The movies got a lot of it.It has nice funny moments and actors too did a good job .And this is exactly what we expect from a large commercial superhero movie. Don't we?<br/><br/>3.Robert downey Jr. :Needless to say the kind of actor he is.Sometimes he does such great job that he singlehandedly pulls the quality of the movies he's part of.He has done exactly the same here. So all you RDJ fans out there ,you guys are most likely to enjoy this movie a lot.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about the negative points of the movie:<br/><br/>1.First and perhaps expected one - lack of depth.In fact the movies got no depth at all.Just a lit bit of Drama into it which appears quite hollow and not something that will impress you. No drastic improvisations by Shane black which was a huge disappointment to me.<br/><br/>2.Poor story: The overall story is full of flaws, errors and ambiguities. A superhero movie story is always surrounded around 2 roles- the superhero and the villain. In this movie the superhero part is just fine but villain part is being built very badly and the story appears confusing and full of crap since the beginning.Ben knigsley did a needless job and the whole mandrine thing was crappy.<br/><br/>Bottomline : The movies is overall entertaining which is quite evident from the huge collections but has nothing that can touch your heart.At first it appears better than IronMan 2 and the Avengers but IronMan was certainly far better than this.RDJ fans are most likely to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Lastly , i would like to express my huge surprise by the metascore this movie has scored .It shouldn't have been more than 55 hardly 60. That just goes to show that Critics words can not be taken for granted ......Always."

MANDARIN you gone very wrong about him shane....argh! I've thought this mandarin will shows in the end or reveal the clue for the real mandarin but its not.... why the he wears 10 rings but its only for props of propaganda broadcast video in this movie???? at least don't kill Mandarin char with that plot of joke!!!! (mandarin loves power...not chicks and drugs *ARGH!).....<br/><br/>for the other reviewer thats support the mechanical things with this kid i understand, you may think Tony don't have resource to repair its armor rite? or maybe shane want to describe how genius tony is? the question is, why tony after revive jarvis in MK42 did not command his backup to pick him up instead of steal a car?! or it saves for the climax? what a jerk..this is not Jason bourne......again ARGH!<br/><br/>for extremis that broke down IM suites i still could not accept this....Tony found the new element for material of the armor rite? (in IM1 its described) its strong...thats why he could join the avenger (as his father found Vibranium for Capt.) ..... MK6 could bear lightning bolt from thor.. (maybe jarvis could send the shocks to be absorbed) but lighting itself has great heat than extremis...or you might to said that the extremis heat is focusing in 1 point attack? not really....remember the avenger that MK6 is hit by Mjolnir the great hammer of universe....and the suites don't bent rite? only scratch .... its 1 focus point attack... again ARGH!!!!<br/><br/>Iron Patriot could be hack i could only accept this as Don it modified by AIM...it could be backdoored... yeah fine...<br/><br/>and what made me wants to cry is why the hell is Tony lift up his arc reactor in his chest so easily? he is ultra-genius guy who create pure energy,...but why in the first IM1 he did not surge himself to lift his arc-reactor chest at once??? surely he don't have problem to do this surgery.....again ARGH!!!<br/><br/>to be conclude Shane Black is not appropriate for directed a Marvel movies that needs fantastical fictional imagination and knows deep about Marvel. The trailers deceive me, the mandarin seems powerful but the fact is such a joke.... Less-ironman....this movie should called ""Tony Bourne""..... please bring Favreau back!!!!! Kick shane out marvel!!!!"

Also the true action sequence was only in last 20 minutes, except that it was a joke. Maya's (one stand of RDJ) sudden empathy towards Tony stark's situation wasn't justified, just after listening a 2 min speech from Tony Stark. Also there were many loop holes, The way he got the info about Mandarin's where abouts was too simple & why he hasn't used his force earlier in the movie ... And he use to jump places without making things more clear ... Though it seems to be the end of Iron Man .. I wish to see him in future .<br/><br/>8 out of 10 rating doesn't justify this movie.

"pamcg","9","9","22","24 April 2013"," Brilliant: funny, deep and Downey Jr. at his best
","I went into this feeling very excited and slightly nervous: excited because it's FRICKIN' IRON MAN, but nervous because, after the disappointing Iron Man 2 and then the triumphant comeback in the Avengers, I didn't really know how they were going to be able to come close to that level of fun and thrills in a stand alone film again. I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG TO EVEN DOUBT IT. It's everything Iron Man should be: Downey Jnr. IS Tony Stark , his lightning fast wit enhancing the cocky comic character. The action was intense and, surprisingly, not just confined to Stark's alter ego. There were genuinely hilarious moments when the theatre was in stitches, and Kingsley and Pearce were epic in their roles.....AND there were a number of twists and turns that kept the movie fresh. The most interesting aspect that sets it apart from the Iron Man we've seen previously, however, is the depth that we delve into Stark's psyche, reminiscent perhaps of Bond in Skyfall.But, even in the darkest moments, it's never too far away from a one-liner.<br/><br/>And that's what makes it enjoyable: it balances the serious with the playful, never straying too much into Dark Knight or Batman Forever(I wouldn't even dare and try to mention 1997's Douche-Man and Slobbin) territory, respectively. Black's direction is great (Downey's wit harking back to the brilliant Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), and I would hope that, if there is to be another Downey Jnr. stand-alone, that he would get the nod to direct. So, overall: great villain(-s ????), great allies, great comedy, great action, great depth, great direction and, most importantly, PERFECT Downey Jnr............oh, and Gwyenth Paltrow really DOES have the ass of a 22 year old......and a set of abs Terry Crewes would shed a tear at."

Such a big bummer that the Mandarin was not portrayed like in the comics. So, so sad. The story would've been incredible if it stayed true to the Mandarin character! I thought the movie was going well until it was revealed that the Mandarin was just a decoy. Then, it was downhill from there. And Pepper beating up Killian at the end? That was kind of corny, I thought. Not thrilled with that idea either (and I'm a woman, by the way).<br/><br/>So, from one comic book fan to another: don't go watch this film if you're already having a bad day because it will only make you feel worse. a lot worse. And if you're having a great day, definitely do not go watch this film unless you want to end your day on an unhappy note.

","It seems that Marvels intention of the Iron man franchise was to make Tony Stark as un-superhero-ish as possible, constantly and consistently adding ever-increasing flaws to the character with each film until you can't help but wonder why he should even be Iron-man anymore..<br/><br/>Tony started out as a genius billionaire playboy, loved by millions, surrounded with women, power and money. A cool character, but also someone who turns his life into an admirable direction. That's Iron man 1.<br/><br/>By iron man 2, Tony gives up his business, gets his backside handed to him by a man with whips, can barely begin even a simple relationship with a mediocre woman and gets his suit taken away from him.<br/><br/>In this movie (oh lord), Tony is a wreck with frequently panic attacks over everything. He barely wears the suits and when he does, they break like glass. He makes terrible and stupid decisions, he almost dies several times, he gets captured, beaten up constantly and is eventually saved by Pepper Potts.. Then blows up all his suits..<br/><br/>Is the entire staff team on each film just being replaced with people who dislike Iron man more than the last? Whatever the reason, Iron man is quickly becoming an example of someone who really shouldn't be a superhero and I can't fathom the reason why the movies go in this direction.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope Iron man 4 isn't made because I don't think anyone wants to see a homeless alcoholic Tony wetting himself in an alley way whilst dumpster diving, which is apparently the next logical trend.."
"chachuymedina","10","8","19","3 May 2013"," A good film that i just loved
","I think that this movie is just as good as the other two. As long as i am entertained throughout the whole film, I'm a happy camper. Me and my girlfriend just tried out the new D box feature(where the chairs move), it was an extra 7 bucks, but with this movie, it was worth it! The movie had its funny moments here and there, and the action is great! Love the action in this movie, it is pretty intense, and had my hands covering my mouth on some parts. I think that the average person would be pretty entertained. But i would compare it to The Avengers, and the Avengers was pretty remarkable. The Avengers had me talking for days, Iron man three just had me recommending people to watch the film. So if you want to see action and good entertainment(unlike scary movie 5) you would be a happy camper after watching this movie."

","The first Iron Man was an unexpected delight. The second Iron Man was the perfunctory comic book movie we thought the first was going to be. And now here comes Iron Man ""Three"" (I'm not sure why it's not numerical). Tony Stark (an increasingly bored- and bitter-looking Robert Downey Jr), traumatised by the events of Avengers Assemble, taunts a bonkers terrorist megastar named The Mandarin (an amusing Ben Kingsley, wholly self-mocking), who then proceeds to blow up the Stark empire. So, rather than the franchise going bigger and badder, and rather than a potentially intriguing P.R. head-to-head between the world's two greatest egomaniacs, we get a kind of origins tale. Again. <br/><br/>I wanted to like Iron Man ""Three"", mostly because it represents the final piece of the Shane Black resurrection puzzle (the puzzle being why he hasn't been consistently at the forefront of wisecracking blockbuster Hollywood ever since Lethal Weapon), but I could only let it pass harmlessly over me. It has stacks of great ideas and some whizzy dialogue, but it's also tonally erratic, narratively reckless and overlong. And I can't help feeling that the fanboy-angering twist in the middle might simply be there to make up for the lack of an interesting bad guy.<br/><br/>This feels like a good place to leave the standalone Iron Man movies, although Stan Lee's money-making machine shows no sign of slowing, especially now that he's realised that the Chinese are lapping up his solid, gaudy entertainments like there's no tomorrow. Just because the returns this time aren't as diminished as part two, that doesn't mean we need a fourth. All good things come in threes. Except The Godfather."

","There is a reason George Lucas never put major actors in main roles. He never wants the actor taking away from the character. This movie was about Robert Downey Jr. not Ironman. Also you have WarMacine/Iron Patriot and he does not even fight any. This w as about Robert Downey Jr playing with a bunch of toy robots. I hope this is the last of Downey Ironman movies!!!!!!!! I also this does not reflect future Marvel movies. From the preview of Thor it will not. Oh yeah forgot, this was not about the Mandarin. I still have not been happy that everyone knows Tony Stark is Ironman. I hate they have Tony Stark as a ham. In the comics he was a drunken playboy with a chip on his shoulder. In these movies he is more like Chandler from Friends."
"dilushamcrox","1","7","16","3 May 2013"," The way to get the ""Real Mandarin"" in the next movie.
","Right now everyone knows about the the most ridiculous Twist in history of cinema(the lamest strategy used by a director).Do you think everything has happened and we have no choice?!?!....No! we have a choice...a hope!<br/><br/>Black has thrown Iron man franchise in to the dark pit(just like bane threw Bruce in to the pit in TDKR)But now we have to get Iron man out of it,So here is my plan.And this is what anyone who could take on this franchise should do! Making The real Mandarin the villain in next IM movie! It should be a sequel(with or without RDJ) So this is the story..<br/><br/>Although IM 3 is so lame, I found a silver lining in it.Now i think this movie has laid down a good foundation for a possible Mandarin outing in near future,despite all its plot holes.Do you ever guessed how Aldrich got all his money to do such research? Do you ever thought why he is having dragon tattoos on his chest? or why is he having such dragon statues and symbols when Trevor's TV Announcements were filming?? Or if he was actually the head of Ten Rings Organization ,what was the reason for him to name his organization as Ten Rings????That name never fits with his personality by any means,its so weird!!.....Did Tony ever think about that weird strange connection in this movie????Black must have included such a scene where Tony puzzled and thinking about all this.And he has lot of clues to think on this matter.<br/><br/>Now we come to the real Mandarin.So this real Mandarin as usual in comics a wealthy Chinese who's been raised by his aunt,a regional ruler in a Chinese province(a post which has been inherited by his father),a very fine martial artist and later discovers an alien ship(Makluans) crashed on Earth 1000s of years ago and finds the 10 alien rings(each with a specific power)whom now seeks to make china his empire and rule the whole world(and to watch the west burns)from his global terrorist organization. Aldrich is actually been hired by real Mandarin,the invisible head of Ten Rings Org. He ordered Killian to hire Trevor to symbolize himself and as the false head of Ten rings.Every word Trevor said were all thoughts of Mandarin(simply its his script),his plans....And Trevor doesn't know anything about Mandarin and he thinks it's all Aldrich's plans!!<br/><br/>So now Aldrich is dead(although we didn't see his corpse he is supposed to be killed by Potts)and Trevor is imprisoned but nothing is over yet until the real face of Ten Rings reveal........Now everything is set for Mandarin,the arch nemesis of Iron Man for a close encounter with Stark!!!!!!!"

","First off I'd like to open by stating my ratings /10 of other superhero movies: IM1: 9/10 IM2: 7/10 Avengers: 9/10 Thor: 7/10 Captain America: 8/10<br/><br/>I left out Xmen, Fant4, Daredevil, etc, as they really aren't relevant though none of them got less than 6/10 except the second fantastic Four which was terribad.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, ... That all being said, Iron Man 3 was, by far, the most insulting, terribly written, and poorly acted movie of any of the recent-in-the-past-10-years superhero movie. Don't get me wrong, Downey Jr and Kingsly are fantastic actors and almost never disappoint, however this movie was a stinker through and through.<br/><br/>I'm not a die-hard comic book fan but even *I* know what the Mandarin was and wasn't. Not letting out any spoilers but I will say that not in a million years would you ever come up with a better way to ruin a comic foundation. The Mandarin was the absolute antithesis to Tony Stark and this movie craps all over that by, well, like I said, no spoilers.<br/><br/>The acting was just OK. I never would have thought I'd say that about Downey Jr. or especially about Kingsley but seriously, every single line felt forced, rushed, and had no feeling or conveyance of the characters. I could have read the ingredients off a box of Frosted Flakes with more passion.<br/><br/>The action scenes were boring and unimaginative. It's all been done before and was terribly uninspired.<br/><br/>The entire purpose of IM3 was to make money off the name. Period. Its like they didn't even try. 3/10 for me, right up there with Charlies Angels 2. Seriously."
"wgeddings","10","8","20","4 May 2013"," Reviewers miss the point. This really is a great movie!
","I was stunned to see all the negative reviews for this movie. I avoided the reviews and spoilers and couldn't wait to see it since I have loved the Marvel movies so far and knew they were starting ""phase 2"". This movie really plays well off of the events in the Avengers without really relying on that movie. Tony has anxiety worrying he might fail, worrying that he is not able to protect Pepper now that he has someone he cares for more than himself and basically afraid that he cannot be good enough. Big difference from the swaggering Tony but he tries to keep up the swagger act. <br/><br/>Normally previews spoil surprises in the movie but I was very happy that here, the scenes shown in the previews were good and in the movie but in the course of the movie they actually played out differently than you would guess from the previews. For example, in the trailers/previews I thought several sequences took place well outside of the US but that was not the case. The previews did not spoil anything. <br/><br/>The plot was clear and fun. It took turns and was interesting. I have no idea how others think it was stupid and wonder if they actually saw the movie. People complain about the child and call him a sidekick or make fun of the hostage part. I found him to be a great addition and an effective way to further the story. The ""hostage"" thing with the kid was very minor and furthered the story in important ways. Far from being a silly plot device, I found it to be a smooth addition. <br/><br/>As for the comments about the Mandarin, things are not always what they appear. The movie was pretty clear about that over and over yet the plot twist involving him is something the naysayers take on faith. Marvel is starting phase 2 with this movie. Would the Mandarin twist fit into that or do you think there might be a lot more to it than was clearly apparent? Would Marvel have referred to him in the prior movies and put so much into the ""ten rings"" only to have it end like this? Viewers should ask themselves if Marvel would so misinterpret one of their major villains or would they just make people think that had to reveal more in a later movie?<br/><br/>As you watch the effects of the Extremis drug, see if your mind immediately goes to the Red Hulk? Could the Extremis effect be a springboard for characters in later movies? Better yet, how can it not? <br/><br/>I believe Marvel has shown that if we trust them a little, that trust will pay off. The naysayers are like fans who see the other team score first and just leave convinced that their team has lost. Yes, parts of the movie can be viewed as odd but don't most stories rely on creating a challenge for the heroes? I believe this is what we see here. It is a great movie that leaves some odd questions but I believe they will be answered soon enough"

I rarely go see a movie twice but this will join that list"
"greyscale-rainbow","9","8","20","27 April 2013"," People seem to have missed the point?
","I am just going to start by saying that pretty much the entire point of this movie is to remind people that Tony Stark is a human being, and that HE is Iron Man, not the suit of armour.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the Iron Man comics, I feel like I may also have to remind people that the movie canon universe is COMPLETELY SEPARATE from the comics. They are based on the comics, and lift things from them, but it can be as little as just a name or vague concept. They are their own universe, so please do not assume that something that happens in the comics will automatically be true of the films.<br/><br/>Yes the time line can seem a little jumpy as we are forced to jump between characters now and again, however it's very well edited and utterly necessary to complete the plot line. - following this contains heavy spoilers<br/><br/>I found Tony's anxiety attacks to be very realistically portrayed (and as someone who suffers anxiety, I know better than some). I found it absolutely brilliant that he was genuinely affected the way that a normal human being could be, he was panicked and needed to exit the situation frequently, and it gave him a weakness that threw him into the deep end which was incredibly refreshing to see. While Tony no longer portrays the cocksure attitude he did in the first movie, this is a thing called CHARACTER PROGRESSION, and after all the nonsense that he's been through it can hardly surprise people that the character isn't identical to when we first met him. In fact if he was I would be incredibly disappointed.<br/><br/>The Mandarin plot twist is honestly one of my favourite things about this film, it's GENIUS. The fact that we've assumed about the Mandarin from the trailers and his original comic influence makes it so much better that he is all a facade. People aren't what they seem, and I'm surprised but very pleased that he didn't follow the typical super villain archetype. Killian is an interesting villain because he's actually on Tony's level in the way that he should be. He isn't some alien, or a magician, he's not got super powers, he is a businessman. He is initially a genius businessman that can beat Tony at what Tony does best, and that prowess is intimidating. Plus he breaths fire. That's pretty cool.<br/><br/>The effects were amazing, there were some absolutely hilarious one- liners, and the way that they've manipulated concepts from the comics (especially the extremis virus) was sheer genius. Not a disappointment at all in my books, in fact I'm going to see it again next week."
"cinematic_aficionado","4","7","17","3 May 2013"," Of poor taste
","So far, the expectation from Iron Man films was that of mind numbing, explosive action with superb effects which more than made up for their lack of any further substance and it is precisely because of this pattern, I found the latest instalment to be a disappointment.<br/><br/>So much of the film was wasted on unnecessary dialogue, as if the makers were trying to convince us that such films can incorporate elements including character development, personality, emotional attachments etc... When you have a story that is pure fantasy/fiction and tying to make it look more like a conventional film then you have a problem, because no matter how work is put into maturing the persona of a metal covered super hero, he still is a sci-fi character, plus it will not get you any more fans.<br/><br/>As a result, there was an overload of mumbo-jumbo, which could have been reduced, and lesser of the impressive action sequences we have come to like about movies like this.<br/><br/>It thus ended up looking more tacky than a brilliant sci-fi/action movie."

Viewers finally get to see more romance between tony and miss peppers.<br/><br/>The script and storyline is fantastic and is full of a lot of surprises which will keep you hooked and guessing till the last moment.

"randomhacker-762-412971","4","4","8","10 August 2013"," Derailment of the franchise
","Let me start out by saying that I was really excited for this movie. I loved Iron Man 1 and 2, and was looking forward to seeing how they adapted the Extremis arc, one of my favorite arcs in the comic series.<br/><br/>I could not have been more disappointed with how this film turned out. First, I'll start with the good.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were superb. The Extremis soldiers, the Air Force One scene, and especially the final fight were all expertly done.<br/><br/>That's about it for the good.<br/><br/>Now, on to the bad...<br/><br/>First off, what annoyed me the most was the derailment of Tony's character. Those of us who saw the first two and the Avengers know that he was a jerk (putting it kindly), but someone who still helped others out. I never saw him as a PTSD victim, especially not to the degree of having flashbacks. What, the wormhole was one near-death experience too many? I mean, it's not like he almost died a thousand other times in the... oh wait, never mind.<br/><br/>Secondly, I really enjoyed the Mandarin in the comical, and was horrified to find out that Black reduced him to a washed-up, drunk British actor.<br/><br/>While we're on the subject of villains, Killian just didn't cut it for me. I think that Tony should have wronged him in a bigger way than simply ignoring him to merit *that* level of retribution. I'd hate to see what he did to any girls who dumped him. He's basically the Buddy Pine (from The Incredibles) of the Marvel Universe!<br/><br/>This movie also included a lot of clichés. Not only is there an annoying kid sidekick, but there's even a hostage scene! Pepper is the one to finally kill the villain after being absent from most of the movie (really showing her as the 'most important thing' in Tony's life) to name a few. <br/><br/>We hardly see the IM suit for most of the movie; instead it's just the baddies mopping the floor with Tony. This is a huge threat, which should warrant the attention of others, right? Where are Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America? More importantly, where is Nick Fury (whose JOB it is to take care of superpowered terrorists?) Why did Tony destroy ALL of his suits just to prove a point? Why didn't he get heart surgery earlier? What will happen when another villain comes to town, hell-bent on revenge? <br/><br/>The movie makes more questions and plot holes than it answered.<br/><br/>To summarize, IM3 is yet another cheap action flick with corny one-liners that shouldn't be considered part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'm still convinced that it was all a bad dream Tony had that was brought on by heartburn from the shawarma after The Avengers."

","This is going to be my first review and I chose Iron Man 3 cause i've been a fan boy ever since Iron Man 1.<br/><br/>I'm a fan boy of comics and, everyone's loved Marvel Hero is Iron Man including me. And since Iron Man is quite famous, all of us know one of his most powerful and greatest foe of Iron Man, The Mandarin. When me and my friends (who has read the comics too) went to see the movie, the first 1/4 of the movie was INCREDIBLE! It was quite a nice plot and some of us guys had a laugh. And I do have to say, we watched this movie at the premier so all of us didn't know what was gonna happen next. So, Tony Stark's house gets destroyed and his suit brings him to some place and then the next thing you know, Tony Stark is going to The Mandarin's place, all of us we're excited, finally Tony is going to meet The Mandarin. Well, when Tony entered the room, he saw two girls, and we we're like OK, two random girls who are half naked are in the room but we don't see The Mandarin. THEN THE PART THAT EVERYONE WAS WAITING FOR, The Mandarin appeared. But it wasn't The Mandarin who all of us expected. Turns out. The Mandarin was just an actor working for Killian. My friends and me we're shaking our heads, since it was the premier, there was a lot of obvious fan boys because they were shaking their heads as well.<br/><br/>After that, there was no point of watching Iron Man 3 anymore, Ben Kingsley, who played the Mandarin was such a great actor but he was wasted in this movie. The Ending Fight scenes we're also no good. The Fact that while the president was in the Iron Patriot Armour, he didn't even figure or try to move the Armour so that he can fly away and stuff, but when Rhodes took the Armour it worked perfectly fine, and one more thing, when Pepper Potts when down the fire, why didn't her bra and pants go out in fire and burn? <br/><br/>OR Marvel has this end credits scene that they always have in every of their movies. They could've shown in the end credits that Tony could be visiting the jail where The Mandarin is and ask him questions and stuff, but instead, Marvel and Shane Black gives out a twist. The Mandarin turns out to be the real Mandarin and the jail suddenly explodes then Tony gets up only to see that a guy who worked for Killian before gives him his ten rings then, ""You Will Never See Me Coming""<br/><br/>Marvel and Shane Black, if you had used the original Mandarin and made him do what he is supposed to do, Iron Man 3 Could've been the best movie in the world"
"Dory_Darko","5","4","8","1 June 2013"," Could've, would've, should've.
","There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.<br/><br/>Everything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is – let's be honest – precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all – the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and – big shock – it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.<br/><br/>Well, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.<br/><br/>This was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.<br/><br/>This is definitely a filmmakers' case of ""could've, would've, should've"". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.<br/><br/>No story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad."
"danavenell","3","4","8","12 May 2013"," A lukewarm mess
","What is wrong with IM3? For a start, Iron Man is hardly in it. Shane Black, who wrote Lethal Weapon, of which/who I am no great fan, directs this one, and maybe was pressured to have more Downey Jr face-time or maybe he just wanted to do another Lethal Weapon movie. Or doesn't know how to do a super-hero movie, because this isn't really one. The film is probably a little better and smarter than Lethal Weapon, and has better action and acting (good acting all round is what saves the movie) and a movie where Stark has to survive on his wits without his armour MIGHT have been cool - but ultimately this is an Iron Man movie, I want Iron Man thanks. I want an incredible flying tech-suit, not Tony Stark with a gun. <br/><br/>And when Iron Man is in it, Tony Stark is not in it. In the armour I mean. All the suits are remote controlled, or drones controlled by Jarvis, and that's boring. He's not in jeopardy if he's doing by remote in the back of a van somewhere, get it? And the slightly-tough-to- swallow idea that Iron Man can press a button and all his armour flies to him and wraps around him, seen in Avengers, is here taken to a newer, even less believable level. At the end he's falling from suit into suit and then that suit is chopped in half (by people with very hot hands - wait, I thought Thor's lightning barely scratched it - here the suits are shredded like paper) so he jumps into another suit that wraps around him... and it's all blurry like Transformers action sequences so you don't know what's going on. At one point it seems his leg is cut off, but apparently it wasn't, so like whatever.<br/><br/>Some plot holes/stupid stuff/spoilers - <br/><br/>Stark tells The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley out of Gandhi) his address on live TV, hoping he will attack him. He does with a bunch of helicopters shooting missiles and destroying Stark's home/base. This nearly kills everyone there, because Tony hasn't prepared for an attack at all. He could have had 30 Iron Men hidden around the nearby hills, underwater, whatever, and trapped/killed the attackers as they approached. He could've even called up SHIELD, seeing as this was national security, but SHIELD aren't in the movie. He could've made sure Pepper wasn't at home, but she nearly dies because he didn't think of planning any defence at all. <br/><br/>He is supposed to be the smartest guy in the room at any time. Rarely in the movie was he shown to be very smart... Waking up in Tennessee, his suit broken, he must survive upon his wits, befriending a kid and trying to fix his suit with a car battery. Was every suit put out of action when his home was attacked? If so he's an idiot for keeping them all there. He has a place in NY, remember? No suits there? He could get one to him in five minutes.<br/><br/>Big Spoiler! Mandarin isn't the Osama type terrorist mastermind we are led to believe, he's a silly, confused actor. What A Tweest! Ben Kinglsey makes it nearly work, but logically, would the real villainous mastermind entrust this role, integral to his taking over-the-presidency scheme to this clown? Unlikely.<br/><br/>To enable the Stark attack on the villain's lair to find the Mandarin, suddenly Stark is like Jason Bourne (or John 'Commando' Matrix, the 80's Scwharzenegger movie, actually referenced in the film - 'I'm gonna kill you first') and the outside guards are easily defeated. Yeah, sure. <br/><br/>But Stark is captured and chained to a bed, where he is brutally bummed by Guy Pearce. Not really. The villains, like they never do with James Bond, should shoot him in the head at this point, but of course do not.<br/><br/>I could go on. But I'm bored. I would mention that Pepper Potts is captured, and to goad Stark, instead of say, brutally bumming her, they inject her with the hot-fingers-explode-and-maybe-regenerate-super-serum. Which while painful, as we know, ends up giving you super-powers, so brilliant idea there.<br/><br/>The movie isn't dull. It's often funny (though some humour comes from a super-villain leaving a toilet smelly, and a very camp/gay man who has a crush on Tony ho ho not), but sometimes - often in fact - goes for funny when it would have been better to keep the action and suspense going. <br/><br/>As I've said, it's biggest flaw is that it barely has any scenes with Iron Man, Stark inside, flying, looking cool, kicking ass, blasting people, maybe a bit drunk. And with Stark/Downey, the clumsily handled 'post-traumatic stress disorder' idea (he saw aliens in New York and nearly died... could be interesting but it goes nowhere) means he is rarely the cocky, over-confident Mr Know-It-All that charmed people in the first movie. He is rarely even dressed well!<br/><br/>Oh and the bad guys can explode themselves and survive. At the end some are exploded, and the main baddie is hit with a bit of metal by Pepper Potts who has become a bit explode-y herself. And then I think she explodes him. It's a bit unclear as to who is dead and why they wouldn't be able to regenerate and perhaps a more imaginative way of defeating them could have been devised. It seems to come back to Shane Black, who like in Lethal Weapon, thinks all you need is an abandoned shipyard, a black guy with a gun and a white guy with a gun trading snappy one-liners and saying 'cover me!' and then everything exploding and there's your perfect ending.<br/><br/>My review - Boo!"

","For the past week I haven't been in the best of moods, but still, I was expecting to be at least mildly entertained by Iron Man 3. Unfortunately I was not ... It is a complete and utter mediocre movie, full of twists you see coming miles away, lacking any sort of suspense and completely deprived of the witty humor Iron Man had before, in summary ... a golden polished drop of pooh.<br/><br/>There's so many stupid things leading to nowhere going on that I don't really even know where to start ... his anxiety attacks that lead to nowhere, how an army of unstoppable superhumans have nothing better to do but to blow stuff up in order to ... to ... nothing? ... the way 1 million suits appear out of nowhere after he plays MacGyver during the whole movie... the big middle finger you get shown after waiting for the end-credits scene ...<br/><br/>Besides being just boring and stupid most of the time, what bothered me the most was that it looks like someone decided to take upon himself a mission to prove that you don't need a Joker or Bane in your superhero movie for it to be memorable ... That someone should be tarred, feathered and let loose naked screaming coocoodoodledooo in front of Christopher Nolan's house. The way they butcher the Mandarin character is simply unforgivable ... I'm sorry but it just isn't ... it's not funny, it's not smart, it's not anything except utterly stupid.<br/><br/>I'm really sorry for RDJ, he tries to save the day, but even he cannot help Iron Man from pummeling into the ground on this one ... it looks to be doing fine in the box office though so better luck next time maybe ... the only way to go is up..."
"Mail-927-699065","5","4","8","6 May 2013"," An uncalled for head fake to Iron Man fans!!!
","I could not help but to feel...cheated...fooled...swindled into thinking I was going to be completely satisfied with the film. I will say first of all Robert Downey Jr. sells the film as usual by portraying the billionaire Tony Stark with accuracy. Which brings to me to the bad news, at least bad news for those of us who are familiar with the Marvel Universe. When I first heard Ben Kingsley was cast as the Mandarin I accepted it with open arms, he does not look oriental in any way compared to the classic Mandarin villain. Yet, I was willing to compromise, being that he is a great actor. What follows can be labeled as SPOILER!! material. A while back Marvel went on record stating they were not sure how they were going to address the Mandarin as a villain. I figured they had it in the bag since he was clearly displayed in the trailers, Ten Rings and all. So it was bit of a thwarted surprise when the Mandarin's character is simply a decoy in the film. Yes a decoy! Ironman's greatest archenemy was used as bait. Bait for all of those with any knowledge of who the Mandarin really was to feel that excitement of seeing Ironman square off against his deadliest foe. For those with no knowledge of who the Mandarin is will most likely go on about their day without noticing any wrong doing. The action is great, character chemistry is present much more than the previous standalone Ironman film. My gripe is the way they treated the Mandarin villain. The Mandarin is simply a diversion in order to bring to light the real villain of the film...Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Are you kidding me Marvel? Aldrich Killian, a character known in the Marvel universe as a cripple scientist who commits suicide after letting his work get into the hands of a terrorist group. I understand Marvel's approach to keeping story fresh and new but if you can imagine a Batman film in which the Joker is used merely as a decoy to bring on the real villain of the Scarcrow....Nope that will not work. The anticipation for the Mandarin has been built and as far as I'm concerned Marvel did not deliver the Mandarin the way he should have been brought to the screen. Instead we get Pearce's character breathing fire while having tattooed dragons on his chest. Oh and if your looking for the Ten Rings I hope your OK with just quick glimpse of Kingsley's knuckles because besides that, they are not mentioned at all in the film. Yet Killian manages to mutter to Stark ""You wanted the Mandarin Tony?, I am the Mandarin"" and we are supposed to swallow that Marvel? If they were looking for a twist they got but it came at a price. No one who invested time in reading Ironman books would appreciate the neglected Mandarin that was force fed to us in this film. That said, Shane Black did a good job at putting Tony Stark through situations without his armor that still managed to highlight Stark's intelligence and skill with mechanics. All hope is not lost though, even with all that transpired a clever writer can bring back the true Mandarin at a later point in the saga and give it the respect the character deserves."

","Iron Man 3 was not built for the comic fan, despite the multiple comic story lines that it touches on throughout the movie. If you don't follow the comics you'll probably enjoy this one, but God help you if you follow Iron Man comics; you'll probably be furious.<br/><br/>My main issue with Iron Man 3 is its use of the Extremis storyline. At no point does the movie touch on the actual intention of that particular storyline; the idea that genetic engineering had bypassed Tony's suits and technology is completely ignored. Extremis is reduced to a special effect that forces Tony to go through a bunch of suits to win, instead of examining the real fundamental problem: his suits can't stand up to Extremis-enhanced humans. In the book, Tony is beaten so badly by a militant with Extremis powers that he fixes the process, injects it in to himself and actually BECOMES the armor. Why in the world the writers couldn't see the possibilities of this is utterly, completely beyond me. What infuriated me was the ending: Tony apparently uses the Extremis tech to make it so he doesn't need the arc reactor in his chest, but at no point is it explained or expanded upon to make any sense to the casual movie fan. The writers go from insulting comic fans to giving them unexplained lip service at the end which only serves to confuse someone with no comic knowledge. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that the movie was all bad- to the contrary, it held a lot of wonderful moments, and the over-arching storyline was that of a man coming to grips with this anxieties and fears. But my God, so many missed opportunities to expand on the tortured man concept, the inadequacy of his tech in the face of new genetic developments, the fact that by marrying Extremis with the suit he could become one of the most powerful superheroes in the Marvel universe. <br/><br/>I guess my issues with the movie stem from my high expectations; if I'd kept them lower and treated it as the popcorn summer flick that it is, I'd probably enjoyed the movie far more."

It was a good movie if you was non comic fan, female, or a studio that made millions. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 had that unnecessary movie type of suspense that's found in a soap or twilight film.

"chjx","3","4","8","4 May 2013"," It Had To Happen Eventually...
","Marvel, at some point, had to make a really bad blockbuster superhero movie. I'm just truly sorry Iron Man 3 had to be it, as Iron Man 1 & 2 are two of my favorite movies of all time. And Marvel went all out in their efforts to make this one really, really, bad.<br/><br/>As the legendary Dr. (Seuss) himself put it so succinctly: Stink, stank, stunk.<br/><br/>If you were never a fan of the Iron Man comic books (especially the early ones; I owned the first editions of almost every single Marvel comic in 1968, when I was 14) --and you are okay with people breathing fire and running around with a body temperature of 1000 degrees in what is supposed to be a superhero movie series dominated by ""realistic"" technology-- then you may not have the same set of issues I did with the film.<br/><br/>I had some concerns from reading the various discussions of the plot -- starting as far back as a year or so ago-- regarding the rumor that the film was built around the ""Extremis"" story line from the more recent Iron Man comics, which I personally felt was unsuitable material as the base for an Iron Man movie that would fit well with the first two.<br/><br/>But more recently my fears had subsided because a very different take on the movie's plot was being offered by many people who were supposed to be in the know about the film (a take that turned out to be totally false, but alleged that the film would be a more down-to-earth spies, assassins, and technology type affair). It turns out my fears were warranted, and from my perspective the plot was a total disaster.<br/><br/>I knew the moment that the ""illusion"" (as I will politely refer to it for now to avoid spoiling the ""fun"" for those that haven't seen the film) regarding the primary villain was revealed one thing was was bound to happen: The Iron Man comics fans would savage this movie because of the way The Mandarin was depicted. For long-time fans of the Iron Man comics the manner in which The Mandarin was handled and portrayed would almost certainly be perceived as heresy, or sacrilege. And, based on the reviews preceding this one, my intuition was spot-on accurate.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that I myself emitted an audible gasp when that moment arrived, and I was also overwhelmed with nausea, because it basically -- in an instant-- consigned Iron Man 3 to the scrap heap of superhero movies.<br/><br/>And then, it got worse...<br/><br/>In general things just happened in the film, with little or no explanation provided for the events, processes, or results. And the movie's conclusion consisted of about a minute and a half of a poorly executed scramble intended to wrap-up all of the loose ends left behind during the course of the film. In not much more than a small fraction of the movie's running time a half-dozen or so intractable issues were magically resolved and numerous life-altering decisions were made --even though none really had to be.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie fell flat because the writers, directors, and producers tried to do way to much with it and in the process completely lost control of the story line. They, as a group, simply allowed the film to suffer from what we in the product engineering field call ""feature creep"": the tendency for project managers to try to cram in a bunch of enhancements and features at the last minute, which detracts from the reliability of the more important 95% of the product that is already complete and just needs to be polished up and tested properly.<br/><br/>It was also apparent that the producers of this disaster had way to much film ""in the can"" and way too little time to fit enough of it in, leaving a seriously jumbled mess as the result.<br/><br/>My advice, in a nutshell? Go see it and make up your own mind. But be forewarned.<br/><br/>Me, I'll be trying to wash the bad taste of this unsavory film out of my mouth for quite a while."

"kaelzhang559","4","4","8","4 May 2013"," Bad
","Sacrifice the arch-nemesis of Iron Man for such a minor character is BAH. Such as making Thanos a hologram of some toddler in the Avengers 2. Yes it's going to be a bigger twist but will you like it? I won't deny Talia is weak, even in the movie. TDKR is the final one of the trilogy, she is too weak for the final antagonist, both in strength and persona. She doesn't have her goal and motive like Ra's Al Ghul and the Joker, she was simply following her dad's step, wanted to avenge him, even the organization was her dad's legacy.<br/><br/>I think let her father return would be better since he fit better as the final antagonist of the trilogy as the creator of LoS and his character was established very well in BB, his relationship with Bruce is also much deeper.<br/><br/>However, let's not forget, Talia is not the arch-nemesis of Batman, before we went half way through TDKR we don't see much of her presence, and she didn't take too much credits from Bane. The Mandarin is different. The ""Ten Rings"" showed up in the first Iron Man movie, some organization also backed up Whiplash. So many people wanted to see the Mandarin, Jon Favreau even was asked about it and he said he wanted to make the Mandarin like the Emperor in SW OT. During Iron Man 3's production, not many people care about Guy's character, but the Mandarin confirmed is a big news.<br/><br/>Would it be boring? If they made a vote for the antagonist between Alrich Kilian and the Mandarin for Iron Man 3, it would have been a landslide result. Nobody wants to see some minor character replace the arch-nemesis as the antagonist, for some dumb twist that has been used quite a few times.<br/><br/>Yeah I blamed enough about the Mandarin, and now the twist is totally unnecessary. Unlike Ras' Al Ghul in BB or Talia in TDKR. We knew Aldrich Killian is a bad guy from the flashback, it's way too obvious, even Tony himself mentioned he created demons. What's the point to ruin the Mandarin and make him from the 2nd bad guy the biggest bad guy? Also if he was the leader of the Ten Rings, why didn't he start his revenge when his minions captured Tony in the first one? And beside he does not have any connection with the comic Mandarin beside his tattoo, he does not have rings' power, he is not Asian, he's super stupid as a villain.<br/><br/>Remember the bald guy who works for Killian? That guy followed him to see Pepper, many many people were there and saw him with Killian. And later he showed his power, publicly to people on the street! What the heck is this? I remember the explosion of that minion is an accident, even if it wasn't, people were already running away when the bald guy started to use his power, there surely would be some survivors to tell the security the tale. Not to say later that bald guy showed up again, using his power to melt the water tank and tried to kill Tony publicly, also many people saw it. Once this was known by the US government or Tony, he would easily be able to identified and his boss would be revealed for sure. Killian even told Pepper about Extremis, he could not get away. That's just super stupid! Also later, why didn't Tony let his armors to just fly up the sky and shoot down every of those Killian's minions? They were strong and got fire power, but they couldn't fly or jump that high. Tony also could just fly up and shoot Killian to pieces, all he had to worry to would just be some flame(maybe he wouldn't even have to worry about it because Killian might not be able to shot fire that high).<br/><br/>Overall it's just stupid to ruin the Mandarin and make some retarded guy, who was not even a villain in the comic to be the final, antagonist, of the final piece of the trilogy!"

","I must confess that I entered the cinema hall with a very different set of expectations ,the exact same expectations which have been progressively built through both the sequels and the super successful Avengers.and that is the probable reason ,why, many people have not welcomed this one . This movie answers the legendary question that , weather ' Man makes the suit or Suit makes the man' And the answer has been brilliantly been given by Mr.Shane Black, with the help from our beloved 'Tony Stark' and his associates - Pepper,Rhodes and Happy. I personally think that Robert Downey Jr. Is an enigma ......give him a dead role and still he will light it up like fire , in fact in both the earlier installments ,he has underplayed his potential but In this one Mr.Black has allowed him to perform beyond the suit . I guess , what Nolan tried with Batman trilogy and what Sam Mendes did with Skyfall this one is on the same path , showing that Heroes also bleed ,they cry ,they fail and they are as vulnerable. As for the villains ,weather , it's the Mandarin or Aldrich Killian - Mr . Black wants to put forward a completely new point altogether - Like the Good , even the Bad is just a symbol ......it's just a projection of evil or negative .....the characters don't matter - And I am reasonably sure that , this aspect of his will draw a certain amount of flak.But if one truly understands his point then One will welcome this 'one' with Wide Open Arms. Iron-Man 3 by all means is a leap .......a leap not only from its prequels but from all the other super hero features,especially the ones in Marvel universe."

","I very much enjoyed the first two Iron Man films as well as the Avengers, this one however while it certainly had some fun moments does not rise to the level of the others.<br/><br/>If the film is to be taken as nothing more than a ""popcorn flick"", then it's short comings are that it is too slow, too long and at points my seven year old complained of being bored.<br/><br/>If it is intended to be more than just a popcorn flick, then the shortcomings would become far more numerous; here are a few things I noticed (I'll do my best not to spoil the movie too much)...<br/><br/>-Tony Stark has some ""episodes"" throughout the film"", where he is sort of shell shocked from his experience in the Avengers, the problem is that it is done almost comically, so it is never taken to be something serious, and worse still has absolutely no pay off.<br/><br/>-For a large part of the movie Tony is without his suit as it is being charged up by his new little protégé. During this time he is desperate to get to the Mandarin before the next imminent attack. Eventually, his suit is fully charged and he re-acquires it, but later we find out that he has an entire army of Iron Man suits he could've hailed at any time, which pretty much makes the entire second act of the film pointless.<br/><br/>-There are two other such moments that quickly come to mind. One is when he is fighting two powerful opponents. The first one almost does him in, but he takes her out with an elaborate explosive he make-shifts on the fly. About two minutes later we find out he actually has a hidden palm blaster hidden on his person he could've used before.<br/><br/>-The next one really bugged me. Aboard Air Force One, Iron Man takes out a baddie who is on top of him using his chest blaster. Towards the end of the film the main bad guy is in virtually the same position above him, and instead of using the blaster that worked so well before, he does pretty much nothing, then tries to fight him with a sword blade that pops out of his suit.<br/><br/>-BIG SPOILERS AHEAD... the revelation of the true nature of the Mandarin will probably infuriate fans of the original comic series (of which I am not), but for me it was simply anti-climactic, and to be honest, not all that ""shocking"".<br/><br/>-As the film comes to a close, I'll suffice to say it is a tad ambiguous, in that it almost suggests that he is hanging up the Iron Man suit, as it were, and yet in his closing monologue he states that he IS Iron Man. This is actually a bit annoying to me because like everyone, I know there is another Avengers movie up coming, so they are obviously going to have to come up with some kind of contrived situation to get him back into the suit. More than that though, it really robs Tony Stark's character of the kind of cocky, narcissistic attributes that made him so awkwardly endearing in the first place.<br/><br/>To be clear, I didn't hate the film, just noticed that the bad story points really stuck out. There was a really neat scene in which Tony, similar to the first film, has to construct weapons out of odds and ends. I just wish they'd milked this scene a bit more because it could've been a lot cooler than it was.<br/><br/>Personally I wish I had've waited until it showed up on Netflix."

I'll say it one more time a little more clearly, I DID NOT SEE ONE GOOD FIGHT SCENE IN IRONMAN 3.

","Starting with the Avengers, Marvel has distastefully aimed their movies at the minds of children under the age of 12. This movie is absolutely, not an exception. Filled with a poorly constructed plot and jokes which took too much effort to make work, the clear focus of this film is the cliché of childish action flick: some good action and lots of explosions. Overall, quite disappointing as the first two iron man movies were quite enjoyable in my book. I don't know if Disney's involvement or Shane Black's directing is to blame and I don't care. I will say this, if marvel ever decides to make another movie with Iron Man in it, I beg of you, look towards pre-avengers movies for guidelines on how to make a movie that appeals to a mature person.<br/><br/>Also, I cannot stress enough the annoyance I find in the absurd length of the film and the constant desperation of the screenwriters to slip in another joke. Contrary to Marvels opinion, a movie can be good AND be under 3 hours long. Also, the constant barrage of ill-though out jokes make for poor entertainment."

Too much comedy and too little action. I honestly think this is one of the worse Marvel movies made in awhile. Iron Man 3 did not feel like a Marvel superhero movie. Tony Stark spent the majority of the movie out of his Iron Man suit which really disappointed me.

This movie was a huge disappointment to me in many ways.<br/><br/>How has this film got nearly 8/10 on average?! I honestly have no idea, there must be a lot of people out there who have no use for a plot that makes sense, and prefer CGI and explosions. Either that or Marvel paid them to write good reviews.<br/><br/>Let me start by talking around the plot holes. This film has so many plot holes it is the movie equivalent of swiss cheese. Firstly, why is Stark's suit so flimsy? He makes explosion-proof suits, and this one just falls apart all the time. To add to this point, if he's got an entire silo worth of suits that he can call on at any time, why not just call on them earlier in the film when he finds out that his Mk 42 is rubbish? There are so many plot holes in this film I could go on all day.<br/><br/>The comedy. What comedy. After 10 minutes this film ceases to be funny - they completely ruined the Mandarin; a villain I was convinced was going to be the best bad guy ever in these films. But no, they played for a cheap laugh. I was in a full cinema, and I'm telling you no-one laughed when he turned out to be a moron. In fact I heard the people behind me heave a deep sigh.<br/><br/>All in all it was a massive disappointment. I hope this film gets the reviews it deserves, because it was poorly written, poorly acted (aside from RDJ and a few others), and above all terribly directed.<br/><br/>The only reason this film has a 4/10 from me is because i love the Iron Man films."

An absolute tragedy considering his role as iron mans nemesis.<br/><br/>2- Lots of cool iron man suits for those looking passed the story and more at the action and gear. 3- A completely messy plot. Using the Mandarin as a decoy villain was an insult to the comic faithful. This felt like a t.v one shot and completely missed the characteristics of the villain.<br/><br/>Finally, I am a comic book fan. I like new ideas in a movie and don't fault a story angel that doesn't follow page by page tradition. However, this was simply a bad idea and the story completely abandoned the characters it was trying to introduce a mass audience too. Unfortunately, now the mass audience thinks the Mandarin is a joke. This was as big an opportunity as there are for marvel to build villains into something special..and they decided to completely diminish Iron Man's biggest foe. Bad Idea.<br/><br/>5/10"
"kimotep","4","4","8","3 May 2013"," No Iron Man would endure should endure seeing this movie
","How can anyone really say this is a movie which is remotely above average rating? There is nothing in the movie which is new or innovative. Just the same lame run of the mill action herky jerky as the second installment (which, unbelievably, is worse yet!).<br/><br/>Trailer looked promising, execution on movie obviously sub-par. The emotions and more gritty feel of the trailer was extremely misleading, as the actual movie is somewhat more akin to comedy than drama.<br/><br/>Marvel franchise is getting drive to the ground with this bullshit. What ever happened to the Tony Stark of Iron Man 1, where the character evolvement actually makes sense? In this latest installment, the very-hard-to-believe anxiety attacks and the mushy interaction between the 'Mechanic' and the all-too-cute little town boy is completely over the top. Whoever came up with this story arc should seriously rethink his career... <br/><br/>Only bright spot is Robert Downey JRs usual great dialogue and Ben Kingsleys erratic Mandarin character.<br/><br/>Would not recommend this to anyone with an IQ above normal house temperature Celsius."

What were IM's other prototypes doing when the mansion was under attack ? Couldn't Jarvis send the prototypes when IM was in Tennessee/Miami.<br/><br/>A Villain needs to be more powerful for a better hero to emerge.

","Iron Man 3 is very different to the previous films. I really like the way the plot revolves around the aftermath of the Avengers film and it's effect on Tony Stark. There's lots else that's good, a bit more time for character development and some really mean bad guys this time around.<br/><br/>As part of the franchise Iron Man is really now only competing with itself and this time, I think it's met it's match. Given the way the ending ties up, it looks like the producers have finally laid their swords on the table too.<br/><br/>It's a good film to watch at the start of the US blockbuster season. It won't disappoint.. well maybe except for some of the inconsistencies (shared in other reviews here) regarding the abilities of the suits which seem to be far more fragile in this film.<br/><br/>And then there's that embarrassing continuity problem that brings you out of fantasy land altogether whenever superheroes blow up. Come on! When you design bad guys who can turn into 3000 degree fires and explode and then rebuild themselves, why do they always seem to be wearing pants again when they walk out of the fire? Don't they know that fabric burns too? Whoops.<br/><br/>ZM"
"kumar-india-kiran","5","4","8","30 April 2013"," Iron man 3: Not Upto the Expectation, just Average.
","Had a lot of expectation about the 3rd Movie of Iron Man Series. I watched today in IMAX, totally disappointed. I expected some action sequence with Iron man suite and a exploration of the new suite invented.<br/><br/>But it was like 95% of the movie, it was just Tony Stark, not Iron man at all was featured and even in the action sequence, Iron man had a very less priority given, and the suite was given least priority. I would say its the worst when compared to the other 2 part of the movie.<br/><br/>One more thing noticed was , the other two movies, we felt everything as natural and along with it Tony add his technological skill to build a suite. But in this one the movie has lost it's natural look, as some Un-natural things like human with fire inside, regenerating humans from fire etc, all kinda unwanted things they have introduced.<br/><br/>Finally I was wondering how it got a IMDb rating of 8, a rating of 5 should be more than enough."
"vamsee256","5","4","8","29 April 2013"," The only thing good about IM3 are the action sequences. Full stop.
","I had such high hopes when going for this movie, that perhaps I raised the bar too high for IM3. If I hadn't watched IM1, IM2 and Avengers, I probably wouldn't have been this disappointed. Here are some plot holes I would've liked to see corrected.<br/><br/>1. Why you don't go threatening dangerous criminals by giving them your home address if you cannot protect it<br/><br/>The movie starts well until IM's house gets smashed to pieces with a few helicopter missiles. Now don't start questioning how or why IM, with his plethora of automated iron suits and sophisticated security systems couldn't save his house, not to mention he was expecting it. Also, later on in the movie we see him call his other suits using the same suit he is wearing during his escape. Now as a logical thinker, I really shouldn't ask why he didn't protect his house with these suits in the first place. Oh also he relies on just the one suit which was powering down during his escape. Now why didn't he call the others to save him once he escaped?<br/><br/>2. Don't be frightened by a powerful villain because, maybe, he is just a comedian <br/><br/>The initial part of the movie shows the Mandarin as a ruthless and extremely powerful criminal of Asian origin (talk about stereotypes) and the build up is quite impressive. However little do we know that the real villain is using him as a puppet (and with a much less catchy nickname). I would've loved to see Mandarin as the real villain.<br/><br/>3. If at all you buy an iron suit, just make sure it comes with a warranty, coz, you know, it might break easily<br/><br/>Watching the movie, I was wondering if this is the same iron suit that could withstand Thor's hammer (without crumbling to pieces) or could hold against the aliens' technology. OK, maybe IM, in his 52nd iteration somehow made the suit brittle. A flimsy/easily breakable iron suit just doesn't gel with the image I have of IM.<br/><br/>4. All's well if it ends well<br/><br/>Not really. The only memorable scenes in the movie are the action scenes (if you can somehow overlook the weak iron suits in these scenes). However RDJ's performance is outstanding. He lived up to his quirks, if I may say so."

","Now I don't even read comics, and never have, but you don't need to be a fan of this great superhero to recognize how terrible this piece of trash really is. First of all, why did they even attempt(but obviously fail) to mix the story lines of the mandarin and extremis villains into one film, those are simply stories for another day. I'll give the film props for the effects and direction, but overall this film is just under-developed, I know i shouldn't be ranting on a superhero flick but seriously, 79% ON ROTTTEN TOMATOES, 7.4 RATING ON IMDb!?!?!?!?! This is severely over-rated and it just angers me that people are so fast to nitpick Man of Steel and Dark Knight Rises, but this one gets a pass?!? DO NOT BUY THIS FILM it's overrated, the twist is extremely moronic and it isn't thought out, WHAT A STUPID CASH GRAB!!!!"
"lotus_chief","1","6","14","11 May 2013"," What an embarrassment, a complete slap in the face!!
","I watch the trailer for Iron Man 3 months ago, I love it. I go to a friend of mine who's deep into comics. I ask him, ""what's the deal with Mandarin?'. His reply? 'Mandarin is to Iron Man as Joker is to Batman'. WHOA! Hearing that after watching the trailer I was more than hyped to see this film; if for no other reason than enjoying Avengers and hoping they rebound from the horror that was Iron Man 2. Dare I say the third entry in this series is worse than the second one! The essence of superhero stories/movies is the villain. We don't get one here. From what I've heard, Mandarin is as big as they come in the Iron Man universe, the character was right there for the movie makers to translate to the big screen. But what does Shane Black & Co. do? They make an absolute joke out of Mandarin! He's there, but then he's....NOT there. That's the big twist?? The 'villain' in this film turns out to be someone who Tony Stark blows off one New Years Eve years ago who essentially comes back years later with unexplained powers and using a 'boogeyman' as a decoy. The 'boogeyman' aspect might be the only positive of the film, as it holds a mirror to the ways and actions of the US in the last decade or so.<br/><br/>There's just so many gripes I have with this film, but it's honestly not worth the extra time it'll take to type here, as I'm sure there's enough reviews on here describing just what is so wrong with this film. The sheer FAILURE of this film may just be a sign that it's time to slow down on the whole comic book craze in Hollywood. If they are just going to disregard the source material while at the same time taking a big sh!t on the wishes of comic book fans (and I'm not even one, per se), it would be best to just stay away from the comic book world altogether.<br/><br/>Again, I write this review as a movie fan. Iron Man 3 is just a bad movie. There is NOTHING out of the ordinary in this movie. Corny one-liners, idiotic plot holes and twists just pushes this mess of a movie to the depths of hell. I can't believe this script got OK'd by Marvel, Stan Lee & Co. How did they let this pass? If they were able to do Thor and the universe(s) featured in that story, why the hell couldn't they do that here with Mandarin and the 10 rings?!?! If you're going to put Mandarin in the film, PUT HIM IN THE FILM! I'm just appalled at the approach taken here. As loyal as comic fans are, it's understandable that you can't satisfy them all. It is when you show a complete disregard and disrespect for the source material that makes movies like this even more disturbing.<br/><br/>I can only offer condolences to all the fans (comic book fans in particular) that came to this expecting at least SOMETHING along the lines of what Nolan did with The Dark Knight. One cannot blame ANYONE for those expectations. Watching the trailer (which ends up being one of the biggest okie-dokes EVER put on movie fans), this film had the look of an epic with a darker tone, a la Nolan's Batman series. What we get is an inexcusable embarrassment; with the total castration of the hero's archenemy and the same old, same old with regards to effects, story, etc. Iron Man 3 is one of the worst films of the year.... actually, it's one of the worst movies ever made."

","So the plot doesn't really going anywhere, not like Iron Man 1 or Iron Man 2 which both movies lead us with their great story into the Avengers movie. But RDJ's acting is great as usual and the action scenes are very great. Very disappointed with the story though, it's like they running in the same circle in the whole movie. The MARVEL objective of this story kinda messed-up and it didn't felt like it will lead us into The Avengers 2, which I hope it will be on Thor upcoming movie and Captain America's also Nick Fury The director weren't make the IronMan look bad ass like in The Avengers who can fight aliens and other than human beings, the iron man role was barely shown and RDJ holding a gun rather than in an Ironman suit. It kinda looked opposite from The Avengers so yeah, it doesn't really meet to my expectations."

"jatzel09","6","6","14","26 April 2013"," An Improvement Over the Previous Entry
","Film-wise, 2008 will be remembered as the year of The Dark Knight. The movie that made critics and audiences alike go wild. But about two months before the Caped Crusader swept the Box Office, came the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man. A movie that also got good reaction from critics and made over 500 million at the Box Office. The movie had humor, a good villain and a charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr. who was great at being a less than heroic super hero. <br/><br/>The movie also planted the seed for the Avengers and Tony Stark had a cameo in Hulk just a month later. But then the sequel. That was a really big miss. Trying too hard with the humor and failing while also spending too much time trying to set up the Avengers. It was a big disappointment after an enjoyable first movie. However this was all forgiven and forgotten after 2012 saw a very entertaining Avengers adaptation. <br/><br/>Now comes Iron Man 3. While 2008 was the year that Downey Jr. became mainstream again with Tropic Thunder and Iron Man, he had been lead in some good smaller films like Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang directed by Shane Black whom he is now reunited with as Black takers over directing duties from Jon Favreau. The former director is Executive Producer this time but stays on camera as Happy Hogan.<br/><br/>The movie tries to do more with the character. Something that had not been done in the previous two. This time we see Stark struggling with anxiety which was a great touch. The talent of Downey Jr. is remarkable as he goes from light-hearted wit-master to serious in a matter of seconds and it does not come off as one bit phony. Quite the contrary it seems very genuine. Below all the humor is a real person with real problems. <br/><br/>While that was a nice exploration of the character, other things in the movie were not as well done. There was waste of talented actors, the action scenes while providing us with some good visuals, were not as good as the first Iron Man, the plot was not as compelling outside of Tony Stark and there were some shocking deviations from the source material. Not just artistic license but major deviations. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was also shockingly slow considering that something was always happening. Every scene had something and still, the two hours felt like two hours.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a great improvement over the previous entry but that is not saying much. The exploring of the character was nice and this is an Iron Man movie. Not a set up, but an Iron Man movie. My disappointment is with the waste of other actors, the action and some script decisions but it's an inoffensive movie. The audience seems to be liking it but if you are expecting to go to the theater and cheer, clap and laugh hysterically like last year with the Avengers, you will be surprised. Perhaps pleasantly if you like characterization, perhaps unpleasantly if you don't like change."
"DKosty123","7","5","11","13 May 2013"," Comedy & Action In Form
","This movie is a great example of what comedy and action in a tandem formula can do to attract an audience. The cast helps as Robert Downey Jr. might be in his last one as Stark/Iron Man. He has solid support. This one like previous 2 films in the series are for action/entertainment which is what brings people into the theater.<br/><br/>I am not a major comic book geek, so I make no connection of the characters with the drawn and written word. I believe this is a solid franchise in this genre. I doubt if one of these will ever be made that is the same as the comic books.<br/><br/>That being said, if the films get a little closer to the books, they might flow a little better and not require as much comic relief. Still, to me, you put your brain in park and prepared to enjoy the action. This and the attraction of the fine cast carry the day here.<br/><br/>Could it be better? Yes, like a lot of installments of the Bond series could be better. Still, the Iron Man films are what they are. I enjoyed this installment because I got pretty much what I expected here. This has become a pretty solid formula and they are hitting that target just about every time out."
"ddunawa","1","5","11","13 May 2013"," So bad, that I cried, and now I can't sleep.
","This movie is so bad that I have trouble sleeping at night. I have cold sweat nightmares, where I imagine Shane Black holding down the Iron Man suit and rapping him. I would go on and on with evidence as to why this movie is so bad, but I think the majority of the reviews speak for themselves. Before, anyone bashes me for being pro comic book or a genuine nerd. Let me first say that I have thought that Marvel had done a great job creating movies before this one. I did not have too much of a problem with Iron Man 2. This movie however is awful from start to finish. I hope Marvel can salvage this franchise and quit trying to make comic book movies as ""realistic"" as possible. They are comic book movies, they are not suppose to be real. You are writing sci-fi fiction, cut it out with the realism guys. My biggest gripe with the movie and it has been said by just about everybody on this review forum is The Mandarin. We were all fouled into thinking that an iconic super villain would take on a classic super hero. A show down that would set both on a path of awesome CGI destruction. I was unsure of how this would play out but I knew this was the show down we all wanted. The first two movies had less than quality show downs. The Mandarin is the biggest they could do and it's because of his abilities and his goal of ruling over all and destroying Iron Man. Ultimo, Fin Fang Foom, Justin Hammer, Zeke Stane (Obadaih's son) and others would come to his side in order to destroy Iron Man. The leader of SHIELD Tech, Leader inside SHIELD and friend to most all other super heroes. Cutting down Iron Man would hurt War Machine, Pepper Potts, and everybody. This movie gave us nothing. When Happy went into a coma, I have to be honest, I felt nothing. When Stark found the Mandarin's lair, I was like, yes! That quickly switched to yells of pain. I really hope that they can repair this by giving the Mandarin the rings and turning him evil but I feel that would be impossible."
"chezzi","10","5","11","11 May 2013"," Only True Fans Will Understand, Shane
","May or may not contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was brilliantly made, but only the ones that have followed Iron Man since early in the comics will understand the hidden messages encountered.<br/><br/>For example, who would have thought about the shrapnel-necklace he gave to Pepper in the end?<br/><br/>Who would have thought about Yinsen's importance in the opening-scene? Who would have thought about the Chinese doctor mentioned in the first Iron Man movie later appeared in this one?<br/><br/>Who would have thought about the song in the opening scene could mean so much? Who would have thought it had something to do with every single action in this movie; and who would have thought the reason he threw the arc reactor into the ocean would have something to do with it?<br/><br/>Who would have noticed the message it brought to us about living in the shadow of your fear? Only the ones that look for it. The mortals, the averages, the normal people, the ones who merely stay after the credits -- they will never find it."

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe. So far, it has been nothing short of spectacular. From Iron Man to the Avangers, all of these movies had nothing to hate and a lot to love for me as a long time Marvel fan.<br/><br/>So what's going on here?<br/><br/>When I wrote my gut reaction review on my blog, I was in pure HATE mode for this movie. Seeing the big ""twist"" in this movie really stuck in my craw, and I'm pretty sure that came through in my words.<br/><br/>In fact, just the Mandarin twist itself was enough to turn my feelings inside out for the whole movie, especially the end sequence. That was when I asked myself over and over again: THIS guy is the Mandarin?<br/><br/>However, upon second viewing the movie has revealed itself to be not AS bad as I thought before. there is some quality acting here, especially by Downey, and Kingsley looked AND SOUNDED like a truly intimidating terrorist (pre reveal, anyway).<br/><br/>However, I still think there was WAY too much comedy here. And not too mention the fact that many could have done without the kid sidekick thing, although it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have turned out.<br/><br/>Still, I expected and really wanted to see Tony Stark versus the Mandarin, as the trailers promised. I was expecting something darker than the previous two. What I got was a buddy cop kid film with potentially awesome ideas that ended up getting screwed up.<br/><br/>Are the rest of the Phase 2 movies going to be like this?

","""Iron Man 3"" does what most third entries in movie franchise don't do, turns in a great movie. This holds up very nicely next to the previous 2 installments, and I'd say it's probably better than ""Iron Man 2"" and about the same as the first movie. Here, Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) is haunted by the events of the Avengers and finds himself obsessing over creating and perfecting new suits. He is constantly trying to figure out new way to protect Pepper(Gwyneth Paltrow), and make the suits better and better. Then he placed in the cross hairs of a terrorist called the Mandarin(Ben Kingsley). Going any further than that would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, because there are quite a few surprises and twists, that I didn't see coming at all. Very unconventional super hero movie, which is great because it's a true breathe of fresh air. It's not your typical good guy vs. bad guy movie in a lot of ways. All the performances are great, and it really leaves you with a sense of ""how are they gonna do another one?!"" Marvel is battling a thousand when it comes to their movies and they continue that streak here. This is the first must see movie of the Summer and a great way to kick off the summer movie season. Also, stay after the credits, it's pretty awesome. less"

I'm completely sure the suit is in functioning order more often in Joss's spectacular.<br/><br/>Also.. they make the same mistake as 'The Dark Knight Rises'.

"CinemaJackIX","2","5","11","5 May 2013"," Iron Man 3
","My Experience <br/><br/>When I saw the first trailer to Iron Man 3, I was ecstatic. After having seen the disappointing Iron Man 2, I was dead set on this being a redemption movie simply because this was post Avengers. I walked in the theater knowing full well that I will one day own this on Blu Ray Combo Pack and now I don't even want a bootleg of this (never thought I say this) garbage. I'm writing this review because it is getting way too much praise and should not. When it comes to movies (especially comic book adaptations) I have a very high tolerance for fantasy, creativity, and imagination all grounded in reality. But even I have my limits. I got 3/4 of the way through the movie until I just couldn't buy it anymore. It was not getting any better. I could no longer blind myself to the plot holes and that this is a flat out bomb.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>GOOD: Iron Man 3 had me in stitches. Hands down the funniest Iron Man yet. Which is way I gave this 2/10 rather than its well deserved 1/10.<br/><br/>BAD: Like I said, I was able to get pretty far into the movie until the foundation of reality began to crumble. And once you pass that breaking point. The trolls come out of the woodwork on everything leading to that point. Strike 1: One definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. Tony Stark now has post traumatic stress sydrome induced by the awesome powerhouse of a movie that was: The Avengers. Which was a very smart route to go.'The Invincible Iron Man' that we know and love has reached a new level in humanity and venerability that we all have and can relate to. This problem was never resolved. In order to get over his memories and hallucinations of battle from The Avengers he goes to fight in another battle. Insanity. Ball 1: It is a Christmas family comedy nothing more. Do not kick off the summer with a Christmas movie. It's sort of an unspoken rule. This is nothing against Christmas. It's remains to this day my favorite holiday and always will when it is appropriate. Strike 2: This is was near breaking point, Sir Ben Kingsley. One of the best actors of our time. The Mandarin destined to be one of the greatest performances in a comic book movie or movies in general since Heath Ledger's Joker. The role was abruptly dismantled and castrated into nothing more than: Trevor. An actor with a drug and alcohol dependency. A front for the real Mandarin Guy Pearce's character. Bad twist. <br/><br/>UGLY: Ball 2: There was an overuse of CGI especially when Rhodes was swinging while holding on the trailer. It reminded me of the biggest abomination to ever grace human presence that is: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Strike 3: This is the last and biggest strike for me. All valid points made were permissible until this point. Pepper Potts at the beginning of the movie finally put on the Iron Man suit which was awesome. Naturally, she had no knowledge of using it and struggled operating it. Fast forward to the end of the movie if you will. She seemed to have full knowledge of the Iron Man hand blaster along with knowledge of hand to hand combat. She takes out the archenemy of Iron Man: The Mandarin. In Spiderman (2002), did Peter Parker let Mary Jane take out The Green Goblin? Did Bruce Wayne let Vicki Vale (Batman 1989) or Rachel Dawes (The Dark Knight 2008) take out the Joker. The Mandarin is the archenemy of Iron Man. I have no problem with female leads taking out villains. For example, Catwoman took out Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and I loved it, but there is a reason why we call them archenemies. They challenge the physical and mental essence of the protagonist. Which Guy Pearce's character did and all Stark did was slap him around a bit and then let his girlfriend finish him. It seems Marvel Studios' Phase 2 isn't off to a good start."

"DICK STEEL","10","13","38","25 April 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Iron Man 3
","To tell you more about the story will be a great disservice, because whoever cut the trailers, did the perfect misdirection, with what you think you know from the trailer, being very much farther away from the real truth. So that's that. What was expected though, was how closely this narrative ties in as post-events to the Avengers, with Tony Stark now elevated to more than a hero status, instantly recognizable amongst plenty of geeks, and with countless of references back to his exploits in the finale of that movie. It's one thing being recognized, and another thing having to grapple with the reality that there are threats larger than life now, which is Tony Stark's perennial bug bear in this installment. A pity of course, since it's supposed to be the parallel of his pain and addiction to the bottle, which will never see the light of day with Disney as owner.<br/><br/>Fans of Robert Downey Jr, will rejoice with this better than expected installment, since he spends most of the time outside the suit as Tony Stark, battered, bruised and worn out, no thanks to the reckless stunt he pulls as part of personal vendetta, but putting his loved ones at risk and under fire. One cannot get enough of the actor's charisma on screen, and at this point, it's inconceivable to think of any other actor stepping into the role other than Downey Jr, who owns the role, and makes his ""I am Iron Man"" declaration all the more a truth. There are franchises that get tired after a while, but in Downey Jr, who is portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man in no less than 4 feature films already, there's no lack of enthusiasm, and it shows. Having him outside of the suit for the most parts, is also that breath of fresh air, especially well when it got written into the plot with his tinkering having brought him to a stage where he can be inside, or outside the suit, remote controlling portions of it, and having both an arsenal to count on, plus his street smarts when backed to a corner, and having to design really rudimentary weapons with items from a hardware store.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau continues his role as Happy Hogan, given a lot more to do this time round since he's given up the director's chair, while Gwyneth Paltrow will be that Pepper Potts we have all yet to see. The appeal of Iron Man 3 is how it takes apart the status quo without feeling like it needed to just to stand out from the crowd, but doing so in a fashion that makes it seem like natural progression. Even Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes / War Machine / Iron Patriot also had the character pick up pace from the midway point, combining once again with Tony Stark / Iron Man as an effective team. Paul Bettany remains the unseen but often heard voice of Jarvis, although I thought this time he sounded a little more baritone than in the earlier films. And the standout amongst the supporting cast would be Ty Simpkins whose Harley, a kid whom Tony Stark befriends, plays something of a pivotal role, which once again brings back a little bit of the sharp wit that the previous Iron Man role seemed to lack.<br/><br/>The action here's slicker than what we've already seen from the earlier movies, from its large set action pieces as already seen in the trailer set to pump up some adrenaline, while Iron Man 3 pretty much showed that Tony Stark had put in dutiful hours in the gym and picking up a slew of martial arts along the way. Especially useful since he spends quite a significant amount of time outside of the suit. And the CG got kicked into high gear especially when the arsenal of Iron Men came out to the open, which is fun to watch, but ultimately really cursory and brief, which was my main gripe about it. And it's no surprise too that humour was well placed throughout the film, even when this was darker in tone amongst its predecessors.<br/><br/>Those of you who have been up in arms about this film's kowtow to the Chinese studios, may want to take note that the scenes involving the Chinese actors Wang Xueqi, and Fan Bingbing, were nothing more than a glorified blink-and-you-miss cameo for the former, and a non- appearance by the latter. While there exists an alternate, longer cut of their scenes for the China market, I doubt their characters were written with that much depth to have caused any real impact to the narrative, since they can be so cleanly shaven off from the international release. I am curious however, as to what those scenes exactly were, so I guess one can wait for the discs to find out how, if their scenes get re-entered as deleted ones.<br/><br/>We see more of Tony Stark in this Iron Man film, which is a good thing, but one which also bode some closure to the franchise if it show chooses to end on a high note at this point, no thanks to the finale in having a key cause removed. Something like The Dark Knight Rises having to come full circle with its characters. But it's really never-say-never since Avengers 2 is a go, so there's one more real outing before anyone can call it quits to bidding RDJ and the rest of the cast farewell for starting what had snowballed into the definitive Marvel cinematic universe. Stay tuned, as you would already know by now, until the end of the credits for a scene that neatly bookends this movie, since it began with a narration, and would reveal that bit of a surprise with the post credits stinger. A no-brainer recommendation for Iron Man / Avengers fans everywhere."

","The events of New York(think ""team-up"") changed things. Gods and aliens exist... how do you deal with that? Well, the President(Sadler, as a passionate, protective man) feels the US needs its own hero, and repaints War Machine with Captain America's color scheme, calling it Iron Patriot(and the first person to ask why it isn't Norman Osborn in there will be slapped silly), and having it work directly for the government... and yes, it's still piloted by Rhodey(Cheadle, truly engaging the buddy dynamic), whose loyalties are thus split between his job and his long-time best friend.<br/><br/>And Tony(Downey Jr., completely game, with the charm and snarky arrogance fully intact) has to face the love triangle between him, his obsession with tinkering with his tech, and Pepper(Paltrow again with personality, not a mere fantasy object, a strong female role, toying with the ""damsel in distress"" trope)... the one that matters most to him. He also has to deal with the anxiety he's feeling after fighting off an outer space invasion(and yes, the trailer is accurate: for much of this, he has to rely on his wits, improvising in order to make due... often the best type of story about someone who has enormous responsibility and/or skill. We again have something from his past, yet it feels original again).<br/><br/>And from the outside, there is the threat of The Mandarin(Kingsley granting him immense charisma, leading to a presence that is felt whether he is on-screen or not; and yes, we finally have a villain who is there from the very start), who blows up and threatens targets, yet leaving no traces to follow(thus we get comments on the War on Terror, and in general this has the feel of a Tom Clancy thriller, and feels politically relevant, current... without cramming a viewpoint down your throat). Killian(Pearce, an ambitious businessman that can be hard to get a read on) emerges from relative obscurity with the Extremis virus, a substance able to regrow lost limbs, that will become integral to the plot.<br/><br/>This is the best of the trilogy. Shane Black brings his style to it, with several elements reminiscent of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and melds them well with this universe - narration, quirk, etc. This rejuvenates the gotten-stale series(note that the overall film franchise did not need it), and clearly, that enthusiasm grips all the actors, as well, who do impeccably, several of them having to span a lot of the spectrum, and doing so flawlessly. The side characters are memorable and credible - be it Happy(Favreau, putting all his energy towards the portrayal of the now chief of security of Potts, with greatly increased paranoia for our amusement), a kid(who gives a truly believable performance)... I could go on.<br/><br/>Somehow, this hits the gas on humor even more than they were already doing, and it is hilarious and infinitely quotable. The dialog is fresh, organic and smart. This has a ton of twists and unexpected developments, and rather than confuse matters, they add complexity to otherwise seemingly straightforward endeavors and keep you guessing. The action is huge(cemented by the epic score), exciting(and in spite of the scope, you never lose track of what's going on or become overstimulated) and effectively raises the stakes - the climax is stunning, funny and a fantastically constructed pay-off to everything that has been set up along the way.<br/><br/>This is paced immensely well - it has you right from the opening seconds and through the two hours it runs until the ending credits start(and yes, you will want to stay after them!). The 3D is post-conversion, and it's good, not mind-blowing... if you're on a budget, you can forgo that.<br/><br/>There is some bloody, tense violence(usually not graphic), a bit of moderate language and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone who is enjoying these(and yes, you will have to have watched the two first ones, as well as The Avengers... on the plus side, there is a lot of respect for continuity between them). 9/10"

Robert Downey Jr is great in the lead role showing a more vulnerable side to Tony Stark and the supporting performances from Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jon Favreau and Ben Kingsley are also great. The humour works and the action is thrilling, especially a sequence on/outside air force one. The twist is smart and funny however the villain is one of the more forgettable Marvel villians.

","A new director takes on the reign to the Iron Man franchise, Shane Black. Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2 but not on par with the first Iron Man. The film is a little darker and more serious than its predecessors but not by much. Entertaining adventure, some cool action sequences, with some surprises, let's get right to the surprises. 1 of the notable twist was Ben Kingsley's supposedly role of The Mandarin, wasn't really The Mandarin, he was just an actor with substance-abuse hired by the real villain to fake it. Ben Kingsley's talents were wasted. As a long time, comic book fan, I've gotta say, that was truly a disappointing twist in the movie, disgusted by it. And that's that."
"codehim2","5","2","3","3 June 2016"," A Huge Iron Mandarin Mistake!
","The main beef I have with this film surrounds the directorial choice to use the Mandarin as a total foil instead of the true antagonist. Perhaps a candidate for one of the worst ideas EVER by the MCU! Obviously the director had little affinity to the original Iron Man story, or he would never have attempted such a thing. And yet I thought they picked THE PERFECT ACTOR to play the Mandarin too! Such a disappointment that they wasted his talent, especially since the antagonist (Aldrich Killian) was a laughable substitute with a nearly spoof-like backstory and shallow motivations. To add insult to injury, they write the plot where Tony spends basically the whole movie out of the suit, and then has him totally destroy all his remaining suits at the end for some fireworks. Overall, I'd give it 5 exploding Iron Man suits out of 10."

","Back in 1999, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who is working on her bio project. It would simply be an one night stand and he would also blow off Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). The two of them would come back to cause trouble in the present. In the present, Stark is haunted by the battle of NY and is suffering sleepless nights and panic attacks. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now CEO. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)'s suit has been renamed Iron Patriot. And there is a new terror menace named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>I love the fact that Stark is suffering from the battle of NY. The sarcastic humor is funnier than ever. In this one, Stark even picks up a funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is one problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits. It makes the ending less reasonable. But the ending is chalk full of explosive fun, and I'm willing to ignore any minor problems."

","It seems even Tony Stark, now suffering panic attacks from that wormhole in New York City, realizes he can't top all the bombastic glory of THE AVENGERS. Thus IRON MAN 3 goes beneath that epic adventure, providing more of a subtle espionage thriller than a superhero roller coaster.<br/><br/>The best scenes have Tony Stark figuring out things on his own after his mansion is attacked and destroyed by impending forces led by The Mandarin, who, played by Ben Kingsley, resembles Osama Bin Laden with the voice of Dan Rather. Mandarin devises (or appears to be devising) televised terror strikes, and the rampage on Stark's pad sets the stage for the rest of the film: Tony's defunct iron suit in hand, he winds up in a small town – kind of a white trash Norman Rockwell painting.<br/><br/>After meeting a helpful young boy, who thankfully is an effective character and not that corny, Tony – who's become a bare knuckle James Bond type – traipses into the villain's lair and finds out something not worth spoiling: Although Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian, first shown in the film's backstory/prologue, was such a frantic scientific underdog he can only get worse. Yet the really important heavies are the agents that can heal themselves instantly, making like that liquid cop in TERMINATOR 2... sleek, resilient, unstoppable... providing Tony Stark (and company) a few cool fights along the way.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. turns in another fine performance in the title role, although his rapid fire sarcasm is hit or miss, only provided he has funny lines to deliver – some are, some aren't. But what makes this third IRON MAN work are the eclectic locations of the action sequences: from a dungeon lair to a soaring air plane to a final stand on an old oil freighter, there's always something to excuse the pun marvel at, despite the plot getting overly complicated and the villain wielding powers that are a bit of a reach, even for a comic book movie."

","For the last year I've felt that the massive success of The Avengers—and I mean its artistic success, not its box office—was a double-edged sword for Marvel. After all, wouldn't the individual character films feel a bit... small after that? IM3 attempts to use that to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose. It's a character study with a bit of spectacle slapped on, and I do mean ""bit"". While the third act does follow the standard ""Stuff go boom!"" formula, the first two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional (with one notable exception). To make this work you need an actor who can hold the audience's attention. Thankfully IM3 has the ultimate ace in the hole in Robert Downey Jr. But even his unmatched charisma can merely Spackle over the film's many flaws. The story is weak, the stakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum. There are a lot of things to like here. The aforementioned RDJ, some sharp dialog, a scene stealing turn by Ben Kingsley and a jaw-dropping twist. Unfortunately the sum of IM3 is less than its parts."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","6","1","1","20 April 2020"," An old review from 2013 on one MCU movie I've never really loved
","I'm not a huge comic book kind of guy, yet I still love a well-made comic book movie as much as the next person. Nolan's Batman trilogy is a great one- his film's have a few minor flaws but ultimately all three of them are gripping and entertaining. The first Iron Man was surprisingly good. It's been a while since I watched the Spiderman movies, but I remember enjoying them for the most part. Seeing The Avengers last year was one of the most fun trips to the movies I've ever had.<br/><br/>So it was disappointing for me to come out of Iron Man 3 feeling letdown. Had I hyped myself up for it too much? Yes and no- I thought the trailer was great, and it got me pretty excited. Early reviews were extremely positive, and my expectations were heightened further. Then the movie was released to the general public, and I noticed a number of negative to mediocre user reviews on IMDB. I didn't read any of them in detail, and for the most part just assumed that they were nit-picky reviews from die-hard fans of the comics disappointed about some minor detail that wasn't a concern to me- (""oh, his suit doesn't look quite right."" I myself couldn't care less.) And it really sucks, but I'm going to have to side with these less positive reviews because I felt incredibly underwhelmed by this film, and I'll try my best to explain why without revealing any major spoilers, as I'm aware this film is only just coming out now.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is completely inconsistent in its tone and style. While this is probably the Iron Man film with the most attempts at humour, it is also the ""darkest"" Iron Man film yet (other people's words, not mine). I don't actually think the movie really succeeds in being darker and grittier but I can tell that the film-maker's probably wanted to make something a little edgier, but then kind of destroyed the chance of that happening by throwing in a near constant stream of goofy jokes. There's a few too many in this movie, and they don't all work.<br/><br/>Mind you, there were some moments I laughed- but there were other times I sat there shaking my head because a number of the jokes felt so forced and out of place. There's no proper dramatic moments in the film because most of it's just too damn goofy. There's no tension, no nail-biting moments. Our main protagonist seems aware that he's in a goofy comedy action film, and therefore he knows that he's never in any real danger. I wasn't a fan of Iron Man 2, but at least he was vulnerable for a good portion of that movie, and in that case at least a little compelling. Here, he loses a lot- this was heavily implied, almost shown by the trailer- yet it never really seems to hurt his progress. He shrugs off devastating circumstances because he knows he's fine. He knows Disney and Marvel will never properly harm one of their biggest and most popular money-making characters.<br/><br/>I get it. I understand nothing too tragic will ever affect Iron Man himself, but I wish the character didn't also know this. We need a believable character we can root for, who not only goes through tough times but is affected by them. And yes, the events of The Avengers are brought up, and Tony Stark keeps telling us that he's traumatised by what happened, but you never really FEEL his fear, you're just told about it. Ultimately he still has no qualms about using his suit, and his physical strength is never weakened. Hell, he's still real cocky too, telling The Mandarin his home address so the antagonist will bring the fight to Tony's doorstep- hardly the actions of a ""defeated"" and ""traumatised"" man.<br/><br/>And yes, I know I'm complaining about the goofy tone in this movie, and yes, I know The Avengers, which I already mentioned I was a big fan of, was also quite goofy. But it was a consistent sort of goofiness- the humour was so purely ""Joss Whedon-ey"" and it just flowed and pretty much every joke worked. The humour in Iron Man 3 is, like a Will Ferrell comedy, quite hit and miss, and feels more out of place considering Iron Man 3 is ""supposed"" to be a grittier and more intense Iron Man film.<br/><br/>I've always thought that one of the key factors in making a protagonist easy to root for (I accidentally nearly wrote ""root-worthy"" there) is by forcing them to face an absolutely despicable villain. You don't even need a particularly compelling protagonist if you have an absolutely vile antagonist- just look at the 2010 Japanese film 13 Assassins, a sort of modern re-telling of Seven Samurai, which shows the main villain using a captive family (children included) as target practice in order to improve his archery skills. He is a villain so unlikeable that the final showdown between him and his army vs the titular thirteen assassins becomes extremely compelling, as we as the audience want him dead- badly.<br/><br/>The villain department in Iron Man 3 is very disappointing. Ben Kingsley is wasted as The Mandarin, a bizarre character who we never really get to see face Iron Man in the way we'd like to see- a character and an actor so under-utilised it hurts. Kingsley's voice is also absolutely absurd- was it meant to be menacing or something? It's even sillier than Bane's from The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>The main antagonist of the film really has no clear motive. Yes, he wants to rule the world and get rich and have power and stuff, but why does he have such a grudge against Iron Man? We are given a reason, but I thought it was a pretty weak one.<br/><br/>Also: the already infamous twist is dumb. I didn't like it. That's all I'll say.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 has a great cast, but they're not very well utilised. Don Cheadle is in about one scene in the film's first hour, and after that becomes a boringly standard black sidekick for Tony Stark. Gwenyth Paltrow yells at Tony a lot and becomes a damsel in distress when the plot requires her to be. Guy Pearce is... okay. Nothing about his performance really stood out- Sorry Guy, this one's probably not gonna get you on the Hollywood A-list either. Keep trying.<br/><br/>I'm a bit mixed on Robert Downey Jr. He's good, he's fairly entertaining, and even while not all his jokes work he delivers them to the best of his ability, and to his credit he makes most of them at least decent. But the man's been playing this character in all his movies lately, and it's kind of getting annoying. His acting range isn't really stretched too far in this film either, because Tony Stark really doesn't act like that much of a changed man, even if he keeps telling the film's other characters (and the audience) that he is. So Downey Jr's good, but I'd like to see the actor pick a few more diverse roles in his future (does anyone remember him in Natural Born Killers? He was amazing in that movie- my favourite aspect of that film by far).<br/><br/>Then there's the minor plot holes and inconsistencies- every big budget Hollywood action film nowadays seems to have them- not even the very good The Dark Knight Rises and the excellent The Avengers from last year were free of them. Things like Tony putting an Iron Man suit on Pepper at one point to save her from danger, and then telling a disappointed Rhodes later in the film that he can't wear one because they're only modeled to fit Tony. Then there's the un-justified fact that Tony's armour is far weaker in this film than it was in the previous Iron Man films and The Avengers- it falls apart like rusted scrap metal on a number of locations. To mention too many more inconsistencies and questionable details would start to spoil things, but trust me, they're there, and they're bothersome.<br/><br/>Then there's the stupid kid character who spends a few scenes with Tony Stark, played by a terrible child actor. If he becomes ""Iron Man Junior"" at some point in a future Marvel film I'll likely lose my cool or something. And there's the awful and unnecessary 3D I unfortunately saw the film in. No, you don't have to see the film 3D, and again no, you shouldn't. It makes a fairly dark and murky film even murkier and darker, and while some things ""pop"" out a little, ultimately it just makes most of the scenes look kind of fuzzy. Detail is largely lost, colours are made bland, and it makes it look like most of the scenes are poorly lit. 3D can work from time to time, but seriously, it has to stop being shoe-horned into movies where it's not needed. I saw Oblivion earlier this week- it wasn't in 3D and it was absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning colour palette, fantastic detail, and damn near breath taking scenery that still ""popped"" even without the 3D effect. Even if you disagree with my thoughts of this film, I'm sure you'll be able to at least understand my little rant on 3D there.<br/><br/>Well, there's the negatives, at least most of them. This review's going to be rather unbalanced because I'm not about to spend another 1500 words talking about the good stuff, even though there was stuff that worked. The action was pretty good- unfortunately there wasn't much of it, and none of it was on the same scale that the final battle in The Avengers was, but the ""plane rescue"" sequence looked great, and the climax on the oil rig at night was quite good- or at least it would've been if lousy 3D effects hadn't been there to make the whole thing kind of hard to see. Robert Downey Jr was good, even if his acting is becoming a little stale, and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the ""darker and edgier"" story this movie was supposed to be telling.<br/><br/>Just go in with moderate expectations- this is probably not going to be your next favourite superhero film- but with the right mindset and controlled expectations, it could at least be an enjoyable trip to the movies."

The scene was pure action! As Tony suit malfunctions in Midwest America we find Tony vulnerable and has to remember real life and as he is a mechanic he has to go back to his roots in a shed This is were a kid in this film who reminds him about how it is for kids to look at him as a role model and no he isnt annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits on new ones. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin""! that was brilliant and I love the twist!.

","Iron Man 3 is the first Iron Man movie in which we get to see Tony Stark as a superhero in himself not just a man in a suit. The struggle that Tony experiences around his loss of the suit throughout most of the movie provide evidence of the actual hero being Tony and not the suit. The plot is okay but it overall isn't even addressed too often because the writing is meant to make way for the development of Tony during his final solo film. The villain is good at creating scenarios for Tony to prove himself however he is pretty surface level. I will reiterate once more that although the movie as a movie for the most part is not too great, the scenes when Tony is stuck without his suit provide more character development in a meaningful way than any other scene in any Marvel film."

","I'm very disappointed that Pepper Potts would always allow herself to be pushed around by Tony Stark, even though she is clearly an intelligent and capable woman. She degraded herself to being a slave that only does whatever her master (Tony) wants her to do.
She rejects business offers because ""Tony wouldn't like it."" Not because of her own will.<br/><br/>I hope that in future movies, Pepper allows herself to be free of Tony's influence, and to make decisions that don't serve Tony's desires or wellbeing, but her own wants. She should also have a breaking point, where she questions Tony's ideology, and become enemies with Tony. This woman has potential."

","Iron Man 3 is great and I will not change my mind on that. This was the first team up between Robert Downey Jr. and screenwriter/director Shane Black since 2005s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and it was worth the wait. The dialogue is sharp and the plot with Tony Stark dealing with P.T.S.D. after the events of The Avengers makes for a great character study.<br/><br/>I am aware that the general consensus is that the plot twist sucks but with Ben Kingsleys fantastic performance and the wonderfully absurd way that it is reveled I can't help but love it. In all honesty I just to big a Shane Black fan to hate this (the same logic does not apply to The Predator)."
"staticstation1","Null","1","1","8 April 2019"," I AM IRON MAN... AGAIN!
","Here we have a film that is divisive, to say the least. When this film was first released, I was on the negative side. I was young and wanted action, action, and more action. But over time this film has grown for me, and on the positive side. This is a character piece and a strong one of that. It's a film that takes risks and a film where Downey is at his best as this iconic character within the MCU and comic book fandom.
POSITIVES
Something to admire about this plot is that it takes the character in a different and welcomed direction. Tony Stark is as important of a character as Iron Man and to have him and his powerful mind being the draw and the lead was very entertaining. This goes into the writing of this character and their story. The path the film takes is very interesting and faces the repercussions of the Battle of New York. This helps to maintain this shared universe and not have them be offbeat stories. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible in this role and he takes this character and performance to new heights. Yes, there is the sarcastic humour that the character is known for, but there is some real and powerful emotion that the actor develops in his face alone. Downey still maintains that incredible and natural chemistry with his co-stars and that elevates their performances as well. For what Ben Kingsley does in the role of The Mandarin, he is very entertaining. Shane Black takes over the director's chair and he does a very good job. The film has its different tone, but still has that ""realistic"" quality that Favreau set up in the first two films. Some very good visual effects that come with the Iron Man sequences. What they do with the multiple Iron Man suits in this film was so fun and helped ground the film in the comic book realm. Anyone that knows the character knows about the multiple armours that the character creates. The sound design that I've praised before is still present in this film. Along with new sounds that are strong. This is the first film, in the Iron Man franchise, that has a great and memorable score from Brian Tyler. And overall the film is fun. It has its humour and engaging action sequences, but also, a lot of heart.
NEGATIVES!
The main negatives I have with this film involve the villains. Even though this film was released in 2013, no spoilers. What the film does with the character of The Mandarin I am mixed on. It upsets comic book fans but makes sense in the narrative of the film. My main negative is the story of Aldrich Killian and Guy Pearce's performance. I mean, 1. it's Syndrome from Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles. 2. it's boring. Pearce gives a portrayal of a cynical villain that has been done before and all the ""humour"" that the character/actor tries to deliver falls flat. Not once is this villain threatening or memorable.
CONCLUSION!
So, Iron Man 3 gets a bad rep and it doesn't deserve it. I am kind of a hypocrite since I have ridiculed this film in the past, but I've grown and so has my appreciation for this film. If you are looking for an MCU film that is not-stop action, I can't see you enjoying this Iron Man instalment, but if you are looking for a superhero film that takes risks with its material and character, then I suggest you check out Iron Man 3."
"margulanabutrlov","9","1","1","25 March 2019"," Iron Man 3 Review
","Christmas, 2012. Following the Avengers' planet-saving victory in New York, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has returned to his life of ease in Malibu. But a series of panic attacks and escalating threats from a maniac called the Mandarin (Kingsley) threaten to tip him over the edge.
Three signs you're watching a Shane Black movie: it's Christmas, there's a meta voiceover, and some of the best lines are dispensed by designer-suited henchmen. Pleasingly, Iron Man 3 ticks every box. Just as Joss Whedon pepped up Avengers Assemble with his unique brand of jocosity, here, despite the sci-fi trimmings and goliath budget, it feels like Black's been given carte blanche by Marvel to do his thing. The result is a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles. It's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with a lot of extra bang. And, by some distance, the Man In The Can's best solo outing so far.
Together with co-writer Drew Pearce, Black sets out to dismantle Iron Man's armour piece by piece. Like Bond in Skyfall, Tony Stark loses his flash car and big house. He is also, for a sizeable stretch of the movie, deprived of his super-suits. This is a new, vulnerable side to the playboy-philanthropist: he's on the run, in the corner, pausing between quips to suffer breathless anxiety attacks.
Part of the problem is PTSD, brought on by his near-fatal tangle with that Chitauri wormhole in New York. But his more pressing concern is a very bad man who goes by the monicker The Mandarin. A shadowy, ethnically indeterminate figure with the didactic menace of Colonel Kurtz and the attack-chopper access of Colonel Kilgore, this terrorist overlord is regularly forcing his way onto US airwaves to threaten dire ""lessons"". No-one knows his identity, his location or where he's buying his extraordinarily nifty video-editing software.
This may all sound like the fixings for another brooding threequel: The Stark Knight Rises. Happily, that's not how it pans out. Keeping the dial firmly on 'fun', the film hustles from one set-piece to the next, leavening the gloom with a lot of big laughs.
As well as the customary Downey Jr wisecracks, there are sight gags, bits of slapstick, Downton Abbey references and a genius beat involving a suit of armour turning its head. The ominous introduction of a boy sidekick in the second act turns out to yield some of the sparkiest repartee. And Don Cheadle's Rhodes, a character who barely made an impression in the other films, is skilfully tweaked, becoming the amusingly square Murtaugh to Tony's Riggs. Wait until you hear his password.
The series' villains have always been an issue. Thor gets Loki. Captain America gets the Red Skull. So far, Iron Man has faced a bald Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke and a cockatoo. While this outing is an improvement - credit to Black and Pearce for creating antagonists who aren't just more angry blokes in metal suits - it's still the film's weak point. Drawing on the comic-book's Extremis storyline (a 2005-'06 run by Warren Ellis), Iron Man 3 pits Stark against a squad of T-1000-like super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage. They're visually interesting - glowing like human lava lamps as they try to smelt Tony's face off - but their motivation is murky and unconvincing.
Far more successful is the aforementioned Mandarin, who in the Iron Man comics is a super-powered martial artist with magic rings. While a close-up shot reveals that his fingers are adorned by rings, there are surprises beneath the character's sinister hood which we won't spoil. Suffice to say that people will be talking about Ben Kingsley's performance for ages to come - it's a tricky, delicate role, handled beautifully.
Not every performance hits the mark - scanty screentime for Rebecca Hall, as Tony's botanist ex, and Miguel Ferrer, as the Vice-President, suggests the existence of a longer cut. These are minor niggles, though, in a satisfying blockbuster that mixes up political conspiracy, sleuth-work, MacGyver-ish DIY weaponisation and outstanding eye-candy. The Iron Man suits - and there are now 42 of them - are used ingeniously (watch out for Stark giving himself a literal hand in a tight spot), not least in the action highlight, the spectacular 'barrel of monkeys' sequence. This sees Air Force One under assault and its passengers forced to disembark thousands of feet above the Florida coast, not helping what is proving to be a heinous cinematic summer for POTUS.
As for why the other Avengers aren't getting off their invincible butts to help, it's explained away, a little unconvincingly, with the line: ""This isn't superhero business. It's American business."" Iron Man 3's greatest achievement is that they're not missed."
"tabuno","8","1","1","17 January 2019"," An Enhanced Super Hero Experience That Just Misses Being A Classic
","5 May 2013. Enhanced with a decent and by now mainstream 3-D experience that still doesn't quite bring in the complete visceral experience and a subliminal psychological incorporation of the Jaws (1975) audience identification storyline that pulls on the American public's patriotism echoing the recent Olympus Has Fallen (2013) espionage-terrorist genre along with a huge enjoyable Ben Kingsley twist, this superhero action-thriller explodes on the screen. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark's character continues it deepening layered personality, exposing more humiliation and humanism that Jennifer Garner's character reflected so well in Elektra (2005).<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat dependent on its technical photographic 3-D special effects for part of its presentation and it suffers somewhat in its lack of complete immersion into the clarity and focus on all its elements (either the technology is not quite there yet or more money and time needed to be expended), thus the rich density while enhanced doesn't quite match up with a movie such as Hugo (2011) for its qualitatively superior 3-D presentation.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 continues to improve with its further inclusion in its storyline stronger emotional relational elements to balance the movie's action sequences offering this movie a more human component than say the more consistently fast-paced suspense ridden Speed (1994) or the tech-intelligent and slick sci fi thriller Déjà Vu (2006) though not as substantively strong or conflicted as found in Spiderman 2 (2004), Spiderman 3 (2007) or even The Incredibles (2004), Bolt (2008), or The Dark Knight Rises (2012).<br/><br/>The storyline is somewhat spoiled by its overly ambitious inclusion of cute lines and characters that reflect it attempt at audience identification with the everyman or everyboy characters in the movie from the over the top comedic television producer or the small town boy even though it might capture the enlarged audiences interest and appreciation of the movie. The Green Lantern (2011) excelled by incorporated instead an everyman as its principle character played by Ryan Reynold for the audience to identify as well as a much more subtle use of rich humor so as to avoid having to use secondary characters to obtain a similar effect or some more obvious and standard manipulation for laughter, The Green Lantern's entire movie was focused on the mass audience instead of the smaller elite population."

Marvel manages to make decent movie after decent movie almost with all-too-much precision. They have a working formula of 'hero being more interesting than the villain' and unfortunately Killian is simply too un-compelling a villain to be invested in; he's there because he's played by Guy Pearce. With that said, Robert Downy Jr. gets time to shine as a desperate Tony Stark who has to take on baddies without his iconic suit.<br/><br/>Iron Man Three is not the best of the MCU films but it's still a good action film nonetheless."

"hakrames","9","1","1","23 March 2018"," A very good end to the trilogy
","Iron Man 3 (Three), follows Tony Stark after the events of The Avengers and the effects that have come from it and the people around him too. With him having borderline PTSD and a new villain that has an odd connection to Tony in more ways than he would ever want.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is the first film in the trilogy to not be directed by Jon Favreau but still include him as the memorable and lovable Happy. But instead of Favreau, Legendary writer and director Shane Black takes over with being silent for nearly a decade of not working on any films to break out again with the biggest solo film yet. Black directed the hell out of this third installment and yes there is a tone change from two to three but the barebones of the series are still their with a new and original story and a whole hell of a lot of amazing action sequences. And with Black building a lot of the sets and doing a lot of the stunts in real life instead of digitally adding it in makes this film feel real. <br/><br/>Writing wise, the film is overall extremely good, one major piece of the film I didn't like too much but the overall film is very enjoyable and fantastically written as well. Robert Downey Jr. hasn't felt more comical or broken, depending on what way you look at him, with the fantastic writing of his character. Each character in the film has a sense of comedy in a lot better ways than they did back in Iron Man 2 and it makes the film feel a lot more light hearted and more fun as well. And with the physical comedy like Mark-42 and his imperfect quirks in the film with him being a prototype suit makes the film feel real showing a fractured Tony that isn't at 100% and is almost caught off guard in every scene. My biggest issue is during the third act the 'villain' comes off very awkwardly and somewhat upsets me with his write off and destruction of the iconic comic book antagonist. <br/><br/>The acting is amazing though with Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley joining the cast and making some memorable performances throughout out. Obviously Downey Jr., kills it with such a different look at his iconic Tony Stark with him being broken and knocked down from The Avengers and his personal ties in this film. Cheadle also is great with his best performance in the series yet in this film with his dialogue feeling more smoothed out than in Iron Man 2. And of course my favorite performance done by Pearce is haunting and definitely makes a huge impact on the series and shows that the MCU can make a good villain in a stand alone film. <br/><br/>With one flaw that is pretty big, this film is great in a lot of other ways and makes the perfect end to a great trilogy. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 gets an 8.75/10"
"jeddjong","9","9","25","24 April 2013"," Iron Man Tri-umphant!
","In the interest of full disclosure, I'm more of a DC Comics fan than a Marvel one. That said, I haven't missed a single one of the films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, established with 2008's Iron Man. The time has sped by on rocket boots, and with the Phase I films all in the bag, Phase II begins where it all started, with Iron Man. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. (who else?) is back as Tony Stark, tinkering with new gadgets even as the events of The Avengers give him sleepless nights. His girl Friday Pepper Potts (Paltrow) has moved in with him, but Stark just won't give her the time of day even as the holidays approach. Enter the enigmatic terrorist mastermind The Mandarin (Kingsley), perpetrator of a series of vicious bomb attacks, one of which critically wounds Tony's ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Tony swears revenge, and his home is assaulted by the Mandarin's forces in return. Stranded in rural Tennessee, he enlists the help of a local kid (Ty Simpkins) to help patch his armour in anticipation of The Mandarin's next strike. Tony also discovers links to Dr Aldrich Killian and Dr Maya Hansen, developers of the Extremis virus – a revolutionary piece of biotechnology that has turned dangerously unstable. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is nothing short of a game-changer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the film, Happy Hogan doesn't work directly for Tony Stark anymore – a bit of leaning-against-the-fourth-wall winking, seeing as how Jon Favreau has passed on the director's baton to Shane Black, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Drew Pearce. Once one of the most sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood, Black proves he's still got the mojo he displayed with his screenplays for Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout in spades. Iron Man 3 has got his stamp all over it (notice the Christmas-time setting) and yet also delivers everything we've come to expect of a big-budget superhero blockbuster at the same time. <br/><br/>The film is tightly-plotted and expertly paced; audiences certainly won't be twiddling their thumbs waiting impatiently for the next action scene to roll around. Said action scenes are plenty inventive though – a daring mid-air rescue which Stark compares to playing ""Barrel of Monkeys"" and a dazzlingly-choreographed finale involving Stark hopping in and out of an array of Iron Man suits mid- combat being the prime examples. Black shows that he understands how important such displays are to the type of film he's making, but never lets the story get drowned out by the din of high-octane bells and whistles. <br/><br/>A section of viewers have taken Iron Man 2 to task for spending too much of its running time in setting up the big event, The Avengers. Iron Man 3 suffers no such problem. The focus is squarely back on Tony Stark, and by now it is impossible to imagine the character being played by anyone other than Robert Downey Jr. At this point in a franchise, the leading man is wont to display signs of weariness or that he's only doing it for the paycheck – nope, not here. Downey Jr., armed with a new batch of one-liners and an even bigger new batch of armoured outfits, is having as much fun with the role as ever. <br/><br/>He doesn't feel like he's hogging the spotlight though, because both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow get more to do here in their supporting parts. Col. James Rhodes' ""War Machine"" has been given an image makeover and renamed ""Iron Patriot""; the film doing a good job of showing how Rhodey is at his best fighting alongside Iron Man instead of merely playing errand boy for the US military. Pepper Potts finally gets to step out of her ""beleaguered assistant"" corner and throw some punches of her own, playing a pivotal part in the film's climactic shipping dock battle. The subplot with Ty Simpkins' character serving as Stark's kid sidekick of sorts could have come off as twee, but it doesn't eat into the meat of the proceedings and Stark's interactions with the boy are amusing and heartfelt. <br/><br/>Also new to the series are Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall. The Mandarin, the Fu-Manchu like archenemy of Iron Man in the comics, is reimagined as an unkempt, somewhat theatrical figure of the shadows – though there is of course more to him than that. Stalwart comic book fans might not like the way the character is ultimately handled, but it is clever enough and didn't really bother me. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a scientist who was ignored by Stark earlier in his career and doesn't take too kindly to this, re-entering the fray with slicked- back hair and a spray tan. Pearce plays the ""mousy to charismatic"" angle well, when it could well have been overly cartoonish à la Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever. The beautiful Rebecca Hall doesn't get a lot of screen time, but is one of those actresses who plays ""hot scientist"" without a hitch. <br/><br/>It would seem that doing anything new within the confines of the wham- bam comic book blockbuster genre would be difficult, since every new entry seems to be measured against The Avengers or The Dark Knight trilogy. It is to the credit of Shane Black and the team behind Iron Man 3 then that the film is effortlessly invigorating, assured in its tone with a good sprinkling of humour mixed in with awe-inspiring, effects- heavy action sequences and well-written character moments. There probably isn't a better way to kick off Phase II of Marvel's Cinematic Universe than with this flick."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","6","15","7 May 2013"," Creating Our Heroes
","Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark ominously echoes, "" We create our own demons."" Director and Writer Shane Black takes a decidedly dark real world turn in ""Iron Man 3"". Black and co-writer Drew Pearce transform the hero's journey from the inside out all in the realm of global terrorism. In ""Iron Man 3"" Iron Man, Tony Stark exacts vengeance and justice against the megalomaniac Mandarin (measured charismatic evil Ben Kingsley), who harms those he loves. The Mandarin is the sociopath anarchist, who seemingly wants to watch the world burn. In the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy, ""Iron Man 3"" assumes an eerie resonance. <br/><br/>So if we create our own demons, can we also destroy our own demons—our fears? Shane Black and Robert Downey Jr. explore with gravitas and gratifying sense of humor. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Downey still masterfully exudes billionaire Tony Stark's charming narcissistic genius blazing through Black and Pearce's crisp dialogue. In a hysterical scene he tells young charge Harley (scene stealing Ty Simpkins), whose Dad went to the store and never came back, ""Don't be such a p***y."" Downey has the amazing gift of letting us know what he is thinking. I really loved the movie, because he makes us see that Tony is the transcendent hero even without the high tech armor. <br/><br/>Downey's Tony is haunted by the thwarted Alien invasion from ""The Avengers"" movie. He can't sleep. He has debilitating anxiety attacks. And in his manic streaks advances the Iron Man suit technology. There is a cool sequence as Stark summons elements of the suit to his body. Downey displays his Chaplin-like physical acting gifts. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as the beautiful and grounded Pepper Potts, who is CEO of Stark Industries. She has moved into Tony's Cliffside Malibu home. Tony is suffering, and Pepper takes the brunt of the collateral damage. Happy (funny and aloof Jon Favreau, also Director of the first two movies) has transitioned from Tony's Chauffeur to anal Head of Security at Stark Industries. Tony's buddy Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is PC version Iron Patriot. <br/><br/>We create our own demons. In 1999, Tony attended a Conference in Bern, Switzerland. He cozies up to brilliant sexy Maya Hansen (smart and strong Rebecca Hall). Maya has discovered a process to regenerate plants in this case marijuana. However, the downside is that the regeneration is unstable and literally explosive. Tony blows off enamored fan crippled Aldrich Killian (deceptively diminished Guy Pearce), who has a proposal from AIM. New Year's Day finds Maya alone in bed and Aldrich in the cold. <br/><br/>Aldrich as the now buff and handsome Guy Pearce reappears in 2012 meeting with Pepper. Pearce exudes a charming arrogance and power. His company AIM has Extremis, a regenerating healing biotech that he proposes to Stark Industries development. Pepper declines the easily weaponized app. <br/><br/>The Mandarin unleashes his anarchist terrorism upon the President and invariably upon Tony. ""Do you want an empty life or a meaningful death?"" Enraged Tony challenges the Mandarin, ""I'm not afraid of you! I know you're a coward."" The Mandarin sends a helicopter kill team across the Malibu shores. This is reminiscent of Black's ""Lethal Weapon"". The carnage is spectacular. Tony protects Pepper, and somehow manages to get to Tennessee. There he hooks up with whiz kid Harley (Simpkins) to investigate the source of the terror, as Tony battles his own demons without the protection of Iron Man. Everyone in ""Iron Man 3"" is yoked out. Downey looks to have injured his hand early on wearing a brace. He is muscular and strong. He gets to use his Wing Chun expertise in a lot of the fight sequences. Don Cheadle exposes his biceps. Gwyneth Paltrow looks amazing, and shows off her shredded abs. Guy Pearce looks like he worked out with Hugh Jackman. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the dark hero narrative culminates in the climatic showdown at shipyard, out of ""Lethal Weapon 2"" as opposed to world destruction of ""The Avengers"". A welcome departure. The pivotal plot twist works, but for me dilutes the gravity of the emotional threat. The action sequences are amazing. The aerial rescue from Air Force One is visually stunning. Robert Downey Jr. makes us believe in heroes. We create our own demons. Heroes do what must be done, in spite of their demons, and inspire others to do the same. ""Iron Man 3"" is a great movie."

","I personally thought that this film was the best of the 3 films since it was rather interesting for those that love Robert Downey Jr in the title role. I liked how this film dealt with Tony's Post Traumatic Stress as a result from the events of the Avengers. I do wish that Nick Fury and Christine Everhart would have appeared in the film. I also thought it was rather nice to see Tony grow as an individual sine he had faults but he was still a rather humorous guy. I thought that it was also nice to see Tony's relationship with Pepper grow as well while dealing with their own relationships issues. I think that Ben Kinglsey was great as the Mandarin since he can act in just about anything he does. The best part of the film is the post end credits scene which features the return of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in a cameo. I really hope that there is a part 4 since the ending is rather open ended while providing some closure."

To my surprise nothing from the previous movies linked into this one, the director and writer destroyed any history behind the technology and characters. These are the people that didn't have the decency to watch the previous movies, read any comics, watch any cartoons or the easiest thing to at least go on wiki and read up before coming up with some half assed movie. I won't even mention what they did to the fans, comic buffs or anyone that grew up knowing the Marvel heroes. If I could sum it up it would be like someone taking the Holy Bible or another holy book and making a parody out of it, blasphemy. They ruined the Iron Man, the man behind it and the most notorious villain. I wanted to see the Mandarin in all his special effects glory.<br/><br/>I don't want to give spoilers but the quality of the suits? I guess it is the new i-man suits low on charge, running out of juice when you need it most and full of bugs. The ending? Seriously (it had the most screwed up issues contradicting previous movies and marvel history)? On the plus I hope Pepper joins The Avengers next:))))))))))<br/><br/>They did to Iron Man what was done to Mass Effect 3 (pooping on the fans), so I will chose to ignore this movie stop at Iron Man 2 and not add it to my collection hoping that a remake will come along to salvage it or that Avengers 2 will make up for this pile of garbage."
"bigpapapumpct","1","5","12","15 May 2013"," Such a letdown
","First off, I'd like to talk about what I liked about the film. <br/><br/>Happy Hogan. For me, he was the best thing in the whole film. Genuinely funny and someone I cared about. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. delivers another great performance. In fact, none of the performances is really bad. They all do a really good job. <br/><br/>The opening song ""I'm Blue"" was a great throwback to the 90s. Loved it.<br/><br/>My problem lies with the story and how it's handled. First of all, The Mandarin is Ironman's arch nemesis. He is the Joker to Ironman's Batman. How they could totally and completely f*%k that up is beyond me. Mardarin is an epic villain and should've been firmly based around his comicbook counterpart. But no. What we got is some lame generic villain who was no better than that turd from Ironman 2, and who did not at all even in the slightest resemble the true Mandarin. I supposed it wouldn't have been quite so bad if they had just left ""The Mandarin"" name out of the film altogether, but as is, they totally flushed Ironman's greatest foe down the toilet like some piece of garbage. <br/><br/>In Ironman 1, 2, and Avengers, Tony's suits are all extremely solid and stand up to tough damage well. Hell, even the God of Thunder bashes the suit with some pretty good shots, but it stayed together and held up nicely. In this disastrous wreck though, pretty much any time Tony's suit gets hit, it falls apart. Just a f*&king disgrace. <br/><br/>All in all, I hated this film and never want to see it again. Ironman 2 is still Marvel Studios' worst film to date, but Ironman 3 is right behind it. It sucks. It's terrible. It's boring. It's a slap in the face to the other films that came before it. What a way to wreck an amazing villain and a great character. <br/><br/>Marvel should be ashamed of themselves. I hope to God the rest of Phase 2 gets better from here on out and the worst is behind us. I don't think I can handle another monumental bastardisation like what I witnessed with Ironman 3."

"trektek","10","5","12","5 May 2013"," Great Movie!!!
","This post includes SPOILERS!! I thought the movie was spectacular!! Great plot, wonderful acting by all involved, exciting action. With that being said, I do have to comment about a few inconsistencies between this movie and the previous two. At least they appear to be inconsistencies to me and I am appealing to my fellow fans to either confirm my suspicions or dispute them. First, I thought that the miniature ARC reactor in Tony Stark's chest not only powered the electromagnet to keep shrapnel away from his heart but also powered the Iron Man suit. But in Iron Man 3, the suit runs out of power and must be recharged. I question this on the fact that in the original Iron Man, Obadiah Stane incapacitates Stark and steals the ARC reactor from him to power his own creation. Second, the Iron Man suit is ""keyed"" to Stark (as confirmed by Stark in the final action scene) and another Iron Man suit is supposedly ""keyed"" to his friend Colonel James Rhodes for use as ""The War Machine"". But in this movie, Rhodes is captured and forced out of the suit and then the suit is used by one of the bad guys as a ""trojan horse"". If it is ""keyed"" to Rhodes, how was the bad guy able to use it? Third, and last, Stark tells Jarvis to destroy all the Iron Man suits and in the end scene throws the ARC reactor into the sea. How can it end like this when there is an Avengers 2 in the works that supposedly includes Iron Man?"

"RyanCShowers","Null","4","9","5 August 2013"," Stepping up from 2, but not farther than the original
","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.<br/><br/>IRON MAN 3<br/><br/>Part 3 can be judged differently than the first two installments. There's a new director in town and Iron Man 3 being the first follow-up flick from Marvel after the substantial success of The Avengers. Iron Man 3 feels more like it tries sequel to The Avengers, rather than support the first two films. The tone and cinematography make you feel like you are playing a video game, not watching a movie. It's peculiar how dividing Iron Man 3 actually is. Foremost, the tone has a broad range of being the lightest film of the series to the darkest film of the series. Iron Man 3 takes some staggering risks that pay off, but could've had some more polishing to the script. It had some of the deepest emotional moments, but those are complimented by some of the fluffiest cheesy moments. Ben Kingsly is perfectly dynamic and frightening in his role, but the only thing Guy Pearce brings to his role is a pass card to get by the audience completely without them caring about his character one way or another. The film has the best action sequences and visual effects and strong character development for its hero. My favorite thing they maneuvered in Iron Man 3 is the message of the movie hitting the movie's opening and final scenes with and epic punch of Downey's narration. Rating: 5.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: B<br/><br/>My next thoughts are dedicated to two men that are both geniuses gifted in their artistic expression. Joss Whedon could not receive any more respect from me for his masterwork on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. His show was humanity, love, and life conducted into 142 episodes of television. Unfortunately, my opinion of The Avengers isn't favorable to his film. The Avengers is geek-glorified trash that felt like an animated Saturday morning cartoon. All three Iron Man films far surpass The Avengers, for my money. I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. <br/><br/>Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.<br/><br/>Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for."
"Rage-Kage","10","4","9","27 May 2013"," best of the trilogy
","Let me start out by saying that I am not a comic book fan and do not usually like it when a movie goes to far off of source material. That being said I loved this movie in every way. I'm going to list a few of the big complaints I have heard about this movie and then give my point of view on these arguments.<br/><br/>1.The Mandarin: I understand why people hated this and I understand why people loved this and i personally loved it.The Mandarin twist was so unexpected if you went into the movie not knowing anything and was really well done. The way that the people involved in this movie had Aldrich Killian create the fake terrorist to scare the entire country to not only draw attention away from himself but also to benifit his plans was amazing.<br/><br/>2.to much comedy: People have said that not only was there to much comedy in this movie but that none of it was even funny. I personally think that the comedy never took away from any serious situation in the movie and i think Robert Downey Jr. is the person to thank for that. It is true that there was a lot more comedy in this Iron Man then in any of the others but RDJ is able to be funny in a way that just seems really natural as if it was simply how he actually talks on any normal day whether he is playing a part or not. When somebody is naturaly funny like that it literally cant be forced comedy it just flows.<br/><br/>3. Lack of Iron Man: iron Man 3 was really more of a Tony Stark movie then an Iron Man movie and i think given everything that happened to him during The Avengers that making a movie more about the man in the suit is perfect. After helping to save the world and seeing what he has seen of course he has problems and i think that this movie will prove to be an important part in his character development going into The Avengers 2.<br/><br/>One last thing i think is worth noting is that the tone of this movie is very different then the other 2 Iron Man movies and for me it worked out really well.<br/><br/>These things are of course all my opinions and obviously people will disagree but i gladly give Iron Man 3 a <br/><br/>10/10"
"dejockimo","4","4","9","6 May 2013"," Mediocre at best.
","IMO this wasn't really a movie so much as a vehicle for executive greed trying to capitalize on Avengers success.Just seemed like a whole bunch of random situations/ideas crammed in so the film can make big bucks opening overseas and advertising for the next Disney/Marvel movies. Don't even ask about the Mandarin. Not enough room for the problems there.Poorly plotted action sequences,lot's of forced jokes,re used cg, anti climactic, and generally lost trying to figure out what it wants to be. Faverau dodged a bullet here imo. Really hoping Black was rolled over by non-creatives pulling the strings as I had higher hopes for him. Not to mention the amount of artist work that was done and then completely ignored by bumping artists off the credit list amongst other wrongs. Sad that movies spending hundreds of millions of dollars fail due to ego and greed. Hey,at least the upper crust can get a new supercar with the cash they made though. Hopefully DC will repair this void with Man of Steel."

I watched Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and The Avengers the night before so that I could get ""the full effect"". So I finally get to the movie. About 5 minutes into it and I realize that something is really off about this one. That's when I was informed there was a new director. I know, I know. As a true Iron Man fan I should have known this long before I saw the movie. Still. I was worried, but I thought I would give it a chance. I honestly couldn't tell you what happened throughout most of the movie as I was spent a lot of time thinking, ""It's gotta get better soon, right? Right??"" Wrong. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow made the movie tolerable, but other than that the only thing ""Iron Man"" about this movie was the title. <br/><br/>I'm giving it three stars because, as an action movie on it's own, it was okay. It was somewhat comedic and cheesy, but not the worst action movie I've ever seen. But I paid to see Iron Man and I was sorely disappointed."
"Jwdjrs","7","4","9","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3: wasting Ben Kingsley's talent (SPOILERS)
","Alright so I've been anticipating this since last year's Avengers, and I was just a tad bit disappointed with this sequel. So, I said in the title there will be spoilers in this review. <br/><br/>The ONLY problem that I had with Iron Man 3 was the Mandarin. In all of the trailers and previews, Marvel made it seem as though the Mandarin was a dangerous and extremely evil man. BUT, it turns out that the Mandarin is not real. <br/><br/>We come to find out that Aldrich Kilian (Guy Pearce) just needed a cover-up, making it look like Ben Kingsley was the bad guy. But Guy Pearce was the bad guy all along. This is what disappointed me so much. It was basically as though all of the trailers were a lie.<br/><br/>But on with the good stuff! The special effects in this movie were incredible! Almost 10 minutes into the movie, Tony Stark was suiting up into his brand new Iron Man suit. And also, this movie had the theater (which was sold out of tickets) laughing almost the whole time, mainly the Mandarin ""revealed"" scene. That just shows how unexpected and silly it was. Yeah, the funniest scene was a Mandarin scene.<br/><br/>If you never read any of the comic books or wasn't very much anticipating this movie (as I was), then you'll most likely have a really fun time. I loved the movie. Just that one little part kind of ruined the movie for comic book fans and me. I recommend this movie to a Marvel fan, or superhero fan, or someone looking for a fun movie on a Friday or Saturday night."

","OK. Iron Man was possibly the best modern Marvel adaptation of one of their classic comic book characters. Iron Man 2 had some shortcomings but was still, on the whole, excellent. And Iron Man in The Avengers absolutely without a doubt made the film!! Up till now Robert Downey Jr has been killing it, without question!<br/><br/>However, this third installment manages to fall completely off the mountain of awesomeness they had created. In a total turn around Tony Stark is now a lamenting, distressed, anxiety ridden shadow of his former self. The most compelling and interesting character Marvel had built, is now portrayed as a confused teen, not sure of his place in this world. He might have been acne ridden because this sums up your reaction to him. At no point is Iron Man/Tony Stark a character you can get behind and root for, and it takes a series of mishaps and oversights on his behalf to keep the movie plot going. And it gets worse, the portrayal of the Mandarin is inexcusable, they really should have keep his name out of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie has the feel that it is going for a cheap surprisingly laugh, rather than any depth or conviction. Tony's one line genius is entirely absent and Tony and Rhodes bumble round like they are in an 80's cop show for much of the film. At Tony's best point he vaguely resembles Macgyver. Even the exchanges between Pepper and Tony are mechanical. Oh, and lets not forget the lame voice over, as if we are reading Tony Stark's secret diary of woe's!<br/><br/>It is so disappointing to think that Iron Man has to some how recover from this horrible bad dream of a movie, to continue in The Avengers 2 and Iron Man 4.<br/><br/>SO WHAT HAPPENED? I hear you scream...<br/><br/>Shane Black is what happened!<br/><br/>This was Shane Black's recipe for Iron Man 3. OK, lets take...<br/><br/>two very poor ""threequels"" to start...<br/><br/>1 part Spider-man 3, 1 part X-men 3 <br/><br/>add to that, something to mix it up a touch<br/><br/>1 part, Spy Kids 1 part, Dawson's Creek<br/><br/>That sounds excellent, but something is missing, I need a dash of some classic, ah yes, my Oscar nominated 'Lethal Weapon 2'... the perfect finishing touch. (Our two 'heroes' in this film, in the shipyard, final scene, very reminiscent of good old' Mel and Danny). <br/><br/>PLEASE, bring back Jon Favreau or Joss Whedon PLEASE!!!! <br/><br/>In short, save your money and watch The Avengers or an earlier Iron Man in the comfort of your own home."

","The short version of the plot is: Tony has PTSD and has spent all his time building autonomous armor suits. Mandarin attacks Tony's house after Tony taunts him with his Malibu address. Tony goes into hiding and rebuilds, then attacks Mandarin's Miami estate. The final confrontation occurs on a ship where Mandarin has the President captive, and Mandarin plans to kill him.<br/><br/>This film had problems in the departments of plot/logical consistency and tone. Some examples: The armor suits became mysteriously flimsy at the writer's whim. The writers also injected awkward comedy lines which didn't work. Tony's armor pieces flew across the country at between Mach 5 and Mach 10, which seemed a stretch even with the idea of flying armor parts. He decided to blow up his suits at the end of the film as a mechanism to provide fireworks, I suppose. The bad guys ability to heat things somehow disabled the mechanized armor, but only when it was convenient. I could go on.<br/><br/>What we ended up with was a unsatisfying, sometimes strange, and ultimately disappointing Iron Man experience. I'm not sure how this script got green-lighted, but it needed to stay in the oven a while longer, if not scrapped altogether."

Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.<br/><br/>However, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails it just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.<br/><br/>What is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark's cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time.<br/><br/>The end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.<br/><br/>I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie."

","It's entertaining enough but far from a masterwork. The Tennessee scenes where Tony's on his own worked; the Mandarin was a nice McGuffin, but sadly, the whole finale didn't work. Apart from the fact that the story loses some focus because of all the pyrotechnics and action - the noise even drowned out Pepper's death which should have been a very emotional scene - it's very unsatisfying. The appeal of IM3 should have been that Tony manages to take out his enemies on his own, without his laboratory and suits and money, and they started that off pretty OK by destroying his home base, and even the scenes in Malibu ran along that line and were pretty OK. But at the story's climax, we learn that he still has an army of suits at his disposal, hidden away until the last 10 minutes of the story?! What were they thinking?! What was HE thinking?! Note to screenwriters: It's more satisfying to outwit the villains than to outgun them, the more so for superheroes, because outgunning is too easy for them.<br/><br/>Apart from those script troubles, I liked it well enough; production values are good (as has to be expected), performances are good, the action was filmed in a very straightforward manner, and especially the set for the finale is very good. I wouldn't mind watching it again if someone offered me a ticket but there's a better film hidden behind all the big bangs which sadly didn't get realised."
"monkriffe","9","3","6","27 June 2013"," The Fall and rise of House Stark
","At the time of first writing, Robert Downey Junior had finished his contract with Marvel Studios, and as yet there had been no announcements that he, or Iron Man will be coming back, beyond a tantalising ""Tony Stark will Return"" during the credits. Thus the news that he is coming back for two more movies is a relief, to say the least. RDJ has over the last 5 years strikingly embodied a character fans have been hoping for since the 60s, and made him cool, as well as kicking off Marvel's groundbreaking vision of a cinematic universe that other studios are now rushing to try and follow. Without him, there would not only be no Iron man, but there might not have been an Avengers, either. That said, Iron Man 3 ceases to be simply another superhero movie, and becomes a possible swansong for a cult hero of fans everywhere. Does it live up to the challenge? Hell yes. This is not Tony Stark's finest hour. What it is, though, is his best film to date. As Tony says himself, this is a film about demons, specifically those you create. We open in 1999, pre Tony's weekend away in an Afghan cave and adding a sense of continuity to the trilogy. Tony's casual snubbing of a nerdy geneticist who later becomes a villain is one of the film's few predictable plot points, and Guy Pearce's performance as Aldrich Killian manages to sell the moment. More on him in a moment. Back to Tony. We also meet the bright and innocent Scientist Maya Hansen, played by Rebecca Hall, inventor of a bio virus named Extremis, capable of rewriting human DNA, converting humans into sizzling skin-crawling lava lamps, regenerating limbs, and, um going boom. Snap forward 13 years, and Tony has locked himself in his basement, making a prehensile suit that attaches itself, piece by piece to his body, sometimes with considerable force. His only companions are robots, the social creature seen only 10 minutes previously hiding considerable PTSD with bravado and obsessively creating countless variations on the iron man suit. This self imposed exile is not without consequence. The Big Bad quickly shows himself as the Mandarin, a drawling Ben Kingsley offering anti-Western ""lessons"", usually ending with a claim of responsibility for something going boom without a locatable bomb device. After a casual approach leaves one of his friends in a coma and an overly arrogant invitation to his house leaves said house destroyed in an admittedly spectacular action sequence, Stark starts taking the Mandarin seriously, and the rest of the Movie takes off from there. The attack on the Stark Mansion is where we start taking the movie in general seriously as well. The reappearance of Maya coincides with a helicopter attack complete with missiles, explosions, and not one but two of the Stark Family suiting up thanks to the flying Mark 42 suit. Pepper suiting up is one of the many fan services done in this movie, and it is gratefully received. Following this adrenalin fuelled boom- fest, Stark finds himself alone, homeless, and really wishing he'd plugged the Mark 42 in to charge before going out. What follows then is where the movie begins to shine- Stark suit less, alone and working to track down the people behind the Mandarin and take them out for good. Without an Iron Suit Stark resorts to hand made weapons, exploding baubles and the help of a small kid named Hayley, cleverly sidestepping the superhero sidekick cliché with snappy dialogue, and being downright rude, whilst never becoming unlikeable as a character. Quite a feat. From there the plot develops as organically as possible, with so many plot twists that revealing here would spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. The fact is, this a story about Tony Stark- not Iron Man, showing that as much as the suits are cool ( and they are- look out for the Mark 42), it's the man inside them, who really has our hearts and this film finally manages to balance some stunning action sequences with some real character development, Dark Knight rises style. Verdict: See it already! While not perfect, and not everyone may agree with Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the Mandarin, this is definitely Stark's best outing yet, and if it had turned out to be the Golden avengers swansong, then he certainly would have gone out with a bang.

I was ready and excited for a great flick.<br/><br/>Sadly at around 38 minutes into the movie, I found myself checking my watch again to see if I shouldn't have seen enough that it would start making sense. I would find myself checking my watch many times after that, wondering when this movie was going to be over. I am sad to report that this episode is tragically long.<br/><br/>I've loved this Iron Man series (some better than others). But now, this current Iron Man 3 element seems to be part of the series only in that you recognize some of the gear, mostly suits that work poorly or not at all and of course we all recognize Pepper and Tony Stark. <br/><br/>And if you've seen none of the previous movies in the series, I suspect you will be completely lost. What is with all these unexplained round light sources in the chest and hands of Stark and the gear? Admittedly it would be very difficult to explain all of that without showing all the previous releases but just a heads up to those getting into the series late; save your money. <br/><br/>I am still sitting here bewildered by how this movie got released. I am still sad I find myself writing a negative review for anything ""Iron Man"" related. Honestly, I'm not sure why I even gave it a three star. Memories perhaps."
"Phil_Movie_Addict","5","3","6","23 June 2013"," Takes everything great about Iron Man and turns it into a farce
","What happens when you get a director/writer of comedies with action in them and put him at the helm of Iron Man? You get a bloated movie with lots of corny comedy and some action.<br/><br/>The first Iron Man is arguably one of the greatest comic book adaptions ever made. The second film is generic and felt incredibly rushed and constrained by the guidelines Marvel were putting on the film to lead into the Avengers. The third film is a farce of Iron Man's former glory.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that of revenge. A man who was once shunned by Tony, develops a serum (I'm not calling it extremis because that isn't what it is) that lets people regenerate fallen limbs, but at a cost; they also can overheat and explode, essentially turning them into lava machines.<br/><br/>The first two Iron Man films were grounded in reality but they showcased wonderful sci-fi elements that seemed plausible. Does having magma for blood and the ability to regenerate limbs seem like grounded realism to you?<br/><br/>The comedy in this film is almost always rushed, lingers far to long when its on screen, and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth when you've finished watching it. Do we really need to see Tony say, ""just wait, wait until my hand shows up"" for a minute and a half, which is just one overly long joke?<br/><br/>Do no even get me started on Mandarin. In the first 2 Iron Man films we get to see hints at the Mandarin, part of his Ten Rings organization are who kidnapped Tony in the first film. But what they did to the character in this film basically overrides anything in them by saying Mandarin as you know him doesn't exist; he's a washed up British actor who is pretending to be Mandarin....excuse me, what? Really, is that really the best you can come up with.<br/><br/>As far as solo Iron Man films go, this is the worst and I'm done with watching them. From now on the only Iron Man I will be seeing is in the Avengers sequels.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 for bad acting, bad script, campy humor, and lackluster action sequences."

","I find movies to be constantly going downhill, iron man's trilogy has gone from bad to awful. Robert Downey Jr's awful portrayal of iron man through his arrogant, simply irritating nature and the lack of chemistry he and Gwyneth paltrow have together all blend together to make one very mind blowingly average film. its boring, its cheesy and its predictable. its just plain poor. is it really too much to ask for a marvel film that in some way challenges the superhero series of batman? because at this point its out of hand, maybe the bar has just been set to such a high standard by the batman series that anything else just fails to match up, but they could at least make an effort. very much struggling to find anything positive to say about this movie, in some of these types of movies you could at least push for some good action scenes to somewhat disguise a horrible storyline and an even worse script but it lacked even that basic need for a good superhero film. don't start to watch it, you could spend 130 mins doing about 130,000 better things."
"oscarguido7","9","3","6","13 June 2013"," A Great Success 3
","The last month I saw the movie ""Iron Man 3"", directed by Shane Black. On a personal opinion, I really enjoyed the movie for the many aspects it had. Not only is this movie filled with a suspensive action, but it also shows many of the problematics in today's society like government corruption and sentiments for others. It also has the best special effects that I have seen in a movie so far. Not only does it have all of this aspects that I like to find in a movie, but I also am a fan of the ""Iron Man"" storyline and the Marvel franchise. <br/><br/>The story takes place in the United States. The main plot of the story is how Tony Stark, the main character of the film, tries to redeem himself after the villain named The Mandarin takes control over the war on terrorism, and how he must protect his loved one, Pepper Potts all at the same time. So not only does he have to defend against this terrorist who has created a very powerful weapon, but he also has to save Pepper from him. Throughout the story, we can also enjoy many of Tony's gadgets such as the ""Iron Man"" and his super intelligent computer named ""J.A.R.V.I.S."". As he undergoes this dangerous adventures, his best friend, James Rhodes, helps him to uncover the many secrets of the Mandarin and try to kill him.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, I think that Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), is one of my favorite actors. The way he develops his role is not only creative, but very realistic, so the person that sees the movie really gets into the character and sometimes may familiarize himself with him. Robert takes this role into a whole new level, and as we have seen in the previous movies of this trilogy, he uses a lot of sarcasm and crude wording in order to fit perfectly in this egocentric millionaire that is Tony Stark. Now let's talk about Pepper, or as known in the real world, Gwyneth Paltrow. I think that just as Robert, she has really made her character really realistic and many women try to identify in it. I think that from all the movies she has made, this trilogy is definitely the best paper that she has represented. She has grown so deep into the character, that I have sometimes difficulties telling if her real name is Pepper or Gwyneth. I think that both of these actors make the perfect couple in order to give an action based movie with a little bit of sentimentality in it. They both make the movie funny, entertaining, full of action, and loving. <br/><br/>As I previously mentioned, this trilogy is my favorite portion of movies. I can watch all of this movies a thousand times and never get bored, but why? The answer is really simple, the storyline. I think that the director and the scriptwriter have made an excellent job when it comes in creating this films. They make the films full of a little bit of everything. Just by being Iron Man, it has to have that action that gives us that butterfly feeling in our stomachs, and ties us the idea that we want to be indeed Tony Stark. They also give it the love part, since it has this idea of trying to save the person one loves the most in the world from a terrorist and a potential world war triggering person. This brings me to the next point, its special effects. The special effects in this movie are ridiculously good. Since the beginning of the movie when we see Tony Stark in his brand new armor, till the very end with all of the explosions and all of the advanced technology in it. The special effects are so good that one feels that one is part of the movie, and not just a spectator watching it from a couch with a bag full of popcorn and a big beverage. There are just some scenes in this movie that makes are jaw drop to the bottom because of all of the amazing special effects one can find. <br/><br/>Every movie has its theme, but I think that this one has many themes. The first one and most important one I believe it is love, and how no matter what the situation is, love will always prevail. But on the other hand, it also shows how destructive many of the future technologies may be and how they can change the life of millions of persons in a matter of days or even hours. It also has a political view, and how sometimes the government doesn't do all of their job when they do a mess. Last but not least, it shows terrorism, and how this idea of destroying cities just to give a message is really unnecessary. I believe that this are the main themes of this movie, generalized in a way so that I don't soil the movie for many of you readers.<br/><br/>I believe that this is a movie for teenagers to above because not only does one have to have a basic knowledge on some ideas and terms, but also because of its big violence, although not bloody, there is still violence. The movie is rated PG-13, and I completely agree with this. My final comments on the movie is that it is a must-watch and a very good movie.<br/><br/>My rating would be a 9/10 since it may be my favorite movie. <br/><br/>My name is Oscar Diaz. I live in Costa Rica and this was a review made for the film appreciation class of Lincoln School."
"bajungadustin","3","3","6","29 May 2013"," Fails to meet expectations
","Robert Downey Jr. i think did the best he could have done with what he had to work with here.<br/><br/>I think that i went into this with an open mind but it was shut off pretty quickly.<br/><br/>First off... The lack of Bruce Banner in the film was a let down as in the end of the Avengers we clearly see that Tony and Bruce drive off together as also mentioned in the earlier parts of the film where Stark was telling him about the ""top 10 floors all R and D and that he would love it there"" So that was a bit of a let down... Not that i expected it to be a Hulk themed movie.<br/><br/>Second... The Mandarin...<br/><br/>The Mandarin is one of Iron Mans greatest villains. The Mandarin is to Iron Man as The Joker is to Batman. Imagineif at the end of ""The Dark Knight"" if you were to find out that the Joker was only an actor hired by the mafia to keep Batman Busy... You would probably be a little upset right? Well thats what they did with the Mandarin. Its shameful.<br/><br/>And this turn of events would not have been SO bad if they had not added in all the extras to make it seem like he was real. Evidence that goes back to the first film.<br/><br/>In the first film the lead terrorist that was holding Stark captive in the cave was wearing one of the 10 rings of power. He was even admiring it in one of the scenes. along with a poster of the 10 rings in the back of his tent. Why would he do this if the whole ring thing was faked. Why would they fake the 10 rings of power for Iron Man 3 as you can see ""the Mandarin"" wearing them in the video. The Mandarin and the 10 Rings are real in the Marvel universe. its a shame they made all these errors and made it out to be fake."
"kenobi7","9","3","6","22 May 2013"," Unlike IM2, this one does not disappoint. Don't listen to the haters, it's a great movie!
","Obviously one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. It's always very important for any movie in a franchise to do well after a big movie, such as the event that was ""The Avengers"". But IM3 totally exceeded the expectations and proved that we fans had nothing to worry about. It combines all the best things from the previous two Iron Man films, with a story and a cast that was still original enough to make for a great movie. Also, the entire Iron Man franchise is very rooted in the ideas of self-destruction and regret. Therefore, if you pay attention to these themes in all three films, then you notice a progressive full-circle kind of thing. The first Iron Man introduced us to the character of Tony Stark and his genius, but there were slight implications of self-destruction in that if he didn't figure out something to do with all of his money and technology, then he would never be able to make up for all the mistakes he made as a weapons supplier/dealer. In IM2, he absolutely has to figure out how to fix his relationships with others and the problem with his arc reactor, or he will most certainly die and regret how he didn't fix them. And now, in Iron Man 3, his obsession with building all these different suits and using them to save the world has finally come back around to bite him in the butt, and he has to figure how to fix it all by himself. This leads to some very welcome flashbacks from Tony's experiences in ""The Avengers"". The film's big twist is surprising and very well thought out/set up. Others have said that this totally eliminates the entire idea of the villain, but the film makes it clear that the villain still exists within the film, just in an unexpected way. Besides, when anyone feels that the physical villain of the film does not satisfy, they can always rely on that self-destructive factor of Tony himself. That is also a villain, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense. Shane Black's direction makes sure there is a definite balance between action, great emotion/feeling, and some comedy. At times in the film, all of these things will exist in one scene, usually one right after the other. Unsurprisingly, RDJ turns in a terrific job once again. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Paltrow and Pearce. IM3 also doesn't disappoint in the general sense of the franchise. While Iron Man was and still is a great movie, Iron Man 2 was all over the place and never did really find a central theme, but there were certain parts of it that were very good and somewhat made up for where it fell short. Now, Iron Man 3 has absolutely wowed the socks off all its appreciative fans, and still is, according to the box office numbers. It featured what we loved from the first Iron Man in spades, while still kicking all of that up a notch with a much stronger central theme. Therefore, it is the best in the series for me."
"bozzod","4","3","6","19 May 2013"," The Tony Stark Comedy Hour - Spoilers
","This is not an Iron Man movie. Tony is in the suit for maybe 15 mins tops. Most of the movie is slapstick and RJD throwing out one liners. There are so many things wrong with the movie. No building tension as none of the attacks are on screen. You only see the one incident at the theatre caused by Happy. It would have been better to see escalating attacks around the globe and a building threat. The Mandarin was a total throw away after building up the Ten Rings over 2 movies. Maya was a wasted character. She would have been interesting had she been Tonys first love who came back and caused friction between him and Pepper. Instead she was a one night stand and there was no emotional weight to her heel turn. It was ridiculous that Tony had 40 sets of armor but the only one available to him during the attack on his house was an experimental model that didn't work. In addition he then spends the next hour of the movie investigating without functioning armor. Really? He has no armor at Stark Tower? Very disappointing movie."
"trublu215","4","3","6","18 May 2013"," Horrendous writing and storytelling bog down an otherwise satisfying action film.
","While watching this film, you will most likely get a headache at one point. This is a loud and brawny piece of cinema. Multiple shootouts, explosions and death defying Iron Man stunts make up for a lack of storytelling in an overall weak film. While the cast does the best to salvage what is left of the franchise, you can't help but wonder whether or not Shane Black took this too serious or not serious enough. Either way, it doesn't turn out a masterpiece entry in the Marvel franchise.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 proves to be a high octane action thriller in it's first and third act, however the second act is so muddled it is impossible to ignore. The film is what you would expect out of a summer blockbuster in the action category but fails to deliver on any story structure. Shane Black's direction gets some things right, an impeccable set of performances namely from Ben Kingsley and Robert Downey Jr keep the film from being a total washout but once the credits roll, you're left with an empty feeling in your stomach and failed expectations. While this entry is light years ahead of the second installment, it still lacks the energy of the first one. This should be expected out of a trilogy, which is why my rating isn't completely honest. By any regards, this is not a great film. The dialog is horrendous, the story structure is finicky and it is more brawn than brains. However, considering it is the last installment in the franchise, it does gain some recognition on effort. Overall, if you're expecting a summer blockbuster then look no further. Iron Man 3 is mindless, over charged and high octane. However, if you're looking for anything over and above that then skip it."
"zardoz-13","9","3","6","15 May 2013"," Third Time Is The Charm!
","As superhero spectacles rate, ""Iron Man"" qualified as an instant classic. Sadly, ""Iron Man 2"" was pretty scrappy. Happily, ""Iron Man 3"" surpasses its lackluster predecessor. Although it cannot top the original, ""Iron Man 3"" still ranks as remarkable. The narrative is easy to follow, and the villains are a lethal lot with a secret about them that enables them to initially gain the upper hand against our hero. Not only does ""Iron Man 3"" serve as a sequel to ""Iron Man 2,"" but it is also a follow-up to ""The Avengers."" Everybody who played somebody in ""Iron Man 2"" returns for this entry. Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Lieutenant Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) are back, too. Colonel Rhodes has his own Iron Man suit and he is called 'the Iron Patriot.' Nevertheless, only one Avenger makes a cameo, but you'll have to bide your time until the end credits to catch a glimpse of him. Similarly, neither Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) nor Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) turns up for this threquel. Jon Favreau, who helmed the first two ""Iron Man"" epics, has entrusted the franchise now to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director Shane Black. Previously known for his violent contemporary crime thrillers, such as ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""The Last Boy Scout,"" and ""Last Action Hero,"" Black imparts a palpable sense of momentum as well as a sense of purpose to this installment. He scored a hit with the Mel Gibson movie ""Lethal Weapon,"" while the other two feature-films languished at the box office. Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as the obnoxious but heroic inventor Tony Stark who constantly worries about his romantic interest Pepper Potts. As it turns out, Downey starred in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" for Black when the actor was struggling to rekindle his career. Prepare yourself for a lot of humor this time out, especially where Tony Stark is concerned. <br/><br/>Basically, ""Iron Man 3"" feels like an invigorating gust of fresh air. Downey cavorts about in several scenes without his Iron Man armor, and he delivers one of his best performances as the billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. ""Iron Man 3"" occurs after the celebrated New York adventure in ""The Avengers."" Although allusions are made to ""The Avengers,"" Black and freshman scribe Drew Pearce reveal nothing new about that brouhaha. As if to silence anybody who poses questions about the Big Apple showdown, Tony Stark cringes in agony. Presumably, in an effort to keep him down to Earth, Tony must suffer acute anxiety attacks to make him more sympathetic. Although he wrestles with these anxiety attacks, Tony doesn't shirk his duty to save lives and thwart evil. Fortunately, nobody plays an idiot like Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer in ""Iron Man 2."" Most importantly, ""Iron Man 3"" doesn't provide us with a finale where men in cans square off against each other for a do-or-die showdown. Interestingly enough, the premise of ""Iron Man 3"" reminded me of Dr. Curt Connors' obsession in ""The Amazing Spiderman"" (2012) with growing back amputated limbs. The villains in ""Iron Man 3"" engage in a modest variation on this skulduggery. One turns out to be one of Tony's girlfriends from the past, Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall of ""The Town""), a botanist who has grown plants that can grow back severed stems. The other is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce of ""Lawless""), who founded a think-tank company called Advanced Idea Mechanics with the acronym AIM. Later, Killian hires Maya after Tony dumps her to see her research become a reality. These two are no match for the chief villain, an Osama bin Laden stereotype known only as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley of ""Gandhi"") who jams the airwaves with his threatening ultimatum broadcasts and commands an army of suicide bombers. Since Iron Man's identity has never been an issue, the real issue in ""Iron Man 3"" is how quickly Stark can suit himself up in his armor. This lively, exciting, third installment makes it even easier for our hero to don his outfit. Remember that idiotic looking suitcase outfit in ""Iron Man 2?"" ""Iron Man 3"" accelerates the wardrobe change time for our wisecracking hero and does it in a way that amuses us but appears cinematic. If you've seen the trailers for ""Iron Man 3,"" you've seen the incredible scene where three attack helicopters blast Tony Stark's palatial residence atop a mountain into the California coastal waters. Actually, Tony brings this disaster down on his head when he challenges the Mandarin to visit him. The other scene that stands out finds out hero trying to rescue more people than he can carry while airborne after Air Force One is blown up. <br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" will keep you glued to your seat with some surprises to keep things interesting. Black and his co-scribe look like they have managed to bring the Marvel Comic book character full circle from the original. This raises the question if Robert Downey Jr. will keep on playing the role. If box office figures are anything to go by, the Marvel people won't let Robert go down the tubes."

","When they made the first Iron Man, i was like ""Man! They have to make more."" Then they made Iron Man 2. It wasn't a bad movie it was just not up to (or close to) the first movie's standards. Well my friends, the third was not as good as Iron Man (1), but it was up there. I feel like Iron Man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy. As far as making the film goes,(not gonna spoil anything) look out for all the foreshadowing. You will also be hit with a little comedy. Kind of like all the Iron Man movies. There isn't much I can say about Iron Man 3. I did like the action sense of the movie. I did contain a lot of action and it did live up to it's title of being an action movie. Also like the first one. Throughout all the Iron Man films, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark was always my favorite actor. I cannot say the same for 3. Gwendolyn Paltron's Pepper Pots was mine in this one. She acted very well. Overall, Iron Man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a movie worth watching. However, it still can't beat the first."
"dspman11","7","3","6","13 May 2013"," Ten times better than Iron Man 2, not quite as good as Iron Man, a pretty solid flick by itself.
","After seeing Iron Man 2 (which, not to sugarcoat, was a pile of garbage), I wasn't going to bother seeing Iron Man 3. I was dragged to see it, and I must say, I enjoyed it. Some are saying it's the best of the three, but it doesn't touch the first one. But it's also leagues better than the second.<br/><br/>I'll make this review short and address my complaints and the complaints of others. This is a non-spoiler review, so I'll be as vague as possible. Many people complained about how the movie used the character of the Mandarin because it was so unlike the comics. I never read the comics so I personally don't give a damn. I liked what they did, and it was a cool plot twist.<br/><br/>My own biggest complaint was...there was way too much comic relief. The writer(s) of this film thought of a joke for every line and just had to put it in. The amount of comic relief in the first two were perfect, they went overboard in this one. So many people die in this movie. I don't mean main characters. I mean nameless extras. So many die. It's not even funny how many people die in a PG-13 Marvel movie. In addition to one-liners every ten seconds. It was a strange, uncomfortable combination.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the ending, not going to spoil anything, but I liked it a lot. I'd rather not add to spoilers to this review, but random extremely vague point: if you were thinking of the question ""why not sooner?"" at the very end, it's explained in the comics. Google it. The movie did a poor job of explaining it.<br/><br/>Overall, 7/10."
"Asteri-Atypical","4","3","6","8 May 2013"," IM-1 is still the best of the series. As for this -- call it ""shallow action fun"".
","Let's start off with saying I really liked IM-1. It was one of the better superhero movies I've ever seen. This is a sentiment shared by most of my friends.<br/><br/>IM3? Let's say it was enjoyable enough to watch as an action flick. However, it failed to impress me in any of the ways I would hope a major feature film would. For instance, the story. OK, granted, not all movies, especially action movies, have to have a great, let alone deep, storyline and script with sensational dialogue. It all depends what they are TRYING to be. That's where IM3 fell short, to me. It seemed like it was trying to seem deeper and more intelligent than it was.<br/><br/>Let's make that clear, right now. No matter how much you may have enjoyed this film, it's neither ""deep"" nor ""intelligent"". Any thrills derived are more along the lines of action and shallow motifs.<br/><br/>IM3 seemed to give us a number of elements just for the sake of handing them to us. The most infamous of these, what they did with The Mandarin. I won't get into that, here, in this review. But let's say the ""twist"" was more a twist for the sake of the twist. It was not innovative or clever. They could easily have pulled off the same plot device with any other number of names or new characters. Instead, by dropping the name The Mandarin, they slapped the faces of everyone who were familiar with this character from the comic book and wanted to see him brought to life.<br/><br/>Another cheap-trick element was Tony's emotional issue (again, not discussed here). You can't just drop something like that in to a character like Stark without working it in, with purpose. Otherwise it seems random and just ""thrown in for the heck of it"".<br/><br/>I'll also mention the ending, which left us wondering ""why DID he do that?"" Just for the sake of a few pyrotechnics and a feeling of ""starting fresh"". Sorry, sometimes a theme needs to make sense.<br/><br/>That leaves us with is not bad. Not great, though, since the Extremis characters were just a bit too over-powered (and not consistently, I might add) and a far different battle than what I might have hoped for. RDJ, of course, is masterful as Tony Stark, and he was the best part of the movie. I just wish Stark, who is one of the more interesting characters in the Marvel movie franchise, was better-used in this installment.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that, while there were minimal moments of pure dialogue, they seemed slow and to drag. This is indicative of the quality of the writing and characterization, since I usually love moments of meaningful dialogue, even in an action movie. I guess this wasn't all that ""meaningful"". Hmm.<br/><br/>I leave you with the notion that if you want to just see an action film, you may, indeed, enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't set your expectations too high. Take all the elements with a grain of salt. They seem to be geared towards a more juvenile audience than the average comic book reader (yes, I meant that as it sounded).<br/><br/>IM3 has its moments, and is worth a view, but it's far from great, if you hope for any meat with your cheese."

","If the teasers make you incredibly curious about this movie, I would say you were right. At first, when I watched the trailers I was pretty excited to go see it. However, the movie was a failure. Fight scenes were so complicated, at least in 3D, to catch up. Even the scenes were blur and you wouldn't understand who was doing what. The best fight scene was the last one where Iron Man suits were teared apart. The storyline, was also a stupid idea for Iron Man. Firemen around, what the hack seriously? Oh, girls looked pretty hot with their fire abilities, but there were only 2 of them so it is still a waste of time to watch. I think, this would be the worst to publish as Iron Man 3."
"Phoenixsilverbird","6","3","6","7 May 2013"," A disappointing plot
","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is an excellent movie in terms of its visual effects and is only enhanced by 3D. However, for me, this was the best part on the film. Although the plot is fundamentally decent, I did not feel fulfilled or satisfied after watching Iron Man 3. In terms of story, I would probably rather watch IM 2 again.<br/><br/>Why? Although the extremis idea is good, the ending is awful and the suits are treated like disposable water bottles, being repeatedly destroyed. Moreover, the fact that Stark destroys all his suits and removes his arc reactor just makes me want to scream in frustration.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10 for the high quality craftsmanship and the basic but flawed plot. In my opinion MARVEL has just ruined the Iron Man series."
"Know","4","3","6","7 May 2013"," How do you get blown up twice?
","Of all the ridiculous mistakes they made, the one that is unforgivable is why they needed to blow up Aldrich Killian twice? He was blown up in the Iron Man suit. Vaporized. And then...he wasn't. Pepper Potts has to pull an Underworld/Resident Evil maneuver and kick a grenade at him and blow him up again. How cheap.<br/><br/>I gave 4 stars for the CGI and the airplane scene. There was so much other stuff that stunk like Rhodey not even trying to save himself. You're the Iron Patriot for chrissakes. Maybe they should put a Marine in that suit. Stark finds a 10 year old who acts like he's 35.<br/><br/>Last but not least: the most accomplished actor in this movie is reduced to playing Keanu Reeves from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. That dude is KNIGHTED. SIR Ben Kingsley. You don't waste that kind of talent!"

","Well there was a few awesome action scenes! ... However, there was a bit too much of ""Just Tony"". The McGyver bit was over the top... The broken down suit got old fast....<br/><br/>That was not the Mandarin. In all fairness the bad guy was cool however he was still not the Mandarin. I'm a bit surprised that Marvel signed off on this. Did Stan Lee sell out? Also I don;t recall the Stan Lee cameo now that I think of it.<br/><br/>I would say Iron Man 2 was my favorite, then Iron Man 1 is in second place and this one pulling up the rear. <br/><br/>It was a fun watch but once was enough, I won't be adding this to my BluRay collection."
"judywalker2","6","3","6","6 May 2013"," No so great as it could have been
","I guess I just hate female characters in Marvel movies. They just constantly get in the way and never die even if they should. I know that Robert Downey Jr enjoys playing his quirky Tony Stark but this movie showcased that quirkiness way too much (i.e. the second, third and fourth Pirates make the same mistake for Johnny Depp). The story had a nice setup and the action was of course first rate, but it just to me falls flat because some of the story elements that didn't fit together. If you're going to have the main character have angst about something then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about and then allow him to work through that in the end. This movie introduces Tony's anxieties but really they don't make any sense and he doesn't really resolve them in the end. I also really didn't care for the great reveal of Ben Kingsley's character, why too cartoony and dumb. So all in all OK but not great. Hope they bring the avengers back soon and I'm personally waiting for Thor cause he and Loki are a much better team than Tony Stark and Rhodie."

If you want a good vs evil movie with a villain that has sensible motives, goals, and intentions, save your money and watch something else at home.<br/><br/>Much like Prometheus or The Avengers, Iron Man 3 is very entertaining but becomes more and more illogical as it goes on. The plot twists feel forced.

"wizardlord-1","6","3","6","5 May 2013"," WTF?! How could you do this to Iron Man fans?
","Extremely disappointed and frustrated after watching Iron Man 3. What a disaster! Shane Black is unfit to direct superhero movies. Why the hate? Read on...<br/><br/>Iron Man Suit Abuse: The Iron Man suit is shown as a piece of junk metal that constantly malfunctions, powers down, breaks into pieces several times and gets ripped apart pretty much by every goon in the movie. And somehow one of Tony's older suits was able to withstand the force of Helicarrier's fan blades and Thor's lightning in Avengers? <br/><br/>Iron Man Suit Army: I'm pretty sure that the writers who came up with this idea were seriously smoking pot. Tony who for the most part of the movie with the help of a kid attempts to repair Suit Mark 42 giving the impression that getting that suit working was the only hope, suddenly out of nowhere calls dozens of artificially intelligent Iron Man suits that autonomously fight bad guys (Jarvis kicks ass of course).<br/><br/>Plot: ***This space is intentionally left blank due to the absence of a real plot.***<br/><br/>Mandarin: The twist with Mandarin may have been for comedic effect or shock value or both but it only lasted for a few minutes, however as the movie progressed it certainly left a bad taste in the mouth and the overall tone of the movie changed from funny to frivolous. I think this was a weak attempt at mimicking the whole Ra's Al Ghul is really Ducard twist in Batman Begins. While Nolan masterfully delivers his surprise, Shane Black manages to mess it up for the fans!<br/><br/>Visual Effects & Screenplay: They definitely knocked this one out of the park. Absolutely phenomenal special effects, from changing suits mid flight to the way the suit flies and fits on Tony's body is a visual treat to watch. If this is your only expectation from the movie, you will not be disappointed and will love the movie.<br/><br/>Maya/Rebecca Hall: Her character was boring, useless and an absolute waste of time.<br/><br/>Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr.: As always RDJ's performance is top notch. He owns the character and eats up the screen with his charisma, wit, sarcasm and the gift that makes his written lines appear utterly spontaneous and genuine. He gives Tony Stark his awesomeness!<br/><br/>Supporting Cast: Paul Bettany as always is awesome as Jarvis. Gwenyth Paltrow does a pretty decent job and Jon Favreau is funny as Happy Hogan. But William Sadler as the President? Uh... did anyone notice that this guy has the looks and demeanor of a psycho villain?<br/><br/>Air Force One: So they just let Iron Patriot into Air Force One without even asking him to unmask and check if he really is James Rhodes? Bravo Shane Black for not thinking this through!<br/><br/>Overall the movie did not take itself seriously, humor was forced into every possible situation and Shane Black beyond doubt proved that he just doesn't get comic books, let alone direct a blockbuster superhero movie. Please leave that to talented directors like Christopher Nolan and Joss Whedon!<br/><br/>I will give this movie 6 out 10 just for RDJ's acting and spectacular visual effects."
"turnershane01","6","3","6","5 May 2013"," Christopher Nolan Should Sue
","If you haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises, go watch it before you read this review.<br/><br/>It's almost as if Shane Black has watched DKR way too many times. Iron Man 3 had almost the same plot line and the same twists. Just like Batman, Iron Man is left with nothing an stranded out in the middle of nowhere while everything he knows is being ripped apart.<br/><br/>Plenty of characters were completely screwed up in this movie as well. Instead of the Mandarin being a complete bad ass, they made him out as a joke and gave him the name Trevor who's a British junkie who calls himself an actor. Then to top it off they give Aldrich Killian the alias of the Mandarin and make it so he has been the boss the entire time. Sounds kinda like how Talia al-Guhl was in control and not Bane like everyone thought. Also Maya Hansen was suppose to be Tony's (ex) lover just like Talia with Bruce Wayne, and just like Talia, double crosses Iron Man. Another character ruined was Coldblood aka Eric Savin.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie totally sucked. If Tony could have had the shrapnel surgically removed from his chest why wouldn't he have done it in the first movie? The movie leaves you believing that he's giving up Iron Man for good, so what's he going to do in Avengers 2 (if RDJ decided to be in it)?<br/><br/>The end credits scene was a total waste of time too. I'm not sure how it was in other theaters but I had to wait an extra ten minutes because they decided to put it at the very end instead of after the main end credits.<br/><br/>If tickets weren't $100 (exaggerating) I would have just walked out of the theater. TOTAL disappointment from a huge Marvel fan. I put this along the lines of the Spider-Man Trilogy and the Fantastic Four movies. Horrible."
"aidanb1-642-823074","6","3","6","4 May 2013"," Is it an Action, a Drama, a Comedy? They don't know either.
","I would like to make this review short and brief without giving too much away. This movie is not amazing, but it is also not bad. It is above average. If you go in like I did, expecting a good movie with a darker tone and a great villain, you will leave disappointed.<br/><br/>The most damning part of the movie for me was the tone the director tried to establish. Were it a little grittier and not a superhero movie, Iron Man 3 could pass for a dark comedy. The movie attempts to be both comedic and serious but fails at both. Bad jokes come at bad times, totally ruining the suspense and emotion of the scene. A little humor is not a bad thing per say, but Iron Man 3 is neither funny nor as well timed as the original, and it is damaging to the movie. <br/><br/>My second gripe is the plot twist halfway through the movie. Up until the plot twist, I was really enjoying the movie. The plot twist pulled the movie from serious to ridiculous in one single scene, in the process effectively rendering Ben Kingsley (who happens to be the best and most exciting actor in the movie) moot. I cannot stress this enough, even as someone who before this movie had no prior connection to the ""Mandirin"" character, the plot twist simply destroys the tone and seriousness of the film.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie didn't do some things right. I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie, and began liking it again towards the end. Two thirds of the movie are great, but the parts in between simply destroyed it for me.<br/><br/>So, in short, this is a fun movie, with great action and sfx, and even a decent storyline. Just don't go expecting anything comparable to the Dark Knight Trilogy or the original Iron Man or even the Avengers. You will leave disappointed if you do."
"jasvinder04","5","3","6","4 May 2013"," Such a disappointment.....
","Iron Man 3 was such a waste of my money. I went to watch the movie because of Sir Ben but was disappointed. The movie is poorly directed, it has cheesy jokes which I found really unfunny. <br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie because of the 'super awesome' trailer, you are going to waste your money and your time. Believe me, the movie sucks. Robert Downey Jr. played his part and it was really excellent, Guy Pearce's acting hardly made an impression of a villain. The movie is more of a comedy movie than an action movie. The movie's really good for small kids. If this is an end of the Iron Man trilogy, it's a rather disappointing end."
"cfinleyCA","4","3","6","4 May 2013"," Wow, such a huge fan of IM and this was such a huge disappointment
","Pros: Not many, the new MK suits were interesting, except for the hero suit that dominated the movie. MDJ was funny but the character did many things that were not consistent with previous versions. Some of the action scenes were very well done and full of visual and audible goodness.<br/><br/>Cons: The MK42 was supposed to be the latest and seemed more like a drunk dial experiment. The suit was always breaking and not working as expected. Somehow runs out of power, but the arc reactor is just fine not even mentioned. I am usually easy on movies but this one I felt I could poke holes in almost every scene. The ending is just stupid. 3D was non existent, i don't need it but if you say its in 3D at least have it look 3D. I went back to Iron Man I several times. I would not recommend seeing this film even at the budget movies.<br/><br/>Sorry to say Iron Man jumped the shark, the parties over. I don't know how it has gotten a 7.9 on IMDb, I read 12 pages of reviews and only 3 or 4 in total had anything good to say. Can you say artificial inflation of the score?????? That is so scummy, but goes right along with this movie. They have lost a true fan."
"imokurok789","4","3","6","4 May 2013"," If you have to lie mislead people to get them into the theater, why bother to make the movie?
","The previews looked great. Had they been an accurate representation of the movie it could have been terrific. For $200 million, it seems like they could have shot the movie shown in the trailers. <br/><br/>What else was lame?<br/><br/>1. The suit now can disassemble itself and the pieces can fly across the country to reassemble and still be fully charged up and battle ready. The suits can fight on their own. The pieces can fight on their own. They can protect everybody. About the 100th time we see this I find myself looking at my watch and wishing I was mowing the lawn, or sleeping, or at work, or sleeping at work, anything. What is the point of Stark or anyone else ever putting the suit on again and risking getting killed when they can be remotely operated and even autonomous if Stark is busy making dinner or something? Stark doesn't even need to show up for the next movie, he can just tell Jaris to send some suits to kill everybody. Of course, who needs the suits when we have Super-Stark - see next item.<br/><br/>2. Tony Stark has gone from middle aged guy w/ a heart condition, a slight paunch, and a huge brain to a CG enabled super-dooper martial arts one-man A-Team/McGiver hybrid with 10+ invincibility. How many times can Stark leap into the air, fall 50 feet and land on a catwalk while blasting caps at baddies and not splatter all over the pavement? It seemed like it went on forever.<br/><br/>3. At his house, he stores 40+ suits with the power pack thingys that caused so much trouble in the first movie when Stane got ahold of ONE, yet apparently he can't even keep bad girls from driving up to his front door, much less any kind of protection from a couple of choppers lobbing rockets at him. Oops, the genius weapons manufacturer missed that one Couldn't have even one of those suits on standby to protect the crib? He's obsessed with keeping Pepper safe, but he misses this?<br/><br/>4. Final big battle scene with literally everything thrown in thanks to a sad, sad over-reliance on CG. CG should enhance a good movie, not compensate for laziness.<br/><br/>5. If the 40+ suits are un-manned, why bother to make them man-shape? Wouldn't there be much more efficient configurations? Are they all man- shape just in case Stark might want to get in them some time? Really? All 40+? Am I the only one that thinks that's kinda creepy?<br/><br/>Creates a lot of problems when these clowns insist on hitting certain points in the movie even if they make zero sense. Why? Do they think most people that would go to see an Iron Man movie are too stupid to catch them? And there's usually a final ""epic"" battle scene with so much nonsense going on it can't help but disconnect the viewer and remind them they are watching a movie. Is it ""Death by Focus Group""? ""This is all the things the focus groups said they like in movies, so let's throw it ALL in EVERY movie we make and we can't lose!!"" <br/><br/>If you're a big fan, it's probably a given that you'll see it. I'd suggest waiting a few weeks and renting it for a dollar. More than that and you too will wish you waited. Won't make this mistake again."
"maxsmart51","4","3","6","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3
","The suit breaks way too much in iron Man 3 it is as if the writers and director never saw the previous iron man movies or the avengers. Tony Stark is only in his suit about 10 min. in the whole movie and every time he puts on a suit it is broken off in about 5 seconds. A truck is able to completely knock the suit off in this movie and a little boy is able to pull of the finger of the suit. In the previous iron man movies it shows the supremacy of the iron man suit by being hit by a missile and not having a mark, being hit by Thor's mighty hammer and THors lightening and withstanding the damage as well as a long fight against alien creatures in the Avengers. It was if the suit was made of plastic in iron man 3 it was ripped off so easily. I think he went through at least 40 suits in the movie."

","I guess you know it's not a good sign when you see the people from the previous showing come out, and they aren't laughing or even smiling but just kind of humbly walking out. I said ""oh noÂ…""<br/><br/>Action wise this was nice to see in IMAX, and the action scenes are done very well and special effects are second to none, sadly that's about where the good ends. Also I should point out early on that this one is not so kid friendly. I expected to come out of this loving it and looking forward to taking my 9 & 11 year old kids to see it, but I am seriously second guessing that. This one is darker, more intense, shows much more graphic scenes and situations which are not as kid friendly and boarder on the Rated R scale.<br/><br/>The flow wasn't really good, and some scenes I liked and others I about fell asleep, I didn't really care much about the side stories and just took away or needed to be edited down a bit more. The whole anxiety thing while I thought was an interesting addition totally fell flat and was not an issue at any critical moment in the film. It's really hard for me to dig into issues I didn't like but really can't without giving too much of the movie away.<br/><br/>The non flowing story, the needless intensity of a few scenes. Probably one of my biggest gripes in this movie was the suits! While they looked cool they were just feasibly impossible, or at least the main one. Not to say that the previous ""Iron Man"" suits were totally believable of course, but now he has a modular suit, which each piece can fly attach to him or whoever he points to, cinch itself together, and then when it runs out of power it can simply open itself all the way up so he can just crawl out? I'm sorry while it looks cool it's just too beyond the believable point. Not to mention his other suits were torn through like butter. I mean so much for the impenetrable suit of armor in this one where it could actually take a beating. I guess lastly I didn't really like the bad guy or his minions. I like Guy Pierce and thought he did a good job, but the fact that you didn't ""feel"" for him nor really hate him it just made for a lack luster bad guy. While they had a cool power, again it was a little beyond the realm of believability. I know that sounds silly for me to say given the whole Marvel Universe of powers.<br/><br/>I walked out similar to those who came out in the previous show. Thinking it was just okay. There were some great action sequences, I was bored at time and overall thought the story was ho hum. It wasn't one or two things, but quite a few. Either the story just wasn't that good or the director change wasn't a good one, or both"

","As a fan of the past two Iron Man movies, I felt excited and thrilled to see another sequel to popular series. However, this one did not live up to my expectations. Either my taste for movies has finally grew in respects to my age or the Iron Man franchise had outstayed its welcome- finally reaching a point where it says, ""screw it, they will watch us either way, we just need a couple of explosions and everything will be fine, right? "" The movie lacked a captive presence because i felt exhausted as i was watching the movie; hoping every second that this will be its final scene. Sure, Iron Man 3 throw in a couple of great laughter, but overall i found myself wondering what i'm watching and why i'm still here. I had always thought the character, Tony Stark, to be charismatic, which translated and enforced a lot of the insults in to semi comedic lines; but this movie fail to make that impression. As its traditional punch lines rolled in, i looked around to see if it had just been me that was repulsed by the movie's lack of creative lines, but it wasn't. The only ones laughing were a couple of girls in front of me, who i felt would laugh at the drop of a quarter.

The movie stayed true to its origin with strong action scenes and special effects with peppered in comic relief, although, it came off more as a comedy than an action film. Kids will love this movie none the less, but anyone over the age of 10 who has any taste in good movies will agree this movie was a let down to the series and marvel especially. The story line was terrible, and in no way stays true to the comic series involving the Mandarin. This movie had all the potential in the world and fell short in every category.

"arnieiam","1","3","6","3 May 2013"," I am never watching another Iron Man film ever again
","OK severe spoiler warning impending. There will and there are a lot of fanboys who are incredibly outraged myself included.<br/><br/>First of all as a film it was genuinely decent. It was the only Iron Man film with an actual driven plot which is loosely based on the Exremis graphic novel, unlike the completely filler 2nd film. In fact its the plot that made me stay in the theatre, which in itself is complex enough for a 2 hour long film. Basically Tony is dealing with post traumatic stress and insomnia after the events of the Avengers. So with that he becomes a workaholic making his suits with more artificial intelligence. And he has to deal with the threat of the Mandarin, a terrorist who has become a threat to the Americans.<br/><br/>Now I was fine with not making him Chinese or East Asian. I was fine with him not coming face to face with Tony Stark liked he did in the comics. I was even fine with not making his rings magical even though we're in a post Avengers universe. Here was this bin Laden like figure who was incredibly menacing but ....<br/><br/>HERES THE SPOILER <br/><br/>He was not real. Nope. He was an actor hired by Aldrich Killian as a ruse, to put a face to the villainy. Except it used one of Marvel's most iconic characters. Never mind that Killian was breathing fire or Iron Man wasn't actually in person when he saved the passengers of Air Force One, this is what really got me heated.<br/><br/>And its not even in the same vein as Batman Begins where it turned out that there's a real Ra's al-Ghul. You do have Killian saying 'You wanted the Mandarin, I am the Mandarin!"" while he's spewing fire and sporting dragon tattoos, but well.... no. Killian being the Mandarin is analogous to your parents being Santa Claus, yes he did do those villainous things but he is not the Fu Manchu sporting long coat wearing arch-nemesis of Iron Man who's been in the mythology for almost half a century.<br/><br/>I understand that filmmakers are entitled to some artistic liberties but to take it to the point to negate the existence a character thats was ranked among IGN's top 50 comic book villains, what was the point of all that buildup? In the first film his presence was really hammered in with the Ten Rings and all the Genghis Khan talk. I do know that the portrayal of the Mandarin has varied from a bad ass to a complete buffoon (lets not forget Modok) but... that is the same for any comic book villain including the Joker (*cough* Ceasar Romero *cough*).<br/><br/>I honestly wanted to walk out of the theatre after that big twist but I felt like this film still deserved my full viewership (and I didn't want to waste $11) as it still was a good film let alone. If you are not a die hard fan of the source material, you would really enjoy it.<br/><br/>Like Cracked.com said, comic book films are now in decline. I still look forward to Man of Steel because it genuinely looks like it's a good movie actually improving on the source material."

","I have been a big fan of the Marvel films since the first X-Men came out years ago and have eagerly anticipated when a new Marvel film comes out. On top of that Iron Man was and will always be my favorite super hero since I was a little kid. With that being said I can't tell you how completely disappointed I was in this film. Not even the special effects were able to save this horrifically poor movie. Between a terrible plot, lazy acting, horrible directing, and bad special effects decisions, this was a bad movie.<br/><br/>1. Other than Gwenth Paltrow nobody seemed to care much about their characters. I was quite impressed with Paltow in this film. She seemed to finally get a chance to be a major player and she stepped up into the role. Downey Jr just mailed it in like he knew this was the last standalone Iron Man and was just tired of the role. Jon Favreau seemed as if he was angry that he didn't get to direct and came off as a total buffoon as Happy. Ben Kingsley was their for the paycheck plain and simple. Won't even go into any of the other characters because it's not worth it.<br/><br/>2. Mandarin. Yes this is a spoiler so if you don't want to know don't read. Why bring in such a powerful villain and then choose to make him a phony. He's a burned out drug addict pretending to be a master terrorist. WTF??? The potential for an all out awesome villain vs hero was just thrown in the trash. He's not even a terrorist, he's an actor playing the part of a terrorist. What a waste of an opportunity here for a climatic event. He's working for the so called bad guy who's working with the VP of the US to take over the country. To many pointless plot twists to even bother.<br/><br/>3. Shane Black. Please do not allow this moron to ever direct, produce, or ever touch a film again. Sure he had Lethal Weapon, but that's it. Seemed like he had some political agenda for this movie. It comes off very anti-American and not sure why he wanted it to go that way. Had a very liberal spin on it. Now I know why it's doing so good oversees. Choppy film cuts and the flash back scenes were just bad.<br/><br/>4. Special effects and 3D. I'm not a fan of 3D, but someone else bought the tickets so I didn't really care, but the 3D was just bad. Nothing came off the page and made me feel like I was really there. Saw the Avengers in 3D and was very impressed. This had no 3D value at all. The overall special effects were good, but just not used appropriately. So many new suits Tony built, but you rarely get to see them up close and in detail. The epic end battle you hardly see what makes one suit that different for the others. Just randomly flying Iron Man suits everywhere. The fact you get almost no time with Stark in a suit doing what he does best made no sense.<br/><br/>I'm a Marvel fan for life so this review isn't from some DC fan boy trying to kill a Marvel film. I really hate DC movies. Saw the superman preview and knew I wouldn't even bother watching that for free. Sad thing is I would have probably enjoyed that film more than Iron Man 3. Glad to know the days of Iron Man are quickly coming to and end. Don't waste your time or money. This was just a terrible film from start to finish."

The odd thing is the movie realizes this in the second half of the movie and mocks it self. it turns into a full on comedy mode. it is really hard to find any seriousness any darkness in the story line.

In particular, the back-and-forth between Stark and the kid really works. There's also some great bits of physical comedy and classic Starkisms.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>RDJr's performance. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I felt like Downey's performance in the Avengers left much to be desired. It alternated between a boring, plastic impostor of the first film's Stark and a shameless self-parody. To a lesser extent, I felt this to be the case in Iron Man 2, as well, although the character hadn't grown quite as tired yet. While it's still not on the same level as the first Iron Man, Iron Man 3 does provide the best representation of Tony Stark since. The charm is back. Job well done.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/><ul><li>The plot. What? On the one hand, this plot feels more at home in a 3-issue mini-arc in the comics, not something that should necessarily be carrying a feature film. It's pretty much just a bad mixture of different villainous clichÃ©s rolled into one hammy ""plot."" On the other hand, I found the plot to be rather poorly explained. Guy Pearce is secretly selling this new ""technology"" to the Mandarin because... well, the Mandarin and his cronies are willing to buy it, finding its nefarious ""side effects"" more desirable than the original, seemingly noble intent behind it. But then we find out that the Mandarin was simply a construction, a work of fiction designed by Pearce's character to serve his own ends. Well now I'm confused. Who's buying what? Where's the money coming from? I'm not saying these questions don't have answers, only that they weren't explained very well and at some point I felt like the film and I entered into a tacit agreement: just don't explain it anymore and I'll stop thinking about it. To its credit, the film lived up to its end of the bargain.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tonal inconsistencies. I felt like I was watching three different Iron Man movies. One was the typical mainstream superhero flick we've come to expect from Marvel movies. The other was a surprisingly absurd comedy - almost a spoof of the franchise rather than a further installment of it. For example, it's sort of hard to buy the Mandarin as a pathetically aloof actor, at least, the way it was sold to us in the movie. He doesn't seem to understand the very real violence going on. He seems like a worthless jester, which is fine... just not really the kind of person you want burdened with that kind of responsibility. He's so comically oblivious to the real happenings, that it suggests, again, a satirical tone rather than a straight one. Thirdly, I felt like part of this movie was an indie-actioner, sort of like Black's previous film, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" The quick- witted Stark firing out shots from his handgun while engaging in banter with Rhodes, also wielding a gun, didn't really work for me in this flick. I guess the movie felt like three ingredients thrown hastily together to create a last-minute meal. The results are what you'd expect, I suppose.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The anxiety issue. It just didn't work for me. On the one hand, it felt like a less interesting version of Stark's alcohol problem, which is obviously a big issue in the comics and was dealt with in Iron Man 2. But whereas alcoholism seems totally fitting and understandable with the Tony Stark we've come to know, this anxiety issue felt like a contrivance and like something that would clearly be resolved by the end of the movie. I felt like giving the guy a hug and saying, ""just hang in there, Tony, you'll be better in a couple hours."" Whereas the alcoholism issue, even if done in a more nuanced way, seemed like a lasting, difficult challenge for the character. Yeah, they try to explain the anxiety attacks as something of a reaction to the wormhole in the Avengers, but whatever. It just seemed artificial.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending. It reminded me of the kind of BS conclusion you might write during an in-class exam. You know, try to wrap things up, broaden your thesis statement a bit, tie it into some abstract ideas or themes. But I just felt like they were... BSing. Wrapping up themes that either weren't there or were too boring to have given much thought to in the first place. I guess the story was about ""healing,"" which explains the ludicrous scene in which Tony Stark gets the shrapnel removed. Okay. A big part of the first two films was that he couldn't remove the shrapnel. I'm not saying that he never should be able to, but his story is so inextricably tied into the shrapnel, that it deserved more than a passing ""Oh yeah, got rid of that"" moment. Losing the shrapnel is a big deal, but it was done so easily that it came across as a comical distraction.</li></ul><br/><br/>Those are my thoughts. Thanks for reading."

","To start this off this movie was alright tin my opinion but does not deserve it's current ranking on IMDb. There was just too many plot holes and unanswered questions for me to like this movie. <br/><br/>Starting off with the main ""villain"" The Mandarin, turned out to pretty much be a joke, as much as i love Ben Kingsley, i hated his role in this, The Mandarin was supposed to be iron mans arch nemesis, not guy pierces character. I hated the whole extremist storyline which pretty much left with more questions than answers. i also hated how iron mans suits were apparently made out of tin foil in this movie, with those extremist just cutting through them like butter. Thors hammer and lighting could barely scratch his armor and these guys can just rip through them? a joke to my eyes. <br/><br/>Other then that RDJ's acting was good, great special effects. but this had more of a dark feeling, not consistent with the other marvel movies. Also i thought the scene at the end would have to deal with more phase 2 of the avengers, but i guess not."
"ypjoshi","6","3","6","2 May 2013"," Prototype Failure: Iron Mark III
","There i am on the seat in positive mind ready for the iron man's ""toughest battle"". The movie starts,the plot is being arranged..the characters are being introduced, and i am totally in the mood. I have the entire cinematic history of Iron man in my mind ready for reference,in case some deep connection to previous movie is implied very subtly worrying i might miss it.The movie is on, the pace is slow, i am busy justifying myself, making plausible connections. An occasional eye catching action sequence makes my palms meet in a clap. But there's some humming noise of misconnection coming from my subconscious, its been past interval and i seem to spend more time shaking it off, as the quantum of solace starts to pile on. And just like some iron man prototype suit, the movie rises, exhausting too much in bursts in short time and makes that sad projectile dive, not so far from where it launched.The movie just did not feel to be happening in marvel's world whatsoever,its so disconnected. Marvel might just feel it a little harsh the way i am putting it,but they had it coming from a fan.<br/><br/>They had made a perfect trailer, they had the success of avengers behind them, and of course, there was this new awesomeness in iron man since avengers,a little different that the first two episodes in the franchise. With expectations rocketing skywards, the movie looked deflected from the projected path. A very important part of making a sequel is you adhere to what you declare earlier. They seem to just have forgotten, the way they built iron man's world in avengers and taken a new route altogether. Whatever connections shown to the avengers seemed more like afterthoughts.Looked Like the makers were there with some action scenes in mind(they were very good, no doubt) and the producers pressurizing them to release the movie NOW, when the iron is hot. It comes out as a skeleton with very strong bones articulated by weak joints(""storyline""). Well needless to say, it succeeded in generating some joint pains in the pro movie-goers. The usual iron mannish comedy is good and equispaced but hurtfully misfit in the end sequence. I cant convey it without spoilers.So, i hope you feel it. Some mention-able aspects are 1.the array of new Iron Man Suits 2.Pepper pots in action mode and 3.As always, some new futuristic technology and devices...<br/><br/>Acting wise, i don't find any flaws, the actors were up to the mark. What can i say about Robert Downey. I think Shane Black's role when Downey is giving the shot, is to yell action and stay put. The very little things he does puts immense personality to the character he plays. Man i would love to see him behind the camera someday. The outcome would be truly enjoyable. Ben Kingsley is a surprise package in tho movie and has exceeded high expectations in his role. Enough said, these two have left the rest of the cast at some far away milestone.<br/><br/>In the making department,even though considering Shane Black is only one movie old, when at stake is iron man 3, he cannot be shown mercy.It seemed like he had his hands full, and the story unknowingly leaked from his fingers.The 3D was non mention-able, so much so, i would not have noticed save for one scene. You would know which one when u see it. <br/><br/>All in all a good action movie. Fans, i know we cant just stay put when its out. Go watch it, don't expect too much..and you may be rewarded.!"
"ironhorse_iv","6","3","6","1 May 2013"," Marvel's Man of Steel, Iron Man 3 steals audience, a good movie. It was just OK film
","After the events of 2012 summer blockbuster The Avengers, there were some really big shoes to fit, for the new Iron Man movie and its director Shane Black. Sadly, it's was too big for him. I had high hopes for the film, and it felt like just another mediocre lazy popcorn flick. The movie based on the ""Extremis"" story arc by Warren Ellis comic book, but it's loosely. The movie starts after the events of The Avengers, a haunted Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) start to have panic attacks due to the 'trauma' of the alien invasion and his near-death experience. Yes, Tony Stark started having panic attacks, yet he is able leap off 20 story buildings, fight crime, and save the world yet again from the evil Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Wow, those near-death experience is really stopping him. Not! Talking about the Mandarin, if you are a comic book fan. You will be deeply disappointed by finding out who he truly is. At first, the movie made him out to be one of the greatest superhero villains of all time, but they really ruin it for a twist ending, and stupid humor. Without spoiling the movie, let's just say, that the real villain is somebody else in the film. While there is a string of bombings by terrorists, I surprised there was no mention of S.H.I.E.L.D or what the other Avengers were doing while this was happening. They did had a cameo from one of the Avengers after the ending Credits. I know they didn't have the actors plan for this film, but they could have at less note one or two lines what they were doing around this time. I would have thought that would be a big deal for S.H.I.E.L.D since the Mandarin is planning to kill the President, and make super soldiers with the Extremis, an alien biologic weapon. Well, we know what Tony Stark is spend doing some of the movie, and it's rarely being Iron Man. Stark spend most of the time hanging out in Tennessee for some odd reason with a kid that looks like Carl from Walking Dead name Harley. In truth, he's barely in the suit even with the highlight action scenes like the jet plane action rescue. Honestly, if people get suck out of a jet plane, I think they would die once they leave the airplane due to the high pressure. If not they would have at less freeze and pass out. Still, it was pretty good action scene. The supporting cast of Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Gwyneth Paltrow work within their means. The movie use Gwyneth Paltrow more in this film less than Damsel in distress, but more like the wife from the movie High Noon. The ending to the film wasn't that good in my opinion. I wonder now how he will join the Avengers 2 if there is any. The story was meant as a sort of ""new start"" for the character -to redefine him from his origins as an arms dealer, to be the ""test pilot for the future"". Ellis intended him to be a better superhero, so I understand what they were saying, but I also believe it had something else to say. The reason they made the movie how they did is because Robert Downey Jr's contract is ending after this movie. He may sign a new contract but that is in discussion. Marvel wanted to leave their options open for new cast if that is the way they go. I personally think Iron Man wouldn't have been such a success without Robert Downey, he made the movie great and plays the character awesome. It's hard not to see him in the role. It paled in comparison to the other two. I wonder how many fans tuned in to see an epic battle between Iron man and his nemesis The Mandarin and got screw. The Mandarin is Iron Man's most famous foe in the comics mainly because he's been around the longest, and now it's wasted. I Love the actors and special effects, but that's just false advertising. Stick with the Marvel Comics version of things, Hollywood and quit trying to re-write things because you think you can do it better. You can't, sometimes."
"jack_woods","7","3","6","30 April 2013"," Great entertainment but shouldn't be Iron Man 3
","Keeping it short and sweet, 'Iron Man 3' does not live up to the standard the first two Marvel creations paved over the last five years. John Favreau's replacement director, Shane Black took the reigns on the third installment and Marvel clearly provided him freedom within its creation. While the action holds up, fun choreography blended with Tony's new tech there are some major plot holes. Over the years Stark's suits (MK 7-8) have endured encounters with: Thor the God of Thunder, Ivan Vanko's reigns of lightning...oh and a trip through a worm hole whilst battling the alien race, Chtauri. These old suit model types are outdated and yet his MK 47 in IM3 cannot withstand the heat from Guy Pearce's poorly explained fire-henchman. This, I just cannot understand.<br/><br/>For me this was a disappointing end to the Stark/Iron Man legacy. Favreau should have held the torch til the end. This movie will receive some very varied reviews, no doubt. Hell, I'll watch it again just for the entertainment and good chuckles.<br/><br/>6/10."

"nethlyn","7","3","6","26 April 2013"," This is ""Lethal Iron"" With Tony Stark As Riggs and Rhodey as Murtagh
","Shane Black wrote the script - the dialogue is excellent. The budget was something north of $150-200million - it's on the screen, and 90% of the 3D works well with subtlety and not just in your face negative parallax.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? It's not about Iron Man anymore and Disney thought we wanted to watch two hours of ""ah heck my suit's not working again"" and turn these characters into a standard wisecracking action duo, or if they actually get to wear a suit of armour then they're R2-D2 and that suit will get smashed to bits because this is a hilarious running joke from the Avengers onwards. It got old after two hours in the Avengers but nope, here it is all over again.<br/><br/>The treatment of the villain might have been smart but more time should have been given over to Guy Pearce's excellent performance than just a simple flashback and cut to the present day. Then it would've been more believable than having his plans nearly succeed all over one single Christmas period, he's criminally underused and so are his non-super-powered henchmen.<br/><br/>The ending is also complete BS, trying to give some kind of patriotic flag wave about counter-terrorism and to some extent takes another leaf from Nolan's Batman films with regard to Stark.<br/><br/>All that Man of Steel has to do is to be about Superman without the relationship sub-plots getting in the way of the action and that will be the better film this summer out of the two. Anyone that disliked Iron Man 2, go back and watch that again because this is worse."

If I could see this movie again tonight I would. My mind is still blown away. Once again the movie is amazing."
"HOXS28","10","6","16","27 April 2013"," The Boldest Marvel Film
","First of all, I said BOLDEST and not necessarily BEST. Actually I believe IM3 is second only to The Avengers, which has an overall more ambitious and greater scope despite having a more conventional narrative. But the main reason why I say it's bold is the great risks it took to deviate from comics and even the whole S.H.I.E.L.D/heroes coalition theme (that up to The Avengers was present in every Marvel Cinematic Universe film) to focus solely on the character Tony Stark. And by doing it, it finally accomplishes the character development of the MCU's (arguable) protagonist. <br/><br/>Never before was Stark as much aware of the consequences of his giant ego (he risks Pepper's safety with a miscalculated threat that leads to the subsequent destruction of Malibu Home, not to count the heinous outcome of ignoring Aldrich Killian's Extremis project back in 1999) as well as of his own vulnerabilities without his suit (post-traumatic stress after the crossing of the Wormhole and contacting aliens and gods leading him to escalate the production of armors). Indeed, as the opening citation states: ""We create our own demons"".That, however, doesn't stop him from recovering from the blow and looking after himself throughout the film with limited access to technology (comparatively to the previous installments), relying mostly on his geniality, resourcefulness and craftsmanship. <br/><br/>And even if the 'army of armors' (which took the whole movie to successfully load) has a decisive role in the final battle, by that time Stark's learning is already enough for him to realize that his heroism is based on the MECHANIC he is rather than the MACHINES he uses and, also, that he is ready to take one step further in his commitment to Pepper. Thus his character arc of humanization is complete and he promptly gets rid of the armors and the 'arc reactor' he depended on. As he states 'HE is Iron Man', regardless of his gadgets... <br/><br/>As a poignant bonus, filmmaker Shane Black and screenwriter Drew Pearce (with the fundamental consent of R.D. Jr.) added some clever comments on USA politics (a hallmark of the Iron Man film series but this time much more incisive, focusing preferentially on the oil rather than the weapons industry) and on the media, more specifically, on cinema itself (with the 'Mandarin twist' , to the comic book fans dismay - and the evident conclusion regarding the power of images to manipulate and tell lies, aided by the superb casting and distinct acting from sir Ben Kingsley), leading to a surprisingly omnipresent mocking tone - in such a way that's reminiscent of Black's own previous use of metalanguage to deconstruct Hollywood in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". <br/><br/>All matters considered, even if the whole Extremis program deserved a better approach to its implications and scientific issues, one can easily overcome it by noticing the film's intended lack of seriousness. Considering yet the 'buddy cop' overtones (dating back to Black's screen writing breakthrough in Lethal Weapon) in Stark's interactions with a Tennessee kid and Rhodes, not to count the presence of gags (R.D. Jr. undying comic timing) even in the climax, the outcome is a motion picture that is as unpretentious and entertaining as possible, which nevertheless is successful in crafting a meaningful story. <br/><br/>Moreover, the visual aspect of IM3 is indubitably the best in the whole MCU franchise, with the cinematography making the action sequences the most impressive, while the film editing allows them to always keep geographically understandable (aided by Black's long time experience with the action genre), all the while the special effects finally ended the graphic discrepancy (that even in The Avengers couldn't be dealt with) between Tony's live-action face and his CGI suit. More than just a technical achievement, such a feat beautifully matches the film's overall humanization theme.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the message after the post credits scene (which has Dr. Bruce 'The Hulk' Banner in the role of Stark private and unwilling shrink after the establishing of their friendship bonds throughout The Avengers) leaves no stone unturned regarding the humanization narrative: <br/><br/>""Tony Stark will return"", rather than the the title character..."

","After sweeping the box office and enthralling the audience, this third offering strategically stays on safe ground. After the somewhat excessively convoluted plot of Iron Man 2, this one takes a simple, familiar plot line: a villain grabbing a new technology to gain power. There is also a small moral lesson: you can slight someone, but don't play with him. When budding inventor Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) approaches Tony Stark at a busy conference, instead of just sending him away, Stark sends him to the chilly roof to wait for him. This apparently trivial prank comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>Talking about villains, Iron Man 3 offers a sleight-of-hand twist that have been seen a couple of times but names of the specific movies just don't come to mind readily. Anyway, it is wonderful to see Ben Kingsley in this context, in a superbly executed comic role, English accent and all.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr continues to ooze his flippant, Narcissistic charm, which is what I referred to about this movie staying on safe ground. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, has elevated Pepper Potts from just pretty prop to a role of real substance, culminating in even saving our hero. I understand that this has attracted mixed reactions from the audience. Some loved it while others consider it nothing less than sacrilege.<br/><br/>Completing the strong cast are Don Cheadle returning to his now familiar role, Paul Bettany reprising his HAL-like role of Jarvis, and lovely Rebecca Hall as the femme fatale.<br/><br/>The main attraction, however, is still the spectacle. Here, the movie makers are clever in not overdoing it. The movie is basically bookended between two most spectacular set pieces that you can find anywhere. No description is necessary.

"csommerkelly","1","4","10","13 November 2013"," A rotten mess *Spoilers*
","Rarely have I seen such a grotesque and hideous film as Iron Man 3. The Avengers set a high bar for the Marvel franchise, it was an outstanding success became the third highest grossing film in cinema history. I am aware that the Marvel films are not to be taken seriously, these are supposed to be fun guy flicks with lots of action and witty one liners. That does not mean however, that every female character is either barely clad, about to have sex, or just had sex. The objectification of woman in this film is extraordinary. What's more they have no brains. Those that have lines are all damsels in distress. Second, the violence. One gets the feeling that Director and screenwriter Shane Black wanted to bring the franchise to the level of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Shane therefore injects all sorts of violence towards innocent people, including a bombing in a city area, incredibly disrespectful due to the recent Boston incident. None of these events achieve the realism of Nolan's dark villains, and just makes the film quiet idiotic. A total let down and a stain on the Avengers franchise. Lastly the villains. According to the trailers and the first quarter of the film Sir Ben Kingsley was to portray the big baddie, the Mandarin. However he turns out to be a puppet for Guy Pierce's character. We are never told why Mr. Pierce's persona is killing all these people. However, would have been much better if it had been the other way round. The Mandarin a big bad guy and Peirce's character the lead henchman. But the ending is the final straw that broke the camels back. In order to declare his love for his wife/girlfriend, Pepper played by an uninteresting Gweneth Paltrow. Tony decides to destroy both his suits and Jarvis. How will he be able to appear in the second Avengers? The whole film seems to have been made by Michael Bay, and that's not a complement."

Its like me talking about saving a bird from being alone, I get an anxiety attack,you might think I'm a wimp.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 copied a couple of scenes from ""The Dark Knight Rises"".They copied the destroyed mask and they copied the hospital scene which is very ridiculous.They should have their own ideas.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall is terrible in this movie. I couldn't understand a word she said, she doesn't move her mouth. They should have chosen someone else besides that terrible actress.<br/><br/>People were given drugs by the bad guy, Killian. Then they were able to blown fire out of their mouth and they could be shot and not die, it's very fake. Killian also had mind control over them? Aldrich Killian is really the Mandarin but has an actor guy that looks like the Mandarin from the comic books with ten rings pretending to be Mandarin.That doesn't follow the comic books.<br/><br/>The relationship between Tony & Pepper is not about love, it is about Tony wanting her so he can function. Tony gave Pepper a giant stuffed animal that's like 6 or 7 feet tall, that part is too goofy. If he loved her, his gift would have shown it.<br/><br/>The story is so confusing and so lame that you can't tell who's who and what suits are destroyed. And 7.6 its too high for this movie that you can't understand what is going. Tony Stark is so good in The Avengers and he became wimpy in Iron Man 3? When he is with Pepper he's a jerk. In King Kong,Carl Denham said ""the beauty killed the beast"",and for Iron Man 3 I say ""Pepper killed Iron Man"".<br/><br/>I am very,very glad that they are not making another Iron Man movie because this is so bad. <br/><br/>And there's nothing else for me to say,except that Shane Black should not have directed this movie the same as Brett Ratner should not have directed X-Men 3."

","I waited a day after I saw this movie to write this review because I didn't want to write it on a per emotional bases.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: <br/><br/>I did not think a Marvel or a Iron Man movie could be this bad. I was skeptical when I saw the trailers but I had faith in Paramount and Marvel that after the success of the Avengers they would do nothing to screw this up. Boy was I wrong. If you are a movie fan, like me, you may check IMDb.com and moviefone.com to see what kind of ratings and reviews movies are getting from critics and users. I don't always believe cities or other users but this time I wish I would have looked a little harder. Whoever voted this movie as a 7.7 on IMDb or gave it 3 & 1/2 out of 4 stars on Moviefone should never be aloud to vote again. This movie should not have even been in theaters but instead been put on the Disney channel, and even by that comparison I still would have said it was terrible. I was so disappointed with Iron Man 2 that I thought there is no way they would screw up again, but I was wrong, this was WAY worst. On a scale of how bad I would even compare this to the Green Lantern Movie and say Green Lantern may have been better.<br/><br/>About the movie: They tried to make a darker more gritty version of Iron Man, I think, but it turned out to be just stupid. How this scrip made it to the big screen is beyond me. The villains were all bad, the jokes were awful, the acting was no good and even the computer graphic were just OK. The end with Pepper was just something I had to laugh at because of how dumb it was. I am trying not to go to into to much detail but trust me there was NO part of this movie I thought was good! Let me restate this so you don't get the wrong idea, I am a movie Fan and I am a super hero, Marvel, DC Fan. This is truly my first review I have written but I felt this had to be shared.<br/><br/>Please save your money, Do Not Go See This Movie. If it was possible I would sue Paramount for not my money back, but my 130 minutes of my life I lost!"

","First things first,this movie is definitely one of the coolest movies out this year.The dashing Robert Downey Jr. returns as Iron man 3 and you better watch out he's slicker than ever.The first half of this movie was amazing,humorous and a treat for the senses...In fact i think it's first half was far greater than that of it's predecessors Iron man 2 and 1.There are plenty of sensational technology powered scenes that will totally wow you.The plot too seems interesting and the stakes much higher with a deadly global terrorist called 'The Mandarin' targeting U.S and who else to stand up to him than our very own Iron Man.The build up is great.The wisecracks are good.The action scenes top notch.Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow perform superbly. All good till here.<br/><br/>Where then does it go wrong?The second half.Why oh why did they have to make a mockery out of such a menacing looking villain(The Mandarin).Why try fix what's not broken and make The Mandarin just a pawn.The pace of the movie drops,the plot dulls and so many things just don't fit in. Nor did i like it that Pepper had her DNA mutated and all of a sudden in the end she's like the new hero.Lame.They ruined what was such a promising start with some mind boggling digressions and unexpected (rather, not needed) story twists along with lack of elaborations on the plot.<br/><br/>Overall i think it's way better than Iron Man 2 and probably as good as Iron Man 1.Does it still merit a watch?Of course,it's freaking Iron Man!"
"rawalshadab","10","7","22","25 April 2013"," Iron Man 3: Pretty Good
","Iron Man 3 is Marvel's latest entertaining cash-cow. As a huge fan of comics in general, I was really looking forward to this movie. From the trailers I had already resigned myself to the fact that we live in a ""post 9/11"" world. Having accepted that, I was ready for a movie about terrorists or evil corporations or wars with other countries. This was not what I had expected. In fact, it took some risks and liberties with the Iron Man mythos that may upset hardcore fans. However, I consider myself a hardcore fan and I liked it fine. <br/><br/>There was this little movie that came out a while ago called Avengers. This is a direct follow-up to that independent low-budget cult film (ok enough sarcasm). Iron Man 3 takes place a little after the 'New York' incident ' (the events of the Avengers, not to be confused with 9/11), where after Tony Stark has decided to do what every millionaire superhero does in the third part of a trilogy: become an obsessive hermit. He builds better stronger multi-application suits in his spare time. What can I say, he's better at pissing away money than Bruce Wayne. Stark narrates the film, possibly reading from a copy of Warren Ellis's 'Extremis' (I really wanted that to be the ending). I won't write what happens in case you haven't read that book, but I will say this is more of Stark's past coming back to bite him in the ass... much like the other 2 films (albeit in a different way). This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The villains are terrorists using bio-enhancements. That's about all I can say without spoiling the movie, really. (there's a spoilers version on my blog)<br/><br/>Shane Black takes charge of this part of the trilogy, which was a great choice of directors. I'm a fan of his amazing dialogue and very intelligent, elaborate fight scenes. Keeping in mind this is Shane Black, I was expecting a darker plot. Gladly, he kept it light and campy when it needed to be, but also wasn't afraid to pull out a death scene. He really knows how to pump up the intensity. I felt like this was a true successor to the Avengers in terms of tone (and I think music as well), but also wasn't afraid of exploring it's villains a little deeper. It's still comic booky and it's REALLY soaks that in. It's not afraid to be over-the-top, which I admire. I thought that was a major flaw with the Nolan Batman films. They seemed to be ashamed of being comic book movies, so they ended up not feeling like it.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are goofy as hell but just what I want to see from a comic book movie. The dialogue is ridiculously good. Stark is snarky and always has something to say, just the way we like it. They don't ignore the existence of the rest of the movies. In fact there are clever references all over the place. The soundtrack does it's job. If you were a fan of the Avengers soundtrack, you'll notice the similarities (particularly the ending scene track of this movie and 'A Promise'). Musical motifs linking the movies are definitely in there.... (Go to Full Review to read the rest)"

"mstomaso","7","3","7","13 February 2014"," Pulp for Genre Purists
","Iron Man 3 is more of a moving comic than a motion picture. Even the cinematography is reminiscent of old-time comic book panels. The story is light years from any reality we participate in. Like the best comics, it alludes to various aspects of history and reality cleverly but without yielding to the oppression of the everyday. Iron Man 3 is not entirely consistent with the rest of the franchise, however. Iron Man's various armor configurations appear to be a lot less resilient and functional than in the previous films (a bit like the difference between the creature in Alien and those of Aliens). <br/><br/>Tony Stark is experiencing a great deal of apparently justifiable paranoia. He is also suffering from crippling anxiety attacks and nightmares. At one point, he is diagnosed by the most likable, heroic, and memorable character in the film - pre-teen Harley Keener (played by Ty Simpkins) - as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. <br/><br/>Stark is facing a shadowy, almost invisible, enemy, who is apparently hidden in plain sight. Having lost what would appear to be a decisive battle, Stark must rely on his wits, his own unreliable technology, and a series of unlikely heroes - a young boy (Simpkins), the alcoholic mother of a dead soldier, a media operator with a good internet connection - to prevail. Of course, Pepper (Paltrow), his AI Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and War Machine/Iron Patriot/Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also come in handy. <br/><br/>The plot is extremely predictable, but it moves along and successfully relies on escapism, awe-inspiring effects, and entertainment value. <br/><br/>With their respective talents, Paltrow, Downey and Pearce didn't even need to try. Paltrow and Pearce do, however, and really make the film worth watching. Downey never seems as fully engaged with this script as he has in previous comic book films. All the same, Iron Man 3 is a lot of fun and will appeal to those in search of the insane action, dysfunctional myopia of the main character and the tongue-in-cheek, slightly smarter-than-average dialog that characterize this franchise."

","This is a man with an action pedigree including the Lethal Weapon series, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Last Action Hero, and The Last Boyscout to name a few that he has been associated with. He still managed to create a film with too many action scenes that were often excessive. The result was a disconnection between non-action scenes, leaving plot and character development to be drowned out by fight sequences that became tedious and silly to watch. All of this could have been avoided via Shane Black exercising a lot more restraint which, coincidentally, may have given said action scenes greater impact without interrupting the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Another major offender in Iron Man 3 were the convenient escapes. Multiple times we see Tony or loved ones in danger only to have his suit fly in to save them. While I get it is Iron Man and that the suit will at times save the day, the number of times this occurred sucked away a lot of the movies tension.<br/><br/>Finally without putting too fine a point on it as I have no desires to spoil, there were a number of divergences from what was in the comic to how the story played out in the film. It is a Hollywood film and I understand this will happen, but usually they do it for the right reasons. Here what was changed seemed to be a lesser, more confusing version of what was originally an enjoyable, logical journey. Go figure.<br/><br/>Anyhow,its how I felt walking out of the film and still feel days later. I'm not going to go on about what good points there were as this is more a review of grounding some peoples high expectations for this film, in the hopes it may better their film experience. I write this only wishing I'd had something similar to have read before going in."

","I don't know what is all this rage about. It's just a fricking superhero movie. Maybe because I am neither a hardcore Iron Man follower nor I have tons of comics, I just enjoyed this movie like someone who likes sci-fi and fantasy movies. Well, what can i say? I loved the first movie, but for some reason the second one bored me the hell out of me and I really wanted to like it; now this third movie has accomplished its mission: it has entertained me. Of course I know some background info about Iron Man thanks to some comics and cartoons of my childhood, so when I watched this crazy twist about Mandarin, I said: whaaaaaaat???? This is.... just.....ridiculous, but also BRILLIANT! Why not? really, why not? I know this was a delusion for hardcore fans and angry nerds, but for this movie , it worked perfectly. Another apparently hated point is that this movie focus a lot more on Tony Stark and not only on Iron Man... well, I hate to say it but this is for me another strong point. Are there loopholes? of course there are! But hey what movie doesn't have any? This is not an artsy fancy movie or Oscar movie, it's just an action flick that just happens to have a superhero. If you just want action, fun, good fx and entertainment, don't hesitate and watch it.<br/><br/>PD.

Hell even the animated series of young tony is depicted more accurately than this bull s***. At least that series mandarin has the concept of the 10 rings and aspire to collect them.

","""Iron Man 3"" brings the ""Iron Man"" franchise back on track after the poorly made ""Iron Man 2"" and brings the audience a satisfying conclusion to one of their more popular super heroes.<br/><br/>There were a lot of ideas that were creative and interesting, particularly the Mandarin being a washed up actor instead of an actual terrorist leader and the story focusing more on Tony Stark and not Iron Man because if the man behind the hero is boring then there is less interest in the character itself.<br/><br/>While it was the funniest one, which I liked, it felt at times like there were several screenwriters, one who thought it was supposed to be a darker chapter of the ""Iron Man"" movies and one who thought it was supposed to be a comedy film. Having comedy in a film is fine but this is not a comedy film and there are a lot of times where jokes are overplayed or shoved in for no reason.<br/><br/>With the development of Stark's character, I am satisfied with the series as a whole and do not believe another film is needed.

I like comedies and go see them when I want to see a comedy. When I want to see a super hero I go to see one. This is neither. On top of that now any and everyone is now a super hero because they are wear the Iron Man suit at some point in the movie. I believe there was FIVE different people wearing some form of Iron Man suit.<br/><br/>How in the world does this get such a high rating from critics too? I'm baffled at that.

Also, you could really see character change through the entire storyline, plus there were NEW characters, I don't want to spoil it, but they're really great. The acting was fantastic.

"Forgotten_Conscience_Productions","7","3","7","6 June 2013"," Iron Man 3 Review: Is the 3rd time the charm?
","Any decent film franchise will try to recover from a failure if the potential upside outweighs the downfall. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like most people, I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 2. It had its moments and some great characters, most notably Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit kicking butt and taking names. Not to mention any movie that involves Samuel L. Jackson always gets a bump in credibility with me. That man can read the phone book and make it fascinating. Oh, and did I mention Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit? Even that can't save a badly told story from a weak script. As a friend recently told me, a good story can make people forgive bad production value but the reverse isn't necessarily true.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Iron Man 3 has a good story and good production value. Whereas Iron Man 2 was more wrapped up in setting the scene for The Avengers and the preceding Captain America and Thor movies, this movie is about the aftermath. How does Tony Stark live with what he's seen and done? What does a scientist do when his perception of the world has been shattered and he realizes that the world is much bigger and more deadly then he could have imagined? Can a hero even operate under that kind of environment? That's the reality that Tony Stark is living with at the beginning of the film and the theme of the whole movie.<br/><br/>It's a powerful theme and something that's pretty common in the superhero film genre, particularly in today's world. Doing it well and in a fresh way takes a lot of planning and a good foundation. The best part about adapting a comic book character with as many years behind it as Iron Man, you have a lot to draw from. Particularly when your audience may not be as familiar with the character's history as most hardcore fans. The first film raised the profile of the character but I'm guessing that the fans of the first two films didn't go out and read all the best comics of the character. I can count myself among such fans.<br/><br/>Still, I know enough to know what makes a good superhero film for the bigger fans. This film has a lot of those elements but doesn't require you to go out and read through every comic book to understand the context. It also refocuses the story on the main character, something sorely lacking in a film that has such a self-centred hero. In the end though, I think most people will be very happy with the latest instalment of the Iron Man franchise. It's smart, funny and has a lot to say about the world we live in. The way a great movie of this type of film genre should do things. Even better is the fact that we know that this franchise is far from over. They have Thor and Captain America 2 coming out and while the film doesn't appear to set up anything for them, it does leave you with room to do another chapter if the folks at Marvel want to.<br/><br/>And with the success they have been having lately they most certainly will. Unlike other film trilogies, the character's story isn't entirely wrapped up but many elements which have been carried over through the three films do get a resolution of sorts.<br/><br/>Is the 3rd time the charm for Iron Man? I was definitely charmed by it and I look forward to seeing more from the character and the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"

","I've read many negative reviews about this film that almost put me off watching the film, after being disappointed with the 2nd installment, however I decided to go anyway and ignore the other reviewers. <br/><br/>Iron Man Three wasn't the best out of the trilogy, I think the First Iron Man had the edge due to it being the original and you didn't know exactly what to expect, but this installment definitely was worth watching and much better than the 2nd. <br/><br/>Unlike other reviewers saying the dialogue was terrible I do think the writers did a good job with keeping the humour throughout the film, because at the end of the day you can never take these films too seriously and the dialogue is well written to keep it that way. Unlike Transformers where they tried to make the film more serious than what it was in the 2nd and 3rd installment.<br/><br/>The acting was great, Robert Downy put in a solid performance and did a good job of adapting to the slightly changed Tony Stark after the events of Avengers. Ben Kingsley was superb as the mandarin and pretty surprising after you realise his true character. <br/><br/>Finally the CGI was amazing as always and the action was great. Had great action sequences from beginning to end. (Slightly slow starting like the 2nd film) <br/><br/>My only down sides was that I was slightly disappointed with the Mandarin and how he turned out. And also that there was no AC-DC music that was key in the first two installments. Other than that which is nothing to put you off from watching, my final rating is,<br/><br/>4&1/2 stars.<br/><br/>But remember, do not take this film too seriously as it could disappoint you."

Rarely do I hate a movie. I hated the third film. Absolutely hated it. <br/><br/>My work bought us tickets to see it as a team-building event, and they got tickets for the 3D version. What a waste. The action sequences are incredibly mashed and blurred in 3D. I had no clue what was going on during fight scenes. If I had my way I'd never see another film in gimmicky 3D again. <br/><br/>I was beginning to enjoy his bond with the kid, and then the 2nd half of the movie came in. Holy crap. It's as if the writers just said ""screw It"". The plot twist with the mandarin was aggravating. I don't think I've ever been so let down by a comic book villain before (and I've seen batman & robin). All the critics that came out and said that Ben Kingsley was one of the best villains ever were either bought out or just unfunny jerks. <br/><br/>The political elements in the film are pointless. At one point they have the president captured and they mentioned they're going to drown him in oil Why? The main guys beef is with Tony Stark. The PTSD tie in is in poor taste. ""Hey we can cure your PTSD but you have to REALLY want it"". Cruel, and shameful to be used as a plot point.<br/><br/>Now for the whammy at the end they removed Tony's shrapnel in his heart like he's getting his tonsils taken out. The WHOLE premise of the first two movies is that he needs the power source to live and it was too risky to remove.<br/><br/>If they make another Iron Man, I might just wait for the Blu Ray. This one ticked me off."

The Mandarin. Or lack-thereof. Instead of simply making the Mandarin more grounded in reality, they decided to make him fake altogether. This was simply a stupid idea and I was kind of angry.<br/><br/>2. Lack of actual Iron Man action. The scene when Tony's house was blown up was pretty good, but that's really all the iron man fighting we got other than the final scene with the dozens of suits.<br/><br/>3. Lack of seriousness. Don't get me wrong, I thought the jokes were pretty damn funny. But they didn't seem to get that balance of humor and darkness that the first Iron Man had.<br/><br/>4. Boring. I mean seriously, this is a legitimate complaint. It took a good hour and a half for anything interesting to happen. When it finally picked up, I was like ""finally"" and then it ended. Seriously? I waited all this time for that?<br/><br/>5. Lack of Iron Patriot. The only real action screen time Iron Patriot had was when Guy Pierce invaded the plane and kidnapped the president. I would've liked to see Tony and Rhody kicking ass side-by-side again like in Iron Man 2, but alas it didn't happen.<br/><br/>Overall, I was incredibly disappointed. Avengers was a phenomenal movie, I didn't think the next movie to come out of Marvel Phase 2 would be the worst one yet.

","Rounding a trilogy sure is difficult. Your audience has built up its expectations of how the movie should feel, and if you play with the tone too much the relationship to the previous films will suffer. Iron Man 3 does this in a big way; however this doesn't inherently make it bad. Both Iron Man and Iron Man 2 were directed by Jon Favreau and while the hedonism was a bit much, these films felt very connected and watching them back to back tells a very fluid story. And then there's Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Ironically Joss Whedon's The Avengers was a substantially better ""Iron Man 3 film"" than the film Iron Man 3. Not just in quality, but in the character focus and the story of Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, Tony Stark's character feels completely removed from the previous Iron Man films. The excuse of this radical change is told with flimsy conjecture that his actions in The Avengers somehow hurt his psyche. Although going from a spoiled, rich, and hedonistic lifestyle to being held prisoner for three months in a Middle Eastern cell, that he just shrugs off with no problem.<br/><br/>To tell the plot summary with as minimum spoilers as possible, can be summed up with a simple concept: abandonment of focus. Iron Man, the first film, was Marvel's lash back at DC for the successful retelling of Batman in Batman Begins. DC chose to focus on how their superhero Batman could practically exist with only minor jumps in technology along the way. Iron Man follows this idea to the T. And as you probably already assumed, Iron Man 3 abandons this concept. Why? <br/><br/>The character of Tony Stark is intrinsically interesting. He is rich, handsome, charming, and confident; however, Iron Man 3 feels the need to humanize him. But this is an exercise in futility. From the moment we meet him we also learned his faults. He was an alcoholic, womanizer, and had no respect or love for anything but himself. Despite resolving these issues through the events of the first two movies, by far his largest character fault was his ego. Again this was somehow bruised by saving the world at the end of The Avengers. Because we all know that someone with an overwhelming large ego would not in any way become more full of himself after saving the world. And that this would simultaneously cause a complete shift is personality.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great; both Ms. Potts and Happy continue their respective character stories well. The villains however were laughably out of place, and sadly this was the only aspect of the film that was similar to the original Iron Man. One of the only improvements that Iron Man 2 had over the first film was dropping these flat, one-dimensional, Saturday morning cartoon Bond villains. But if you missed them, they're back for Iron Man 3. Hooray? <br/><br/>Despite being a very entertaining film, it seems its editing might be the greatest enemy. There are several rather important plot points and character decisions that either make no sense or happen at the wrong time. In fact, throughout the whole movie I kept thinking, ""Man, I can't wait to do a Fan Edit of this"". The flow of the narrative is perhaps the most damaged by this sloppy editing. The story is in there somewhere, but it's just not coming through very clearly.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is amazing. And the special effects keep you enthralled throughout every action sequence. From the barrel of monkeys to some spectacular fight/flight choreography, you'll be glued to your seat. At least until the scene is over and Tony Stark is back to babysitting some random kid. What's that? We need to appeal to the young kids in crowd? You want us to shoehorn a random subplot of a child in this film for no reason other than a blatant marketing ploy? Sure no problem.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 does have a lot going for it, but the degree of its strange choices adds up and in the end it leaves you with a bad aftertaste in your mouth. Did we mention this was a Christmas movie? Yeah, let that sink in for a moment. This is early May. So I ask again, why? And not knowing that it is a Christmas movie before watching it is even more confusing. There are no plots or subplots that justify it either; it is simply Christmas and there is no reason for it.<br/><br/>Iron Man is by far the most beloved Avenger, and with Thor and Captain America sequels in route I'm worried that this film may cost the others at the box office. Iron Man 3 pulled in over 175 million dollars in its opening weekend, one of the largest in history; second only to The Avengers. As this was the first film to follow The Avengers, it thusly was guaranteed to succeed financially, but at what cost to its fellow heroes? Although it is a very watchable film, the structural inconsistencies and abandonment of character focus deeply hurt the ability to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Check out more reviews at http://www.budswatchingduds.com"
"eddie-678-238217","5","3","7","6 May 2013"," Weakest of the series
","I am a big comics fan and have sucked up the last few years output, thoroughly enjoying the first two Iron Man films, along with Thor, CA, IH and culminating with the Avengers Assemble last year. Due to my anticipation of Man of Steel, I actually didn't get caught up in the IM3 hype- machine so when I went last night I had not too many expectations.<br/><br/>There are some good things about the film which I'm sure others will list, but I need to focus on the flaws as ultimately it is these that have outweighed the good aspects in my opinion.<br/><br/>1. The Armour. Mk 42 as we are now up to is very clever but feels insubstantial. I know it is meant to be light and more maneuverable but.....<br/><br/>2. The Mandarin. Love Ben Kinsgley. Loved Mandarin until they ruined it. What on earth was all that about? Why go to the trouble of creating a genuine menace and part of Iron Man's actual history only to discredit him entirely and produce a moment that can only detract from the films credibility? Not going into detail but this was a massive boo-boo in my opinion.<br/><br/>3. Extremis. Not explained sufficiently and the whole premise felt airy-fairy.<br/><br/>4. Finale. Great to see all of those Armour's, but where did all of the Extremis guys come from? There was no hint at any point that there were as many as this - having only shown documentation for 4 or 5 that we had seen during the film. There was no reveal that actually the program was quite extensive until the battle itself.<br/><br/>Aside from these main points, it felt very slow in the middle and not a lot happens. <br/><br/>I don't know whether it is the Avengers 'effect', but it doesn't feel right mentioning aliens and New York in an Iron Man film. I know it is unavoidable, but Iron Man has always felt more grounded than this. Even the flashbacks to the A film felt wrong!<br/><br/>There were a few other bits I didn't like but can't be bothered to list them right now but suffice it to say I was disappointed by this outing. I hope it is a blip as I love IM and RDJ but my love is not blind!...<br/><br/>Also, IMDb needs to ensure its grammar database is up to date and correct. It has forced adjustments and edits to my post which were unnecessary."
"StevePulaski","6","3","7","5 May 2013"," The ship should be docked by its original captain
","Early on in Iron Man 3's lengthy, long-awaited production, director Shane Black stated he wanted to make a film that wasn't superficial or self-serious, but rather, more fun and lighthearted. I would've went with serious; Iron Man 3 is, to say the least, a disappointing conclusion to a franchise that showed amazingly potent promise with its awe-inspiring debut just five years ago. This is a been-there-done-that affair that does exactly what I praised its original film for not doing; serving as a special effects compilation and incorporating much more humor than necessary.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was the foreseeable effect of having Black take the director's chair over Jon Favreau, who manned the ship on the first two productions. Black, whose fame stemmed from the 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, throws way too many cutesy witticisms in his writing, treating the third installment of the Iron Man franchise as the byproduct of a self-referential film treading the likes of Seven Psychopaths. Not only does putting this side-by-side with the original two films, which weren't as dark or as heavy as Nolan's Batman franchise but still rather serious, seem a tad out of place, but the series feels like it's more concerned with nudging and winking at the audience than wrapping things up cleanly.<br/><br/>We are thrown back in the futuristic world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), only this time, we start in 1999 at a New Year's Eve party where scientist Aldrich Killian tries to bring up thoughts and ideas about expanding his company to an cold, uninterested Stark. He is quickly-shifted out of Stark's mindset, never to be seen again any time soon.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to the present and we see Stark's battle with the aliens in New York (events from The Avengers) have made him jittery and a frequent victim to panic attacks. Just in time, too, since the elusive terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is threatening America's safety and Killian (Guy Peace) returns to exact revenge on Stark for his narcissism and arrogance. On top of this, he must ensure the safety of his long-suffering Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and continue emphasizing that he will protect the citizens of the United States from uncertain danger.<br/><br/>There is far less going on in the third installment of this series than there was in the second film; whether or this is good or bad, you can be the judge. Black doesn't play it safe, but he sometimes only slightly opens doors before closing them abruptly, a little bit like what Iron Man 2 did in the face of the government wanting Stark to hand over all his technology to the Defense Department. The ignored idea that we could've got a lot out of is when Stark's pal Rhodey (reprised by Don Cheadle) tries to convince him to refrain from instigating or provoking Mandarin in anyway and saying leave it to the government. That is when Iron Man's role in social order and political uprising should come into play but sadly never does.<br/><br/>I, too, can't help but feel that if you were a fan at all of the original Iron Man comic books that if part two let you down part three will considerably let you down. Mandarin is drastically shortchanged as a villain, not given too much backstory and only given certain times to chime and spit villainous clichés. Killian, as well, although the film sort of explains why in a twist ending that I find a tad more disingenuous. Clearly, he is played as some sort of Osama Bin-Laden-esque terrorist, but we know far too little about his motivations and plans. He is evil and wants to take over, case closed.<br/><br/>Another subplot features Ty Simpkins as a young boy named Harley, who connects with Stark on a personal level in certain points in the film. Harley is a well-meaning kid, kind of irritating, but genial and relatively harmless, and often the victim of Stark's narcissism as are many of his close friends. Harley isn't a bad character, but he's an unneeded addition to the story. His story offers little-to-no payoff and, in the end, plays as sort of a little piece that tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings.<br/><br/>It's honest to say that the Iron Man series has gotten a tad bit worse since its start in 2008 with a very promising film that I consider one of Marvel's strongest films to date. Its sequel, while crowded with subplots and characters, still found a way to get its energy and heart in the right place and at least tie things up marginally well by the end of the film. The third film features yet another wonderful performance by Downey Jr., a briskly-paced narrative, and interesting little minor inclusions along the way, but gets too caught up in the sense of its own whimsy and personal delight with its humor. At this point, the fans deserve an ""Iron Man 4"" just for the sole-purpose of optimism that it will be better, more efficient than the two sequels we got.<br/><br/>NOTE: My video review of Iron Man 3, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqz0INZADww <br/><br/>Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Rebecca Hall. Directed by: Shane Black."
"homiep87","3","3","7","5 May 2013"," Why? Just why? :(
","I can't believe what I saw tonight. I went and saw the highly anticipated Iron Man 3 directed by Shane Black. I'll start this review off by saying ""Marvel, what was going through your mind when you were making this film?"" I was so disappointed by this film, it wasn't even funny. I am just in shock, by this movie. How did something so good, become something so bad?<br/><br/>Story: The story follows Tony Stark after the events of The Avengers. Tony is having issues dealing with what he has been through, and the movie shows him dealing with these issues quite well. Unfortunately this is probably the best part about this story. Now if you're a comic book fan, you probably know of the Extremis story. If not, then this story will seem very fresh and interesting to you. Iron Man 3 has a hard time following this beloved Iron Man story, but I'm actually okay with that. I understand that movies are different from the source material and they must put their own spin of things. The movie goes along and gives some plot twist (one of which I will go into more detail down below). These twists can make the story interesting if you aren't familiar with the source material, but the movie still feels like it has a hard time deciding whether it wants to be funny or be full of action. For me this story was horribly disappointing. There was so much that could have been done with the source material that they just decided not to do, but that isn't where I have an issue with this film.<br/><br/>Acting: Again Robert Downey Jr. does a fantastic job playing Tony Stark. He really brings life into the character, and he is just fit for the part. Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin was a great choice for the role, but the story prevents it from becoming memorable. Guy Pierce was actually very good in this film. He picked up the slack for the other characters who were just okay.<br/><br/>What I have against this film: *SPOILERS* The main villain in this movie in this movie is....not the Mandarin? It's actually Guy Pierce's character. Now this wouldn't bother me, if the Mandarin actually did something in this film. But no. He is a complete joke and Iron Man fans who have read the comics will feel like they were just stabbed in the back by Marvel. I'm not even a big Iron Man fan, but I knew about this story and that the Mandarin is his arch nemesis. Why then does his arch nemesis do nothing in this film?! He is supposed to have all these powers, and is pretty much a super terrorist, but nothing happens. It was so disappointing, I wanted to cry. I have never been so let down by a movie in all my life. Now I didn't have the highest expectations for this movie after seeing Iron Man 2 (which I liked, just not as much as the first one). I was looking forward to seeing what they would do with this villain and story line, and what they did was almost criminal. I really hope Marvel looks at the feedback of these reviews and sees that they messed up. They need to stick closer to the source material so stories like this aren't ruined for their #1 customers. I don't think they need to follow the source material word for word, but they shouldn't have changed it as much as they did.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I came into this movie with some fairly high hopes. The story looked amazing, and they had a great villain, but none of this mattered in the end. I was let down by this film and by Marvel. I don't understand how they could get something like the Avengers so right and get this movie wrong. I am terribly disappointed by this movie, and I really can't recommend it to anyone who has read an Iron Man comic or knows of Iron Man stories. Marvel has a lot of apologizing to do after this. Such a sad night."
"arndt-sayer","5","3","7","4 May 2013"," The good, the bad, and the mandarin
","Let me start out that I love what Marvel studios had done with their movies. I loved phase one, with their crowning moment in the Avengers. I was super excited to see Iron Man 3, because I enjoyed all the others. The movie starts out with a flashback scene, which was different, but flashbacks are never ideal. I liked the acting of the cast, there was some very funny parts that made me laugh very hard, but I had to realize that I was watching a Iron Man movie not a slap stick comedy. The scenes with the boy and RDJ where enjoyable, Harley held his own, but it didn't really help the plot, if there was one. I was excited to see the mandarin with his ten rings and Iron man in an all out battle, but to my disappointment the mandarin was a scam, just an actor named Trevor, oh Ben Kingsley you could have done better. The role was so pointless they could have given it to Stan Lee for his cameo. The movie was hard to connect with, I left the movie theater disappointed."
"boadcox","3","3","7","4 May 2013"," The best part of this movie was the trailer...
","I don't think I have ever been as disappointed with a film as I was with this one. Talk about an epic failure on all fronts. The plot was a disjointed mess, and it appears the filmmakers involved took all of the things that worked in the previous Marvel Universe films and threw them out. From watching the trailer, I felt this was a sure fire winner. However, the trailer is about as good as it got and the story contained in the film was nothing like what was advertised. Cringe inducing comedy, bad direction, and poorly thought out plot choices can only lead to an extremely underwhelming and disappointing third effort in the Iron Man franchise. I hope this stands as a fluke and doesn't foreshadow what's to come with the rest of Marvel's Phase 2. If so, let me off on the next stop. I'd need a lobotomy to survive the hours of torture they would have in store for me."
"supersayain90","3","3","7","4 May 2013"," Oh. Dear. God
","IMDb - Long time follower - first time review.<br/><br/>I watched Iron Man 3 last night and as I sat down in the plush leather seats of the largest cinema Melbourne had to offer, I was feeling a tingle of excitement. Following the Avengers I was amping for some cross-movie character goodness, not to mention seeing Iron Man battle it out against the Mandarin.<br/><br/>Things started out semi OK. The Mandarin was sending out terrorist threats at a fast pace - these threats mimicking real world philosophies and politics (clever, I thought). Then it got to about halfway through the film and I was wondering ""when is something going to actually happen?"", or more importantly ""when is Ironman going to do something cool - like he did in the first film when a tank fired at him, he dodged it, sent a tiny projectile in return and then turned his back and started walking away with the knowledge already that the tanks ass was grass, and he just mowed it"". Come on, that scene was dope.<br/><br/>Instead we get Pepper Pots - who once was a PA in a short skirt, now discussing weaponisable genetic therapies with a greasy businessman. (What are her credentials?). We get a dude that blows up half of Hollywood because he gets too hot. Why he gets too hot is not explained (yes I realise it is because of this extremis project - but why they have the power of lava inside them is beyond me. I thought it was meant to be for regeneration???). We get Tony stark making a mockery of why he is even Ironman, because he can just control the suits from any desirable location. Does this not destroy the whole idea of Ironman? We also get the Ironman suit falling apart in nearly every scene. I thought the suit was capable of more than this, and surely if you have 50 suits then you must be unstoppable - even by superhero standards. We get a laughable joke of the Mandarin. A lot of people have already commented on this so I wont proceed further. And finally we get every god damn person being able to control the suit almost willy nilly. It took Stark ages in the first film to tweak the suit and train in it, then all of a sudden, Pepper Pots and bloody Guy Pearce can fly around and crash to the earth, knee first no less, as if it was as simple as operating an iPod. As for Guy Pearce breathing fire - I literally cried.<br/><br/>My head was in my hands at the end of it. Where was Thor, or Cap or even Hawkeye - someone from Avengers that could even stop by and help for a second before explaining they have their own s%*# to do. Wasn't this meant to be a phase two film taking into account the events of the Avengers? Actually - while we are on that - why didn't War Machine show up in the avengers, if only for a short while? They had aliens laying waste to New York City and where was he? Isn't he meant to be the Presidents' right hand man? The after credits scene summed up the movie entirely - lame and pointless. Everyone will go watch this film because this is how they are marketed, and unfortunately, the poor social state of the world just packs these theaters out with people too stupid to see the wood through the trees. Unfortunately, through sheer hope, I had become one of them. Well no longer! I was left with a foul taste at the end of TDKR, and after this my mouth is even fouler. These films need to be better. The Dark Knight was exceptional - why can this not be achieved elsewhere? They have the money for it, and any resource they can command.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend not watching it - but who I am to stop the tidal wave of crap that is currently being produced.<br/><br/>P.S. Dredd ruled. Hard hitting, true to the comics, gory. And that film bombed??? What is this world coming to?"
"ehent","1","3","7","4 May 2013"," My simple complaint...
","Ben Kingsley was why I wanted to see the movie. Maybe that was my mistake. I thought this was going to be a villain driven movie. Where the villain was so charismatic and powerful that for a second you thought somehow he would win. Kinglsey has the ability to pull that off. Kingsley's voice in the previews had me so excited for his interpretation of the Mandarin. I'd simply have preferred no strange twist where Kinglsey wasn't an over-the-top, British, stereotypical wimp. That alone would have made the movie somewhat more tolerable. You don't waste a talent like that. Surely a shame.<br/><br/>Second point, the comedy. The preview needs to match the movie's direction. I don't want to be led to see one type of movie, and then see something way out of left field of what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting something super dark, but I also wasn't expecting an over-the-top, cheesy comedy bit. I did think there would be a lack of action compared to the first two, but not to be filled with so much cheap humor. I felt very mislead. Mislead to the point where I still feel like I haven't seen the movie from the preview. I didn't hate Iron Man 3. I just don't really feel like I've even seen it."
"zurnd","10","3","7","3 May 2013"," THE IRON MAN Christmas SPECIAL
","I was actually surprised that this film took place around the holiday season, similar to Batman Returns before it. But if you think the yuletide setting is enough to spoil this film, think again. Iron Man 3 is the best of the Iron Man trilogy and had a lot of elements that were even better than The Avengers. The first Iron Man was great, the second was a tad better (at least in my opinion), but the third just drove the nail further into the wood and not only gave us amazing action and suspense, but profound character development and soul as well. This is the darkest Iron Man flick and it's even a little jarring at times, but at the end of the day, Iron Man 3 is the perfect balance of humor, horror, suspense and overall excitement. It's a film any superhero buff would like, despite the tweaks and changes that were made to some characters that may get under hardcore comic gurus' skin. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. gives his best performance as Tony Stark in this film. He is still just as sarcastic and hilarious as ever, but in this film, we see his character go to a level we've never seen him at before. At the film's start, we see him torn apart and reclusive after the events of The Avengers and obsessed with building suit after suit. He has some of his best moments and some of the film's best lines, but his character is much more serious and dramatized this time around and he comes off as a tragic hero in many ways. He's a lot like Christian Bale's Batman, a determined, yet tortured hero that is deeply effected by the terrible events that unfold. Luckily, his character comes out of his shell towards the end of the film and, you guessed it, he saves the day. Big surprise.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, but instead of being the clueless damsel she was in the previous films, she contributes to the action and even takes part in the film's climax. I liked seeing the feisty and rough side of her character and the fact that she takes out the main villain at the end makes her character as solid as a statue. Don Cheadle comes back as James Rhodes from Iron Man 2, this time around sporting red, white and blue armor instead of the classic War Machine silver and black. I'm not the biggest fan of Don Cheadle, but he's a decent actor and really shows his acting capabilities in this flick. He also delivers one of the film's best lines (""That's your department""). But the actor who steals the show, at least in my opinion is Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin. Holy cow, what a great adversary this is! I won't give too much away about his character, but let's just say that your jaw will drop once you discover a pivotal twist about him. One minute, he can be as terrifying as the Devil in The Exorcist, the next minute, he's a cheerful, quirky jokester with a love of soccer games on the television. Ben Kingsley really let it all out as the Mandarin, and he's one of the movie's most memorable players. <br/><br/>But the movie really shines in the action department. This had the best action out of any other Iron Man film and in some areas, it had better action than The Avengers. I really liked the scenes where Tony went up against the explosive Extremis Soldiers and rescued all the senators from a desecrated aircraft in his Mark 47 armor. And the final scene involving all of Tony's different suits was one of the best scenes ever executed in a Marvel movie. Seeing Tony constantly switching suits and at one point, leaping into one as it soared through the sky, it really puts gas in your stomach and you really wish you could go out there and jump into a suit of armor yourself. The final fight against the Mandarin was also dazzling as you see the villain use his Extremis abilities to the fullest. It's also worth mentioning that Guy Pearce gives a slick, yet malevolent performance as Aldrich Killian and a brief appearance from a fellow Avenger in the after credits scene really makes the film come full circle. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is one of the best films of the year. Hopefully, with upcoming films like Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, Marvel and Disney continue to give us high quality adventures that take us into alternate realms and send us on thrilling, chilling rides of exhilaration."
"Laureado","6","3","7","26 April 2013"," A great summer movie , but that,s it!!
","It is such a Shane that mi first review is about this movie, i was expecting something out of this world, i mean Shane black as cult director and someone who i believe was not going to allow Disney to wash down the script to ""make it safer for a general audience"" but that is what really happens, the tecnical side is amazing the suits are great and despite everything Robert jr handles his character as always , despite flaws in the script like going hand to hand without armor to a complex full of terrorists; taking everyone down and finally facing down ""the mandarin"" without a scratch ""why"" because iam iron man!! Come on , other thing is they don't allow the characters to grow more, do to a excessive need of the director to squish in a punch line every two seconds, the post traumatic disorder that tony is going through feels real the first time,but that is!! Other thing is the way iron man is investigating the origin of the explosions !! How is possible that you own a multinational empire and you just happen to have incriminating videos of your experiments on your data base waiting to be hack !! Specially now when the world has ""change and people like stark who are genius"" can do this so easily, but as i said it is just a summer movie!! So go enjoy it and don't think too much about it."
"Fanboy218","7","3","7","26 April 2013"," You know that good feeling you get after watching a great movie? You won't get that by watching this
","I have been a fan of the first Iron man film. Even though the second film was an absolute let down, I still had hopes for the third one. <br/><br/>The change of the director made me even more excited to see something fresh from this movie. But after a quite long wait, this movie turned out to be a quite disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the new director DID gave a fresh new feel of the movie, and the jokes are the funniest of all three films in the franchise. <br/><br/>Despite of all the plot holes, this movie is just not satisfying. The first 60 minutes was quite amazing and made me think for a moment that this is one of the best superhero movies, but this movie turned out to be just another boring-full of action superhero movie. The visual effects and action are amazing, but it turned out to be too much and quite boring. <br/><br/>The jokes and funny scenes did save the movie, without all that the movie would just be a train wreck. The movie was quite intense, but it's also quite predictable. <br/><br/>All the things were just so easy for Tony Stark and we won't be worry about nothing. All the suits are getting too much, and many many part of the movie is just nonsense. <br/><br/>What ruined the movie most is the villain. (SPOILERS!) Ben Kingsley as Mandarin should've been the main villain, but instead they add a plot twist of Mandarin is just the actor and the villain is Guy Pearce. Guy Pearce didn't really do a good job.<br/><br/>Even though this movie was far from satisfying, it's still slightly better than the 2nd Iron man. Well of course the first movie was far better than this."
"annie421","9","7","23","26 April 2013"," I liked it
","Look as with any movie based off of something, this might have its detractors. I get that. But if I were to rate it on its own, it accomplished its mission. It was loud, it was awesome and most of all it had heart.<br/><br/>After the events of the Avengers, Tony Stark is rattled. This is a guy who's made billions on sheer genius and guts and he had to face something, including near death, that he didn't understand. So to have that PTSD tied in with the plot line of the movie makes sense to me. Protecting Pepper Potts by creating a bazillion suits but almost losing Pepper emotionally because of the suits was an interesting dilemma to play at as well. <br/><br/>The reason I liked it? well other than the awesomeness of RDJ, this movie had little bits, little touches that I think are missing in a lot of superhero movies these days. 1. ingenuity- what made the first movie great and this one as well, is that Tony Stark is a genius and when he has all the glitz around him, its easy to forget that. But this movie showcased some of that great mind and great heart (despite all his snark to contradict him) to prov it. 2. Heart- If you're familiar at all with The Iron Giant... man this movie has some callbacks to the 1999 gem that I just loved. If you haven't seen it, I would definitely recommend it. 3. Happy Hogan- I liked that Jon Farverau (sp?) decided to still play happy despite not being in the director's chair. He had some great moments and the truth is even if he's only the bodyguard/driver he's one of those people that helps Tony stay human, if that makes sense. plus he's a fan of one of my favorite shows. :) 4. Ben Kingsley- the man is awesome. 5. Pepper Potts- Her character isn't just a damsel in distress but that doesn't stop her from being any less Pepper. 6. The scene in the trailer with all the suits- just as awesome as imagined. <br/><br/>There are a few things that I can see why people don't like it 1. Unless you've been heavily involved in the whole of the marvel universe, its kind of easy to get lost watching this. Not so much like the Harry Potter movies where you can't just pick it up and get it, but there are still some moments where it would help to know and see the previous films. I mean yeah the end credits help by giving you an overview but still, it could be a bit of a detractor 2. Like I mentioned before, if you are a superfan of the comics, you might not like how some of your beloved characters are portrayed. I mean there are certainly things I would have liked to have seen, but I get why the filmmakers went this route, and I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>All in all I think it was a vast improvement over Iron Man 2 and a good way to close the trilogy, if that's the plan. I mean after avengers 2 they could find someone else buttt this last one sets a pretty high bar. Watch it, enjoy it and please get that this is a superhero movie, thats what was set out to be made, nothing more nothing less. :)"

","Marvel has set itself really high standards after The Avengers. So this Ironman had to deliver and it had to be better than its prequels and it does so in style. This is another visual-treat and of course has a strong storyline. This time its more serious, more powerful and there's the crude humor when you are least expecting it.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is that this shows the sensitive side of Tony Stark along with his attitude. You'll connect to him as a common man's superhero too. The action is amazing and we get to see RDJ performing many stunts without the suit too. To get the full satisfaction of this do watch the trailer before you see the movie. That's something you really should do.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr of course walks away with accolades for his masterful performance. Bring out crude humor and spares no one with his witful sarcasm. Gwyneth Paltrow is hot n great. Guy Pearce does well. Jon Favreau makes an impact in his little role. Ben Kingsley is a class act and Don Cheadle also doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Its a complete entertainer with rich visual effects and also intelligent with a strong story line. Don't miss this. Don't."

","I don't know why I continue to think that any sequel let alone the sequel to a superhero movie will be any good...This movie is complete trash. Robert Downey Junior is not funny anymore...at all. When he calls the kid a ""pussy"" after the kid says his dad left him, I almost turned the movie off...I'm not easily offended but that just seemed to be in very poor taste (and the movie wasn't going anywhere anyways). Being that I was in an Iron Man mood, I decided to brush it off and watch some awesome Iron Man action...oh wait...there was none. All the ""other Iron Man suits"" the film promised were boring...Nothing more than a gimmick to try and hold up the crap script. I'm usually VERY lenient when it comes to action films...I don't let a lot of clichés, bad dialogue, or bad plot deter me, but it was almost sickening here. I think it might also have to do with the fact that this movie made a TON of money...who in their right minds would shell out a theater admission price to the theaters for this garbage?? I felt conned in paying the $1 for my redbox viewing for pete's sake! HELL, illegally downloading this stinkfest isn't even worth the space on your hard drive! I sincerely hope they abandon the whole Iron Man series because it really should have stopped after #2...and that is reaching. Shane Black sure has fallen a long way since ""Lethal Weapon..."" Holy sh!t this is bad."

","There was a quote I heard in a show or movie or something once.. ""your only as good as your last show.."" With that in mind I must say I am seriously disappointed with Ironman 3 .. it was no where near as good as the first 2 were. I honestly feel that any money that this movie makes will be because of the movies before it.. and not because of its own merits.. I paid to see the first 2 Ironman movies in theatre 3 times.. and I did the same with Thor and Avengers, but this one was what can only be described as an epic failure. I actually kinda regret paying to see it in theatre.. I should have just waited for pay per view or something.. It was no where in the same realm or class of the other movies I named here.. the story line was weak, the characters had no passion or chemistry.. tony stark seemed like an empty shell.. we have seen that character face his mortality several times yet never once did it shake him. And where was shield when all this was going on.. the whole thing just made no sense.. all of this I might have been willing to accept if they had at least gotten The Mandarin right but they dropped the ball on that too.. in the comics The Mandarin is portrayed as a genius scientist and a skilled martial artist. However, his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger. Not one part of this was portrayed in the movie.. instead they made The Mandarin just another genetically enhanced moron with delusions of grandeur, all in all this is the is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It was just a disappointing all the way around."

Go watch it. Don't be miss led, everyone is saying ""ohh yeah there is great action, twists and turns, visual effects are amazing, weakness, overcoming adversity, lots of Robert Downey Jr."" But that's why you go to a Film. If they put the comic on the screen you be like I feel like it was missing something.

","I recently saw this in Imax 3D and was not disappointed. This film engages you the very way the other films do not. It keeps you intrigued and wrapped up in its storyline. The plot is enough to demand and be worthy of your attention. I think the acting is great too and smartly casted. Downey is his usual charismatic, non self-effacing hero self. He brings more to his Iron Man portrayal here then in past portrayals. He has more fun with the character and we have more fun watching him. It pulls the viewers in more when he is having as much of a good time with the role as he is in this installment. Pearce as Aldrich Killian really sinks his teeth into the role I have to say I was impressed and even more impressed with Bettany as Jarvis. Bettany really nailed the performance and I think held his own in the film as far as the bad guys go. I think the special effects were spot on and overall this is a thrill ride well worthy of the hype it's been receiving."

"lee_ross_1996","8","4","11","3 May 2013"," Amazing: I don't see why people are complaning!
","Iron Man 3 is part Sci-fi, action, adventure as well as being amalgamated with conventions of romance between Tony and Pepper, and some elements of humour too. The humour in the films was amazingly funny at times, and there was continuous laughter throughout the film. The film's spectacle is outstanding, it's one of the best CGI science fiction films I have seen. There are more suits that ever before that can be controlled without a human having to be inside the suit. When I went I watched it in 3D and it was easily one of the best 3D films I have ever seen and it will be hard to be topped. But I believe it would still be an outstanding film if it was to be soon it 2D. Overall I think that you should all go and watch it, you won't regret it."
"divncom","7","4","11","25 April 2013"," Brings the action; lacks the depth. Ironman's getting rusty.
","Analysis of the film's pro's and con's.<br/><br/>Pro's: <br/><br/>1. The action sequences were beautiful. The final battle on the ship was very nice; the way it ebbed and flowed was very well done. Real suspense was built which shouldn't be taken for granted as that's very difficult to do when you basically KNOW Ironman won't die.<br/><br/>The appearance of Ironman's ""back up"" was a stroke of genius also. It's too bad we couldn't get more into his ability to control suits remotely. I felt like we had just begun to touch the tip of the iceberg in regard to the vast potential technology. <br/><br/>2. Robert D. J. is always good ... he's authentic. What more can I say about him; he loves the character he's playing and there's never a moment you see him phoning his performance in. I get the feeling he reads the books, knows the source material, etc. Genuinely loves the character. <br/><br/>3. Ben Kingsley was wonderful - absolutely taken by surprise by him in this film and he's hilarious. I really felt like he stole every scene he was in. Original, creative - that entire angle was innovative. <br/><br/>4. We may be seeing the groundwork for the future of Ironman - he ends the film with an interesting dialogue which can be construed in a number of ways. I was hoping it indicated it was going to continue following the story arc of the comic book (he and the AI merging). <br/><br/>5. Don Cheadle is a gifted actor and he actually DOES have chemistry with RDJ (you could envision them being good friends). This entire angle was poorly explored in favor of more and more of Pepper. Ugh<br/><br/>6. Innovative use of the technology behind the suits - we're really beginning to see the fuller Ironman technology/potential take some shape. The way the suits merged, reconfigured, had an almost independent intelligence was impressive and creative. We all go to the movie to see the suit and it doesn't disappoint. Tony is all about technology and they made sure to drive it home. <br/><br/>Con's: <br/><br/>1. Weak villain. The most important villain in the Ironman world was presented in a very poor way. Some effort was done to provide background and motivation at the beginning of the film but it was fleeting and superficial (he got embarrassed). This doesn't explain his desire for unfettered violence and vengeance. It's a weak presentation, derivative and boring. <br/><br/>I'm saying this in spite of being a huge Guy Pearce fan. He's a tremendous actor. <br/><br/>Villains are more interesting when they have a complex personality and REAL motivation (grey area). One good example of this is the Joker in TDK - his philosophy was palpable and believable; you could BELIEVE someone might live this way. <br/><br/>2. Lack of explanation of the source of the villains power/technology. We're introduced to him as he demonstrates some technology for pepper. It's extremely vague, though, and the notion of controlling the brain didn't exactly explain people regenerating body parts, breathing fire and tearing iron man's suits apart like paper. <br/><br/>3. G. Paltrow/Pepper Potts. It's difficult to believe Paltrow reads or is even vaguely familiar with Ironman. Never get the feeling she enjoys the role or even knows anything about her character. <br/><br/>She's meant to be spritely, ingenious in her own way, etc. She doesn't convey it. It goes so far sometimes that you seriously can NOT take their relationship seriously; total lack of chemistry. This is sad because a massive amount of the film relies on their relationship. <br/><br/>I can't convey it thoroughly enough the extent to which I think she drove this movie into the ground. <br/><br/>4. The PTSD angle. The root of this film was meant to be RDJ fighting his ""demons"". Alright - so he has PTSD from flying a NUKE INTO A WORMHOLE. The director did not sufficiently justify this angle with an appropriate amount of attention – comes off as bizarre. <br/><br/>5. Ironman's suits being tore apart like paper by fire breathing dragon people. <br/><br/>6. Warmachine/Iron Patriot may have well have not even been in the film. Was waiting to see him kick some butt in his suit. Disappointing. <br/><br/>7. A lack of the presence of the other Avengers in any regard. Yes yes I know the explanation is they're off doing other things ... still. A brief appearance, a shot of them doing whatever it is they're doing would really help to weave this universe together. <br/><br/>This film was much more engaging than Ironman 2 but was not as good as the first film. There are definite signs of wear and tear on many of the films more ""relied upon"" imagery and themes. <br/><br/>Paltrow's character was relied upon HEAVILY in this film and I discovered it was an extreme turn off. I found her repulsive and thus I could not empathize with Tony's excessive motivation to go to any length to protect her (which was the basic premise of the film). <br/><br/>The other important aspect of any comic book film is the villain. Believe it or not I found Loki to be the more compelling villain than this version of the Mandarin. He has no real motivation or philosophy; he's just ""getting"" people back. <br/><br/>The third leg then is RDJ himself. He succeeded mostly - unfortunately the fact that he constantly relies on Pepper as his supposed source of emotional stability and motivation is not believable. <br/><br/>The action sequences were superior to the previous two films so if you're going to the movie for that you'll be rewarded. <br/><br/>I recommend the film but I can't talk about it in as effusive a manner as some others have."

","When it was announced in 2009 that Disney had acquired Marvel for $4 billion
I thought ""Wow! Did they really need to, though?"" Well, when The Avengers came out as the first Marvel film distributed by Disney, I was blown away! I thought, ""Wow! I can't wait to see what they do with Iron Man 3 next year."" Fast forward to May 3, 2013. I'm in a sold out show of Iron Man 3, and I'm giddier than a nerd at Comic-con. (Compliment, because I consider myself a nerd too. So no offense meant fellow nerds.) What's the first thing I hear when the movie starts?A voice over narration by Tony Stark himself. Then something amazing happens. As the opening credits roll, I hear Eiffel 65's ""I'm Blue (Da Ba Dee).""
I have to cover my mouth to keep from cheering. Then it's awesome action scene after awesome action scene. I leave the theater so excited I can't sleep that night. And yes, I did see the scene after the credits, because, to misquote a famous Lord of the Rings character ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits."" (Tell that to half my theater though.) The basic plot of the film is this. Tony Stark needs to figure out how to balance out his life as Iron Man, and spending time with Pepper, while defeating the new menace called The Mandarin. I think Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely brilliant in this, but man that precocious ten year old kid whose name I forget, really stole the show. And now I hear he's signed on for 3 more Marvel movies, which he hasn't revealed yet. Awesome!

","I like the action sequences (Although the different suits got misused and the ending could've been even better, showing a greater differentiation between the Armors).
I think Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall did a great job to elevate a terrible story/script.
That's all the good on this movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the acting was terrible.
Downey Jr was awful because this movie required more than the one note that he nails like few ever (cocky-funny).
The script was awful; the pace terrible, with an incredible boring middle of the movie to show ""the superhero without the suit"", including cheesy acting/dialogue. It looked like an early 90's movie... in 2010's. Also the twist sucked and made a mockery of the little tension the movie could've built.<br/><br/>Last point. Like Age of Ultron, they throw a gazillion of terrible jokes and one-liners and they only work when they refer to Tony and Peppers relationship.<br/><br/>The movie is so bad, that even making almost Avengers movie type of money, it ended Iron Man's franchise movies."
"seannasuti","9","2","4","17 April 2017"," Perhaps the most under-appreciated film in the entire MCU
","Well, we all know the big deal behind 'Iron Man 3'. Fresh off 'The Avengers', the third installment of the 'Iron Man' trilogy helped kick off Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a big way, becoming the second MCU film to gross over one billion.<br/><br/>However, it ended up attracting some major controversy due to its big bait-and-switch. Originally, we were led to believe that Ben Kingsley's character was the infamous terrorist 'The Mandarin'. However, as it turns out, he's nothing more than just a drunken British actor named Trevor Slattery while his employer, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), serves as the true villain of the film.<br/><br/>This reveal attracted some major flak from comic fans for being a major deviation from the comics. And yet, I'd argue it actually worked from a story perspective. First of all, it's probably for the best that they didn't go the route of the comics and just have 'The Mandarin' because of the character's racist portrayal in the comics. Plus, Killian's villainous plot is steeped in modern day sensibilities regarding terrorism, making him one of the most layered villains in the MCU's library of generally maligned villains... and therefore, one of the franchise's best. <br/><br/>The rest of the film is another enjoyable outing in the MCU with great action sequences and hilarious dialogue courtesy of director Shane Black. In a time when many argued the MCU limited the creative control of their directors, 'Iron Man 3' is one of the most unique entries in the genre (e.g. set at Christmas, a Shane Black trademark). It doesn't have much of the main hero in his suit but it allows for Tony Stark to utilize his other talents, proving that the suit does not make the man. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. gives one of the best performances he's ever done in the role of Tony Stark. <br/><br/>In short, 'Iron Man 3' is definitely an underrated entry in the MCU. Simply put, the twist worked, people."
"taggard-98527","6","2","4","16 April 2016"," The fallout from The Avengers lands squarely on Tony Stark.
","The interesting - Marvel kicked off Phase 2 with a decided switch in tone and character. Iron Man 3 is less of a superhero movie and more of a psychological detective thriller, and we will see this genre-bending throughout the movies of Phase 3. T he good - RDJ is still Tony Stark, and just watching him grow the character, dealing with the events of The Battle of New York, is worth the price of admission. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to be great as Pepper Potts, and (with very few exceptions) Pepper and Tony's relationship continues to be believable.<br/><br/>The great - I loved seeing Pepper suit up in some armor, if only for a moment, and I also like the strong female characters in the film. I believe this might be the first MCU property that passes the Bechdel Test.<br/><br/>The problems - I don't totally buy Pepper being so angry at Tony and this bugged me. The whole ""twist"" didn't really work for me. I missed Jon Favreau's lighter take on the Iron Man universe of Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This Tony is a much less fun Tony, and while I get why (Tony is realizing it is a much less fun world he lives in), I still miss fun Tony.<br/><br/>Summary - I enjoyed this movie, but find it one of my least favorite of the MCU. It lacked much of the charm of the first two Iron Man movies. I don't mean to pan it in any way, but it will certainly be a while before I throw this one on."

","The first Iron Man was great. The second was pretty good, this is in the dirt unless you like the cartoon humour. Personally, I don't like seeing people bounce around like they do in animation. It's a film with people, it needs to have ground rules.<br/><br/>Also, the story line is very weak. It's like they tried to make a sequel but they didn't know what they were doing and improvised a half chewed script. There is no depth or complexities to the story. They had one goal and that was doing something with Iron and and his girlfriend. I won't spoil it for you, in case you still want to watch it.

About half of the jokes fall and each interaction with that stupid little kid is just painful. Plus the fact that Pepper Potts is the one who ultimately defeats Aldrich ""The Real Mandarin"" Killian is the worst finale ever along with destroying all of his suits and getting a procedure (which he could have gotten done in the first movie) to remove the shrapnel is asinine because everyone knows he's going to be back in Avengers 2. <br/><br/>Finally how does Captain America not show up when the god damn president gets kidnapped by a terrorist?

"tharnax","Null","2","4","24 August 2014"," More CGI than quality movie...
","'Iron Man 3' is a classic example of what happens when you attempt to make lightning strike in the same place thrice: it doesn't quite work. There have been few casting decisions in the last 20 years of cinema as perfect as the pick of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (a.k.a Iron Man). Iron Man 3 reminds us of this miracle every time RDJ is on-screen; the billion-dollar franchise depends on him and his great skill at playing this witty, ingenuous billionaire-turned-superhero. The original 'Iron Man' film benefited from a great script that chronicled Tony Stark's transformation into his Iron Man persona. That first film was a smash hit for those 2 reasons: Great script and great lead actor. Now we must subtract the great script for both 'Iron Man 2' and 'Iron Man 3' which leaves only the great actor as a character that we really enjoy. These are mediocre stories compared with the first film, however they are enjoyable due to the action and RDJ's performances. The anticipation for this movie was also amped way up after the incredible 'Avengers' movie, which also benefited from both Downey and an amazing script. That brings us to 'Iron Man 3' which has 'Corporate Meddling' written all over it. I'm not sure exactly why, but highly anticipated blockbusters always tend to be overworked, predictable and drenched in overdone, expensive CGI effects ( Think: Spiderman 3) . Iron Man 3 is such a film with a confused script and a lot of odd ideas for location shooting. By now, Tony Stark has developed his armor in striking ways and with amazing capabilities, so much so that we have little to look forward to in a 4th movie with so many great ideas for the armor crammed into this installment. RDJ keeps us glued to Tony Stark as he carries out an investigation into the terrorist bombings of the Osama Bin Laden-ish villain 'The Mandarin'. The always great Ben Kingsley has a great time with this character and creates a few laughs along the way. Another fine actor, Guy Pierce ( Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo) is completely wasted in his two-dimensional role as mad scientist Aldrich Killian. Many of the sacrifices made by the other actors are simply to make room for Robert Downey Jr. himself. Tony Stark needs a lot of screen time, but the crammed and forced script and plot twists need a lot of screen time also! Mix it all together and it will certainly not match nor suitably follow 'The Avengers' or the original 'Iron Man'. However, there is that cool actor Robert Downey Jr. who seems to miraculously keep us coming back to watch again and again."

","After watching the trailers and reading the reviews for this movie I was extremely excited to see Tony Stark fight with one of the greatest villains Iron Man has ever come face to face with, The Mandarin. Unfortunately the story was completely different, don't get me wrong, I enjoy movies with twists and surprises but Iron Man 3 crossed the line. Don't worry I'm not going to give away any spoilers.<br/><br/>The actors do their jobs well and the visual effects are amazing but the people who worked behind the scenes completely ruined what could have been one of Marvel's greatest movies. It surprised me how much of a success the movie actually was, because usually a movie like this goes straight to DVD. If you would like to know what happens in the movie I would just search it on Google, as it is a faster and won't bore you for 2 hours.<br/><br/>In the past i have really enjoyed Marvel's movies ( especially the first two Iron Man Movies ) as they have a great balance between action and humour but Iron Man 3 takes all of that away turns it into a comedy. I hope this movie is forgotten because to be honest I preferred 'Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer' than this awful embarrassment of a Movie."

","There is a review by 'sirdavidofthecourt' below which has eloquently vented all the rants I'd like to make regarding this film. So, for the sake of consuming time and minimalising the repetition, I'll be summarising my feelings when I sat through this last night.<br/><br/>Whenever I sit through a film, I rely heavily on my impressions and general feelings towards the spectacle. After enjoying the majority of the original 6 'Avenger' movies (of which I felt IM2 was the weakest), I was expecting something better than this. I will grant kudos for the flashbacks to the Avengers in IM3, but instantly burn the respect by the way TS suffers anxiety attacks 'Nam film style throughout, followed by the bearing that these panic fits have no relevance or importance as the movie reaches its climax.<br/><br/>That mini spoiler summarises everything. There's way too much clichéd cinema which has little relevance to the plot being ripped off throughout this movie. There's Short Round from the Indiana Jones movie. Here's Edward Nigma from the Batman film of the '90s. Bye, bye home base, as seen in Xmen 3.<br/><br/>It's all be done before; but throw in some sloppy/not well thought out plot twists you know is coming from the opening flashback (the geek will be a supervillian, the shunned girl his helper), and the tone is set for predictability and rehashes of other not so great movies.<br/><br/>It all boils down to the superficiality of a comic book movie made shiny by 3D. The movie is soulless and devoid of humour. War Machine/Iron Patriot/Rhodes... what a waste. Pepperpot... standard damsel, with a predictable twist. And RDJ... He was bored when shooting this, right? Even his ego was embarrassed by the usual 'in joke about his early career' which made earlier films charming but are no longer amusing considering he's arguably the biggest and richest actor around these days; or so it seems.<br/><br/>After watching this film, it's pretty apparent that my impression of IM3 is not good. The reason can be broke down to the following statement: once again Hollywood has gone for style over substance, as the producers of this movie rehash not only old lines from previous movies, but also rip off and rehash audience tested plots from not so great movies which create a lot of pointless set pieces and plot conflict.<br/><br/>Avoid, unless you're really stuck for a new movie fix. Even then, prepare yourself for flashbacks of every other clichéd and overused set piece you've ever seen."

Tony was going through suits of armor at the rapid rate during the finale. My question is with the large sum of money made off this film, more than doubling what it cost to make, why have they not green lit another one? I know he is going to be in Avengers 2 but I figured they could start moving forward on Iron Man 4 too. Anyone know why they haven't?

That's one of the main reasons I hated this movie so much.<br/><br/>Another reason I hated this movie was in a lot of the scenes with Iron Man Stark wasn't actually in the Suit, he was controlling it from far away... Yea WTF! You would think he was in it then they would show him in a different area controlling the suit. I don't wanna see that, I wanna see Stark in the suit kicking bad guys butts.<br/><br/>Then there's the storyline. Im not gonna go into detail because I would be going on for days, but in short it was horrible. It was so far off from the original story.<br/><br/>In all this was a mess! TOTAL MESS!"

","The movie was great in all but the story caught me by surprise. I loved the action and the special effects but it got me kind of confused about the mandarin villain and seeing Tony Stark blow up all his suits at the end. It was different from the other iron man movies and that was what i liked about it. I was amazed how they tried to relate the avengers to the movie and telling you all that Tony's been through. The iron patriot was a perfect idea to put in this film and seeing Tony with a new iron man suit. It felt pretty intense at some parts of the film and i think that's what made all the difference because the last two films didn't feel as seriously intense as this film. It makes you think at the end Tony doesn't want to be a hero anymore but something tells me he will return. That's definitely making me look forward to the Avengers 2. Overall it was a great movie and especially for Marvel fans."

","Iron Man 3<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>130 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, William Sadler<br/><br/>Director: Shane Black<br/><br/>Plot: Following on from the events depicted in 'Avengers Assemble', Tony Stark has to maintain his relationship with Pepper Potts while fighting a new terrorist called the Mandarin.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: What I like about 'Iron Man 3'is that it doesn't try to be bigger than 'The Avengers'. This film is more a character study of Tony Stark trying to cope in a changed world and of course Downey Jr. completely excels in this role. Stark has to cope with keeping his wife happy while also investigating some terrorist attacks, which obviously don't go together. <br/><br/>And after he tells the whole world his home address it isn't long before he's left on his own trying to save the world with few resources. Through this we get to see more of the man behind the suit and of course he is carrying huge emotional baggage. His opposite number, the Mandarin (played superbly by Sir Ben Kingsley), isn't actually just after Stark but the whole world, which gives the film a more epic sense about it. The rest of the cast therefore, has slightly limited screen time and Don Cheadle's War Machine sadly, has almost no effect on the film whatsoever. <br/><br/>Although he gets some plot choices wrong towards the end and will certainly annoy avid readers of the Iron man comics, special mention must go to Shane Black who hasn't made a film in eight years. He excels in directing the dialogue scenes and the visually brilliant and entertaining action sequences are really something to marvel at. Super stuff!"

","Personally I didn't like any of Ironman movies much, first one was pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Then there was second one that went beyond boundaries mixing all the stuff together so viewer couldn't understand at all. Great effects though.<br/><br/>Then this third one, too much explosions and such boring stuff, too much ideas and all but still... Acting was very good, directing also, mostly I didn't like that it was two hours or something like that.<br/><br/>Very nice ending for trilogy I think. Very much CGI and all but it kind of not bothered me. Well done, maybe little character stuff too much. But liked it somehow, few times I almost slept and there were issues which made movie more watchable.<br/><br/>8/10 for great directing etc. Script didn't quite catch me."

","if you've seen the previous iron man movies this is a must see to the sequels before it. great movie wicked sick action, and as always tony (Robert Downey Jr.) delivered an amazing show with spectacular incitement into the life of playboy, billionaire, and therapist. great movie with thrilling ending. overall Robert made an excellent role come true and aspire but yet again in this re-producing film. in the movie your seen with tony struggling to adapt to his new life after the feature duo film with great role characters Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye, black widow, and God of thunder Thor, known as Avengers. Tony does so with his new suit and new armoured iron men."

","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>Oh, how I loved the first Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Iron Man, the origin story was pretty darn sweet. At the end when Tony Stark announces on public TV he's Iron Man: just awesome. I liked the second Iron Man too. It may not have been as good as the first, but Mickey Rourke was a pretty interesting villain and overall the movie was pretty sweet so all was well.<br/><br/>Oh, how I was looking forward to Iron Man 3. The trailer looked very promising: the Mandarin is a bad-ass villain in the comics and Ben Kingsley seemed to play him very well. How big was my disappointment when the Mandarin didn't turn out how he seemed to be and a very uninspiring other villain - Killian - takes over. No sir, I didn't like it.<br/><br/>There are still some goods. Robert Downey Jr continues to be a great Tony Stark. I can't imagine anyone else playing him. His ability to be an arrogant dick and be totally lovable at the same time is beyond compare. Also, the action and CGI affects are very well done. Furthermore, I liked the way Tony Stark has to reinvent himself after all his suits are destroyed.<br/><br/>But the bads are much more prevalent. Besides the aforementioned stupid plot twist regarding the Mandarin, Iron Man's suits break as if they are made from matchsticks, the arc reactor in his chest is removed with ease (if that's so easy, why didn't he do it in part 2?) and the goal of Killian is quite unclear. I blame the writing.<br/><br/>I hope Iron Man can recoup itself for the next one, but as of now my interest fades."

","I am a big fan of Marvel and have seen all their movies. I enjoyed Iron Man 1 and 2 but this one disappointed me. It looked promising at first but then came the flaws: <br/><br/>The Mandarin wasn't in the whole movie. He just appeared on TV talking about destruction. In the end of the movie they make Aldrich say he is The Mandarin which is stupid because the guy isn't even Asian or have the rings on. Why mess up one of the greatest Iron Man antagonist?<br/><br/>They renamed War Machine to Iron Patriot and made his suit look almost like Captain America's costume. They also didn't have War Machine appear, only Rhodes which bothered me because I was hoping to see Iron Man and War Machine in action.<br/><br/>A majority of the movie didn't even involve Tony in the Iron Man suit. Mostly Tony just shooting guns and making weapons from stuff he got from a hardware store. The movie should have been called Tony Stark.<br/><br/>So if you want to watch it just keep that stuff in mind and don't get your hopes up from the lies the trailer showed you."

"SixPakUnited","7","2","4","26 May 2013"," An overall solid film with some unwelcome plot points
","There is no doubt that there was a lot of excitement leading up to Iron Man 3, but there were also a lot of skeptics due to the change in directors. Jon Favereau, who directed the last two films, has been replaced with Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon one and two, as well as director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Immediately the audience can identify this due to a darker tone and a different style of humor. The humor is very funny yet kind of seems out of place. It's like if there is a build up of exciting or dramatic moments, ending with surprisingly funny situation. One place I believe Iron Man 3 succeeds over the other two films is the supporting characters. To be honest, the supporting cast of the last two films never really had too much impact, it was mostly Tony Stark's show. In this movie I was able to see that Pepper was more influential than ever, being the cause of most of the actions Tony takes, Rodey now is much more of a help to Tony and has a completely different role to play. As this is a new chapter in the franchise expect to see to new characters either helping or hurting Tony Stark, most important, of course, is Guy Pierce's Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. I don't want to tell of Killian's importance to the film, however Ben Kingsley in the film is a different story. Well let's just say based on the material he is given, Kingsley does a very good job. <br/><br/>Now for the plot. Overall the plot is decent Tony Stark is dealing with post-dramatic stress due to the events from The Avengers, he discovers new technology such as the one seen in the trailer where he can manipulate different pieces of the suit individually and send them where he wants, he cannot stop dealing tweaking his suits due to paranoia. This creates a challenge for him along with his new threats. However the plots are also where most of the movie's problems exist. There are some directions they take that you will ignore, or will simply infuriate you. I, personally, was infuriated by some that I feel did not need to happen. The ending to the film is kind of strange, it kind of seemed like one of those endings that say ""we may or may not make another sequel"". However on the bright side, after two films of disappointing end fights, we finally have fight that is satisfying and doesn't last about five minutes (we're looking at you Iron Man 2).<br/><br/>Overall, the movie has a lot of potential, solid performances, solid characters with a plot that sort of bogs the film down. The movie is very enjoyable yet not as good as it could have been. In my opinion, it was still not as good as Iron Man, yet better than Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>My final score: 7/10"
"draharoon","5","2","4","24 May 2013"," 10 legitimate things wrong with the movie
","*** CONTAINS SPOILERS **** <br/><br/>1) How foolish, in the first 10 minutes of the movie he gets his house blown up because he felt like making an open threat and tells his girlfriend that he's sorry for putting her in harms way.<br/><br/>2) Does iron man, the king of technology, have no sophisticated security measures for his house? He used to make weapons of war..<br/><br/>3) He was barely actually iron man through the entire movie, and even when he was, him or his suit failed. He was more like undercover hoodie man.<br/><br/>4) This is Tony Stark, the guy who created iron man in a cave, now the only thing he could make in a shack were some inspector gadget toys to knock out security guards.<br/><br/>5) The mandarin. Simply, what a joke. Started off strong, and should have been maintained.<br/><br/>6) The main evil, those fire zombies, were pretty lame. Also, come on, one touch and they incapacitate iron man? Iron man fought Thor..<br/><br/>7) His girlfriend saves the day!! Because we all came to watch ""Iron Man's Girlfriend 3"" <br/><br/>8) When Pepper ""dies"", he's momentarily devastated followed up by being totally oblivious to what had just occurred.<br/><br/>9) The surgery to get his arc reactor removed? He didn't think about that before? Was it really that easy? When it was killing him in the second movie and when he said that he is cursed with it in Avengers, where was this option then? Medical breakthrough?<br/><br/>10) Don't stay after the credits. You think you should, as a superhero movie tradition. Tony is telling the story of this movie to Dr. Banner who falls asleep in the meanwhile out of boredom.. That's it (though it reveals something about the quality of the movie). It's like they were mocking you for waiting.<br/><br/>Overall, for an iron man fan, this movie was a total let down and offending. There was too much tom and jerry humor at the expense of the main character, who we all want to see in action. It failed to live up to iron man's capturing movies. Seemed like it should have been animated. Otherwise, if there were no expectations involved, the movie was just entertainment."
"ewillm513","5","2","4","23 May 2013"," Meh..
","I have to admit I'm a bit disappointing with Iron Man 3. The trailers made it look like it was going in a much darker direction with the story line, and in some ways it delivered, but the end product has far to many flaws to compare with the original Iron Man movie or even its frequently criticized sequel. The biggest issue I have with this movie is the villain. I went into this movie knowing almost nothing about The Mandarin. If I was a comic book person I probably wouldn't have seen the plot twist which changed the intimidating bad guy into a fraud and an incompetent goofball. But seeing as I had no idea what to expect I saw it coming from a mile away. I personally don't have an issue with this plot twist but I can understand why many fans of the comics do. If someone completely changed a character I cared a lot about in a film adaption I would be upset too. The real problem is that we don't get any compensation for this. The only real replacement we get is Guy Pearce's character. When you promise the Mandarin and all you end up coming up with is Guy Pearce puking up an unconvincing CGI fireball then yeah the fans aren't going to be happy. <br/><br/>I can't say I hate this movie. There were a lot of big laughs especially at the beginning and there was some cool action but I can't help feeling it could have been a lot better. Tony's post dramatic stress was a great idea for a subplot but they could have done so much more with it. I was especially disappointed because I've never seen a superhero movies that deals with something like this before. It's also hard to consider Tony a hero when in the end it's Pepper Potts who saves the day. Tony shows a considerable lack of development in this movie which defeats the purpose of telling a darker story line in the first place. <br/><br/>In short you're probably better off going to see Into Darkness."

","A Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr, brilliant as always) who is having trouble sleeping, experiencing panic attacks, and in therapy? Clearly Ironman found the battle in ""Avengers Assemble"" a tough outing and we have here a more nuanced super-hero narrative. But he can't simply be left to finesse his collection of metallic outfits and enjoy his live-in partner 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow with an amazingly flat stomach for a mother of two) because there are new villains on the rampage. One is uber- terrorist The Mandarin (a wonderful performance from the British Ben Kingsley), another is science entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Australian Guy Pearce who, as in ""Lawless"", exhibits real callousness), while a third is one-time Stark girlfriend Maya Hansen (another Brit in the pleasing shape of Rebecca Hall).<br/><br/>Third time round, Jon Favreau has handed over the directorial reins - but retained his cameo acting role - to Shane Black who is also co-writer (his original profession as in the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise). Also we have the fashionable use of 3D which does not always enhance the production (often the action is too fast to really appreciate the extra dimension). So this is an entertaining, if unoriginal, romp with the requisite action leavened by wry humour.<br/><br/>As with the previous ""Iron Man"" movies, if you sit through endless technical credits, you'll be rewarded with a short extra clip but this time we are not set up for the next segment in the franchise but have an explanation of my therapy allusion. Many franchises sag at the third offering (think ""Alien"" or ""Superman"") but ""Ironman"" is holding up well and, after this extra clip. we are reassured that ""Tony Stark will return"" which is good news."

","Man, this movie sucks. Just so bad. Its just so disappointing that people keep making movies this bad.<br/><br/>spoilers - nothing really, but just being safe. <br/><br/>After spending 3 movies establishing Tony Stark as the King of Cool (V1), they've decided to ""character develop"" him. So here come these panic attacks (V2),....except they're so unbelievable that I found that I was rolling my eyes while sitting in a theatre. If you have to *tell* the audience that you're having a panic attack,... Robery Downey Junior does his best I suppose, but its just not him. And nobody can pull off being the ""King of Cool"" and simultaneously having a panic attack. Just not possible.<br/><br/>And of course, he's having these panic attacks because he has no armour and needs to fight the bad guys,....except by the end of it he's had 50 armours all along but just didn't use them??? Huh? And he has no panic attacks when he should be having them, like when people are shooting at him and he has no armour. No, that wouldn't be cool to see the King of cool cower,...so he's awesome of course. But then when we switch out of action mode into ""character development"" mode, he can tell everyone that he's having a panic attack so that we know what's happening; (all the meanwhile fully maintaining his King of Cool persona,...he's having the coolest panic attack you ever saw).<br/><br/>Then there's the Tony Stark V3 when he's around Rhodney. Well I'm still cool, but now I'm a military dumb-dumb since I'm around 'Rhodney the military guy'. Please ignore the fact that I just kicked a whole platoon's worth of bad guys with only a hand glove and a machine gun because clearly now I don't know the first thing about guns or ammo or shooting,... face-palm.<br/><br/>It just sucked so bad. And then there was bad guy(s). Oh watch out for this one. The ""#2"" bad guy (AIM) had so little substance that it wasn't even funny. At the end of the movie try to figure out what his motivations were. Was he trying to be a rich industrialist? Well he seems to already have infinite wealth and control. Was he trying to get his little science project off the ground? Well, he was pretty much there already. Compare him to Magneto from the X-Men movies or Norman Osborne from the Spider Man movies and that 'character' just comes across as so lame.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like Michael Bay movies this one's for you. More bang! More boom! than the other 2 movies. Spend 5 minutes thinking about the movie after you walk out and it sucks,....bad.<br/><br/>OK SERIOUS SPOILER HERE. ""I'm Iron Man"". ""Does the man make the machine or does the machine make the man"". Well that little catch phrase seems to have wagged the dog. I'm the man, that's why I spent 3/4 of the damn movie running around without armour despite being, you know, and Iron Man movie. And now I'm going to destroy all of my armours because I'm really Tony Stark the man. Except now I'm going to claim ""I'm Iron Man!"" as my last line in the movie. Jeeez. Seriously, run around the whole movie with no suit. Then show us that you have 50 suits. Then destroy them all because you're Tony the man. Then end the movie with ""I'm Iron Man"". Who the hell thought that up. Gawd, Jeeez."

","Iron Man 3 is the typical loud, pointless third chapter in a superhero trilogy. Why oh why do they throw everything but the kitchen sink at you and expect it to work? Especially galling is the writers borrow from the Dark Knight Rises (phew) putting the superhero's alter ego on camera for 70% of the movie. Then there's the business of everybody gets to wear the Iron Man suit, which dilutes and cheapens the whole premise. As soon as the bad guy or his minions smash the armor to the point of non-operation, another suit flies out of the sky and clamps itself to the hero, or the hero's girlfriend, or his buddy, or the paperboy if he's nearby. Finally, the villain is ...well, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it. In the early comics the Mandarin was Iron Man's Luthor or Dr. Doom, his main nemesis. This movie portrayal is an outrage. Even the Stan Lee cameo was not good and over in a blink of an eye. On the plus side, Gwyneth Paltrow is gorgeous."

Then Iron Man 2 came along, and all I could say about that was ""eh"". Everything that the first film did went above and beyond, unlike the second. This is a film in between. What it does well, it does really well, other things are merely passable. Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark. No contest, this man cannot do wrong with this role at all. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle did good for the roles that they had. Ben Kingsley is the highlight of the film, I won't tell you why, but when I think of Iron Man 3 I think of Ben Kingsley. Now, one of the biggest flaws of the film is that while it does have some huge plot twists, (These are really good ones too) one in particular, hilarious when it happened, crashed and burned, when you see it you will know why. It failed. However, it doesn't sacrifice the good in the film. If you saw the Avengers... you probably already saw this one, but if you're a skeptic when it comes to this series, give it a try, it will be worth your while."

","Personally I've found all of the ""Iron man"" movies to be a bit ""Meh!"" But I was looking more forward to this one (Maybe meaning I was more let down by it) after the pure awesomeness that was ""The Avengers."" <br/><br/>All of the action aside, ""The Avengers"" really was Robert Downey Jnrs show. The jokiness he's brought to all of the ""Iron man"" movies so far is the reason so many love them. Although in number 2, the action seemed to take a back seat to make way for way to many gags. Far from what most in the audience wanted. This time around though they've got the balance right. There's plenty of action and the movies sense of humour is firmly intact. So whys it still so so-so? <br/><br/>Here, I personally think the story is a bit of a mess. SPOILERS AHEAD!! (One's that you've probably already heard about) The way its rounding things off as if its the last movie make no sense. They've already set up the ""Marvel cinematic universe"" so that it can go on forever. Why pretend they're finishing up now? And from what I've heard, the way the chief villain has been handled, is a disaster. Even if your only going by what you expected from the trailer, and your not a comic book junky, I think most will be disappointed with the bizarre twist that works its way round the Mandarin character, and the other one played by Guy Pierce. Then there's that ""Iron Patriot"" thing. Wasn't he ""War machine"" in the last movie. Why change that? Characters in the movie even say ""War machine was cooler."" <br/><br/>Despite promise, the whole thing has a ""rush job"" feel to it.

"theredraylives","6","2","4","13 May 2013"," Not just bad, it's insulting
","Iron Man and his alter-ego, billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) are back in a big way after the events of The Avengers, and it's clear Stark feels a little out of place in a world with gods, alien invasions, and Hulks. Captain America's line to Stark in the film: ""Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?"" resonates in Iron Man 3 as Stark seems haunted by his alter-ego and whether or not it defines him. The film sets out to answer this question; it is far more about Tony Stark than it is about Iron Man, so anyone who went into the film expecting the opposite left disappointed. Stark's character arc concludes magnificently in the film, and if this were the only merit on which it were to be judged, it'd be five stars out of five. Sadly, the film that surrounds this wonderful piece of cinema is drowned out by a colossal red herring, throw-away characters, and wasted opportunities. Special mention should also go to Downey Jr, because his portrayal of Stark in this film is his best yet.<br/><br/>One of the biggest gripes about the Iron Man trilogy to date has been its rather bland villains, especially when compared to the likes of Thor or Cap, whose respective villains (Loki and Red Skull) were excellent. Iron Man 3 decided to resolve this problem by doing absolutely nothing to resolve it, by making a hamming-it-up Guy Pearce as the villain we know next to nothing about, and then by pretending- through trailers, marketing, and the film's plot itself- that the main villain was Sir Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. Well into its second hour, the film reveals that The Mandarin is little more than a sideshow- a demon, for the public to focus its hate on- and Killian proudly announces at the end of it all that ""I am the Mandarin!!!"" No, Aldrich, you're not, and the film could've been a lot better had it actually spent time developing your character instead of making you a sniveling crybaby 'cuz Tony didn't come up to the roof to meet you.<br/><br/>The Mandarin- especially with an actor the likes of Kingsley behind him- would be an instant sell. As Iron Man's most-recognizable villain he'd make for great merchandising and was easily promotable as the film's main villain. The real reveal here is the fact that they wrote another terrible, empty suit of a villain who poses no real threat to Stark, and who is about as menacing as a sunburn. The reveal is poorly-timed and adds nothing to the story- Stark's point about ""creating our own demons"" is evident in Killian. It grinds the entire film to a halt to explain the reveal, once from actor portraying him, and then again by Killian. The film does such a bad job of planting this seed that he has to shout it again at the end to make sure the audience gets the twist. After the dismal Iron Man 2, fans deserved better than this, but we got more of the same- sure, Downey Jr. is great as always, but the rest is basically a waste of time. One could argue that the writers were in fact developing Killian the entire time, but they weren't- his Mandarin was a theater act. He had no ideology or reasoning, he simply hated Stark and wanted money.<br/><br/>Essentially, they had Stark's character arc written and they had nothing else to write it to. They wanted Tony to prove he's a hero without his armor on, and he truly was. The audience learns nothing about Killian or his chief lackey, played by James Badge Dale. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) returns as the Iron Patriot, but the film doesn't give him much to do outside of standing around in a big red, white, and blue suit the whole time. The Mandarin turns from menacing super-terrorist to a drunk Ben Kingsley as comic relief, every moment of which just felt like a slap in the face and- again- ground the film to an absolute halt. Speaking of comic relief, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) got way too much screen time. Obsession with security badges? Really? Was any of it supposed to be funny? The only thing that worked about this dreck was Downey Jr. as Stark. He manages to be the glue, and is funny, heroic, and charming all at once. Without him the film would be a colossal disaster.<br/><br/>The film never quite seems to recover after the twist plays off- frankly, Killian is just not as compelling or as menacing as Kingsley, and this is frankly more of a missed opportunity. Their point here was understandable- creating a mysterious, evil figurehead to represent evil, basically in order to frighten people into submission. A chilling point to make in this day and age, but Pearce isn't up to the task, and his Mandarin reveal comes too late in the film for it to carry any weight or substance.<br/><br/>As far as effects, they're good enough, for what they're trying to achieve. There are some great scenes, like Tony trying on his Mark 42 armor for the first time, or his many scenes with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). There is a great deal to like about Iron Man 3, which makes its failings all the more tragic. The action and music are largely forgettable. They throw every brand of armor in the film just because they might as well, who knows if they'll ever make another solo Iron Man film. It feels like they simply had no idea where to take Tony Stark after the success of the first film, and outside of his stint in Avengers, he can't seem to find a good story- or an interesting villain- to save his life."
"MatthewTodd1","6","2","4","13 May 2013"," Iron Man 3: Movie Review
","After marveling at the cinematic brilliance of The Avengers last year, this year's first Marvel release fell incredibly short of anything close to marvelous. Iron Man 3 like much of the glorified suit of armour in the movie is a clanking hollow shell lacking any real body or substance. It sorely suffers from the titanic box office juggernaut Marvel's The Avengers proved to be and evoked overwhelming feelings of underwhelming disappointment and disenchantment upon its culmination. Damaged by a nonsensical antagonist swerve and a superhero over-utilizing his new remote play feature amidst inexcusable plot holes, aimless disjointed sub-plots, far-fetched role reversals and a sense of going through the motions, this Iron Man installment is nothing short of filler, used as a catalyst to fuel the next phase in the ongoing Avengers (revenue) machine.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a superhero movie sequel co-wrote and directed by Shane Black centered on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man; the third installment in the Iron Man film series and the seventh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Set some time after the events of The Avengers, Iron Man 3 picks up with the supercilious genius industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man who is reeling from the alien invasion of New York, which is causing him to suffer prolonged insomnia and anxiety/panic attacks. Unable to curb his restlessness and anxiety he has taken to his workshop where he has built a legion of Iron Man suits, at the same time detaching himself from the outside world consequently creating tension with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Concurrently, the Mandarin, a relentless and merciless terrorist orchestrates a string of bombings that leave behind no distinguishable evidence. Stark stirs from his seclusion and issues a televised threat directly to the Mandarin when his world begins to be torn apart at the seams and those closest to him become embroiled, ultimately leading to him going on a good old fashioned revenge mission with one objective in mind; to take down the Mandarin.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as the brash billionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is at his sardonic best, however, much of the dialogue Downey Jr. professes throughout the film seems on the verge of stand-up comedy rather than the empowering words of a man-made superhero. Also reprising her role as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow, her performance though solid is plagued with an implausible narrative for her character, and the camaraderie between her and Downey Jr. seems forced at times. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of credulous Tony Slattery otherwise known as the Mandarin is good for what it is, and Don Cheadle as the Iron Patriot formerly the War Machine got lost in the narrative somewhat but nevertheless provided a satisfactory performance for the parts and dialogue he was given. On a more positive note, Guy Pearce provided a stellar performance as the unstable scientist Aldrich Killian, a rivaling industrialist to Tony Stark with an underlying resentment for his fledging genius counterpart. Nonetheless, despite a couple of passable performances, notably those of Downey Jr. and Pearce, Iron Man 3 was sorely lacking character portrayals worthy of the audience's time investment.<br/><br/>Shane Black takes over the helm of the Iron Man film series from Jon Favreau after his lackluster Iron Man 2 and teams up with Robert Downey Jr. who he last worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. In hindsight perhaps Iron Man 3 could have been renamed to suit its premise more; Remote Control Iron Man, maybe Pepper Man, possibly even Avengers Hangover, these would all suffice, but How a Rich Man Copes with Seeing Aliens seems to fit best. Too much of Tony Stark's vulnerability was exposed in this movie which diminished the character we have all warmed to, the exuberant larger-than-life billionaire playboy/superhero. By divulging Stark's susceptibility to the strains of life to the extent it has in Iron Man 3 it makes it a lot easier to understand if he were to finally hang up his proverbial boots for good; not a good thing for a superhero film series with unfinished business. In addition to this, there is an underlying disconnect from the outset much like Stark with his beloved iron suit(s) in a significant proportion of this movie, by opting for the sympathy vote it is apparent Black has alienated viewers such as myself who want to see a superhero at the height of their powers overcome evil. By the end the very thing that ties Tony Stark to Iron Man is away with the wind, which is ironically where big-budget filmmaking intelligence went when this movie was produced. Here's hoping the remaining parts of the Avengers machine have not depreciated like its iron core has evidently done.<br/><br/>Even the post-credits sequence connected to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe seemed needless and afforded nothing to entice in terms of reasons to be eager to want to watch the forthcoming Avengers movie or the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. However, ironically the ending cameo encapsulated the essence of the entire Iron Man 3 movie, a psychiatric evaluation of a perturbed superhero.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Iron Man 3 is not a categorical disaster; it packed in enough explosive action and vivacious backdrops into a lengthy 2 hour 15 minute running time to at least be aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. Although when you look behind the niceties there is not much to write home about.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Iron Man 3 is a frantic overblown popcorn flick that lacks any real conviction and can be only described as a damp squib. Like all superhero movies, the superhero is only as good as it's adversary, and in this case the adversary was not worthy. As a stand-alone franchise it's clearly demonstrable that it is suffering, as part of an even bigger picture, Iron Man's appeal is draining with only 5% power and the odds of it reaching maximum altitude again are slim to none."
"Robotvideo","2","2","4","12 May 2013"," The epic film that wasn't
","With the multi-movie build up of man invents machine - man becomes one with machine - machine begins to consume man sequence, and an iconic villain played by a first rate actor, I was prepared for an experience equal to The Dark Knight, or maybe better. Iron Man 3 wasn't that film. Instead, opportunity for profound and gripping face-offs between villain and hero was traded for sitcom oversimplification and scene by scene over played gimmicks. The basic premise had good ideas, but the final product looked like it was edited by a studio executive committee with no understanding of the comic superhero world at all instead of a visionary director.<br/><br/>Iron Man should be a regular guy who, through his own invention, becomes a hero through the power the machine gives him, and as a regular human the task takes it's toll physically and emotionally. The narcissist Tony Stark denies to himself the personal decay and revels in the attention Iron Man brings. The denial doesn't change the fact that the machine is taking over and Tony is falling apart as the role of superhero overwhelms and begins to destroy him. Instead, in Iron Man 3, the script forgets this and trades it for scene-by-scene stunts and uncharacteristic nonsensical decisions by what should be a supra-genius.<br/><br/>Also, the villains in Iron Man should be powerful, but realistic using clever tactics in a battle of intellects when the machines prove equally powerful and battle to a stalemate. Instead, in this film, the many iterations of Iron Man suits are destroyed without discretion, like they are not the brilliantly designed symbolic source of power they are intended to be, but just disposable props. The villain in Iron Man 3 could have been an epic and unsettlingly realistic psychopath with the Mandarin, equal to or greater than Heath Ledger's Joker. Instead, what we got in IM3 was a false villain just pretending to be evil and a real villain with unbelievable powers seemingly made up as the film went along just to be invincible only until the end when it was convenient for him to disappear and the movie to be done.<br/><br/>I can ignore the false villain because the concept could have been brilliant, but it wasn't and made the story a joke. I can accept another villain amped up with some type of power, but not when it is so outrageous and inconsistent that one scene has no relation to the next. Tony should be coming up with a brilliant solution to overcome the villain's power when the brute force of the suit didn't work. For that to happen the villain's power must be consistent and in IM3 there was no consistency at all.<br/><br/>The bottom line on this film is that the Iron Man world is still intact if you ignore IM3, and I think you should."

","Perhaps one of the laws of fiction, is that despite being fiction, the approach of history must be credible, as the magician's trick, plausible before our eyes, impossible within the rational but we want to believe. And Iron Man, a character rescued from lesser known Marvel comic books, is proposed since 2008 the beginning of a saga that draws, in my opinion, so that the contemporary world shows how the ideal or aspirational it to be: a successful playboy , millionaire, eccentric, intelligent and creative character named Tony Stark. The story, from its inception, has developed some traumas of Tony personal conflicts, friendly and loving. The mixture has attractive, its origin is traumatic, Tony Stark, untouchable, suffers an attack, is kidnapped, gets his lesson for being a creator and arms dealer who does not mind the conflicts and deaths caused by their having capitalist participates. Stark underwent surgery with an implant energy that prevents shrapnel it reaches the heart. So goes Iron Man and its sequel. But among the laws of history, in the third installment, Tony Stark attacked by anxiety attack mid-40s, starring many of the sequences of the plot of Iron Man 3 WITHOUT the armor that provides Iron Man, no longer attractive. While this is part of their trauma, the creation of 50 or more Ironmans detracts from the unique, the unusual, the reified in that symbolic element of the representation of the hero, the icon. This is a law of the comic book hero. The second law in failing Iron Man is a character, an icon should not break apart physically. Abused And this film the armor is now decomposed and recomposed and travels through the territory, handled virtually. These dynamic changes in history are slowly draining the movie to a mediocre one third version of the Iron Man comics stories often develop the conflict of man a hero, one who acquires ordinary supernatural powers and becomes unique and exceptional. But mortal man without powers, meritorious connotes building a character that will power, mind, desire for revenge and to do good, it conforms itself by gadgets, cloak, armor, almost supernatural human strength. In his case, the mere mortal strengthened, Batman, given for a unique trilogy of Christopher Nolan, in which, in the end, Bane literally bankrupt and breaks the mask over his face. This collapse is part of history, the rebirth of the hero who runs towards the end of the authentic self, his future, his lost love. But in Iron Man Character decomposition is his undoing. The character is disrupted, then the film falls apart. Tony Stark, meanwhile, strives to move its powers to third parties, Colonel Rhodes, and even the president of the United States of America is dressed in costume. Third Law: the hero is the sole bearer of its symbols, communication image it projects. Even Pepper Pots have acquired powers survives. Part of the drama of Batman in the Dark Knight is the inability to save the life of the alleged love starring Chapter, and understand that the hero's life is sad, complex, and that their condition represents the loss of those he loves. Iron Man, directed to a child audience, possibly care aspects, focuses on the gags, unless permitted darker issues a much more complex and developed as Nolan's Batman"

I'd expect a more complex, secret, dark one instead. It went a bit off reality and it seemed weird, at least.<br/><br/>It's a half action-packed movie. I was expecting more, as a follow up of the Iron Man 2 film.

He still plays it likabley. The other actors do good as well, and though I was angry at first that mandarine was not being played by a Chinese guy at first, the twist ending does make up for it.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","4","3 May 2013"," Downey buoys a script that is - let's face it - kind of dull.
","The best thing about ""Iron Man Three"" is the presence of Robert Downey, Jr. If this trilogy proves anything, it is that Downey's best natural gift is his mouth. He has a rapid-fire speaking manner in which it takes you a second to register what he just said. Like Groucho Marx, his mouth is always ready with a verbal gag almost before he can complete the thought. He is really a wonderful comedian with the ability to mix the comedy with a certain amount of vulnerability. This is a rare and precious gift at a time when most screenplays march their characters through wooden, pedestrian dialogue that only functions to move the characters from one plot development to another. For Downey, it is such a unique gift that, while you're watching Iron Man Three, you realize that he alone is keeping the movie from becoming a crushing bore. By this point (this is his fourth go-around in the role) his verbal gifts are still fresh and have become the buoy to a series that - hate to admit it - is running out of gas.<br/><br/>""Iron Man Three"" is a well-made, skillful action movie - the special effects are convincing, some of the action scenes work, but they are at the service of a plot that is completely canned. Here again is another story of a superhero battling and army of super-villains who want to take over the world while also dealing with domestic issues that no suit of iron will be able to fix.<br/><br/>The suit, for Stark, has become the same prison that it was for Batman, only in Stark's case he has become dependent on it. How does one balance time with the girlfriend and saving the world? He could do this because the public has fallen in love with War Machine, a new Iron Man occupied by Tony's pal James Rhodes (Don Cheadle). This should leave Tony more time to be with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) but she complains that he is spending all his time in the lab building new Iron Man suits.<br/><br/>Domestic bliss is only part of Stark's problem. The latest threat to civilization is someone calling himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an impressive-looking cloaked figure with his own private army that has been committing acts of terrorism on every shore. His private army seems invincible, they attack and walk away unscathed due to new developments in regenerative genetics (don't ask).<br/><br/>Stark goes on television and makes an unbelievably stupid proclamation to The Mandarin and later finds his house under attack and Pepper missing. That's a problem because, while the first movie allowed Tony and Pepper time to develop a sweet romance, this one keeps them apart for most of the film. We're told how much Tony loves her (he narrates the story) but their scenes together are all too brief.<br/><br/>The presence of The Mandarin, you should know, is also all-too brief. This character is to Iron Man what The Joker is to Batman, but there's a problem here: He's hardly in the movie. You'll be alarmed when you realize that 95% of Ben Kingsley's performance was captured in the trailer and that the movie reveals a plot development that relegates him to a cameo role. If you were looking for a big showdown between Downey and Kingsley, you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Much of the plot can't be revealed here without spoilers, suffice to say the movie is entertaining without being extraordinary. You'll find that the action scenes get the job done, but if you're looking for world-class plot development, you'd do best look elsewhere. Director Shane Black, the scribe responsible for the screenplays to The Last Boy Scout, The Last Action Hero and the Lethal Weapon movies injects a refreshing sense of humor onto a dead plot and wisely makes time for Robert Downey, Jr. to simply do what he does best, just talk."
"josephjgf94","6","2","4","3 May 2013"," My Honest Review
","I just got home from seeing this film and I have to say while it is miles better then the second movie it really was not a great movie. I felt there were a lot of plot holes. Now I do think its worth stating that all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most. In this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie. This focus made the other ""powers"" of the suit fade into the back. Another point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy and out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote. To sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes, too many bad guys to care, didn't make sense and didn't explain enough but was entertaining to watch I think a solid 6 is a generous."
"seige-hound","8","2","4","2 May 2013"," Great movie in and of itself, but inconsistent with the lore of the other movies.
","This movie is great, go see it, just watch out and keep your mind a little more open, because the marketing makes the movie look completely different to what it actually is.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT Now, SPOILERS!!! The only real problem i have with the movie is inconsistency. The plot is inconsistent with the other movie.<br/><br/>For instance, the Ten Rings is an actual terrorist organization in Iron Man 1, but here, they just make the Mandarin a cover-up for the real villain, who you could see coming miles away when you first see him. The twist that (HUGE SPOILER) the Mandarin is actually an actor playing a role is a great twist, if it made sense. The only way that they could possibly redeem this twist is if the REAL Mandarin, aka. The Ring Leader (pardon the pun) of the Ten Rings terrorist organization, is the villain in number 4, otherwise there's this massive hole in the plot between 1 and 3.<br/><br/>Otherwise, in and of itself, this film is dramatic, funny and a really good time at the theatres. I'm not buthurt like some people over the sillification (that's what i'm calling it) of the Mandarin, but i get where they're coming from (imagine if they did that to the Joker. Even if the movie was otherwise amazing, people would hate it more that Batman and Robin).<br/><br/>Conclusion: Iron Man 3 is a great film that has a twist nobody saw coming, and therefore potentially ruined the film for some people. If you're a comic book fan, you may not like this film, especially if you're a fan of the Mandarin character."

","A disappointingly average finale to what has been a progressively anti-climatic trilogy, although it is considerably better than the second film due to its status as a true blockbuster that will have most audiences ravenously eating a large box of popcorn in under an hour. The main problem with the film was that it played it very safe, far to safe for the finale of what could have been a genre defining trilogy if done correctly. I feel that the film was sufficiently dumbed down to achieve its blockbuster status with sub par writing throughout and levels of exposition that border on condescending. Although this may seem overly critical I feel that it was a marked improvement from the second film however, I found that the ridiculous amount of comic relief found throughout the film would have been far more appropriate in Iron Man 2. I am in no way saying that the film should be 'Nolan serious' however, I feel that such a significant Marvel film should have a more substantial ending with some level of catharsis at the end SPOILER ALERT>>>>>> * would have preferred it if Pepper Pots died* as I feel that it would have lent far more to the further development of Tony Starks character for the second Avengers film.<br/><br/>This film adds new meaning to the phrase ""meh""."

RDJ excels himself in the role because there's no one else.

It seems that marvel is choosing its directors for this phase cleverly.<br/><br/>damn you warner/DC GL was not supposed to suck.<br/><br/>The story as it has been doing rounds is yes very much listed from the EXTREMIS story line and adapted cleverly but not completely. For the cast part the one person we have to commend is Sir Ben Kingsley, but please don't compare his part with Heath ledger in dark knight. Sir Ben is definitely excellent with the way mandarin had to be projected and it was a very clever choice in casting.<br/><br/>God knows whats with the negative hype surrounding Gwyneth Paltrow guess it has to be for the marketing of the movie. Any way the rest of the cast have done their parts well and Rebecca hall is the weak link though her Maya Hansen was the strong link character in comics line.<br/><br/>As far as Guy Pearce is concerned, damn he will always be the gem in whatever role is given to him .

","Iron Man 3 Iron man 3 is an exciting new film from Marvel after it's very stunning Avengers line. Anyone who is familiar with Marvels film will not be disappointed by the usual arrogant characteristics of our main character as he tries to defeat our main antagonist which acts the part as well as the main protagonist.<br/><br/>The story itself is very grand and elaborate, the usual marvel story that appeals to the usual family audience which it pulls of very well. The story itself keeps very well and in line with the comic books story developments and characters, like in the comic books there is the usual arrogance and self satisfied exterior of our main character that helps any old school boy fans out there and will help the film win favour with the underground comic book society.<br/><br/>The usual idea of the unrealistic and elaborate story is one that will appeal to the usual comic book fandom everywhere. The outer world experience from the story is really felt, the villain himself is not to frightening and doesn't really stand out and even though the villain does have a simple aim and goal of heightening humans evolution pace but the plan is very impractical to say the least as he wants funding for his research even though he tries to get funding from terrorists but later we find out that was false and only a rouse or a distraction so where did he get the funding? the story never tells us and there are a good half a dozen examples like this.<br/><br/>The mandarin which is the villains identity later turns out to be a random somebody who is just an actor on drugs which once again is very elaborate and doesn't have explanation which is the only fault that we have with the movie, the fact that there are many plot holes and lose ends unexplained but they are unnoticeable problems. the film is worth watching, enjoyable and if marvel have shown us anything is they know how to do well at the box office and become a smash hit with the critics.<br/><br/>The kid that plays the role from insidious does a great job for a child actor as they can be the one annoying film in the film that happens to be the directors nephew that simply can't act. The wife of our protagonist which isn't really a rememberable personality. The one thing the film does lack a he load is simply character development and not necessarily a weak villain just not good enough to be remembered maybe the film should have had more build up and dialogue with our main protagonist without the usual cliché's and bad puns.<br/><br/>The best fact about the film like all marvel films is the good CGI, regardless of what weather you like CGI or not, the one thing is that it is used well, not to much and not over the top to point it gets boring, the 3D is definitely worth having for the cinema experience, they really use it well. I must say iron man has more explosions in this film then Rambo there seems to be more iron man suits get more blown than a Chinese fireworks nights.<br/><br/>yes so all in all a good film and certainly worth watching. I personally would give this film a recommendation to see and a good 6/10 but could be considered overrated."

","Iron Man 3 is good, BUT, the twist was absolutely stupid & diabolical IMO. Not sure how many of you here posting are comic book readers, but the twist was a joke & I think deflated the movie a little.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD!* <br/><br/>They had already changed the origin of The Mandarin so that they could fit him / incorporate him into the movie, which is fair enough for not wanting to P*ss off the Chinese or feel they were portraying a racist caricature, BUT, the awesome concept they did come up with for their interpretation / adaptation of The Mandarin & getting an awesome actor like Kingsley just seems to be a big waste of time after the reveal / twist.<br/><br/>Kinglsey's Mandarin when he was playing it seriously & not being 'Trevor the actor' was absolute gold & would have been a brilliant recurring / returning foe for Iron Man again or even a destructive threat against The Avengers.<br/><br/>Kingsley's Mandarin teaming up with Thanos, Red Skull or Cross Bones etc in future would have been pretty cool to see.<br/><br/>I just think at the end of the day, Shane Black's twist was an absolute joke & big waste of time to the movie over all & let it down just a little bit & basically, when you think about it, there was 'No Mandarin'. Aldrich Killian saying he is / was the real Mandarin just doesn't cut it for me & is an utter cheap cop out to try & combine the two as one, VERY LAZY WAY OUT! I hope if there is anymore Iron Man films that another director or maybes even Joss Whedon himself should he ever want to use a 'real' / proper type Mandarin in an Avengers movie can retcon the travesty that Shane Black delivered.<br/><br/>Also, not enough RDJ or Don Cheadle in their respective armours throughout for me.<br/><br/>However, the scene near the end during the big battle where Tony calls on all the suits of armour was incredible & literally gave me chills up my Back watching that, great scene.<br/><br/>Now, I may get some criticism or hate here, but, IMO, for all of it's so called flaws people seem to say it had or being too crammed etc, I still think Iron Man 2 was better than 3, just a shame that Whiplash was wasted & didn't come across as enough of a threat in it.<br/><br/>That's Iron Man 2 & 3 that have had pretty weak villains & 3 not even really having Iron Man's biggest comic book villain for over 50 years even in it.<br/><br/>I'd give Iron Man 3 a 7/10, wasn't perfect, but it was good / just above good.<br/><br/>Hopefully something comes out of all the A.I.M talk / mentions as I'd like to see M.O.D.O.K on the big screen, but I've just heard recently that there is some sort of rights issue with the character which would be a bit unfortunate after alluding to A.I.M in Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me. The MARKETING. When you watch & see the trailers, they are selling this movie with the Mandarin character & as a serious tone, which, maybe this is a bit of an exaggeration / OTT comment, but, I'd see that as FALSE ADVERTISING on the marketing part.<br/><br/>Because you get a completely different outcome from what they're pushing in the trailers & to me, this movie is somewhat comedic at times when it shouldn't be and takes away from the seriousness they also push in the trailers. But then again, Black can never seem to get away from his Lethal Weapon roots! Maybe if they had have reversed the way the twist was used, & made Killian portray himself as the 'Fake Mandarin' & the reveal was Kingsley as the 'Real Mandarin' that would have been so much better & actually would have worked over all.<br/><br/>I've heard some people say after Joss Whedon has done Avengers 2 & 3, maybes have Shane Black helm one or two Avenger's after Joss has done his 3, personally, I don't want Shane Black anywhere near an Avenger's movie or even another Marvel movie / franchise after the debacle he went with here.<br/><br/>I'd hate to have seen what Black would have done with Fin Fang Foom as he had apparently toyed around with the idea of putting him in Iron Man 3, would we have even gotten a Dragon?! LOL.<br/><br/>NOTE TO MARVEL.......... Please keep Shane Black away from any future Iron Man film or any other Marvel property / Character, I just don't think he gets or understands the comic book genre at all & is too stuck in his own ways. This SHOULD have been a IRON MAN movie, NOT a KISS KISS, BANG BANG / LETHAL WEAPON COMBO!!!!!<br/><br/>How Kevin Feige or Marvel Studios let this film get Green lit from its script is beyond me!!!!! Shame on you Feige!!!!!"
"suvinrajpillai","6","2","4","30 April 2013"," Entertaining only at parts (spoilers ahead!!!)
","Just to begin, I'm a fan of Iron Man (IM), so I've grown with the character over the years, and after ""The Avengers"", when Marvel announced a third part for IM, I was excited, because who doesn't love Robert Downey Jr. and his superb portrayal of Tony Stark/IM? <br/><br/>Now back to the film. Ever since I heard the inclusion of the The Mandarin, I was elated because this villain is known to be one of Iron Man's most difficult opponent according to Marvel Comics. And plus, with The Mandarin, comes his 10 magical rings, each with unique powers. So I was pretty happy as they finally decided to put him into the film franchise, and considering the magical powers, you'd imagine a pretty solid film shaping up.<br/><br/>Now unfortunately, that wasn't the case as The Mandarin ended up just being portrayed as a British actor (pretending to be a terrorist) working for Aldrich Killian. I was rather disappointed at this so-called 'twist'.<br/><br/>Another problem was 30 minutes into the film, with the so-called death of Tony Stark, the screenplay crumbles, and the film gets draggy. Now you may think I'm being harsh here, but please, being a superhero film, you'd expect more action, wit and humour (and speaking of humour, there are loads of one-liners which get pretty irritating at times, due to their bad placement throughout the film). <br/><br/>Also, not seeing Tony Stark in his suit throughout most parts of the film will disappoint viewers.<br/><br/>Now to the technical parts of the film.<br/><br/>ACTING/CAST: Most of the cast acted their roles out effectively, though Robert Downey Jr. appeared as if he was forcing himself to act at certain parts. My problems would be Rebecca Hall (Maya Hansen) who looked like she didn't know what she was doing at times. And of course Ben Kingsley (The Mandarin) who was terribly underused due to how his character was portrayed as. The rest of the cast was fine.<br/><br/>STORY: The plot shows how Tony Stark has devoted an extensive amount of time into building as many suits as possible, ever since the ""The Avengers"" in the events of another attack. During all this, his past comes back to bite him, in the form of Aldrich Killian, who with the help of The Mandarin (first perceived as a terrorist, which proves otherwise later in the film) cause destruction, to a certain level.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: Shane Black helmed IM3 this time and took over what Jon Favreau did for the first 2 films. Well, judging from how the film turned out, the overall tone and flow seemed very much different, as compared to the first 2. I feel that Shane should have done a much better job with the film's execution.<br/><br/>SCREENPLAY: Well, considering that they adapted the 'Extremis' plot from the Marvel Comics, it was a decent attempt, though it seemed misguided and kind of lost it's path in between. It could have flowed much better and in-depth. Sadly as mentioned, the plot gets slightly draggy when Tony travels to Tennessee after the attack at his residence. But looking at it as a whole package, I guess it's close to acceptable.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Certain scenic shots look good. But I expected more, such as shots of China, had they stuck to the original Mandarin character.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS: I watched this film in IMAX 3D, because I love to involve myself with a film, and I'm a fan of 3D as well. For the effects though, you can actually tell that there was an extensive usage of CGI, especially on Tony Stark in his Mark 42 suit, which I'm sad to say, looked obviously fake and ended up looking awkward. As for the hyped up climax featuring the Iron Legion, I wasn't too impressed as I felt not all the suits got proper screen time. It also felt a little messed up. Though, I still recommend watching this film in 3D/IMAX 3D.<br/><br/>MUSIC: The background music (BGM) for the film didn't have much of an impact on me, and I thought it was slightly above average. Of course, I'm not expecting music on par with Hans Zimmer work with ""Inception"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"", but at least something to really match the superhero theme. Furthermore, I think certain scenes could have used some BGM, but unfortunately they were left bleak and empty.<br/><br/>Please don't think I hate the film. I love IM and how Robert Downey Jr. has literally lived and breathed the role. But you'd expect slightly more from the third standalone film. But no matter what, if there ever is an Iron Man 4, or his guest appearance in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (August 2014), I'd still watch it, due to the fact that Tony Stark is such an interesting character.<br/><br/>IM3 may not really live up to your expectations, or to those hardcore Marvel Comic fans, due to a major change (*coughs* The Mandarin). But it definitely is worth the watch, for Tony Stark's antics and how he re- invents himself through the film. The Iron Legion in the final battle scene may just impress some, but only to a certain level. Just beware, you are likely to feel bored halfway through the film.<br/><br/>Setbacks aside, I still enjoyed watching IM3 for the charming Robert Downey Jr. and well, there's a good dose of action here and there. I advise you to see this film as an entertainer in parts with a couple of loose-ends.<br/><br/>(P.S: Hopefully the changes the film made won't affect the majority of viewers)"
"socialnetworksonly","7","2","4","27 April 2013"," Utterly disappointing
","I just came back from the cinema where I've watched IM3 non 3D. I'll try to break it down as simple as I can in the following lines. Even now while typing this review I feel a void inside me regarding the movie. In one word - disappointing-.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION I don't know if it was the trailer that created the wrong atmosphere or the fact that I'm a huge IM fan and I've been on every YouTube channel and every blog and every forum before the release of the movie watching , discussing commenting ... but this is not what I expected.<br/><br/>I expected to see IronMan vs. Mandarin the Asian arch-enemy as seen in the comic books. Turned out the Mandarin was a junky , lame , actor that someone picked up from the street to impersonate Mandarin so people have someone to blame for all the attacks. The worse way is the way it is revealed to the audience. I mean it was like watching BORAT for God's sake. Instead what I got is a personal walkthrough of Tony's life. His regrets , his weakenesses and some action.<br/><br/>STORYLINE Although I'm quite capable of keeping up with most movies (watched also Imaginarium of Dr.Parnasus and Inception etc) I must say I had a difficult time with this one. Scenes seemed to go randomly stitched together. As well as randomly paced, sometimes so fast that you needed some seconds to realize what just happened and sometimes deadly slow. The dialogues seemed very poorly made as well.<br/><br/>In this movie Tony has LOST almost all of his swag. RDJ tries to do his thing and succeeds up to a point as usual but I don't get the casual ""Tony Feeling"" of the 2 IMs before this one or the Avengers. Maybe it was a direction method to present him more vulnerable and shocked (""Nothing's been the same since New York"") but I didn't like it. His jokes were cold and nearly as confident as the ones he used to make. The 2-3 clever things he said he seemed like something that ""had to be done"" rather a natural flow of conversation.<br/><br/>VISUAL EFFECTS & SCENE SETUP I must give them that one. CG artists , 2D/3D artists and VFX departments worked hard on that one. There was action. Of course it seemed disconnected at times (as I mentioned above) but there was some. The Visual Effects were taken care of but in comparison to the former movies AGAIN this is inferior. Although there were some cool things like suits , gadgets , gizmos etc. they didn't make much sense. It was as if they were put there just to satisfy the people that were waiting for them instead of being thought out carefully. There were moments that I couldn't understand if it's Tony in the suit , or the suit by itself and other times I couldn't figure out what he was trying to accomplish at his 3D-hologram computer. Generally intuition was gone for good.<br/><br/>THE ENDING All the above I could forgive. I could honestly say it was a descent movie, despite that it lets the audience down at some point, but I can't because of THAT ending. The ending the way it was made certainly made clear that there isn't going to be an IronMan 4 which I can partially understand (RDJ is growing older after all). To make a long story short Iron Man destroys ALL of his suits and has an operation in which doctors remove all his cluster-shrapnels from his chest and lives a happy life (BATMAN-style drinking wine at the end). So here we go. First , no more IronMan ... Second deriving from no.1 , no connection to The Avengers 2 (what are they going to do call him back or plant the reactor back in his chest for some reason?) and third that last scene totally defeated the whole purpose of IM2. I mean the guy was trying for a whole movie to find a replacement element instead of Paladium to put inside his arc- reactor so it won't kill him bit by bit. If he could just have an operation and take the shrapnels off then why not do it then and keep the first reactor?<br/><br/>CONCLUSION I wouldn't watch this movie again although I will because I have promised some friends and I can't take back my word , but if I could take back my word then I would consider myself luck since I would have saved thrown away money. It's an acceptable conclusive-movie for this trilogy , to watch at home in Blu-Ray with your friends but not cinema material. My original vote is a 6/10 but I'll give it a 7 in honor of RDJ."
"patkoscsaba","6","2","4","28 April 2013"," It was good but I expected better
","Usually Marvel super-hero movies are good, and I like them all. Iron Man 3 was something I was looking for both because it is the first movie after Avengers in Marvel's universe and because I liked the previous 2 Iron Man movies.<br/><br/>I am not yet sure if my expectations were to high, or just misplaced, or this movie managed to actually be boring. Special effects were perfect as usual, 3D was acceptable but not that good, but the story and the action... well they were boring. When the movie finished I thought it was a 3 hours movie just to realize it was less than 2 hours long.<br/><br/>Does it deserve to be seen? Absolutely. But keep your expectations low, it may help.<br/><br/>Finally I gave this movie a 6/10, and I personally think it was the worst modern-day Marvel movie (including Thor, Avengers, Captain America, Hulk, and whatever I can't remember right now).<br/><br/>Looking forward to Thor 2. I hope it will be better."

However, Ben Kingsley was a highlight in an unexpected way, and Guy Pearce played the token greasy villain rather well, but I felt the bad guys in general were a tad uninspiring. I also felt the finale was a bit of an unfocused mess..."

She does not get to be Iron Man kill the villain and save the day. Woke nonsense served up by idiot producers who don't have the courage to simply make a male the hero. Period!
Let alone using a mediocre actor like ms. Paltrow in the role. Which is why this movie gets 2 stars and not 8. Maybe she should just stick to reading liberal ads on the Net."

"bryanbezter","8","0","0","27 June 2020"," A good movie, but it could not anticipate the hype after the Avengers
","The writing is good, it has cool moments, surprising elements, and quite disappointing parts. It is a good follow-up of the Avengers, and once again the Iron Man starts another phase. It is clear that Tony is heavily impacted by the New York event, because he was the one who closely finished the battle. It is understandable why Tony has so many enemies from the way he treats and acts disrespectfully towards people. We see Tony being vulnerable, threatened, and anxious, but we also see that he is a genius and resourceful inventor. His relationships with Pepper, Happy, and Rhodes are strengthened through the conflicts that personally impact them. The inclusions of the President, the Vice President, and Harley Keener are not desirable, but Tony's relation with Harley is well-done. The Mandarin twist is very clever, although many people dislike it very much. The character growth, villains, and humor are well-done.<br/><br/>The casting and performances are good: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey Rhodes/Iron Patriot, Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery, and Paul Bettany as JARVIS.<br/><br/>The production set, costumes, make-up, visual and special effects, props, tone, action sequences, and music are well-done."

","Many call it the worst MCU movie, for me this isn't even the worst Iron Man movie.<br/><br/>A great start, 'We create own own demons'. I love that the movie focuses on Stark's PTSD coming from Avengers. This is the Stark's character being motivated by fear and ultimately leading to Ultrons creation.<br/><br/>Feige said he wants to do different things with the third film, so he brings Shane Black. The director does what he is good at, Tony & Rhodey buddy cop. But the movie has a lot of other things going on, there is also a whole storyline with a kid, the kid was good but all things mashed together wasn't a great end product.<br/><br/>Biggest unpopular opinion, the twist was goood. Ben Kingsley was perfect for a fake mandarin and as a con artist, 'I am an Acctorr'. Seeing back that we are getting Shang-Chi with real mandarin and Marvel making a short clip owing up their mistake and saying real mandarin still exist was great damage control.<br/><br/>The villain was played great but felt short like all other marvel villains. Motivations...<br/><br/>Seeing Iron Man rescue people from the plane was a breath of fresh air. Nowadays very few superhero movies show heroes rescuing civilians from danger."

","The third instalment of the highly-successful Iron Man franchise goes off in a different direction to its predecessors. I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.<br/><br/>However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.<br/><br/>And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2)."

","SYNOPSIS:
After the incident at New York, Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) I struggling with extreme anxiety. While trying to cope with that, there's been a string of random and strange explosions going on around America and so he sets out to discover the source.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
This film is so underrated among the the MCU films. I know a lot of people who actually dislike this film a lot. I like this film a lot due to us seeing a very human side of Tony Stark that you can really sympathize with. I know that sounds strange being that he is one of the actual humans of The Avengers, but he has a much larger than life persona. We do have Elon Musk, but Stark seems even crazier than that. Where before he would act out of selfishness due to wanting the spotlight on him, you see him act out of selfishness due to mental stress and because he's tired. I see this as a point to sympathize cause we know what he went through in The Avengers and the anxiety attacks he has at the beginning of the film. At that point we go, ""oh so we can relate with him in some way."" Many of us could even empathize with certain things. Shane Black did a really good job with spreading the conflict all the way through the film and giving it more of an investigative feel.<br/><br/>THE TWIST:
If you know my reviews, you know there are certain times where I have to dedicate one section to something specific in a film. I think the twist in the film is incredibly important, because I believe this is ultimately what makes or breaks the film for a lot of people. I thought it was great. Ben Kingsley was phenomenal and with this twist threw me for a loop. I understood certain people who were bad, but when that twist happened, it flipped everything and to me it excelled the film to a level it might not have gone to if they didn't have this twist.<br/><br/>In the end, I can understand certain comic book heads who might've disliked the twist so I understand that. However, with the emotional aspect this film had, what it did for the Tony Stark character, how we got a bit more of Happy (Jon Favreau) and you can never have too much Favreau, then Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian with a fantastic performance, this film had so much going for it and for me that makes this the most underrated film of the MCU. 7.8/10."

The film is more grounded and takes us to bigger and better places. The villain has purpose and it showcases a film that has a clear vision behind it. One giant hole is the fact Tony Stark goes missing and no one goes looking for him, just weird. The finale is insane and one of the best action set pieces of the series.

"kelboy10","7","0","0","28 November 2019"," Any old iron
","Iron man is back and has moments of greatness and elements of surprise but did it all work swimmingly. Well in my opinion it rusted ever so slightly. The main problem with this film is the villain for me. The motive is good but the execution not so much. Jealously can be a dangerous thing and arrogance can set it off. But for me the previous instalments had stronger character development for our main antagonist. Maybe the twist gave the main villain much less screen time than we were prepared to accept. The main villain is a terrorist in the name of the Manderin or so we are lead to believe. But not everything is what it seems. Tony Stark does some crazy stuff for an intelligent man and is easily sent over the edge when his friend Happy is injured. Although there isn't a great deal of character development on their friendship. One big flaw for me is the simplicity in which the manderin is offered Mr Starks home address on the entire news. Now we know from previous instalments Tony can be his own worst enemy, at times egotistical, but seriously this is ridiculous. Does Tony not consider the danger he is not only putting himself in but his girlfriend Pepper. Being the third instalment like most third parts the exaggeration and humour has stepped it up a few levels and of course so has the explosions. Robert Downey Jr maintains his believable flirtatious chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper but also begins ascending new friendships in the unlikely nerdy boy in basement type or garage to be accurate. More of a distraction or annoyance than a friend but a healthy one to remove him from his PTSD after the events of the Avengers alien invasion. Downey Jr shows great emotional depth and along with humour/witty intellect he brings stress and anxiety to a much more round less invincible Tony. He proves that he is much more than just iron man. At times a mentor/father figure to the boy that he treats only like an adult. Juxtaposed along with how his father may well have treated him judging from flashes we have seen of Howard Stark throughout the marvel cinematic universe. Pepper is no longer the damsel in distress in this one but a influential team player and a worthy ally and partner for Stark. Guy Pearce is good in his role as the envious Aldrich Killian but we don't seem to get enough of him as we'd like. Overall it's a solid sequel but nothing groundbreaking in the comic book movie world. More of a story or revenge and how our hero will adapt against the odds."
"davidmvining","6","0","0","25 November 2019"," Disjointed, but fun
","This movie has large sections of it that work quite well in isolation, but the movie as a whole doesn't really come together like it should.<br/><br/>I realized something was wrong pretty early. Tony has been tinkering ever since his close encounter with a nuclear weapon in New York, losing himself in his work and developing dozens of Iron Man suits. When confronted by the events of that day, he has anxiety attacks. Meanwhile, a terrorist called The Mandarin has been setting off explosions around the world and delivering messages to the American devil. One explosion occurs in Los Angeles and Tony's former bodyguard Happy gets grievously harmed because of it. This is where I realized something was off. Tony has an emotional reaction that is way too much for the situation, and his unveiled threat to The Mandarin in response is too angrily directed at The Mandarin himself.<br/><br/>Wait, that doesn't make sense, does it? Happy has been at Tony's side since the beginning of the first movie. Of course an attack on him is going to piss Tony off. And here's where the difference between the intention of a movie and its actual execution becomes important. Happy is barely a character. He was largely a source of mild laughs in the middle of light sequences. He had never developed an emotional connection with Tony or with the audience, so to see Happy in danger and to have his injury drive Tony's next series of actions that are meant to be powered with high emotion feels unsupported by what's actually come before. Injuring Pepper, Tony's girlfriend, though, would have done it. For all the faults of the first two Iron Man movies, they did manage to sell the relationship between Tony and Pepper well enough so that if Pepper had been injured and Tony had delivered the exact same speech it would have landed emotionally.<br/><br/>The reverse of that are ideas that seem curious but end up being executed fairly well all while feeling isolated from the rest of the story. Tony getting isolated in Tennessee with the plucky kid is an example of this. The plucky kid is a trope of movies, especially sequels, in order to artificially heighten stakes and create a new dynamic for the characters to explore. The kid here, though, gets treated like an adult by Tony. He doesn't soften at the kid's doe eyes, nor does he learn his lesson in abandonment through him, he's there to help Tony in a time of need, and I think it largely works. However, it's done in isolation and feels extraneous at best.<br/><br/>The other major element that I really like on its own but doesn't seem to fit the rest of the movie is The Mandarin himself. Now, fans of the comic hate this interpretation of The Mandarin because it turns a terrifying and evil character into a joke, but I am not a fan of the comics, I think lack of adherence to source material is a junk criticism, and I quite like him. The subversion of the big bad being the main target, leaving the guy we've thought is the bad guy as the actual antagonist, is a fun one, and I think it's handled well. The Mandarin gets built up very well throughout the movie with his video messages to the world, and the sudden deflation of that image to find out that he's a drugged out cockney actor named Trevor is really funny. However, it feels like just extra stuff, like material you could cut without much trouble.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I have some problems with how the movie's constructed. There doesn't seem to be a particularly strong throughline for the whole story, though by the end of it, it becomes obvious that Tony's supposed to be learning to say goodbye to the suit. I think the movie largely supports that, though. He doesn't have a full working suit in the whole movie. In fact, he spends most of the movie having to solve his problems without a suit. From the moment he lands in Tennessee to when his suit flies to him in Miami (which is about an hour or so), Tony is just Tony. He has to solve his problems without the high tech gear he encases himself in all the time. In fact, he has to go out and get analog in finding ways to beat down badguys by running into a hardware store and collecting a couple cartloads of stuff to make offensive weapons. He's learning that he can live without the suit.<br/><br/>However, that core idea is hidden behind a bunch of other stuff (like Trevor, the kid, and some political talk that never goes anywhere). The movie looks fantastic, though. This is the first standalone Marvel movie that got seriously huge wads of cash thrown at it, and it shows. The attack on Tony's cliffside mansion is one of the most beautiful scenes of pure destruction I've seen. The final battle with the few dozen Iron Man suits flying around it detailed and inventive.<br/><br/>There's great fun to be had in this movie, but the movie as a whole is disjointed and full of distractions. In terms of construction, I think a couple more drafts might have smoothed out the whole experience and created something more successful."

","Iron Man 3 does a good job of showing the effects that the events in The Avengers had on tony. In this film we see a lot more of Tony Stark rather than Iron Man which I liked. Robert Downy Jr is once again great. The action is a lot of fun in this, I really liked the final battle and there is good humour in this film. I didn't mind the twist with the villain because I never read the comics so didn't know who he was but I can understand why it upset people. I do think that the film might have been better had they not done the twist because the real villain was not great. Also some stuff that was done at the end of the movie was ignored in the future movies. But overall there is a lot of fun in this film and it is better then the second Iron Man .<br/><br/>8.0/10"

","I really love Iron Man. I hadn't watched a Marvel movie in a while, so had forgotten how good he was until I watched this and I was grinning from ear to ear in a lot of his scenes (and sometimes crying). Tony Stark is so brilliant and witty!
This movie is narrated by Tony Stark, which is interesting and different. The plot is awesome and has some surprising twists and turns. The animation and CGI is top notch as usual and the dialogue is great and the acting is perfect. It plays like a mystery thriller, specifically like a James Rollins novel, which was awesomely disturbing at times. The villains are interesting and not whom you expect. The climax is so, so, so tense and thrilling and very well-played - actually the whole movie is.
I also loved how this focuses solely on Tony Stark and shows him when he's a rock bottom with no-one and nothing, pressed into a corner with nowhere else to go. Downey really did an awesome job of capturing Tony Stark as he battles PTSD.
Recommend this if you are a fan of Iron Man, Marvel in general, or like a good mystery/thriller.
Awesome, awesome movie."

"cutesd","8","0","0","27 January 2019"," It's got some serious issues ... but I still really like it. :-)
","So to start off I want to say that I really like this film ... and I recognize that it has some pretty glaring consistency issues.<br/><br/>A lot of people hated the Mandarin twist ... I liked it. I don't think that's an issue but then I never read the comics. My issues have to do with logic and consistency.<br/><br/>The first big issue is the inconsistency on the new suit that ""codes"" to Tony.<br/><br/>So Tony has to implant a bunch of electrodes in his arm to make the suit reassemble on him ... but then with a couple arm movements he's able to put it on Pepper? Then later Rhodes asks for a suit and Tony says ""they're only coded to me"" ... but then he again does the movements and puts the whole suit on Killian???? If he has to ""code"" the suits then how can he just arbitrarily transfer them with a couple arm waves to anyone he wants? And if he can put the suits on anyone why was he implanting electrodes in his arm? For the conducting?? Anyway ... weird.<br/><br/>OK so next is Iron Patriot ... AIM apparently did the upgrade on War Machine to turn him into Iron Patriot. And they were able to program it to encapsulate the president, fly and deliver him to Killian. So why didn't they also build in an override to bring Rhodes to them? Or an ""open sesame"" button to pop Rhodes out of it? They do all the work, they built in override capability, having the suit was completely necessary to their plan ... so why did they have to create an elaborate ruse to capture Rhodes? And then all the heating to get him out of the suit? Why not just push a button and it spits out Rhodes and brings the suit directly to them? Would've been easier.<br/><br/>Oh and quick side note: what was with Rhodes able to active the blasters from the outside while he's rescuing the president? Seriously you can do that ... cuz that seems like a SERIOUS design flaw. Anyway ...<br/><br/>Ok and then lastly is the suped-up soldiers and Killian and the various ways to kill them ... or not kill them. So with the primary bad dude soldier: a 3000 celsius blast DOESN'T kill him ... a blast to the head DOESN'T kill him ... burning, gunshots, nope and nope. But a laser to the chest kills him? Why does that work? Their heart has to be destroyed to destroy them? If that's true why doesn't blowing up work? Or fire? How does that make sense? Then later during the final battle fight the super-soldiers ARE taken out by explosions? I mean the Iron Legion had to have taken them all out because there aren't any left by the end ... it's unclear HOW they accomplish this but we do see some of them exploding and it appears to be working.<br/><br/>But then we get to Killian ... dismemberment doesn't work, punches, blasts, nothing. Then Tony puts a suit on him and explodes it ... that should do it right? NOPE. Somehow still alive until Pepper explodes him a second time ... so two explosions work???<br/><br/>Yeah and let's not forget Pepper ... falls 200 feet into fire ... and survives. So it just makes absolutely no sense at all ... seemed like the movie writers were just making it up as they went along and just shrugged at the end and said ... whatever ... people will still like it.<br/><br/>And hey ... they were right. :-)"

"ianritchey","Null","0","0","14 November 2018"," Can One Bad Twist Ruin a Movie?
","After the smash hit of ""The Avengers"", it was without question Marvel would continue the franchise, starting with the third movie for its most popular character. With a change of director ""Iron Man 3"" was met with lukewarm response, mostly thanks to a twist that made fans furious. But how is the movie really, and was the twist even that bad?<br/><br/>""Iron Man 2"" was met with mediocre reviews, so Marvel decided to hire Shane Black to direct the third entry in the franchise. Black had only directed one other film up to that point, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" but Marvel thought he could bring something to the table. The presentation was quite well done, with rock music and scenes from the previous movies in the credits. But presntation can only get you so far.<br/><br/>The cast is great, as to be expected with these movies. Robert Downey Jr. adds a whole other layer to Tony Stark, who is dealing with PTSD from the Battle of New York. Gwenyth Paltrow is great as Pepper, and it was cool seeing her wear the suit. I like Don Cheadles performance, but War Machine is way cooler than Iron Patriot. Guy Pierce is fine, just another forgettable Marvel villain. His Extremis soldiers were all fun though. While he doesn't direct, Faverou returns as Happy Hogan, and is entertaining while he's there. The big point of contention comes from Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, I mean Trevor Slattery.<br/><br/>The big twist in this movie is that the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's most famous bad guys, not actually the bad guy, but an actor playing the Mandarin. This pissed a lot of people off, including myself. But, it is a decent twist, and very well executed. Plus Kingsley is very funny once the jig is up. I just wish they had someone better than Guy Pierce to back him up. The writing throughout the film is very tight, with Stark's quips being some of the most entertaining yet.<br/><br/>The effects are really good, with the 42 Iron Man suit final battle being the highlight. Seeing an army of Iron Men charge into battle is a real spectacle to see. Each one has a unique design, with the Heartbreaker and Igor being my personal favorites. The limb regeneration is also done quite well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really do like Iron Man 3. That twist in the end throws you off the first time you watch the movie, but once you know it's coming and can just enjoy it for what it is, it's much better. The movie ends with Stark getting the Arc Reactor surgery, proving he really is more than the suit, and proving that he is Iron Man.<br/><br/>7/10"

"CinematicInceptions","6","0","0","4 September 2018"," Some of Marvel's worst, but still passable.
","This has always been one of my least favorite Marvel movies, though I haven't seen all of them. I remember it being a pretty big disappointment when I saw it in theaters, because the hype for it was pretty big. Part of the problem with this movie is that it was the first MCU movie to come out after The Avengers; needless to say, a tough act to follow. The audience knows that the stakes have been higher and that Tony Stark logically wouldn't have to face the Mandarin alone given that at least one of the other Avengers could probably have been called upon for help. So those factors made it kind of hard to take this movie that seriously. However, I think that the sub-par nature of this movie is a real testament to how well Kevin Feige and company have done with connecting their heroes in all the subsequent movies.<br/><br/>With that said, I have a lot of issues with the movie. Most of them are matters of taste, but I think that they might be tastes that other people share. The main thing I disliked was how much comedy they tried to force in. I understand why they would want to go for a light-hearted tone, but if every joke were cut, I think it would result in a better movie. A couple of them are funny, but most are annoying. The fact that the Madarin turns out to be a goofy junkie actor shows that the movie doesn't really take itself seriously. That might have been fine, but then the real Mandarin turned out to not be that great of a villain either. More of a personal issue I had was the kid Harley, who I wanted to throw out the window every second he was on screen. I know he was supposed to be annoying to Tony, but that doesn't mean that he has to be annoying to the audience. Finally, the ending was kind of dissatisfying. It wasn't that much of a let-down because it's not like the emotional plot was that promising to begin with, but It did hang a lantern on how little attention was paid to any kind of human story. Tony has kind of an arc in how he gives up his obsession about his suits in favor of Pepper, but it's not handled that well and isn't even that logical. I think there was also an idea that the way to truly test Tony was to have him face challenges without his suits, but he's never totally without them, and honestly the suits are perhaps the best part of the movie so including less of them was a bit frustrating.<br/><br/>I know that was some fairly harsh criticism, but it's not a terrible movie, it's just flawed. The visuals are of course very good and the climatic battle with all the iron man suits was pretty cool. Also, the plot basically works which is hardly applaudable, but sadly some movies of the same budget can't seem to slap together a plot that logically connects their action setpieces (looking at you Michael Bay). Oddly, I actually had more hatred for it as a fourteen year old seeing it in theaters than I do now, which is odd since movies like this are pretty much tailor made for fourteen-year-old boys. I wouldn't have chosen to see it again, but two of my friends who are big MCU fans were recapping all the movies before Infinity War so I joined them for this one.<br/><br/>I might make recommendations on whether to see this, but it's been five years and the MCU has moved on a lot in that time. If you're not an MCU fan, don't bother with this. It might be moderately entertaining for you, but it won't change your view on superhero movies. If you are an MCU fan or looking to get caught up, this is one you can skip in good conscience. Overall Rating: 6.8/10."

The movie CGI and practical effects looks good and visually interesting. Some Action Sequences are really epic, over the top and impressive. 3D is dazzling and some scenes really looks good in 3D.

There are some unnecessary and totally underdeveloped supporting characters which make the movie some times too much overloaded. The main story plot seems to be unconvincing and underwhelming. The climax scene and ending of the movie is not up to the mark and feels confusing and little disappointing, but the performance of Robert Downey Jr. and some great action sequences makes Iron Man 3, a good enjoyable watch.

","The movie first of all was unnecessary because there was already a good first one, and a bad sequel. This makes you think that they did it just for the money, and not because they had something to say. You get 100% sure about that after watching the movie. As for the villains of the movie, like in all superhero movies or comics, they have superhuman powers. It is so ridiculous, all these exaggerations, with people who fly, who walk through walls, and now, people with flash-lights -lol! Also, the good woman of the story, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, becomes a monster that flashes! I thought the meaning of Ironman is the triumph of man's intelligence,with which he/she can create machines capable of anything. In the Ironman 3 man is capable only of punching around and making noise! We shouldn't forget the dance of the uniforms in the end. Ironman jumps in the air from the one uniform to the other. The uniforms fly in the air above his head, and Ironman leaves the one uniform, jumps from the terrace down, falls inside an empty uniform, flies up to the top again, leaves the uniform, and jumps again to catch another uniform. And again, and again. It may look well as a picture, but what's the possibility of this ridiculous exaggeration to happen in reality? And it's not even a first! We have seen similar scenes in James Bond (jumps and catches airplane), in Star Wars, even in the 5th Element with Bruce Willis! Art is the prototype, the cheap impromptu imitation isn't! The film also contains provocative propaganda: the president of the US wears the uniform of Ironman and saves people. The president was about 80 years old, and all this would be fun, if it wasn't subliminal brain-wash targeting the minds of the viewers! Overall, a joke, not a movie at all..."

Nothing to say about Mandarin, a total fraud, it could have been a decent Marvel villain but they screwed it again. Then again, the jokes another Marvel problem, if you are in a serious situation, come on that's why this movies are for kids.<br/><br/>By the way, what the hell is Rebecca Hall's role in this movie she's like there doing nothing.<br/><br/>Hope Marvel one day make good movies again like IronMan, Captain America 2 or Civil War."

","Shane Blake does not like the comic book Iron Man and even less the character of Mandarin and he proves it in this Iron Man 3 where it shows that anyone can be Iron Man (Pepper Potts, Kilian and even the President of the United United (yes, really). and the worst part is the treatment he inflicts on the character of the Mandarin he hates above all. a shame, a shame, a betrayal. The biggest problem that people have with this movie seems to be an awful representation of the main villain. This particular aspect is bad in its own right, but, honestly, I think this movie's problem go far beyond that specific gripe that people have. My problem with this failure of film is its defective writing, poor conceptualization, dull characters, inconsistent tone, lack of intelligence and thematic integrity. Iron Failure 3 is as superficial and trivial as you can get. Depth in this movie is non- existent. Character motivation is flat. The characters themselves are poorly written cardboard figures with no personality. <br/><br/>There is no stakes and no tension. Everything is paint by numbers and generic. As for the controversial miss-handling of the main villain, which many defenders of this movie have described as an act of brilliancy, because it had some imaginary message behind it, I have my opinion on that.<br/><br/>The only hidden message that this movie gave us, is that Shane Black should never again direct another comic book movie. I guess people think about that meaningless plot-point too much. Iron Man 3 is not a Dark Knight, when you can write a book about all the subliminal meanings behind the film. Iron Man 3 is a cookie-cuter, generic, uninventive schlock. Maybe the idea behind this ""hidden message"" looked good in a concept, but the execution is what kills any potential for this to be taken seriously. It's like with the Prometheus, which had great ideas, but the execution of those ideas was flat and dull. Iron Man 3 was even worse than that. <br/><br/>I am fully aware, as a few other people with actual brain cells, that this cheap option was not executed well and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is generic, cheesy, poorly written mess with no actual depth. If Shane Black, who is definitely not someone who has brilliant writing and directing skills, intended to mock the perception of terrorism in society, he would have an entire film dedicated on exploration of that. But he's too dumb and generic to actually make something good out of that concept. People are giving simply some generic excuses for the fact that Shane Black did very poor execution with the story and the conceptuality of the film (which it didn't really had)."

","The comments regarding skewing the spirit of the Marvel comics not withstanding, plus a formulaic plot, I take a stand on the insidious way we are undermining our daughters.<br/><br/>Whenever a script has anyone use the term ""pussy"" as a sexist slur to mean a coward, we are reinforcing negative stereotypes of our daughters, sisters, and mothers, regardless.<br/><br/>And it goes by almost unnoticed, almost on a preconscious level.The movie industry would have us take ""pussy"" for granted as a normal every day nomenclature. We have come to take script writers use of this term for granted as if people in real life, folks from decent homes, who are trying to work on the life long process of learning and becoming better human beings, speak this way. As if most of us would not cringe if we heard an adult male ""motivate"" a young boy to action by asking him, ""Do you want to be a pussy?"" At this point in the plot, which is not that far in, I lost immediate total interest, and respect. ""Pussy"" as we all know, is the number two derogatory term for the vulva, next to the humiliating term ""cunt"", which is just as bad as the ""n"" word, yet I bet I would not be able to spell out the ""n"" word, even though there is nothing illegal about it when not used with the intent to intimidate or humiliate. We can use the ""n"" word liberally in our film scripts, just can't spell it out discussing films. Sexism still subsumes racism.<br/><br/>But we can spell out ""pussy"" and ""cunt"", not seeing the connection between the epidemic of violence against women as being directly related to the use of hate words to spread an under pinning of misogyny worldwide, as in domestic violence, rape, child brides, female genital mutilation, sex trade, honor killings... yeah, honor. The epidemic of American high school and college girls thinking ""hooking up"" up is liberating, when in fact it is subjugating and humiliating in the long run, sometimes not that long of a run.<br/><br/>""Pussy"" means in our culture the female genitalia, in a derogatory, misogynistic fashion. Who can define ""yoni"" by contrast without Googling it? We never hear it.And yet Iron Man can tell a kid not to be a female genitalia, implying females are weaklings. Even if one were to glibly argue that ""pussy"" means ""pussy cat"", every one would snicker. As if felines were not ferocious fighters.<br/><br/>I hope other parents talk to their kids about the significance of words and how it shapes our reality. That they too caught Robert Downy Junior using ""don't be a pussy"" to goad on a little boy, and insult our daughters while he was at it. Tsk tsk, Robert, and I just saw you filming in our town.

","There are certain actors and certain production houses that are just predetermined to bring you on the edge of your seats every single time those veterans are there to display their prowess. Iron Man 3, well just like the 2 prequels, it was ripe with action sequences that are guaranteed to leave you spellbound. Certain scenes,especially the one where he pulls 13 people falling from an airplane to safety, are so scintillating and yet so immaculate that you cannot stop yourself from indulging with the rest of the audience in praising that moment. Tony is still the suave guy whose ingenuity and cogency continue to hold the audiences captive but the Mandarin, the main antagonist, is so impeccable in his execution that Tony has to refine his ways. With the wrath of Mandarin reaching more and more blatant magnitude with every strike and with the Mandarin now sighting the final destruction of a nation, Tony can only consort with his own intellectual brilliance and his own ""toys"" to become the savior yet again. Will he be able to pull off the decisive victory, will he be able to overcome his own internal demons to triumph against the most devastative of alliances. He may very well do that because ultimately, He is the iron man. But you gotta watch this one to know if he does that."

"blacklist-1","9","3","8","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 manages to drag the franchise out of the mud after it's inferior predecessor and revitalises it to be the best one yet.
","After the watchable enough, but disappointing Iron Man sequel, this third one in the franchise had a lot to live up and to revert my opinion on the franchise, which had hit a rough patch. My expectations were exceedingly low, even with the good reviews. <br/><br/>However in a way that worked massively to the film's advantage and after 130 minutes I came out convinced that I had just seen one of the best third films of any franchise (whatever the genre, I shudder at the number 3 sometimes with movies like Rush Hour 3, Spiderman 3 and Shrek The Third) and the greatest Iron Man up to date.<br/><br/>One asset of the franchise, which has never failed in all three movies is it's most bankable star Robert Downey Jr (who is just a fantastic actor in any film) who always plays the part with a smarmy, sarcastic twinkle in his eyes with the undercurrent notion of a man burdened by so much, which is certainly the case in the third film.<br/><br/>Set after The Avengers Assemble movie (nicely referenced throughout the movie) Stark is struggling with day to day life, staying up for days at a time, (by throwing himself into his work) and struggling to sleep and having nightmares of what Loki did. We also see him suffer anxiety attacks. He is also pushing away his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow - who gets a meatier role in this and more to do instead of being the typical damsel in distress). But a threat to America from the fearsome adversary The Mandarin (Ben Kinglsey) aided by Killian (Guy Pearce) forces Stark to pick himself up and protect the people and everyone he loves. Throughout he is supported by his friend Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and when Iron Man crashes in the snow aided by a kid Harley Keener (TY Simpkins - there's always a kid isn't there!?) <br/><br/>The cast give wonderful performances, with Downey Jr obviously being the best one with his flippant attitude and witty wisecracks (thanks to a well observed script by Shane Black whose credits include Lethal Weapon). Paltrow gives her best performance yet and humanises the whole film with her worry for Stark and her best moment comes at the end where she becomes all bad-ass and then comes up with the best one liner after the carnage she causes (I won't tell you, you'll have to see if for yourself). Kingsley and Pearce gives terrific performances as the bad guys, with a nice, unexpected twist with The Mandarin, though some other reviewers say they feel cheated and it brunts the impact felt of The Mandarin being a fearsome adversary for Iron Man (which is fair enough as everyone has their own interpretations). I have to disagree and if anything for me it elevated his mystique. Downey Jr works wonderfully with Cheadle and the kid Simpkins as they have great buddy chemistry as those two gives solid performances.<br/><br/>Though Iron Man 3 may start off a bit slow and not have as much action as it's predecessor, on balance I prefer as it builds up the story and the character development (of Stark), which is rare in a third movie. It takes the time to not just wow us with the great special effects and exciting action sequences (the best being the last sequence at the docks), but also get to know and care about the new characters and the old ones too. The music was also great and the cameo right at the end of the credits by a certain actor (no not Robert Downey Jr) from The Avengers movie was brilliant.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have for Iron Man 3 is the 3D, which was awful. Very little of it is in 3D and was just a wasted gimmick that was not necessary for an already great film. Overall Iron Man 3 for me elevates the franchise to a whole new level and becomes the best of the lot. Not everyone will agree, but see it for yourself and make up your own mind."
"amit_imt2002","6","3","8","26 April 2013"," Iron Man 3 is back in form..OK somewhat!
","Tony Stark is the kind of billionaire inventor playboy genius that must make Richard Branson and Larry Ellison feel like under achievers or worse-downright wimpish. ""I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, and occasionally save the world,"" yeah, way cooler than Steve Jobs. The appearance of the Oracle brand in Iron Man 3 is perhaps Ellison making a donation to become part of the super alpha male club, because the guys who buy Oracle servers are not going to be swayed by this film.<br/><br/>The story starts off in the post The Avengers world, with Tony Stark having retreated to his workshop to create a plethora of suits.But all is not well in the world, there have been mysterious explosions which have a unique signature to them.The back story belongs to a science conference in 1999 when Stark ignored the entreaties of a partially disabled scientist Aldrich Killian(Guy pierce) to work with him and ended up creating a monster.While he was at it he also had a one night stand with an ace scientist Maya Henson (Rebecca Hall) and left her in the lurch.His life with his girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained. He is going through a superhero midlife crisis, and a ""what else is there to achieve, now that I am the CEO of Starks Corp. and his permanent girlfriend"" emptiness in hers.Meanwhile the evil Aldrich meets Pepper and makes a presentation, taking her inside the hologram of human brain that will make the consultants at Bain and Co. sweat,trust me its sleek.But Pepper is not impressed, it sounds like evil science to her.<br/><br/>With this final rebuff all bets are off and Peppers bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) gets hurt in another mysterious blast.This snaps Stark back to his superhero mode and he calls for war with the new threat to humankind, Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an Asian looking anarchist, who by now is making global broadcasts about his intention to teach the world painful lessons. Aldrich has also harnessed a technology that can regenerate damaged human tissue and has cured himself.He is looking to commercialize his invention.The rest of the film continues to carry on the special effects feast with the Iron Man slugging it out with the evil Mandarin and Aldrich.Hell hath no fury like a scientist scorned.The director charms us in the middle act in a Spielberg kind of way by introducing the all American blond kid who helps Stark when he is down and out and gets a payback which will earn him a fortune on Ebay one day.<br/><br/>After the definitive cinematic death of Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Hollywood seems to be taking a break from terrorists with long beards, in the recent Olympus has Fallen, Hollywood looks to North Korea for pure evil.Tragically real life seems to follow suit in Boston where at least outwardly the killers were white Caucasian men.Maybe next time around we will have a secret society of Russian oligarchs facing off with the Marvel crew.<br/><br/>While the novelty of the suit has worn off despite several reboots, Robert Downey Jr. is superb, this is still one of the most inspired casting calls in Hollywood Superhero history.Gwyneth Paltrow has just been named the most beautiful woman in the world by People magazine, much to the chagrin of feminists who hate her blond slender blue-eyed frame, delivers the goods as Iron Mans weak spot even though he neglects her for his workshop.She shakes off the damsel in distress image to emerge a worthy Mrs Iron Man. Guy Pierce is good as the evil Aldrich Killian but Ben Kingsley's Mandarin sets the screen on fire.His character neatly sidesteps the Fu Mancu stereotype and bears shades of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, in his worldview.<br/><br/>The first Iron Man film was supremely thrilling in combining special effects and a really original character brought to life by Downey.The second installment instead of building on the first went sideways, though not without its spectacular moments.The third installment which sees a change in the direction department with Shane Black replacing Jon Favreau, tries to go back to basics but the plot does not have the cohesion that the Iron Man 1 had.<br/><br/>This is far from a perfect film with more plot holes than there are chinks in the Iron Man's steel suit but a very entertaining and polished product.Its major weaknesses is the length, a full 131 minutes may be bang for the buck or a slight drag depending on whether you are a Marvel comics fanboy or a regular moviegoer. Made on a jumbo budget of USD 200 million, IM3 is worth your time and money for all the fireworks on display, nearly eclipsed by Downey and Ben Kingsley, at their sparkling best.<br/><br/>#Iron Man 3 seems to be a test case for Hollywood in China as it goes head to head with a small budget Chinese drama.The Chinese seem to be tired of the Hollywood pyrotechnics which is good news for all of us!"
"bumblebeeman777","Null","5","17","25 April 2013"," Extremely gratifying and superb in every way!
","They took what worked so well in Iron Man and even Iron Man 2 to a degree and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way with this third installment. The complexity, depth, heart and action were even more off the charts than the first film. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are raving about Iron Man 3. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one, developed in movie two and built upon it masterfully. We get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer mixed with an anxiety ridden celebrity who is having trouble living that celebrity life after the events of Iron Man 2 and Avengers. His playboy ways are over but everything else in his life makes little sense to him now. I love that they haven't forgotten where the character has been. It's what makes Marvel really sing and why they have an edge that most other movies don't have or care to cultivate. They also upped the action but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film than the last and I'm one that enjoyed Iron Man 2. Anyone wondering why Tony didn't just call his new Avenger/SHIELD buddies that's answered in the film. Also, there's going to be a LOT of talk about certain plot twists but I hope people see it before certain twists are on the Net. Anyway, everything fits together wonderfully and in a moving and exciting fashion.<br/><br/>When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What I said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 3. Notice anything about that last sentence? Not many films with the number three are called great. Iron Man 3 will certainly work towards changing that from here on out. It's a great film with or without a number."

This movie is no more than a useless money magnet. Please – stop with Iron Man – no more Iron Mans, please – please - please. 'Iron Man 1', and, 'The Avengers', were all very good renditions of this character, but enough is enough. I can't take this torture any longer and neither can my wallet. Iron Man 2 was bad enough – it really was – but this one stooped to a new low. This Iron Man variant deserves a massive, 'Iron Gag Award.' The actors are pretty good I guess, the script is weak, the story is OK, but there is something extremely camp about the flick that drives the overall movie to poor status. I guess I am just done with super hero flicks. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow are good enough, but you can pull the fork out anytime, the story is better than well-done.

"Hellmant","9","3","9","8 May 2013"," Does Downey Jr. deserve over ten times the pay of any other 'AVENGERS' cast member?!
","'IRON MAN 3': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. returns to his most popular and iconic movie role (based on the Marvel comics superhero) 'Iron Man' (a.k.a. Tony Stark) for the fourth time (after playing the role in two other 'IRON MAN' films and 2012's 'THE AVENGERS', for which he was paid a whopping $50 to $70 million). Returning to their roles for the third time are Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as security guard Happy Hogan and Paul Bettany as the voice of Stark's robotic companion Jarvis (it's actually the fourth time for Paltrow and Bettany if you count their cameos in 'THE AVENGERS'). Don Cheadle returns to play Stark's buddy Colonel James Rhodes for the second time (after replacing Terrence Howard from the first film). Joining the cast this time around are Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, James Badge Dale, Stephanie Szostak, William Sadler, Miguel Ferrer and Ty Simpkins (as the first kid sidekick in any 'Avengers' film). Favreau handed off directing duties to Downey Jr.'s pal Shane Black, who directed Downey in the 2005 action buddy film 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' (which he also wrote). Black penned an assortment of other popular 80s and 90s action buddy films as well like the original 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'THE LAST BOYSCOUT' and 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT'. He co-wrote 'IRON MAN 3' with Drew Pearce. The movie doesn't quite live up to the original two 'IRON MAN' films or 'THE AVENGERS' but it's still an excellent inclusion in the popular franchise.<br/><br/>After the events of the alien invasion in 'THE AVENGERS' film Stark (Downey Jr.) now suffers from PTSD and spends most of his time making obsessive improvements to his 'Iron Man' suit (as well as building many others). As a result he's been neglecting Pepper (Paltrow) as she's visited by a man from both their pasts, scientist Aldrich Killian (Pearce), who works in regenerative healing research. A new terrorist, going by the name of 'The Mandarin' (Kingsley), has been bombing innocent civilians and harms Starks security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau). This pisses Stark off causing him to threaten the terrorist on TV as well as give him his address. 'The Mandarin' retaliates by attacking Stark at his home and putting both Pepper and an old fling of Stark's (Hall) in danger. Stark's suit is severely damaged as he's forced to battle his enemy with only his ingenuity and the help of a 10-year-old boy (Simpkins). When Pepper is kidnapped and put in grave danger as well Stark is forced to overcome all his inner demons in order to save the day.<br/><br/>The story is based loosely on six-issues of the comic from 2005 and 2006 involving the ""Extremis"" story arc. 'Extremis' is the regenerative technology Killian's character is working on in the film. I didn't like this element of the movie so much but I did like the PTSD storyline and it was very interesting to see the otherwise super confident superhero suffering from panic attacks throughout the film. This is where the film's greatest strength lies. Of course the Tony Stark character is always one of the greatest comic superheroes to watch and Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as him. Does he deserve over ten times the pay as any other 'AVENGERS' cast member? I don't know but he is a joy to watch here once again and he does help make the film. Black was the perfect director to replace Favreau and the other additions to the cast are good as well. Pearce and Kingsley aren't nearly as memorable or powerful villains as the ones in the first two films though and Black's screenplay isn't quite as clever or well written as those other movies either. Still it is a good addition to the series; flawed but still about as much as you can expect from the third installment in a blockbuster action series like this.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM"

","I'm not a huge fan of Marvel, since I've only seen a few. Captain America was nice, age of ultron was good, iron man 2 was OK, and I've seen this one. It was released in 2013 to high amounts of praise. But I think it's over-hyped. And here's why<br/><br/>The story in this film is about terrorists about to completely take over the U.S., and it suddenly starts to focusing on people that can burst into flames. See, this is super disorganized this film is? What makes it more choppy is the fact that Tony Starks home was under attack, then he gets in his suit unconscious, flys off, and wakes up in a totally different place. I thought while seeing that, what just happened? Things get more disorganized for reasons that will spoil the film. The writing is just super choppy, disorganized, and a bit confusing. It goes on like this for so long and it just makes me wonder what the heck is happening here. There is not much logic. Its just super messy and just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>The special effects look super great. I will not lie, it just gets you excited and hyped during the action scenes. It's another big budgeted set of special effects that played off. The iron man suit looks great and it really gets you. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the action scenes makes you think about the cgi in the movie. So overall, the effects have a lot of effort.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are flimsy just like the movie. For the main character Tony Stark, instead of learning more like in the second one, he's just the ordinary hero. The kid in the movie serves more of a plot device and is a bit bland. The rest of the characters are mostly forgettable like the people who can burst into flames and more. So there's not much to offer with these guys. There just isn't. <br/><br/>So overall, Iron man 3 is one of marvels worst films. It may have done things right like the special effects are great, and the acting is good . But it's not enough to save it from its lackluster writing, and bland characters. Iron man 3 is so over-hyped that I think some people were a bit harsh on the second one. So bottom line: Its a waste of a screenplay, a waste of characters we watch for two hours, and it's overall a bad film. <br/><br/>Rating: D+ = 3.5/10<br/><br/>One more thing: This movie was so confusing that I even wrote a factual error about the plot that I had to remove. Well, I hope that doesn't happen again."
"GusF","Null","2","5","24 October 2015"," Deathly dull
","It looks nice and there are some nice ideas but the script is deathly dull and the film is incredibly slow. Robert Downey, Jr. is as great as ever, Guy Pearce is good fun as Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley is quite good as the Mandarin in the second half of the film but the rest of the main cast is forgettable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good actress but the character of Pepper Potts has even less of a personality than in the first two films. Harley is incredibly annoying. Why they thought that the film needed an annoying kid sidekick is beyond me. My favourite line is Tony's description of Trevor Slattery as ""Sir Laurence Oblivier."" The dialogue in the second half is generally wittier, on the bright side. The barrel of monkeys scene is certainly the best.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, both Downey and Kingsley played the title character of biopics directed by Richard Attenborough. Sadly, this film's director Shane Black is no Attenborough. It's not even anywhere near as good as Jon Favreau, whom I wish had returned as the director on this occasion. This was generally better received than ""Iron Man 2"" but I thought that film was considerably better. Honestly, I was so bored that I was waiting for Stan Lee's cameo for half the film in much the same way as I waited for Michael G. Wilson's cameo in ""Quantum of Solace"". That's...never really a good sign. There is some doubt as to whether there will be an ""Iron Man 4"". If there isn't one, I can live with that since I found that the films abide by the law of diminishing returns. The film did get one thing right though: War Machine is a much better name than Iron Patriot."
"tstromsn","1","2","5","8 July 2015"," Nothing made sense
","Saw this with a friend and we both agreed: All the dialogs between the characters felt cartoony and unrealistic. The main character is acting like an asshole with no feelings, and you have no sympathy for him. I actually wished him dead. He also fights better without his iron man suit, so one wonder why he would even need this suit. The best characters in the movie are the business man villain and the guy who acts the president. These actors give a convincing performance. Too bad they have very little screen-time. The story evolves more about Stark's personal life problems and past than much action with his iron man suit. At one point I was wondering if I was watching iron man. What's left is some mediocre CGI effects and action scenes that makes no sense; One example is a remote guided iron man robot who grabs a villain and flies high up in the air with him. Then the villain ripps of his head and both plumbs to the ground and die. If you were caught by a flying man, would you commit suicide? Add a lot of cliché and predictable dialoge and ending and you end up with a boring ending and a boring movie. This movie was yawnilly boring."
"shane-vasik","1","2","5","13 January 2015"," One of the worst movies I have ever watched....and I'm an action/comic fan!
","Okay, I don't want to overstate things here, so I'll just casually say that this is well and truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long, long time.<br/><br/>Where do I start? I can go on and on about how boring, stupid, repetitive, predictable, typical and unbelievable in the worst possible way this movie is. Despite the fact that it goes without saying the movie is based on a fantasy comic book superhero, this pushes the boundaries of idiocy and juvenile.<br/><br/>So, rather than write a 15 page diatribe on what is so poor about this waste of 2 hours, I thought it best to summarise these flaws in point form.<br/><br/>* Three missile-shooting helicopters are powerful enough to blow up a heavily fortified house, destroy several ""better model"" Iron Man suits, a dozen armour-plated vehicles and an entire Cliffside...yet his unsuccessful, aluminium-plated prototype survives - no, thrives even, saving everyone's life all on it's own as though the ""suit"" is it's own sentient being. * terrorists use heavily armoured helicopters, but they are obviously no match for a wooden piano flying through a triple-plated glass wall and, without deviation to its trajectory, 50 metres in a straight line through the air. * a 12 year old kid from Tennessee sounds like he's from upstate New York, is smarter than most college graduates, and talks/behaves like an adult. Seriously, why do action movies have kids in them to add a bit of ""Ying to his Yang"" only to make the kid a small version of an adult? * where did all those Iron Man suits come from? Suddenly he doesn't have a few - he's got 600 of them, and each of them can fly on their own, plan tactics, rescue people and attack the bad guys (that is, after they've identified who they are...all on their own). * how many explosions does Pepper survive? A cut on the cheek? Yep, that's enough to convince me she was ""lucky"" the entire building collapsed around her and not on her. * I still don't understand...what is the bad guy's problem? So he got stood up on a rooftop - that's enough to be an international terrorist? * Slow motion does not mean everything else slows down except for the main character...who can suddenly move in real time. That's another superhero altogether. * Why does Stark need his suit anyway? Without it, he's like the Hit-man and Solid Snake combined - dodging bullets, throwing bombs, kicking ass and being heroic all whilst being suave and cool and sexy. * Guy Pearce's performance was okay, but wasted on this piece of trash. Sir Ben Kingsley shows why he was knighted just for being the amazing actor he is, but this movie is well beneath his talents. Don Cheadle is a good actor who, unfortunately, seems to like picking crap roles. And Downey Jnr. is, well, the same in this movie as he has been in every single movie he's done since coming back from constant rehab and cocaine and rehab sessions. * and I thought they overdid the acrobatics with Legolas - it seems that Stark can never fall, get injured or be left alone with his nemesis without some sudden appearance from his ""suits"". * super Pepper takes down the Iron Man suit in one punch - despite a barrage of super-super fire-breathing henchmen unable to make a friggin dent. <br/><br/>I cannot believe that I wasted 2 hours of my existence watching this garbage. I've never seen anything worse in the 36 years I've been alive, and I doubt I will in the coming 36 years. And this is coming from a man who loves action movies, generally doesn't mind comic book adaptations, and is ever hopeful that the wider movie watching public will one day appreciate them more than simply those who are fans. But, in saying all that, these disappointments provide more than enough evidence to prove why, maybe, they are made too often lately. Let's hope this was the last movie with Downey Jnr., and Iron Man, and that Gwyneth Paltrow can get a real job...say, flipping burgers at McDonald's."

"Morbius_Fitzgerald","1","2","5","4 November 2013"," How the hell is MCU getting better reception with this crap than with The Incredible Hulk? Or...the first Iron Man movie?
","This really boggles my mind. How in the hell is Marvel getting better reviews from audiences and critics alike with this than with say...any of the other films they made. This is not normal bad comic book movie. This is Batman And Robin's elevation as a comic book film. I went there, I hated these last two MCU films THAT much (The Avengers and Iron Man 3).<br/><br/>So Tony Stark creates a remote control Iron Man armor to help him stop these explosions that happen everywhere that seem to be caused by a terrorist called The Mandarin. He suffers from panic attacks and insomnia (or some sort of sleeping disorder) and attempts to stop him.<br/><br/>Okay with that plot description, this movie sounds awesome. Why isn't it?<br/><br/>The first thing that started my questioning of the whole matter was when Tony gave his home address to an international terrorist and did nothing. People blame his state of mind but...a retard on ice would at least get a gun out or something. You could make the argument that he didn't know what method he'd use to bomb his house but in the climax (I know I'm getting ahead but you need to hear this) Jarvis activates a ""House Party"" maneuver which activates all 50 of his Iron Man suits. You'd think THAT would be of some help back then, even if Tony wouldn't be in the right frame of mind, couldn't Jarvis activate it for him like he did in the climax! 50 Iron Man suits against a couple of missiles, that wont work at all!<br/><br/>Then Tony flies away in his sacred #42 Armor (seriously, 50 suits, thats the only one he uses in the entire film) and is trapped there when it runs out of power. He meets up with a boy who is bullied and helps him with information about the terrorist (kind of paints the FBI in a bad light when they're outdone by a mentally unstable billionaire and an 8 year old). This should be the heart warming moments of the character and what does he do? Call him a pussy, gives him a weapon to use against bullies and leaves him on the side of the road when he's done with him. This is the guy we're supposed to sympathize with. This is the guy we are supposed to say ""we want you to win"" to. Who the hell wrote this script? The Producer's 12 year old? Whats your great way to make us sympathize with him in Iron Man 4? Draw a swastika on a Catholic Church helping out orphans?<br/><br/>I know this could be seen as ""nitpicking"" but that remote control armor is actually used a lot in this film. Almost to the stage where Tony is 20 feet away from the action, performing the action like it was some sort of video game. Let me ask you this question, if the character is not in any real danger, why should I care what happens?<br/><br/>So Tony then goes to the Mandarin's supposed hideout and he discovers that The Mandarin, Iron Man's greatest arch nemesis in the comics, is a part played by an actor while the villain is actually a business man who uses the terrorist as an excuse for a new super drug called Extremis and apparently, its perfect according to him. No one recognized this actor who was, according to the script, well respected? Not only that but this twist is Godawful. For those who want a comparison for the reasons why, Imagine a Superman film where Lex Luthor turned out to be a 15 year old girl working for her father's evil plan to make the entire population of the world, snowmen of George Takei. I bet people would hate that film while this film would get evermore praise.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, Tony kills this new villain (who is, if you can possibly believe it, the least threatening of all the villains in the MCU films), blows up his Iron Man suits which is actually my vote for the dumbest thing in this movie because its from radio transmissions and apparently Tony wired in a self destruct mechanism? So the villain could've wirelessly accessed the suits capabilities and set them all to self destruct? That is the dumbest move that anyone could actually make while owning these suits. He gets the shrapnel out of his chest (because a plot point that carried on through 2 and 3 quarters of 2 hour movies can easily be fixed in under a minute) and he throws the arc reactor into the ocean. His house is still blown up, his business is down the drain and he has no more Iron Man suits.<br/><br/>Do you see why I hate this film so much? I mean the acting and visual effects are decent enough but the plot and characters are so weak that I feel MCU has slipped severely in quality. Almost to the stage where making George Lucas in control of it would actually be an improvement. If you like this film, I wont judge but, I'm sorry, I just could not ""turn my brain off"" for this one."
"ovaltinejenkins10","6","2","5","19 October 2013"," At least it was better than Iron Man 2
","The third movie in the Iron Man franchise, which started out in 2008, has now been released. There was also a lot of hype surrounding this movie to see how it would fare beside other superhero franchises' third movies, such as Spider-Man 3 (2007), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and X3: The Last Stand (2006). X3: The Last Stand did considerably well at the box office making $459,359,555, but did not get a good review from any critic, scoring a 58/100 Metacritic. Spider-man 3 was a hug box office success collecting $890,871,626, but didn't do as well concerning its critical appeal, receiving only a 59/100 on Metacritic. So far the only third movie of a superhero franchise that has done well in terms of box office and quality is The Dark Knight Rises. Having a 78/100 Metacritic and $1,084,439,099 made in the box office, this movie was a great way to end the Batman series. So, how does Iron Man 3 compare to these other third movies?<br/><br/>Well, let's start out by saying that it would be pretty hard for them to make Iron Man 3 much worse than Iron Man 2 (I'm sorry to both of the people out there who actually liked that movie). The cast included Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow (spoiler, her head does not end up in a box), Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall. And I am going to go as far as to say that it was better than the first Iron Man as well. The movie starts out with a flashback to 1999 on New Year's Eve, and ends up connecting everything that happened that night to how everything ended. The feel of this movie is much more of a Dark Knight Rises' type, where everything actually feels dangerous, compared to that of Iron Man 2 where it ended with just another iron suit versus iron suit battle (which I am happy to say, does not happen in this one.) Although the movie has a serious feel to it, there is still a constant stream of jokes coming from Tony Stark, which makes him different from some other superheroes like the more serious Batman or Superman. But he still has to face his main villain which is a terrorist named Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley, who is somewhat of a Bond villain, but on a more realistic scale. This causes Stark to tell him his home address, and dares him to come and try to kill him, which results in the first of many Michael Bay worthy explosions throughout the movie. The other villain is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who is bent on getting revenge on Stark for what happened that night in 1999. Iron Man 3's best quality is that it is more about Tony Stark being a person with responsibilities, rather than just a man in, well, iron."
"Ge-off07","7","2","5","6 October 2013"," My Review after the 2nd viewing
","I wanted to review this film, but I felt I needed to wait until I saw the film a second time to pass final judgment. My score of 7 stands, but for different reasons than the first time watching.<br/><br/>Firstly, I was one of the people who were massively disappointed by the way Mandarin was handled. This was my main reason for waiting until a second viewing to review. But even before that letdown, I just felt like the film wasn't fitting in with the other Iron Man films.<br/><br/>After my second viewing, I focused some of my points. When it comes to The Mandarin, I accept the value of a good surprise in a film, which that was. I also understand that many people didn't know what a main villain the Mandarin was in the comics, so I can see how many saw this as a cool twist.<br/><br/>The second sitting also helped me articulate the main thing that makes this sequel not totally line up with the others for me. Basically, it's Shane Black. Shane Black is an awesome action writer, no doubt about it, and I love so many of the films he has written. That being said, so many of his themes from other movies are reused here and it makes it feel like more of a Shane Black action film than an Iron man film. Also, I kind of have a resentment toward having a little kid help the hero (it has been done way better in other movies, IMO). The young actor was good, I just feel that his part was a little...Shortround-y.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is great, all the actors put in good performances (especially 2013's go-to summer movie supporting actor James Badge Dale, this guy needs a lead role!) The plot , like I said has a huge twist. However, the ""going back to where it all started"" plot device is a bit tired, especially in a third movie. The story veered awfully close to Spider-Man 3 territory here. If one or two more coincidences from the past had been shoved in, it would have been really hard to buy. While it was a stretch, I am able to buy it this case, but just barely. The problem with reaching back and altering the past in a film is that you risk tainting the original story. The core Iron Man story did not get tainted here, but I'd be lying if I said the ""revelations"" in this film didn't make the past mythology murky for me. Aldrich Killian, briefly, was not a fully satisfying villain for me. I thought that Guy Pearce was great but since I wasn't really on board with the ""enemy from the past"" plot, I found him the least entertaining villain so far. Ben Kingsley, like the Mandarin or not, is hilarious.<br/><br/>The ending of Iron man 3 is very fitting, especially if it is the last time we see RDJ in a solo Iron man film. I think the 'arc' of Tony Stark's character is really dealt with well in the movie and the ending was very satisfying to me, even if the journey was a bit hard to swallow. Overall, I give it a c+. Easily my least favorite in the series and the only one that I feel I have any actual complaints about. Marvel's Track record is still pretty darn good in my book. Looking forward to seeing Iron man again in Age Of Ultron!!"
"Incendid","6","2","5","4 October 2013"," Satisfying us between Avenger movies
","Ciaran: I found this movie very disappointing and very over-rated. For these reasons- one, it created secondary plots that were never tied up or even left open for say another movie, the CGI in this film is up to date. Another thing that makes this movie disappointing is the lack of seeing Tony Stark as Iron Man, instead we saw him as a anxiety suffering detached mechanic. I will give the film credit for the first half as it followed a good story and built on and up the characters. The film also managed to update Iron Man's arch-nemesis The Mandarin. In Iron Man 3 they made him a somewhat threatening terrorist. But after the twist of finding out that the great villain The Mandarin was just an actor and Killian, a researcher of bio-something is actually the mastermind. All in short terms i found this movie to be okay for the first half, but after the twist i felt that the movie took a turn for the worst. 6/10<br/><br/>Jacob: No movie is flawless. There are plot holes in lots of famous movies but the thing to consider is how entertaining the movie is (strictly from the entertainment factor) and consider the problems after the viewing. Iron Man 3 is an entertaining movie for the most part. The problems are not ones that you have to dig deep to find but they are very clear and appear very commonly in the last half of the film. The beginning is brilliant with setting the tone, characters and subplots. The subplots are actually dropped or changed (for the worse)in the later half of the film. Tony Stark's anxiety attacks are completely forgotten and not mentioned again. Tony gets rid of his arc heart contraption that you would think he would of gotten rid of in the first place. A Middle-Eastern terrorist who is set up to be mysterious and one of Tony's biggest threats. That terrorist turns out to be a pathetic actor and the real mastermind is Guy Pearce's character who basically has some sort of weird pathetic grudge against Tony. This is disappointing because this terrorist is built up so much and replaced with a shirtless, womanizing weirdo with fire powers. This isn't a clever twist and his it's eye-rolling moments. The Dark Knight Rises sort of worked with it's twist because it is unexpected and Bane is not just a fraud. Pearce's character is set up as one of the villains in the beginning of the film so him taking the antagonist's role wasn't that hard to predict. The fact that he used a false antagonist symbol to distract the people was a clever idea but the flip-side of that was not all that satisfying. There is another problem that is brought up: it may be a little too predictable. However, the action and special effects are great, the humour is great, the chemistry that Tony has with Pepper, his guard and a little kid is fun to watch. Overall, it's not terrible but really fun."
"JoeStracke","7","2","5","3 October 2013"," Better than you would expect from a '3' film.
","I enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>With that summary statement out of the way (I sometimes tend to be esoteric in my analysis), I will touch on the things that I liked and did not like which should in no way sway the opinion you should make for yourself; ultimately (and obviously), a review of anything is just someone publishing a personal preference.<br/><br/>Liked (in roughly descending order of appeal): <br/><br/>-The dialog writing for the Stark character was, by far, my favorite of the four films featuring Robert Downey Jr. I really feel that the style of the actor and the character dialog have finally meshed into a brilliantly cohesive personality.<br/><br/>-The CGI work was nearly seamless. I do not know if this is the result of the film's post crew, or if it's just the improving industry technology: I just know that for a refreshing change for my capacity to suspend disbelief and enjoy the film wasn't constantly bludgeoned with overly-conspicuous FX.<br/><br/>-Far superior pacing over Iron Man 2 (no offense, Mr. Favreau the first installation is still my favorite of the Iron Man series). Specifically, the tendency for the second installation to side-track for superfluous humorous tangents was thankfully missing in this edition. I have nothing against comedy I just prefer it to be subtle or pace-sensitive in an action film.<br/><br/>-Casting: A believable child character (Ty Simpkins) that didn't continuously bring the story to a saccharine-cute halt. Also, the limited screen time for non-plot support cast was appreciated.<br/><br/>-Gag Reel in the special features. It should be a law for any and every film to have this extra on the DVD release.<br/><br/>Kudos for disparaging reference to the DC Comics upcoming film response to The Avengers. All apologies, but I'm a Marvel fan with a sarcastic streak who is apparently easily amused.<br/><br/>Disliked (in roughly descending order of annoyance): <br/><br/>-Another example of the sequel cliché need for 'more'. The apparent requirement of Hollywood to 'one up' the previous film in a series by piling on gratuitous action; knowing how a film is going to resolve itself before the first frame even rolls is insanely tedious. I understand that this peeve will never be addressed; they are produced this way because it is profitable to do so.<br/><br/>I'm also a hypocrite, as I purchased this DVD without ever seeing the film in theaters, knowing full well I was only reinforcing this practice by paying the film-makers for their platitudes. I can still hope the next film in the series deviates from the trend and relies less on fast cuts and bigger explosions, and more on talented screenplay, writing and cinematography (I will, however, still buy the Iron Man 4 DVD unless something utterly unacceptable and tragic occurs such as letting Michael Bay direct or recasting Downey).<br/><br/>-Formula plot: The fallen hero who rises to an underdog victory. It's used extensively because people like it. Hell, I like it. The problem is that it really doesn't do much to imprint itself on the part of the brain that likes to remember bits of art that strikes a uniquely creative chord. It's rather like having a slice of your favorite cake; pleasant but hardly memorable.<br/><br/>-Villains too derivative of the nemesis character in 'Terminator 2'; I could not stop my mind from generating the T2 signature percussive rhythm in all of the super-villain sequences.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>A post-script to screenwriters and directors: If you are among those who feel 'professional' critiques of films are the only credible measure of your work, then allow me a suggestion: Why not only read user reviews, and avoid anyone anywhere who gets paid to review films? In the information age, you need no longer prostitute yourselves to the thumb position of celebrity critics."

","Iron Man 3 was a total disaster for me. I am a big fan of Iron Man but the movie has nothing to do with the comics. Stop using so must these computers - visual effects and create a movie base purely in a comic story.<br/><br/>It was also unacceptable Mandarin character to be distorted like that. Mandarin is a powerful genius villain, one of the most dangerous Ironman foe and his primary sources of power are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and is worn on a specific finger (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28comics%29). In the movie Mandarin appears as a stupid actor, a puppet. Come on, give us a break. How Stan Lee gave his approve? I really don't know.<br/><br/>The film director ruined it completely; it was almost garbage....

","Iron Man 3 could have been one of the greatest superhero films of all time but ultimately failed to live up to its true potential. While Downey Jr. yet again delivers a stellar portrayal of Tony Stark and there are a few great action scenes the plot eventually crumbles. This movie isn't awful but it's just a major disappointment, I personally blame the moronic writing and direction. One scene in particular will enrage comic book and Iron Man fans alike, I am neither of these and was still baffled as to how such experienced filmmakers could make such a big mistake. There are so many reasons why this movie should have been great and so many reasons why it wasn't, this truly is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. I am now deeply concerned as to where Marvel is heading with their universe and i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way.

It did not follow the tone or the aspect of its predecessors and they wanted to make it more funny than it should have been. I did not like the villains, I felt them to be like too overpowered and their characteristics were like too much to swallow, but not enough chew. It was like you're all ""there, you have powers"" and I'm like ""Why?"" and you go ""Because!! now get to it!!!"" And the thing with the Mandarin it was just a big NO for me. It was nothing like what they offered me in the trailers. It's like when you go to the circus and the announcer tells you about this wild jungle cat and when you enter it's just a kitten with a wig. There was a kid in there and they wanted to make him all witty and funny and cute, but I personally hated him. I thought it was a completely unnecessary character. And another thing is that they were making funny comments when their lives were at stake or before a very intense near-death experience. I just didn't like that they wanted to be funny at inopportune moments of the story. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it was a big disappointment, although it had very good action sequences. And to top it all, it was based on Christmas time. Seriously, a Christmas movie in the summer. It should've been called ""Iron Man: Saving Pepper's Christmas"" and leave the ""Iron Man 3"" title to someone who knows what to do with superhero films."
"michael-j-ashton","5","2","5","19 June 2013"," Full of Inconsistency
","I have loved the movies leading to the Avengers film. The original Iron Man (IM1) movie is one of my favorites. However, I was deeply disappointed by the third installment. It is easily the weakest of the three Iron Man films due to a large number of inconsistencies present within the story line and may prove to be the franchise's jump the shark moment.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Robert Downey Jr.'s character portrayal of Tony Stark. The character is executed in Downey's quirky, witty, and fun style that I find funny and entertaining. However, in this film we are lead to believe that after kicking an entire alien army's butt in the most awesome way in the Avengers movie, the character now has some type of anxiety disorder or PTSD. I assume that the writer's think that Tony has to have some type of internal conflict in each film, an aspect which made this movie hard to stomach.<br/><br/>The kidnapping and abuse of Tony at the hands of a terrorist organization in IM1 didn't give him PTSD; it drove him to create Iron Man. The near death experience of being slowly poisoned in IM2, didn't give him PTSD or anxiety. He was depressed, but chose to seize the day at every instance driving race cars, throwing parties, ensuring the survival of his company and the survival of the Iron Man Legacy through War Machine. In this film, which starts on the heels of the Avengers, after totally and completely dominating an enemy in the most glorious way possible, we have to try to believe that Tony again has an internal conflict. Right. Where is the character growth? Why is he not better for the experiences of his last three films? Then we are lead to believe that Tony, a man of genius intelligence, outed super hero, and developer of the most sophisticated weaponry on the planet is going to let his house get blown up by a couple of tiniest helicopters I've ever seen in a movie. The guy fought back a dozen advance alien flying machines in the Avenger's movie. Come on.<br/><br/>The inconsistencies go on and on and on, and get worse and worse as the movie progresses. Tony fights the whole movie in a prototype suit with no weapons, but later can remotely control 50 suits that he doesn't use until the last scene; at which point they are torn apart like the are made of paper. Really? The enemy in the last sequence couldn't fly and had to touch the suits to damage them... The logical question is why didn't the suits just shoot at the enemy from the air? I almost walked out. The whole thing was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Most egregiously, in the last five minutes of the film they re-write everything that happened to Pepper, Tony, and cast throughout the whole film and re-define Tony's back story from the previous films. I don't know why they chose to do so, but if they were going to, they should have done it in a much better way and spent more than 30 seconds explaining what happened. The end of the film was like watching a Saturday morning cartoon or hitting the reset button on a video game system (only worse).<br/><br/>All said, I'm disappointed and almost saddened by this film. It could have been so much better. Someone is going to have a hard time repairing the damage to the storyline caused by this film."
"micahmatt-fcb","3","2","5","17 June 2013"," Could have been way, way better, but was not thanks to Disney
","Iron Man 3. It should have been the final chapter - the big one - the one that makes people say ""wow, that was a satisfying series!"" To be honest, this movie was like a mini-movie. It didn't feel like an Iron Man movie. There was no climax. This movie could have been the second film, but it wasn't a good conclusion to the hero we've come to know and love. Tony Stark is a fantastic character, but he didn't get his deserved justice in this final film.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate. The characters in this movie strayed away from the realism in the first two movies. Now yes, the first two movies were comic book material. But at least all the things that happened in the movie were scientifically or simply realistically possible. The third got into superpowers. Iron Man isn't really a superhero. He's a man in a suit, much like Batman. As soon as Disney mixed all the heroes together in The Avengers, it was free license to do whatever the heck they wanted to. They no longer had to adhere to realism - something that hurt the films ultimately. But this is not the main point.<br/><br/>My primary gripe with the movie is that the Mandarin was nothing like his comic book counterpart. The Mandarin was an epic character with charisma. He was dangerous and powerful. He could have been done well. But instead they ruined it by making Ben Kingsley play a fall guy. A cheesy mandarin double that would fit well into an Austin Powers movie. In fact, the portrayal of the flabbergasted actor revealed in the film felt like Sacha Baron Cohen's character, Aladeen in ""The Dictator"". <br/><br/>Guy Pearce is a great actor. He is one of my absolute favorites. But Disney's portrayal of the Mandarin was not true to the comics. Come on, it's not like the realism thing was present anyway. They already had Tony Stark fight aliens from another dimension when they mixed Thor into it. So why couldn't the Mandarin be the same character as in the comic books? The Marvel universe is already becoming cheesy. Why not go full out and present the characters as they were written?<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 could have been done better. They should have stayed on track with the Iron Man saga. But the movie felt like ""The Avengers - Iron Man"", a spin off of the Avengers. This is not the way to go. I don't blame Marvel. I blame Disney."
"Hitchcoc","7","2","5","17 June 2013"," Wow! Was It Really That Bad?
","My goodness. I've just read a series of reviews of this film. I had no idea it was so bad. I guess I'll have to un-enjoy it. Is that a word? I'm just an old guy who likes to go to movies. While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know. Kind of left me a little cold."
"illbebackreviews","5","2","5","17 June 2013"," If there is to really be an Avengers 2...well then, this is a bad start!
","I loved the first Avengers films and really enjoyed the first two Iron Man films, even if I have no nostalgic attachment to the character of Tony Stark. I had decided before the release of this film, to not watch any trailers and to have no idea of what movie to expect. Seeing as this review has come a little late, it will be SPOILER HEAVY! I was thoroughly disappointed by this film and would call it the worst of the trilogy...yes, worse than Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>SPOILER HEAVY: Since the events of 'The Avengers' and the alien attack of NY, Tony Stark has faced nightmares but only realizes that his nightmare is about to get worse as the Mandarin has shown his face and has begun to cause chaos. Tony Stark must find the Mandarin who turns out to simply be a drunk, idiotic actor playing out the bodyguard role.<br/><br/>The first hour had some laughs and had some good action and overall was heading off in a nice direction, even if the pacing was rather slow. The jokes came together nicely and I was expecting something nice and a great second half. However, the moment the plot twist happens I come to realize that there is no way that this film could pick itself up again. ""Why do we fall?"" ""To show Iron Man 3 that we can pick ourselves up again"" This plot twist is so absurd and such a slap in the face to Iron Man comic fans who have grown to love the villain, The Mandarin. Without being a fan of Iron Man, I myself found the entire second half of the film pretty bad.<br/><br/>The Mandarin's presence was definitely felt and I expected something that would end perfectly with some fun action, a sense of intensity and purpose but following the twist, the jokes went dry, the action sequences became rather engaging and Guy Pearce's villain was completely uninteresting and just not the same threat of the drunk actor.<br/><br/>This proves that Director Shane Black gave no consideration as to how his audiences may have felt, seeing as many were fans of Iron Man and the Mandarin. The overall direction that the film takes is poor. A great first half and a very poor second half.<br/><br/>Robert Downry Jr is fantastic as Tony Stark, and he will always be. Ben Kingsley was just brilliant as the drunk idiot and Guy Pearce did a great job, even if his character wasn't anything. Visually, this movie looks gorgeous and the attack on Stark's house and saving the passengers on the plane scenes were breathtaking however nothing else in the film comes off as memorable.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 suffers from poor writing, poor execution and just a terrible plot twist that makes what could possibly have been one of the best 2013 films, one of the most disappointing. This plot twist made me appreciate the twist in The Dark Knight Rises all the more...something which I hated."
"NusnakSpilkes","3","2","5","16 June 2013"," After all that noise and explosions, what was it about again?
","Robert Downey Jnr's acting in this movie summarizes the whole movie very well: half hearted, bored and tired, can't wait to get it over with. That's how he portrayed the character, I am sure that is what he was thinking for real, and that is exactly how I felt watching this.<br/><br/>Plenty of ridiculous CGI effects, that all look the same as every other movie with CGI effects these days, to the point that they are getting tiresome now. And the story.... well, what was this movie about again? Having just watched it, I can't tell you what the story was about. Did they hire some deluded psychoanalyst to write the script? It was a bad. What was the point? Except for the special effects, everything else was lame, forced, and none of the actors had their hearts in it. It was almost as if they, the actors, realized once they started filming this, that this was going to be a PAINFUL EXPERIENCE and this comes through in all their acting. With every word coming out of Iron Man's mouth I could imagine Robert Downey Jnr thinking ""how much more of this do I have to put up with?"" <br/><br/>Iron Man 1 and 2 were good. There was a story to be told. Iron Man 3 is just a mess of over the top, unbelievable special effects with no purpose. A colossal waste of time, believe me!"
"DarthVoorhees","4","2","5","14 June 2013"," Its only charm is in reminding you Marvel made 'The Avengers'
","I am honestly somewhat tired of superhero flicks. I just don't see any reason why I should care about anything Marvel makes because no Marvel film has any stakes to them whatsoever other than to make sequels. 'Iron Man 3' is just a wasted experience because Marvel only really cares about making 'The Avengers 2'. 'Iron Man 3's sole purpose is to remind you that Joss Whedon has an 'Avengers 2' up his sleeve.<br/><br/>'Iron Man 3' has the benefit(or some might say disadvantage) of having characters who should be developed by this point in time.There comes a time for these characters to grow up and they haven't done it yet. We forgive the hero saving the damsel in distress when they fall victim once but by 'Iron Man 3' I think Tony Stark should recognize the formula. 'Iron Man 3' would have you believe that Tony Stark has learned and experienced nothing during the course of this series. 'The Avengers' for all it's strengths and weaknesses presents a tough act to follow in that Joss Whedon throws everything at you. When we last saw Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man he narrowly escaped a time hole and a nuclear blast. 'Iron Man 3' wants to spend all it's time reminding you of this fact and how much it's changed Tony Stark. The problem is it really hasn't. Tony Stark has actually regressed between films. He repeats mistakes he should have learned not to make after surviving the first half of Favreau's 2008 film (which I admire all the more after seeing so many horrible imitators.) Instead of learning from the events of 'Avengers' Tony Stark merely goes into hysterics played for comic relief which really bring the film to a screeching halt. Downey's schtick is old because it is only schtick and not a character. A character would have come to some realizations by this point in time."
"balter_dan","4","2","5","11 June 2013"," Why, Marvel, Why?
","I've always been intrigued by superhero movies. Will the story be more about personal conflict, or will it be about the villain? Iron Man was an insanely good movie, 2 was disappointing, and this third one was bad. The Mandarin was a complete and utter joke of a character (which was a waste of Ben Kingsley's talents). He had no rings of power. In fact he had no powers at all. This, on top of Stark having armor that could withstand the mighty hits of Thor in the Avengers yet broke apart countless times from blows nowhere near as powerful as the God's, made this an altogether bad experience for me. Why it was ever approved like this is far beyond me."

The worst part (without spoiling anything) is a ridiculous plot twist which not only made the first act completely pointless but also encouraged me to give up with the rest of the movie.

"criticwithnoname","7","2","5","19 May 2013"," Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and witty dialog saves ""Iron Man 3"" from a shoddy plot and a passé villain
","The Good: <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s Performance: This goes without saying in an Iron Man movie. Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man/Tony Stark. He nails the role sublimely because the character he's portraying is virtually indistinguishable from how he acts in real life. Before this film, Downey's best portrayal of Tony Stark was in the first ""Iron Man"" when he goes from an egocentric war profiteer to an evolving hero who still retains the same wit and charm but uses it in a more responsible way. ""Iron Man 2"" hit the skids and completely disregarded all of the first film's character building progress and makes Stark more selfish and egotistical than he was in the beginning of the first film. In ""The Avengers,"" the writers, director, and RDJ played it safe and found just the right leeway of ego for Stark to play off the other characters without overshadowing them. In ""Iron Man 3,"" Tony Stark's ego and personality is flawlessly modulated in this film. While tormented from the events following ""The Avengers,"" he still retains the singular wit and charm at the appropriate levels that made him so enjoyable in the first one.<br/><br/>""The Avengers"" Transition: Iron Man 3 is the first ""post-Avengers"" film in their franchise and they dealt with the aftermath from ""The Avengers"" excellently. This is to say that they did not attempt to build off of its success with a bigger and more explosive epic. In fact there is very little action in Iron Man 3 in comparison. This is not a flaw because the story takes a step back from the action and deals with the development of characters and how they react to the events of ""The Avengers."" These events had profound effects on virtually every major character involved in the Iron Man universe, especially Stark. Everything in Stark's world is put into question from his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to why he continues to build Iron Man suits. The events of ""The Avengers"" also influence Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and America's homeland security strategy. The blow-back of ""The Avengers"" even plays a role in the villain's motives. The writers and director dealt with the aftermath of ""The Avengers"" in a very intelligent way. The jury is still out on how the blow-back will affect Thor and Captain American in their worlds but at least the first step after ""The Avengers"" is done right.<br/><br/>The Bad (Minor flaws in the film that are forgivable): <br/><br/>Shane Black's directing style: This is not necessarily a criticism so much as it is just pointing out that Shane Black directed this movie. Black is known for his ""buddy cop"" style movies laced with witty dialog, which for some reason always happen around Christmas. (I wondered about that for the whole movie) There is a noticeable shift in tonal ""gears"" at the beginning which is a little annoying, there is some exchange of witty repartee that is slightly over the top but after the first act, Black directs the movie excellently.<br/><br/>The Ugly (Major flaws in the film): <br/><br/>Shoddy plot: While the movie deals with characters and their life in the aftermath of quite possibly the biggest and most epic superhero movie ever made to date in a very competent way, the mechanics of the story are a bit problematic. Without venturing too far into spoiler territory, Tony Stark makes a tactical mistake which affects his ability to use his suits, until the climax when information is revealed which may cause audience members to question why didn't Stark do this earlier. Also audience members may infer that Stark makes one of the greatest biological discoveries in the history of humanity to resolve the final ""loose ends"" of the plot. (Do not read too much into it, the film doesn't read into it at all.)<br/><br/>Passé villains and plot devices: The most crippling part of this movie is the fact that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is past his prime. This is to say that he is an artifact of American cinema in a time which American culture is going in a different direction. Kingsley's Mandarin is an unholy union between Heath Ledger's Joker and Osama Bin Laden. The problem with this is both of these people are dead (RIP Heath Ledger we will always miss you as for Osama Bin Laden, good riddance). While it is true that Heath Ledger's Joker has left an indelible mark on American cinema which cannot be ignored, the time has come for a new archetypal villain. In the meantime, the Ledger Joker villain archetype is acceptable provided the actor does not do an impersonation of the iconic character. Kingsley's Mandarin delivers eastern militant lines a la Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda like Heath Ledger's Joker. This can be heard in the trailer. The delivery of Kingsley's lines is identical to that of a person doing a Heath Ledger impersonation. No more homage! No more rip offs! Move on! In keeping with things that are passé and need to move on, there is a very subtle political criticism of a certain President of the United States and it's not our current one. Yes! Almost four and a half years after he left office, American cinema is still Bush-bashing. George W. Bush has been bashed so much for so long that doing it in storytelling has become passé and unoriginal. Our government is even more inept and corrupt now than it was during the Bush era, there is an abundance of material from which to choose and criticize. Having a villain who opposes a President who is in league with ""Big Oil"" worked during the Bush-era, now it doesn't. While the script does employ a very clever plot twist to protect itself, the fact remains that it is time for a change in social commentary."

","Iron Man Three is the best yet! Seeing a different side, a more tender side if you will, of Tony, as Pepper has become so much more important in his life, is exactly what was needed to add a new dimension to the Iron Man. As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is both captivating and beyond fun to watch. Reckless and ruthless is a fabulous combination. And in this one, he has to use more ingenuity than he's ever been called upon to use before. When all looks lost, that's when Iron Man reaches down and pulls up even more genius. Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes is the perfect partner for him to be working with and Guy Pearce as the villain, Aldrich Killian, makes a tremendous bad guy. This one has a cool little twist in the plot in regard to the bad guys and frankly, I can hardly wait to see the next installment in this exciting series."
"jn2929","7","2","5","16 May 2013"," A Great Start for the Post-Avengers Marvel Films!
","I personally loved this film. I can understand why some are outright calling this a disappointment and a failure. Big Iron Man fans will most likely hate the film for what it did to the Mandarin. I won't spoil what they did for anyone reading this who has not yet seen the film but just know that they do something with the Mandarin that will leave many Iron Man fans enraged. I get it and I'm not saying calm down. If they did something like that to Joker in 'The Dark Knight' I would hate that film. Though I did roll with the twist and still enjoyed the film immensely and in my opinion it only got better as the film continued. Iron Man 3 started off the summer movie season in the right way, just like 'The Avengers' did the year prior. <br/><br/>I loved the first 'Iron Man' film and while I don't hate it, I thought 'Iron Man 2' was disappointing and unnecessary. As far as Iron Man himself goes he's not in the movie much except a few times in the beginning and the huge climax at the end. This film focuses more on developing Tony Stark and showing that in essence he is Iron Man, not the suit. The suit and him are one and I love that the film addresses that so thoroughly. I love that the film goes in a different direction than the other films, which is expected since Shane Black has now replaced Jon Favreau at the helm as the director. Iron Man 3 is the darkest of the Iron Man films while also have the most humor out of all of them. There was one scene with this kid that had me dying and marveling at how Tony actually said something like that. Like the first Iron Man film, Tony Stark is placed in a position where he doesn't have all his gadgets and he has to win using his intellect. Which demonstrates that the suit is not his greatest weapon, his mind is. Once again Robert Downey Junior is in the lead role and kills it as Tony Stark and I cannot imagine anyone else playing him at this point.<br/><br/>Though some characters did not get as much development as they should have gotten, but Iron Man 3 did what it set out to do and it did it very well. Also I don't know get what some fans are saying by calling the story a mess. How is it a mess? Sure, a lot of things happen but everything plays out very well and comes to a fine conclusion, albeit the ending is rushed.<br/><br/>I stand by that Iron Man 3 was a greatly enjoyable installment into the Post-Avengers Marvel Universe and left me very happy and satisfied. Though, my only fear is what Joss Whedon will do with 'Avengers 2' now which he himself has stated as well. Again I won't spoil what happens but know that it has to do with Tony Stark and if you've watched the film I think you know exactly what I'm talking about."

","Well Downey made a downer this time. Not that the movie doesn't have it's abundance of excitement and over the top action, but story wise, the film left a lot to be desired. I'm still thinking about the plot that introduced the Islamic looking Chinese villain called The Mandarin. The set up would have you believe that there really was such a character, but the reveal when Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) makes his secret known, all I could do was go 'huh'? I thought the Ben Kingsley charade would wind up amounting to something, but that was not to be. Instead, The Mandarin was a molten lava man who's evil power seemed to be making things hot. Rather feeble now that I think about it.<br/><br/>And what's with all the Iron Man suits? And why did they all break apart so easily? Now the psychic link between Tony Stark (Downey) and his armor was a cool idea, but some of the stunts they put the Iron Man suit through was a bit much. It got a little over done after a while and began to look monotonous. And if they're going to have Don Cheadle employ the War Machine gig again, at least give him something to do. In the climactic battle scene, he seemed to be more of an observer than a forceful participant.<br/><br/>I liked a few things, like the Barrel O' Monkeys stunt, and the humor was generally well placed, but this Iron man doesn't measure up to the first two. Then when Tony ditched the chest thingie at the end, I had to wonder how Iron Man was going to get back in action with the Avengers. I'm sure they'll figure it out, but why jump through those hoops when you don't have to. Even the after credits clip seemed disjointed and didn't offer the usual inducement to make your mouth water for the next Marvel flick. These guys have to come up with some better ideas."

","Damn. I hope this doesn't happen to Man of Steel. I hope they don't frontload it with comedy and dedicate only 20% of the movie to action/adventureespecially in a SUPERHERO movie.<br/><br/>Some movies, particularly comic book adaptations, don't put the title in the beginning of the movie, and when you finish with Iron Man 3, you'll know why. Okay, I'll just tell you: the original title had to be TONY STARK, because the film's trailer showed you Iron Man more than the film itself.<br/><br/>That's kind of unfair, albeit only slightly exaggerated. But, for the love of Marvel, it would have been nice to see an action-packed Iron Man movie. Hell, I would've settled for an adventure with Iron Man flying around.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, it was pretty dang funny. I laughed out loud and enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. once again as Tony Stark – when he wasn't a baby, that is. And when the few moments of action did appear, it was pretty exciting, though nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>Further, to the film's recognition, were the excellent special effects. It's always fun to see Tony's virtual reality toys.<br/><br/>Sleep deprived and sometimes stupid Tony challenges a terrorist to a fight when his best bud gets hurt in an ""attack."" For the majority of the rest of the movie, Tony plays detective to track the most obvious of villains and connections since his first movie in 2008.<br/><br/>The screenplay lacked an additional couple of necessary re-writes as the plot holes were everywhere. In addition, and as mentioned, the film holds no surprises whatsoever; whenever a scene appears – and you know exactly when that will happen – and we're supposed to be shocked, it comes out as more of an eye roll. And furthermore, the motivations were questionable, the doors opened by the script were barely closed and if they were, the answers were too easy and the cast, with the exception of Downey Jr (of course) and an incidental child, had almost zero chemistry or charisma.<br/><br/>And while the humor was incredible at points, and had some good old fashioned references for people my age, it got a little overzealous with the slapstick. Namely from one character, whom I cannot reveal as that's way too much a spoiler. But, then again, you will see almost every twist coming, so you'll know soon enough who was just funny enough for a 5-year-old.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie, but I came to see an IRON MAN movie and got something that spent far too much time with one-liners, a mostly suitless Stark and was just barely elevated from the disappointing Iron Man 2. And the first installment was fairly cliché and predictable as well, but it was Robert Downey Jr. fresh and the best he's been in any of the films, including The Avengers.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a funny, sometimes downright hilarious, film, but sometimes I would actually rather watch a superhero movie with, I don't know, the title character spending more time on the screen than his alter ego wisecracking and acting weak. If I wanted to watch a video with a whiny character with flawed traits, I'll just go to YouTube. It's cheaper, anyways.<br/><br/>IRON MAN 3 (3/5 Stars)"
"GreenMagnetReviews","8","2","5","4 May 2013"," A great 3rd movie to the Trilogy
","Shane Black and Drew Pearce definitely put more of a humorous twist in the third Iron Man movie; I was not expecting to get so many laughs.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this does not mean that you should not take it seriously because it was more of a comedy. Because it was a comedy, it allowed the movie to develop these great perks and ultimately it was a great aspect and addition that made a viewer like me rate this movie as an 8 out of 10. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, there is a flashback to 1999 which Stark explains how he created demons. A little bit more into the film, it shows Tony Stark beginning to suffer from Anxiety (possibly all due to the result and aftermath of Avengers). The beginning of the movie then really lured me into believing that this movie will obviously be about Tony Stark fighting his demons. Something smaller like his anxiety is a small psychological aspect that keeps the audience worrying what will happen next in this ending to the trilogy (kind of like when Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to fear for Batman's physical health going up against the Brute strength of Bane in The Dark Knight Rises). <br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is when Stark ends up in Tennessee and has to turn to a kid for help. Interaction between this billionaire and a pretty smart kid is also quite comical. But the kid was a great distraction and ended up saving Stark a few times when he was in need. <br/><br/>The bad guys are also not too bad. With the power of heat against iron suits, it forces Colonel Rhodes and Stark to eject from the suits which ultimately leaves them powerless against the genetically mutated antagonist. Again, this leaves the audience wondering how the good guys will follow up when they are in need or powerless.<br/><br/>Of course, the spoiler and biggest troll in the movie is the fact that 'The Mandarin' was a fluke. Some negative reviews really looked forward to a story with The Mandarin and Tony Stark. The hype the trailer built up definitely did a 180 degree turn around when they twisted the whole story into a comedy. However, I was still pleased to find that the antagonist was Aldrich Killian, the one doing the genetic mutations, the demon Stark created in 1999. This twist only changed the war of The Mandarin vs Tony Stark to that of Aldrich Killian vs. Iron Man. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I enjoyed Iron Man 3. The comical twist was definitely surprising but I found it appropriate for the setting. Tony Stark being self-centered and leaving the kid after the first fight with the mutants is still a reflection of himself. Killian utilizing The Mandarin as a fluke to get his own ways without being identified is showing that he is a true villain. (These actually were two great roles played by Pearce and Kingsley in my opinion by the way). Also, there was the part where Stark couldn't summon his Iron Man suit just due to the fact that they were closed inside a barn door where the kid lived and couldn't fly out. It's still a reflection of how smart Stark is but then it shows that small obstacles like a door could get in the way which allowed him not to look like a super hero who gets everything done right the first time; it shows he is still human and makes mistakes. <br/><br/>Other than that, the plot and story line was still great. Tony Stark had to deal with the demons he created, he had to mature and learn not to put his girlfriend in danger, and he had to realize that it's time to grow up and put things aside. <br/><br/>So... In the post-credit scene, he sought out therapy with Dr. Banner."
"saranyavalsarajan","3","2","5","4 May 2013"," A slight disappointment!!!
","After the thunderous evolution and the ultimate heart pounding battle in the first and the second part, a heroic and expanded third part was expected from the Marvel's marvellous superhero IRON MAN. But hard to say but the truth it is, the third instalment of the franchise is comparatively a disappointment, content wise.<br/><br/>Starting from the start, the earth shattering promos are amazingly wonderful and it did indeed create an urge in the minds of the viewers to watch the movie. The painful dialogues of Tony Stark of how he cannot relax even after having an amazing life and how he has to fight for Pepper, whom he loves the most, have been sentimental enough to bounce up the eagerness in our hearts. Of course, these elements are more than enough for a faithful Iron Man fan to watch its third part.<br/><br/>Coming to the movie, Iron Man 3 starts with the year 1999 when Stark (Robert Downey) was the arrogant and the self obsessed 'machine maestro'. The small prequel shows how he urged some people to be the bad and the destructive. The movie then jumps straight to 2013 when he is a changed man with feelings and love in his heart and of course with his new identity of that of the Iron Man. But what done cannot be undone in life and that is what exactly happens in Stark's life. The past haunts him and this time in the form of a hell named MANDARINE and it breaks him nearly in a way that it almost takes his life. But Stark is Stark! The man comes back and this time with his automatic, ultra magnificent and highly developed suit. Oh! Correction; SUITS. Yes he has back up this time. Stark, Pepper and Rhodes showcase their action best and well, Pepper can become a big surprise for you. <br/><br/>After all said and done, unlike the promos, the movie does not show up to as much as expected when it came to the storyline. The first and the second instalments indeed gave us a breakthrough to action heroes and their stories, but this time, there are certain disappointments. Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadale and Guy Pierce have portrayed their best in the movie. In fact Pierce might even surprise you. But more than them, the actor whom everyone was looking forward to was the Mandarin played by none other than the one of the most versatile actors of Hollywood, Sir Ben Kingsley. But alas, the character has not been much utilised and the actor has not been exploited much. His short and kicking appearance in the movie will be remembered though. <br/><br/>There is no doubt about the technical aspects of the movie as the suits have been improved and also the action packed sequences will take you off the edge. The action sequence in the air when Iron Man saves 14 inmates of a plane is one of the best sequences of the movie; the next one to be the climax action sequence. There are fireworks and fire blasts in the sequence that will make you scream for more. The sets are magnanimous and the Stark mansion is one to look forward to.<br/><br/>If you are an Iron Man lover, then there is no way that you are going to miss this third part. Go for it this weekend."
"peakcrew","8","2","5","2 May 2013"," Just about as good an action movie as you will get
","First, the disclaimer. I used to read Iron Man comics regularly in the 1970s. He was one of my favourite super-heroes, because he relied on technology, not silly radiation-induced changes or other impossible super-powers. However, it has been years since I read a comic, and I don't remember any particular villain.<br/><br/>That said, this is possibly the best Iron Man movie in the sequence so far, a bit ahead of the first movie, and waaaaaayyyyyy better than the pile of manure that was Iron Man 2 (which is so bad that I have only seen it once). However, I'm not sure this is the science-fiction film I wanted to see, but it is the Die Hard movie that we didn't get earlier in the year. Yes, I know that Iron Man isn't just the man in the suit - it was always the man, but this film spent a bit too long with Downey out of the suit.<br/><br/>That said, in terms of pace, construction, internal consistency and cleverly different uses of memes (a child in a movie that wasn't irritating!), this was a cracking adventure movie! Lots of well-filmed set-pieces, appropriate humour, and just enough intelligence to keep me thinking. Robert Downey Jr once again shows what a good actor he is (I wonder if he ever thought he'd be *this* big during the bad prison/rehab years?), and his co-stars were equally solid, with the exception of Ben Kingsley. I've always thought him to be overrated, and his impression of Johnny Depp impersonating Keith Richards was ... well, not very good.<br/><br/>I know that there are folks out there that are having hissy-fits because this film doesn't conform to their idea of how it should have gone, but the idea of a really nasty villain actually being a front for a money-making organisation for its own profit fits well with the world today. Yes, super-heroes need super-villains in order to exist, but Killian was a super-enough villain for these purposes.<br/><br/>Will I add this one to the DVD collection? Yes. Do I look forward to any further films in the series? Yes, as long as they don't mess with the central cast.<br/><br/>A great 8-star movie."
"lasttimeisaw","6","2","5","30 April 2013"," Iron Man 3
","Arriving before its North American landing, IRON MAN 3 pulls off a momentous debuting in its international market, I saw it in a plain 2D version and, about this franchise, IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) is a left field coup, a middle-aged superhero to clinch the youth-dominated market, only Robert Downey Jr. could nail it with dapper openness and wisecracking debonair. So within six years span, a fourth cranked-out (if one counts THE AVENGERS 2012, 5/10) comes on strong this year to ignite the summer powder keg. Personally I skipped IRON MAN 2 (2010) though I still possess the DVD, and the only reason why IRON MAN 3 interests me is the Chinese element, reportedly three Chinese actors are on the slate of the cast, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan and Jing Wu, but it turned out to be an utter scam, only Xueqi Wang appeared in about 3 seconds in 2 fleeting scenes with one line ""Nihao"" (""hello"" in Mandarin) and so is Ben Kingsley's ""The Mandarin"", the ostensible ringleader of the terrorists (more Al-Qaeda than mandarin). <br/><br/>So what this new episode has offered to its devoted fanboys apart from the cookie-cutter template of the mega-Superhero action flicker? Since there are no succour from his fellow The Shields' teammates, Iron Man 3 perfunctorily opts to mass-produce the iron-clad robots to rescue the world (perish the undying human mutants), a lame and opportunist move to simplify the mess it creates and spurn any logistic plausibility (at least notify us how to kill mutants for good since they can regenerate themselves under any terms of damage), not to mention the cliffhanging twist of Pepper Potts, maybe it is all written in the next sequel. <br/><br/>Fans will never get enough of raking and levelling, it is undeniable that the demolition of Stark's mansion is visually stunning and apocalyptic, and the esprit-de-corps of the plane-wrecking rescue is also worth the wait (thanks to the telltale trailer), but in the end, the inevitable face-off is a kill-joy, compared with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012, 8/10), IRON MAN 3 looks as feckless as a light-hearted comedy, and its success can mainly be indebted towards Mr. Downey's omnipotent appeal, a rakish fop who owns everything and is sternly faithful to his partner (although a certain degree of promiscuity is a requisite), and more alluring, he can create superheroes. <br/><br/>Paltrow has more action sequences demanding out of her gaunt physique, and also shoulders a turnabout climax in the end, but still a trophy secretary-lover. Guy Pearce is a common-or- garden villain here (not as remotely interesting as in LAWLESS 2011, 8/10 last year), Ben Kinsley on the other hand, is the comic relief (besides Tony Stark) here, wackily inconsequential but a timely buffer from the intensified situation. Don Cheadle is ham-fisted as the other iron fighter and Rebecca Hall does evince cursory nuances for her expendable character. Among others, James Badge Dale (from SHAME 2011, 9/10 and FLIGHT 2012, 7/10) finally found his stepping- stone into mainstream showbiz, his indestructible henchman even makes his boss pale in comparison. <br/><br/>A puff of fresher air comes from the interaction between Stark and a fatherless boy (Ty Simpkins) at a rustic Tennessee setting, with jocular ripostes and a paternal bond affectingly enriches Tony Stark's personality and one plainly wishes this part would be more to offer. However, as the turnover rate has been accelerated dramatically these years in the superhero assembly-line, IRON MAN 3 is a serviceable vehicle to appease its core audience's anticipation, and if put into a larger picture, it is not innovate enough to be a game-changer as its prototype, it is just another helluva sequel, trite but lucrative. But it will be a sad sack if Mr. Downey keeps churning out the persona into his fifties, it could be a grand farewell for the trilogy, and future cameos are warmly welcome."

The suspense of the villain was literally an insult.

BITCHIN'! It has all the action, tech and humour of the first two movie on steroids.<br/><br/>Now at the first I couldn't understand why so fans bagged this movie out something chronic. But after talking to a comic book fan about the progression of the comic book storyline I kind of understand their disappointment.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you're looking for it to follow the traditional storyline of the comic books you're not going to be happy.

","Iron Man 3 was an excellent treat for the eyes, as well as the RDJ fan we all have in our hearts. A careful mixture of Action, Comedy and Drama with excellently executed CGI made this movie appealing to most of our senses, and despite the fact that the Story could have taken a more realistic touch about the military functioning, the dynamics of Tony and Pepper's relation, and the whole part about Tony recovering from his inner demons made the minor problems look insignificant. I am just afraid that the way the movie ends, and with all the rumors going on the internet, we might not see Iron Man for long. Pepper Potts was a nice surprise, WARMACHINEROX, but if someone really made my funny bone tingle, it was the Mk 42 suit, the prodigal son!"

"Skaathar","8","3","10","8 May 2013"," A lot better than what other reviews here say...
","I don't normally write reviews, but after reading a lot of negative reviews on this movie I thought it deserves a more honest review from someone who watched it with an open mind. <br/><br/>First of all, if you're a comics fanboy and you want the movie to closely adhere to the comics and not do anything contrary to that, then yes you won't like it. <br/><br/>For those who have a more open mind and can simply watch a movie without expectations or preconceived judgments, then this movie is actually quite good. <br/><br/>In terms of story, I'd actually say it was better than the first Ironman movie. The pacing is better, and the story is a lot deeper. Of course it doesn't quite have the WOW impact of the first movie simply because the first movie had that ""first time wow factor"" involved. Here, the suits are pretty much what you've seen before. But the action is better than almost any Marvel movie to date. Only the Avengers comes close to the action.<br/><br/>There are a lot of funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie is a lot more serious than the first 2 Ironmans. So give this movie a shot.

"monkeyboy12121-414-225890","9","5","21","25 April 2013"," On par with avengers. Nuff said.
","Well let me start by saying that Shane Black did a fantastic job with iron man 3 and you can really see his directing style shine throughout the whole film. The plot driven film with its twists and turn unravel and definitely does not disappoint. <br/><br/>The film doesn't need to lay any background as the first 2 films did but dives straight into the plot, where Tony (Downey) is faced with a new adversary- the Mandarin (Kingsley), who is amazing in the film. The Mandarin threatens everything that Tony loves and cares about and goes as far as attacking Tony in his own house. <br/><br/>The many twists in the film are great and definitely separate it from Iron man and Iron 2, the is a lot of Tony out of the suit showing his vulnerable side rather than being an invulnerable machine all the time, which was definitely a change and was very intense. However, the plot driven film (although brilliant) did lack action at some points and it unloads it all at the end in a huge bravado of explosions and action (very good indeed) which some may prefer but many would have probably prefer more 'Iron man' action peppered throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>This film is one of the best i've seen, it has action, comedy and a great plot. Also the Stan Lee cameo was brilliant. This is definitely worth a watch and of course there is an after credits scene. <br/><br/>Enjoy"
"estebangonzalez10","8","4","16","29 April 2013"," The third time is the charm
","¨Ladies, children, sheep... Some people call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. Lesson number one: Heroes, there is no such thing.¨<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is the first film following the events of The Avengers, and if you wondered if the movie was going to lose entertainment value considering it shifts the focus back to only one superhero, you were wrong. Despite not having all those great characters together, Robert Downey Jr. manages to capture the audience's attention once again with his vibrant portrayal of Tony Stark. He has been the main reason why I 've enjoyed these films so much because they are just a perfect fit. New director, Shane Black (Lethal Weapon), who worked with Downey in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, knows that the secret to the success of this franchise is letting Downey be himself and focus on his character. In this third film Starks is stripped down of his toys and questions whether or not he is worth anything without the suit. The Nolan effect which has been a key element in superhero movies is present at the beginning of the movie. We see a much more vulnerable Tony Stark, who is suffering from panic attacks due to the events in The Avengers, and who makes mistakes like putting his beloved Potts in danger due to his big mouth. This first part of the movie didn't work very well because it felt like a different kind of hero, but the effect wears off real quickly and Starks is once again back to his normal self once he realizes he is what makes the suit and not vice versa. Having his character stripped of his toys and having to manage to depend on simple things once again to defeat his foes is what made this film so entertaining. It was like if Stark had to go back to the basics and rediscover himself, although he never loses his goofiness. The villains in this film were also a huge improvement from its predecessor. This might not be as great as the original Iron Man, but it is an improvement from the first sequel. Black did a decent job following Jon Favreau's work and he manages to keep the franchise afloat. <br/><br/>Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has to face a new set of villains in this third film which takes place after the events of The Avengers. A terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is terrorizing the world through several explosions across the globe. Meanwhile Tony has found himself absorbed trying to perfect his suits and may have crossed the line trying to overprotect his love interest, Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). The reason behind his obsession is that he can 't afford to lose what he loves most. When Stark threatens The Mandarin, his army destroys his home leaving him for dead. Stark has to hide out while he figures out more information about this terrorist. He discovers some information about an AIM program run by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) which seems to be involved with the well known terrorist. Without being able to use all his equipment and technology, Stark is forced to use his intellect and capabilities to defeat his new enemies, while at the same time trying to protect Potts. Along his quest he makes some new friends, like the young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps gather some materials for him to work with, and counts with his always reliable friend, Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle). Rebecca Hall also has a small role in this film as Killian's assistant, and Paul Bettany lends his voice once again to Jarvis. <br/><br/>As you would expect, the visuals in this film are great and the action sequences are also very entertaining. The two hours go by in a flash thanks to some decent pacing. The franchise doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it still offers some great summer popcorn fun entertainment. Iron Man 3 is the perfect way to start off the 2013 summer and we can only hope the rest of the films keep this streak going. I loved the little twists and turns the film takes here by making you think it is going to be so much darker than the rest of The Avengers, but then all of a sudden it returns to its playful self. The Marvel universe is one that doesn't have to be taken so seriously because we have fun with the lightness of the characters and situations. The entire spin with The Mandarin was incredible. I wasn't too pleased with the opening minutes of the film considering Stark was much more vulnerable and not as fun as his usual self, but once he got his confidence back everything seemed to play out really well. Black is a master at mixing some great action scenes with tons of comedy (Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are proof of that) and we see it once again with Iron Man 3. Downey Jr. continues to deliver with his clever lines and charismatic self. He is the only reason we need to want to go see this movie.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"chrismartin181-1","9","4","16","25 April 2013"," Everything you'd ever want from an Iron Man film
","After The Avengers set the bar so high last year in terms of how to make a super hero movie truly fantastic there's been a lot of pressure on Iron Man 3 to match it's success. Does it succeed? S'pose you'll need to read on. Or watch the film, whatevs.<br/><br/>Speaking just about the Iron Man films here I'm willing to say this is the best in the series. Iron Man showed a great origin story and it's sequel, as much as it was a great little ride, was a little underwhelming when compared directly to the original. It just didn't seem to be on the same scale and there was a feeling that something new needed to be brought to the table to make it feel fresh. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is the film you hoped Iron Man 2 would be. It brings new elements to the story and the decision to give Tony Stark panic attacks and anxiety problems is one that I feel works wonderfully in the film. He's still cocky and in that suit virtually indestructible but showing that weaker side, his inner demons eating him up, makes him seem far more relatable and more of a 'real' man than this kick ass invincible human he has become since the other films and The Avengers. <br/><br/>I also like how what happened in The Avengers is talked about sometimes and not just glanced over as something that happened at some other unrelated time. It's the presence of gods and aliens and worm-holes in New York that have pushed Tony over the edge which makes sense really. Finding out about all that stuff and being the peoples' hope to defend them from it all will fairly mess a guy up. <br/><br/>No characters fade into the background here and everyone, the heroes and villains of the film, put on a great performance. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are probably my favourite movie couple ever. They have issues with one another but the lengths he goes to to protect her remind you that the love is there. <br/><br/>In terms of story I think it's just above standard comic-book movie fare that changes the focus just enough to make it stand out from the other films. Whereas the Iron man series has usually been machine vs machine, Iron Man 3 changes the formula more to machine vs super humans. There's little twists here and there but nothing to over complicate or at the same time really revolutionise the story.It provides a great vessel to showcase the incredible action sequences and relationship development between characters. <br/><br/>Speaking of the action is as spectacular as you'd expect. There are never really any moments of slow down as the film goes from action scene to action scene with elements of the story acting as bridges between them. Two particular highlights are the Stark household being blown up by 100 explosions and a great scene involving Iron Man saving people as they fall out a plane. <br/><br/>Fun fact everyone- the plane scene was actually shot with a sky-diving team actually falling through the air to give it an extra edge of realism instead of just shooting it on a green screen. It really pays off and makes you appreciate the extra mile the film makers are willing to go to make these scenes truly epic. <br/><br/>The finale, without spoiling any of it, is completely awesome. It's everything you could ever want if you're an Iron Man fan or indeed a fan of action movies in general.<br/><br/>Another element that works in Iron Man 3's favour is the humour that rarely misses it's mark. It's not enough to cheapen the film and make it feel goofy but the odd remark here or there just keeps the film light enough and give it a personality. Stark's impromptu nicknames he gives to people never fail to get a chuckle. <br/><br/>So to return to my first question- Is Iron Man 3 as good as The Avengers? I'll put it like this. If The Avengers is a massive cooked breakfast buffet with trays upon trays of delicious food, Iron Man 3 is a specific tray of perfect bacon.<br/><br/>The Avengers felt like more of a special event bringing lots of exciting characters and stories together while Iron Man 3- while not quite the event The Avengers was, stands up by itself as a terrific action comic book film that ends the Iron Man trilogy on a massive high- assuming there won't be an Iron Man 4 of course."
"achyutaghosh","9","3","11","1 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 movie review- All kinks ironed out
","Expectations from Marvel were high after last year's excellent Avengers, and the disappointment that was Iron Man 2. While it seems to be the last of a trilogy, the good news is that it ends with a bang. Iron Man 3 is full of thrills, verve and humor- a big budget summer blockbuster firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>""Ladies, children, sheep. Some call me a terrorist. I say I am a teacher"" - Mandarin<br/><br/>Feeding on jihadistic impulse, the Bin Laden styled Mandarin seemingly emerges out of nowhere as the biggest terrorist threat the world has seen, coordinating random attacks across the world, and hacking his way into the homes of ordinary Americans. when Happy Hogan gets injured in one of the Mandarin attacks, Tony Stark, who is still suffering from anxiety issues after his epic defense of New York in The Avengers Movie, issues a challenge to the Mandarin and promptly gets bombed out. Flashback sequences talk of Adrian Killich requesting Stark's help for a new technology that reanimates destroyed limbs. while Stark declines, Killich rises over time to become a magnate in his own right developing the Extremis virus, which can make human bombs out of subjects, creating a new world of terror.<br/><br/>Ironically, Iron man 3 is more about Tony Stark, and less about the suit. the movie has two distinct parts- the first is more of a detective adventure, the second is balls out VFX extravaganza. After the initial reversal, Stark connects the dots between the Mandarin and Killich, and then brings them down in a dizzyingly spectacular finale where an army of remote controlled Iron Man suits take on an army of Extremis virus powered super soldiers, at the same time rescuing the US President and Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. The party trick this time round is the self assembling suits that add to the fun and unpredictability. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is an all out Robert Downey Jr show- he completely at home as Stark- Marvel has revived Downey's career the same way as Downey's act as Stark/Iron man is unparalled by any other star playing a super hero. He is spot on as the boy genius who does grow up, he makes everything look so easy whether rescuing people mid air, bantering with friends and enemies or dishing insults. Guy Pearce as the nerd turned terrorist is delightfully campy- after all this is a comic book, while Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is the funny twist no one will see coming. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow reprise their roles as Cody Rhodes and Pepper Potts. Having written the Lethal Weapon movies, Director Shane Black has impressive action movie credentials, best exemplified in Iron Man 3's script- every frame left me either awestruck or guffawing. Full of liberal doses of humor, with not a single dull moment. <br/><br/>""You know, it's moments like these when I realize how much of a superhero I am""- Tony Stark<br/><br/>I agree you are the best Marvel can offer, Mr. Stark. After watching Iron Man 3, happy to report that the state of the superhero film industry is in good health. Iron Man 3 builds on its traditional brand values of visual effects, humor and technology showcase, along with a smashing performance by Downey and a script that is fast, funny and whimsical. Good for two-time watch- 9/10"

","After the flop of IronMan2 but given the high-five Avengers Assemble, I decided to give IronMan 3 a chance. And I do not regret it.<br/><br/>Firstly unlike the comics I read in my youth where superheroes could accept without blinking Aliens (which is what human-like Loki and Thor are) followed by an invasion of Chitauris (less and less humanoid), we see Stark coming up with accepting things ourselves would take quite sometimes to digest. T Stark also has to come up withe the consequence of his behaviour in the past. In short the missed opportunities of IM2 are reworked and this time they are finally reflected upon and amends are made.<br/><br/>True, Disney being Disney they introduced a kid and I admit I had a gag/heave moment but the kid cheesy story is quickly sorted out and the interaction is rather limited (bless you RDJ, kids are either stellar scene thieves or kill-joy meaningful text lines).<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow was good, very good. in fact, she is perfect match for RDJ/TS so go girl power... The villain was unexpected and good. Not perfect but quite decent though I am still wondering why he chose to be a villain unless as per IM, it got personal... My husband whose youth and teenage years were MARVEL comics free (yes these people do exist, they are rare but they exist) enjoyed the movie and loved B Kingsley who is a marvellous actor. Whose comic timing was showing in the Mrry Wives of Windsor (yes I remember that TV movie).<br/><br/>So the Mandarin: no spoiler here... but The Mandarin/Ironman is just like the Manhattan Attack/Avengers for MARVEL, a way to exorcise and push to where they belong the bogeymen of Bin Laden. Mandarin tapes are crying out loud Osama and Manhattan Buildings destruction by the space whales was the twin towers (I live in Europe) Does MARVEL feel it is time to move and call these /waful /people for the cartoon characters they are just like when they started to show on telly Hogan's Heroes.<br/><br/>Regardless it was enjoyable,made me think about time and how people start to digest and overcome the emotional consequences of RL tragedies. As for the post credits scene, it was a pleasure to meet again the Hulk. 'we have a Hulk' and I hope to see Ruffallo in his own movie, he deserves it.<br/><br/>Go and flock your movie theatres. Enjoy it. Have fun. Do not listen to the Moaning-Myrtles. Any show who respects women, is uplifting, where the hero admits to PTSD and imperfection and where baddies get really punished by where they have sinned ... oh, go, guys, you will not regret it! 9/10 because I very seldom give 10"

","Take off the hype, what do you really get? Action? Yes. ""Good"" acting? Sure. A lot of CGI? Yes. ""Cool"" new gadgets? Yes. Too much? Yes. Do you want me to stop? Yes, please.<br/><br/>This movie was indeed too much. Now, as a fan of any comic-book adaptation film I didn't find this as entertaining as many other people did (Especially the people in the cinema). Too much cheap jokes, too much CGI-action, too much... everything. There were bombs flying everywhere and I was quite surprised that the cinema itself didn't blow up.<br/><br/>Now, the cheap jokes thing - I know that's a big part of Tony Stark as a character, and I think Robert Downey Jr does that great. The thing is, you can't rely on those things and think that it will work all the time because it does become too much. What we have now is that everyone is Tony Stark, everyone keeps bringing us the cheap jokes, everyone does the exact same thing that worked in the first place when Robert Downey Jr was himself was the only one doing it, though I have to say that I did chuckle a few times. But we even had extras who were bringing us the cheap jokes - and that should tell you a lot about this movie and what it has to offer.<br/><br/>The part where we get to know who the Mandarin really is was actually quite good and relieving in a strange way because I wasn't too sure if Iron Man could handle it as a superhero (which was a problem for me). Ben Kingsleys performance was also great. But what does this tell you really? For me, it told me that not only does everyone act like Tony Stark, but the whole movie is Tony Stark. Once again, a big cheap joke.<br/><br/>There were indeed some plot-holes but I don't think it's anything to take seriously, since the movie itself obviously didn't do it. And I really liked the moments where everything got serious, and I loved Guy Pearces performance and think that he was the heart of the movie. But then again, when he started to shoot fire out of his mouth... As Don Cheadle said - ""Really?"""

This brings the momentum of exciting tense moments down or even make the overall story less exciting.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the beginning the ""villain"" is mysterious and interesting, but in the end he's cliché and uninteresting. Sadly the worst villain of the trilogy IMO. But that's my opinion I think a lot disagree with me on this one. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The build up in the first half of the movie makes you expect something much more different than second half actually shows us. This normally isn't bad, but I was so excited for those expectations I had. It just didn't come. But still the last epic battle is very awesome.

","This travesty reminded me of a cynical comment I received on a forum the other day commenting on how most media and press releases are ""dumbed down to the level of a 12 year old"". Iron Man 1 was funny and intelligent. It had action and a story line that any interested 12 year old could follow and maybe even learn a bit about how truly nasty evil can be. As an adult I found the arms dealer gets a conscience exploration compelling. But in 3 we get something that seems to want to insult adults that go and see ""childrens"" films, and which manages to insult the 12 years olds as well ! I remember being an intelligent 12 year old, looking back I knew and instinctively perceived much more than I was given credit for. 3 seems to revel in insulting anyone who even took a passing interest in reading a comic as if none of the material really matters. I know its ""just a film"", but this is a film that made millions upon millions ! Why ? I don't understand why it was not a huge financial flop. Go and make a film like 1, not this insult."

Robert Downey Jr will lose his gift just as Johnny Depp did if he does a couple more of such films (which he already signed contracts for). <br/><br/>Tony Stark says in the film that he will take revenge for Happy. I wholeheartedly second that and demand that Iron Man goes after those who removed Jon Favreau from directing Iron Man. With Jon Favreau all humour, wit, lightness of touch, and operatic dialogues have gone from Iron Man. You can say all you want about Iron Man 2, but it had great acting from RDJr and Sam Rockwell, it was funny and it was full of character and characters.<br/><br/>What we have in Iron Man 3 is a walking corpse of an 80s film with loads of CGI. No, actually... Damsel in Distress? Chained by handcuffs to a metal frame? I take the 80s statement back. This is clearly a confused mummy suffering from a hangover from the 60s."

","As soon as The Avengers finished I said to myself ""that was a fun payoff to a mediocre build-up but I'm done with Marvel movies now."" I love movies big and small but I'm not a comic book fan and these superhero movies are a formulaic fad that I wish would fade away soon to let another movie-phase through. However, the marketing and the fact Shane Black was writing and directing Iron Man 3 started to make it a one-off exception. Then the reviews came in and the response was mediocre to terribly poor. I really like Black for Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang so I was surprised he could disappoint this badly. The only movies that failed this bad for Marvel have been the Hulk and Thor movies as well as that abysmal third X-Men movie but that's usually because of the poor directors behind the camera. Iron Man has always been a highlight of the series.<br/><br/>I went to a Shane Black talk this Summer at the LA Film Festival and he asked the audience ""who went to see that piece of s--t?"" He defended himself that he wanted to make Tony more vulnerable and have his machinery break every once in a while but then he admitted defeat that it just didn't work. At first it put me off but then I couldn't help but be curious, what went so horribly wrong? I don't care about official comic book canon so any changes don't particularly faze me but Black changed Iron Man far too significantly from the other movies for it to be ignored. I like the idea that he's trying to show growth with the traumatic events of The Avengers having a big effect on Tony but it's so clumsily handled that it doesn't work. The film isn't actually that bad in its first 45 minutes but when it gets into the meat of the story is when it starts to become ridiculous.<br/><br/>It constantly struggles with momentum, stopping too much for Black's taste in quirky self- referencing humour and none of the characters who deliver that comedic relief suit it, particularly Don Cheadle. The villains and the special effects simply weren't believable, probably due to a lack of explanation. Every left turn or surprise in the story ended up lowering the stakes or taking me out of the moment. But the biggest problem is that Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark of Iron Man 3 is just too mean-spirited to support which is a big problem as there's not nearly enough Iron Man action, and this is coming from the most casual of viewers. The hope for this film crumbles like far many of the suits do when they hit the tiniest of roadblocks. I'll be avoiding the rest of Marvel but hopefully Black can redeem himself with an original and R-rated film like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.<br/><br/>4/10"

Boring wet floppy fish of an Action movie. I was hoping for kick ass action, big effects, a little comedy but instead i got a wet, depressed Downey Jr for 70 minutes of the film before finally we get a little Iron Man action, which in itself was quite disappointing.

"culturedogs","7","2","6","4 May 2013"," The Best of the Iron Man films so far; Mandarin obsessives stay home
","The Mandarin was going to be a problem.<br/><br/>Among Iron Man's rogues gallery, the Mandarin was going to be, perhaps, the toughest one to update. The visual basis for the character seemed to be the Fu-Manchu mold; his connection to the Cold War world of the original Iron Man was also problematic, but the Asian stereotype thing was either going to be straight up offensive, or mock-ably silly. The comics writers seemed to manage (just) to breathe new life into the character a bit, by choosing to develop the old character tropes in the light of a better understanding of Eastern cultures (sufficiently so for an ongoing comics series, anyway). But how do you bring a story arc with a character with that complicated a genesis to a major feature film series in the modern day without turning the story into an outdated Sax Rohmer adventure?<br/><br/>Bringing in Shane Black, who turned in a very good modern noir/ mystery/ comedy with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and Ben Kingsley, who plays a Mandarin, that those who hold the original Stan Lee (Larry Lieber?) and Don Heck creation as beyond reproach, may actually hate; too bad, because the pieces of the Mandarin that are thrown to the fire for Iron Man 3, fuel a cracking good storyline involving another Marvel villainous institution (AIM) and Warren Ellis' contribution to the mythos, the Extremis virus.<br/><br/>The film is framed as a confessional, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) recalls (as much as he can, that is) a very drunken Millennial New Year's Party (pre-super-armor), where he picks up researcher Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), and is approached by AIM's Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), whose AIM proposal is dismissed by Stark. His brush-off of Killian and playboy tryst with Hansen will come back to haunt him...<br/><br/>... in ""the present day"", where Stark suffers restless insomnia and panic attacks following the mind-blowing cosmicness of his foray with aliens and gods in The Avengers. He tries to deal with it by endlessly tinkering with Iron Man armors, which friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) both agree is not helping. Also not helping are the exploits of The Mandarin (Kingsley), an apparent international terrorist in something like the Bin Laden mode, but, Stark notes, who talks like ""a baptist preacher."" When The Mandarin's bombings end up harming his longtime pal and head of security, Happy Hogan (the returning Jon Favreau, director of the 1st two Iron Man films), Stark decides to take things personally and impulsively issues a threat to the terrorist leader.<br/><br/>This impulsive act, unfortunately, directly moves Stark and his beloved Pepper (also Stark Industries' CEO) into the bull's-eye, and the ninety minutes that follow show us Stark as Iron Man, the hero, but also as a vulnerable human struggling to strategize his way out of an increasingly horrific situation.<br/><br/>Along the way, it was a complete delight to find an Iron Man film so entertaining and recognizably coming from the creator of the offbeat Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (and, for that matter, Lethal Weapon).<br/><br/>Black has a knack, an affection for offbeat, unbalanced heroes, and Downey's Iron Man is certainly the most unbalanced of Avengers' class of 2012 (okay MAYBE the Hulk, but his mood shifts are more on/ off switch volatile than kooky). Black's film also succeeds as a stand-alone that effortlessly exploits the larger Marvel cinematic universe, using Stark's Avengers experiences as a jumping-off point for some further (though never ponderous) soul searching. This is the smartest and funniest Iron Man (stand alone) film yet, and certainly among the smartest and most daring re-writes of a major comics property since Ang Lee's Hulk.<br/><br/>The difference? Ang Lee's film ended up confused and confusing, losing its' great green superstar in the process. Iron Man 3 leaves us a resilient and smart franchise with the chutzpah we should expect from a superhero.<br/><br/>And, naturally, you're staying till after the credits, right?"
"alwaysforgiven821","9","2","6","4 May 2013"," The Movie Did What It Set Out To
","This review will contain very light spoilers.<br/><br/>In the current atmosphere of superhero movies, there are directions that have been explored and overplayed. Iron Man 2 had a shallow enemy. It had a shallow Tony Stark. In the third film of the series, the creators sought to give depth. Depth to the characters, depth to the story - and they succeeded.<br/><br/>Now, I will first say this: Much hate has come to this film from die-hard fans of the comics, for the film to liberties with characters (Mandarin) which many of these fans could not stand. For me, when I go into a film, I ignore any expectations. The film and the comics are very different things. The characters can be different. The question is: Did the film makers create an enemy in Mandarin that was dynamic and entertaining for the film audience. The answer? Yes.<br/><br/>This film does what the past two films have been unable to do for me: Leave me surprised when it came to the villain. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time - sometimes due to suspense, other times because I was laughing extremely hard.<br/><br/>Tony Stark has depth in this film. He has emotions. He has a supporting cast that helps redeem the character - from a buddy body-guard who comes on... hard times, to a young kid who forms an interesting side-kick'ish relationship with the title character. The film was laid our brilliantly, and every scene had a purpose.<br/><br/>Listen: If you want non-stop action, and want to see War Machine and Iron Man totally own people the whole movie... well, this isn't for you.<br/><br/>If you want to see a direct adaption of your favorite comic book, without any changes... this isn't for you.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that explores the character of Tony Stark - and through him, so many others. If you want a film that is realistic (well... enough) and has carefully adjusted its action, humor and characters... if you want a movie that can surprise you when so few superhero movies can anymore, give this movie a shot. I doubt many of you will be disappointed."

","The highly anticipated Iron Man 3 is out and to say the least, it was really entertaining.

Shane Black delivers the movie with a darker, serious style, but also kept it's rememberable comedy that gave the first two films their charm. The special effects were great, acting was better than the last two (not saying the last two were bad), and even if this is the last solo Iron Man movie with Robert Downey Jr., then it leaves you with a satisfying taste in your mouth to know that RDJ is, and always will be Iron Man.<br/><br/>8/10"
"xenoraiser","8","2","6","2 May 2013"," Gleefully Inconsistent
","www.recaphub.com<br/><br/>Everyone's favorite Avenger is back in his own film, and he is in no rush to get the dazzle going. Iron Man 3 opens with an untold backstory, just not the kind you might expect, given such a statement. After that, the movie takes the post-Avengers route, which is to say it shows one piece of the aftermath. The impact of these preceding events is apparent in the first act, but offers little more than a character roadblock, in the long run. Beyond that, the threat of a new villain is brought up consistently enough (through broadcasts) to warrant Tony Stark's curiosity. The rest is left to be seen first-hand.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 returns much of what was missing from the second film: delight. The laughs and conversations can definitely get obnoxious, but even when they fall flat, there's still an odd gravitation to find towards it all. At least, with the very potential exception of the film's key plot twist. Spoilers will not arise, but those in charge of the script choices really jumped the shark here. This will be an experience-destroying moment for some, especially given what is initially built up. From there on, the plot begins to fade away as action is (finally) incorporated on a more frequent basis. <br/><br/>Like the laughs themselves, Iron Man 3 has tone shifts splashing left and right. To say the film loves leaping from detrimental threats to light-hearted scoffing is definitely an understatement. If it wasn't so brash--usually courtesy of Robert Downey Jr., you could almost pass it off as dark humor. Whether it works or not rests entirely on the viewer's emotional flexibility.<br/><br/>One certainty, however, is that the cast had a fun time doing this film. While there are some serious scenes, a lot of room is made for whimsical or play-along-with-it moments. Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle and Ben Kingsley get a lot of the latter. In fact, if there's anyone who gives Robert Downey Jr. a run for the suck-it-up award, it would have to be former series- director Jon Favreau, even with his brief screen time. There really aren't any weak points in the cast, although Gwyneth Paltrow could've had more footage during the second act. <br/><br/>Where Iron Man 3 shines the most, unsurprisingly, is in the action sequences. No, they aren't always plausible. Then again, neither is half the technology Tony Stark has at his disposal, so credibility is far from top priority. As Guy Pearce says in the movie, ""ever since that guy came down with the hammer, things haven't been the same."" Nonetheless, this leads to some pretty impressive stuff. The attack on Stark's mansion is as thrilling as you'd expect, while the climax almost feels like it got mixed up with The Adventures of Tintin in some spots. But given all of the style, it's tough to complain.<br/><br/>The final word on Iron Man 3 is that it's a very misleading film. Things start off quite serious before quickly turning comical. There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but it isn't always for the best reasoning. Still, everyday audience members won't have a problem rolling with what comes around, simply because it means plenty of entertainment. Iron Man 3 is a worthy successor and inclusion to the franchise, but the first film has continued to prove a tough piece for Marvel to match."
"shraysharma85","7","2","6","26 April 2013"," All's well except THE END!
","Well to start off, the movie had a great plot and amazing visual effects, would not even dare talk about RDJ, he is a class act and perhaps the most suited for the Tony stark role. The film almost rushes through as a joy ride, covering almost each and every aspect of Iron Man franchise- plot, emotions, brilliance in technical aspects, action, visual effects and most importantly the humorous Tony Stark.. The movie has its share of moments when you are just at the edge of street and are at times admiring the brilliance of a genius Stark possesses. What does come of as a surprise is that if you are aware of comic books, you would be knowing the looks of Mandarin, which might come out a little indigestible. Having said that it does not take away the credit that should be given to Shane Black for his effort. He has pulled off a great plot and would make you fall in love with RDJ all over again. The performances are great, Guy pearce is great in fact post Memento, to me he has looked pretty substantial NOW(That's a long time) Paltrow is impressive, whereas Sir kingsley seems a little too wasted for the movie, though he still creates an impact. It kills me to see such a class actor wasted. RDJ, let's not even discuss him, HE IS A CLASS APART. All in all a movie worth a watch and fun ride!"
"fabio-baldanh","7","2","6","25 April 2013"," Entertaining, but in the end a bit disappointing
","Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>As someone who liked both previous Iron Man Movies (along with most recent marvel movies) I was quite excited about Iron Man 3. After seeing it... well it's a fun movie, I laughed and I was entertained the whole time, but in the end I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The trailers made it look like a more serious take on Iron Man. Now, of course from previous Iron Man Movies (and The Avengers) I was expecting there to be humour but I think they went a bit overboard with it here. This is supposed to be Iron Man facing his main enemy, his biggest trial so far... but the story simply cannot be taken seriously when the director and writers had the need to constantly put in comedic elements. Be it the true nature of the Mandarin or the final fight just after Tony Stark thinks the love of his life died in front of him, it seems the story cannot be serious for more than 5 min without having to put in some joke. Even the big reveal/twist (the fact that ""The Mandarin"" was just an actor)was used as a comedic factor. And the post credits scene that I was expecting to start hyping for the avengers 2? Nope, also a comedic scene.<br/><br/>The action was good with great special effects, there where even some cool Tony Stark-not quite iron man yet action scenes. If there is one scene I didn't like was the end to the ""final battle"", the whole super pepper thing felt over the top in a ""1997 batman and robin"" kind of way. Same could be said about the ""grab hand while we fall"" scene<br/><br/>As I said, it's still a fun movie. I'd still recommend it for someone who just wants to go to the movies, have some laughs and see some good looking action. But from the trailers, from what was said and from previous movies I was expecting it to be the ""bigger and better"" Iron Man movie, so I couldn't help but feel disappointed in the end."

Gwyneth Paltrow and Guy Pearce were just amazing but the best character of the movie is Ben Kingsley who portrays his role with pure perfection.<br/><br/>Overall if you are looking for an action packed superhero movie with some of the spectacular stunts this is the movie for you and a must watch for all the MCU fans."

","Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Avengers: End Game. Iron Man 3 at leats did not kil Iron Man and itr finished the trilogy perfectly. I am glad Shane Black replaced the director Jon Favreau who ruined the sequel and didn't know what to do with the movie. I love this movie and it is one of my favorites MCU films. I love it more than the last ""Iron Man"" movie The third entry of Iron Man is a decent kick-ass bad-ass action film. There is a ton of action in there. The characters are better developments. Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame and Ant-Man and the Wasp!!!!!!!!! Those movies suck I don't like em. I love this movie so much I have a blast watching it.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow was more supporting girlfriend than she was in Iron Man 2, she wasn't so annoying like she was in the last Iron Man movie. I love her performance in this movie so much. This is the last time we see her in any superhero movie she only appeared in one scene in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) Mandarian was an okay and as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The movie is set after the events of ""The Avengers"" after New York and Tony Stark is fallen to pieces suffering post-Avengers PTSD, Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark is called upon to stop a bomb-happy terrorist known as the Mandarin, as well a mad scientist who has used the experimental regenerative drug he created to build an army of powerful mutant humans, and who is now threatening to kill Tony's sweetheart, Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>More entertaining, better story, good Special Effects CGI. The last good Iron Man movie almost good as the first one. I also don't understand the negative reviews. Shane Black directed well action MARVEL fun popcorn film that is also intrigue thriller and different from the first movie. I have enjoy this movie a lot and I had fun with it. This is not Lethal Weapon, Die Hard With A Vengeance, Terminator 2: Judgment Day or Aliens it is an own movie about dark fantasy and a different science fiction film filled with action. Even tough Stark and Rhodey are both in that ship without their armored that doesn't mean they look like Murtaugh and Riggs or McClane and Carver the story is different.<br/><br/>I for once have enjoyed the helicopter action sequences which were bad-ass. Attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! That was so bad.-ass action all Stark's suits were destroyed. I love the opening scene on New Year Eve in 1999 in which we see Tony Stark for the first time been selfish and arrogant person he was in the first Iron Man. We see Yinsen (Shaun Toub) how they met this deals with a prequel from the first movie. Yes I enjoy this movie more than any other MRAVEL film it so bad.-ass. The movie is set on Christmas Eve, reminds me on Batman Returns there was a kid Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy in which helps to repair his suit Mark 42. He wasn't annoying kid. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene.<br/><br/>The main bad guy is Aldrich Killian great performance from Guy Pearce who previously played in Christopher Nolan's Memento. I thought Aldrich Killian was brilliant mad scientist who participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Guy Pearce played a great bad guy Aldrich Killian, he was right from the comic books. To mask his illegal activities as a terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin"" portrayed by the British actor Trevor Slattery to serve as his proxy, unaware that the Mandarin truly existed. He also conspired with Vice President Rodriguez in an attempt to take control over both the United States of America and the War on Terror, manipulating them for his own profit. Miguel Ferrer as Vice President is also in this movie he was in RoboCop (1987).<br/><br/>Extremis are super soldiers who are impossible to stop. I hated it the Mandarian joke too and the twist around but I accept it they way it is. Aldrich Killian developed that program Extremis with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who was also love interest of Tony Stark for one stand. Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen plotted revenge for years on Tony Stark. Great performance from Rebecca Hall.<br/><br/>I disagree with the haters about this movie I have enjoy it from the begging till end. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is a nice fellow guy he promoted this movie and I saw him how good he was with kids he was so nice on his movie Iron Man 3. Don Cheadle as War Machine was much better than he was in the last Iron Man movie. The action sequences on the end of the movie looks like in Terminator 2: Judgment Day in a steel mill sequence while on here was on the docks on a ship. If you see Pepper Potts falling down in to the fire you see Tony Stark goes to do what he has to do, to stop Aldrich Killian as he put more suits on him self.<br/><br/>Was a good ending of the trilogy I have enjoy it, it is my favorite MCU MILES way better movie than ""The Dark Knight Rises""."
"popculturethoughts","5","1","2","16 June 2019"," PopCultureThoughts.Com
","I'm not sure what it is, but there's something missing from ""Iron Man 3."" Maybe it's that Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark barely seems like himself here, with his aggressive charms muted for the most part to make room for the overstuffed-yet-underwhelming plot. There's also the perpetual problem of Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, who doesn't seem like the same character here, with Paltrow's performance changing gears from scene to scene with no cohesion or narrative arc. But the biggest problem seems to be the weak villainous threat, with Guy Peace making a negligible villain and a wasted Ben Kingsley left to wander aimlessly in a sitcom-grade secondary plot that's poorly deployed. The special effects are surprisingly underwhelming for the most part, which is especially glaring in the never-ending climax. It's not bad per se, it's just not that great, and is missing the formulaic-but-effective Marvel charm that's propelled a number of weak storylines past the finish line so far."

"mounirrmaged","1","1","2","22 February 2017"," Worst MARVEL movie to date, absolutely terrible
","Iron man 3 is the 7th installment in the marvel cinematic universe, directed by Shane Black (Kiss kiss bang bang). The film follows Tony Stark being torn apart mentally while facing a terrorist, the mandarin. He starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. When you read it like this, it can come as a powerful, dramatic conflict that can leap the boundaries of comic book movies to a whole new level. Sadly it doesn't. The biggest problem that people seem to have with this movie is the mandarin (We will get to that later). People seem to be very mixed about the way the mandarin was represented in the film. My two cents is that it is utter stupidity. Tony Stark in the film is a completely unlikable asshole. He has no charm, no charisma or any weight. The character is supposed to face a deep, mental conflict which is PTSD due to the events of the avengers, but that is embarrassingly downplayed. This conflict gives no emotional substance or levity. The way it is handled is completely superficial. In other films, such conflicts can be presented and supported by other elements of film making, such as camera movements, sound editing, crazy visuals and great acting. Unfortunately none of these elements are used in the film. They simply use a close-up shot and rely entirely on Robert Downey Jr.'s acting skills, which are terrible and hold no emotional value. All he does is staring and throw quips. The PTSD is also there as a plot device, appearing only when it is needed to, but never really doing anything to the character. Tony gets a nightmare, makes foolish decisions that almost cost his life and his loved ones, but it is all presented in a very dull way. It doesn't also help with RDJ's one note acting who can't do any dramatic performances. Another poor aspect of the film is the tone. The tone ranges from pretentious edginess to a Mel Brooks action spy comedy by the end. The movie has no idea what kind of theme or layer it wants to represent. The tone is inconsistent and that damages the movie. The writing in this film is absolutely stilled, the dialogue is awful, and the delivery is bland and poor. <br/><br/>Now to the main complaint of the film, the mandarin. Yes, the mandarin is completely ruined. Not just as an adaptation from the comic, but as a standout film character in general. Both of the characters, the terrorist and Aldrich Killian, are some of the worst film characters. The terrorist has no reason to attack America or give it lessons. What possible conflict does this terrorist has with America? Or at least what reasons does he has to do such acts? The film gives us no explanation or any reason at all. Just a random villain thrown there, with no backstory, no motivation, and no clever themes behind this. The second idiotic character, Aldrich Killian, has a laughably terrible origin story that you can't take seriously. His entire reason for hating Tony and wanting revenge is because Tony left him on the roof at a new year's eve in 1999 while wanting to present a new project to Stark. Just, stupid. And finally, to the twist. For some unknown reasons to me, some people claim that this twist is clever because it was unexpected and because it tells us not to trust the government. Now that can be a good idea, except for one thing:it is terribly executed. There is not smart writing, no build-up, no thematic elements, just a forced twist for a cheap laugh. And as always, marvel can never really create a soundtrack that can give a powerful, emotional impact for the viewer and to serve the movie from a dramatic standpoint. The musical score is dull, forgettable and serves no purpose. The visuals are also dull, giving no memorable moments or imaginative scenes to give a bigger experience of the film. It really saddens me that such awful movies can break such huge box office numbers and gain critical success. It is one of the worst blockbuster movies i have ever seen."
"stephen7272","4","1","2","3 January 2016"," Iron Man without Iron Man (or the Mandarin)
","Clearly Robert Downey Jnr wanted to make this his last Iron Man movie so a story was contrived to allow him to drive away with honour as a happy man with a fixed heart, both in terms of his love life and his physical injury. <br/><br/>Blockbuster movies these days are designed around demographics. IM 3 is no different. Women have to be empowered so Pepper ends up with super powers. Women don't need men so Tony Stark doesn't save Pepper from her plummet to death. An Asian audience must not be offended so the Mandarin is converted into a white Caucasian. An African American saves the Presidency (i.e. Obama). British actors overwhelm Hollywood movies so a few jokes are thrown in about British theatrical actors playing roles in superhero movies. The esteem of scientists and DNA engineering has been lowered so the bad guy is a scientist who alters DNA. Fallen American soldiers in the Middle East have to be honoured so we are given a young boy who has lost his soldier father. Returning vets from the Middle East suffering from the effects of war are represented by Stark's anxiety attacks. Engineering is too clever a subject for most audiences so Tony Stark becomes a mere mechanic. The super rich are largely detested by the public so Stark's Malibu home gets blown to pieces. Hard drugs users are used as the prototype for the villains who can either handle an overdose or explode in an inferno.<br/><br/>The final message is that there are no superheroes. There are just men and machines. As with modern day drones, the Iron Man suit becomes an unmanned drone that can be lost in battle without harm to its operative.<br/><br/>Very little of the comic book super hero is left. But the makers knew this would appeal to a wider audience of non-superhero fans so they experimented with that path. The comic book fans will wonder if the real Iron Man is still out there somewhere. I'm sure he is and will return one day, slightly dirtier and more hardcore than before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, once again the editing is dreadful, resorting to the modern craze for 1 second or less camera shots."
"policy134","5","1","2","6 July 2015"," Hollywood women look great, don't they?
","This is a little late to write commentary on the third installment of the franchise, but I just can't help myself.<br/><br/>As usual, Robert Downey Jr. does great as Stark and I can't think of anyone who looks better in this universe. His age is starting to show, though. But if I looked as good in my present age, as he does at almost 50, then some wrinkles is a small price to pay. One who looks even better is Gwyneth Paltrow. Just goes to show you that California sun does miracles. Or is it that miracle innovation called surgery. I doubt it. She looks way too natural.<br/><br/>Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh, yeah! Iron Man 3. Well, it doesn't stink. How about that? Except, there are some crucial errors, mostly due to casting. Ben Kingsley is a good actor but what the hell is what that accent? I know he's supposed to be a British actor playing the mandarin but shouldn't it therefore be an Asian accent he's adopting? Rebecca Hall who plays one of Tony's conquests I believe is British. I first saw her in Frost/Nixon but she hides her Britishness very well. It is also nice that we see her tryst with Tony way in the past because I don't think Tony would have gone for her when the main storyline is set. There is a twist to her character but to be honest, it's not that big of a surprise.<br/><br/>Of course, now he is involved with Pepper and we get the usual relationship quarrels from a thousand other movies. Fortunately, these scenes are short and don't ruin the overall experience.<br/><br/>Now for the worst part. Introduction to a new character which is of course a kid. It's like a bad sitcom where they think this storyline will boost ratings. Please stop.<br/><br/>Anyway, there isn't really that much to recommend about this show except action scenes. But isn't that what kids wanna see? Unfortunately, there isn't that much action except for that sensational helicopter who does what? It has something to do with putting the actors in danger?"

It almost looked as if Christopher Nolan was making this movie. I was excited about how intense and dangerous the Mandarin looked, then I saw the movie. What a total joke. First of all, there's no way Happy would've survived that explosion, and why did the so called ""Mandarin"" have to be an actor pretending to be a villain? That was really dumb. I don't blame the actors for this movie being bad, I blame the writers for this one. Way to let us down Marvel. It's as if Marvel Studios got together, sat down and said, ""Okay we made all this money from The Avengers, everyone loves Robert Downey Jr. Let's take all the horrible ideas we've had for previous Ironman films and throw it altogether into one huge suck-fest!"" I understand that they wanted to show Tony Stark suffering from PTSD after the New York attack, but the other stuff wasn't needed. Also, I really was hoping for Pepper to die in this movie.

"drqshadow-reviews","5","1","2","29 May 2014"," A Fleeting, Inessential Little Skirmish That Fizzles Out Quite Early
","Badly in need of a spark after an underwhelming second installment, this series has swapped directors and imported a major villain from the comics for its third. Frankly, it doesn't fare any better for the effort. That's partially due to the Tony Stark character hitting a wall - his arc has been stagnant for a while now - but I found more culpability in the icy set of cold feet developed around the plot's halfway point. In the blink of an eye, the whole tone of the picture changes from a topical dash of political intrigue (and a pointed metaphor for the US's approach to terrorism) to just another struggle between Stark and the latest in a long line of bland, suit-wearing, self-enhanced business rivals with an eye on one of his inventions. That the Mandarin is downplayed doesn't necessarily bother me. Actually, I found Ben Kingsley wonderful in the role and enjoyed the sudden wheel-jerk of his change in course (those upset about his blasphemous take on a sacred character need look no further than the short follow-up film All Hail the King for vindication). But that sudden, accompanying leap from a new path to a tired, over-familiar formula is a development sour enough to curl toes. This character needed a blast of fresh air, some momentum to carry him through the next phase of Marvel's plans. Instead, he's simply planted his feet deeper in the same vat of quicksand. Despite all its intentions, it's really no better than Iron Man 2."

Performances were first-rate.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is no exception. In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous two. Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident in the first two. Plus, in the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's character we have a villain who is a match for Iron Man.<br/><br/>On this note, Guy Pearce put in a great performance as the bad guy.

"alindsay-al","7","1","2","16 January 2014"," A good film but could have been better
","This film has a lot of controversy surrounding it but I will say straight away that I do like iron man 3. The premise of this film sees Tony Starks life turned upside down when he encounters the mysterious mandarin. Meanwhile, an organisation use a drug to try and take down the president of the United states. Now one thing nobody can deny is that Robert Downey jnr's performance is great as Tony stark. Even though he is now an avenger he hasn't changed, he is just as narcissistic and arrogant as he always has been and it is why we love Tony stark. The supporting cast is also great, Gwyneth paltrow returns as pepper Potts and she is given more to do in this film as she is great in these films. Her chemistry with Downey is fantastic and is one of the best romance stories in comic book film history. Don Cheadle returns as Rhodey and he is great in the role and once again his chemistry with Downey is a great part of the film. Guy Pearce is really good in this film as Aldrich killian and even though his character is a bit cliché he manages to make it work. Ben kingsley plays the mandarin and he is really good in the film with his menacing demeanour really makes his character menacing. Now some of the twists of the story do work in action film turns and they are good ideas but the story does fall a bit flat, this is because there is one twist in the film that people will either like or hate. I am one of those people who hate this twist and I think it does drop the quality of this film. The script did a good job of getting a lot of humour in the film, however, the mix of drama and humour didn't really work in the film and it felt a little out of place. The action scene all look great and this is the best that iron man has ever looked. But the problem is that this film is a complete Tony stark film but iron man is barely in the film and it takes away from the whole thing. Overall I do like this film but I really do believe that it could have been better."

","At first i was mad because the Mandarin not being real and of course the villain was like not good enough but after a while when i was thinking about the film i really saw the big plot there. Imo they tried to show how a mare man deals with the life after the big event from the Avengers. Ofc he is Tony Stark (genious, billionaire ... etc. etc.) but his experience so far is nothing compared to the others(Thor, HULK , Captain America). After all i like how the movie showed his struggle with accepting all that happened. It was funny, action was good and overall a solid performance. Big movies are coming up and we should look at the movies Marvel universe as something new and not to compare it with the comics and the animated movies. I am really looking forward with great expectations and a chill for the next movies and how they will show thing and what innovations will they present to the public. Cheers."

","Marvel films are not for everyone, I accept that. I am not an expert, and so cannot judge Iron Man on technical Marvel merit, but on the basis of a film about a likable character, by known brilliant actor (Downey Jr). Paltrow is watchable in this film and many people have commented that it's one of her best roles; I usually like her (especially Sliding Doors and Shakespeare in Love) and she was no less good in this than I expected. Downey Jr and his comedic timing and dry straight style - always incredible deep into character - weren't disappointing but the stars were Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, particularly the latter. Don Cheadle also reassuringly good and the child actor Ty Simpkins was perfectly cast and not at all annoying (as many child actors are). I could listen to Paul Bettany all day so him as the voice of the suit/computer was very pleasant ;-) <br/><br/>The CGI was obviously front and centre with all the SFX, which is expected, and for the most part it wasn't obvious (aside from where the laws of physics made it necessary) except for a few places where I got annoyed. Generally though it was seamless with real action, and some of the SFX were brilliant especially the 'running hot' bodies of the terrorist army - especially Pearce. The script was witty and clever for the most part, but a little staccato and without much depth but it did the job and for such a visual film it was sufficient. Without the SFX and the absorbing skill of the actors, this film would have faltered as it really was a visually attractive experience even on a small screen. I was gripped all the way through, which I didn't expect and was emotionally involved with some events in the film. Really did enjoy Ben Kingsley and the humour, for me, added a great deal to the film. Not much in the way of life changing or expanding experience in watching this film, but in terms of entertainment - even for a super-hero/comic book franchise - I enjoyed and gave it 7/10"
"Kcpjhp","7","1","2","30 October 2013"," Release the WiseCrackin'
","Brilliant inventor/engineer/smart-alek Tony Stark is suffering from insomnia and bouts of PTSD after the incredible battle in New York with the Chitauri & Loki. He still puts on his best cynical/sarcastic/charming face for the public but he has great doubts about himself and his limitations. These are further exasperated by the arrival of ""The Mandarin."" Mandarin takes credit for several high profile and destructive terrorist attacks throughout U.S. Tony offers to help, but he is told that Mandarin is a ""terrorist problem, not a super- hero problem."" After an attack leaves his former bodyguard in a coma, Tony disagrees and levels a threat directly at the Mandarin. Things escalate quickly from there. <br/><br/>An obligatory word about sequels.....<br/><br/>The late, great Gene Siskel once said,<br/><br/>""Ok, we're going to talk about sequels. We are going to talk about sequels. See, wasn't it less interesting the 2nd time ?""<br/><br/>This logic holds up more often than not, though I've softened on my inherent disdain/mistrust of sequels over the last decade or so. While there are some movie franchises I enjoy a great deal, I believe each movie (whether part of an ongoing story-line or self-contained) should be able to stand on its own merits.<br/><br/>That said, I liked this movie. But it did come in slightly below my high expectations.<br/><br/>Where it works : Humor - All of the trademark Starkisms are here. Tony being Tony, while putting bad guys, bad girls, fans, kids or members of the press in their place verbally. RDJ does sarcasm better than any other actor today, in my opinion. Action - There is a ton. You're about 20 minutes in before things really get going, but the filmmakers make up for lost time, especially for the finale. Lots of explosions, chases, narrow escapes and large complicated structures going BOOM! CRASH! POW! ZAP! and so on. If you like stuff blowing up, you'll get your fill. Tony's got a new suit which he can operate remotely, along with a few other surprises. Tony Stark - The character itself has gotten better over the course of Marvel's three films. Tony is a billionaire who struggles with a responsibility to his fellow man, deals with past indiscretions/childish behavior, and tries to overcome the insecurity which plagues us all. RDJ has truly digested this role and deserves many accolades for it. He's a fine actor and he's turned a larger-than-life comic book character into a human being (not as easy as it might sound) Where it doesn't work as well: Story - This is adapted from the ""Extremis"" series created by Warren Ellis and Adi Granov. I found it interesting, but not delivered in a particularly coherent fashion. The overall motive for the antagonist is very similar to that of Obadiah Stane from the original IRON MAN. References - There were a number of references to The Avengers. These were justified by the arc of IM3's story, but it was a little odd to talk about Thor, Loki, and the group collectively half a dozen times without seeing any of them. It also begged the understandable question: ""Why aren't any of Tony's super-friends showing up to help him out?"" All in all, it's a very good movie. But, the first two films set a very high bar for the franchise. In my opinion, the first remains the best, the second (a very close) 2nd.<br/><br/>BTW : As is the current trend in Marvel films, there is a short scene after final credits that's worth a look. ;-)<br/><br/>My wife liked it, but thought parts of it were ""a little silly"" My personal rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)"
"outofvogue18","4","1","2","28 October 2013"," To campy, to many plot holes, this isn't Iron Man
","Iron Man is back in the third installment of the Iron Man series, unfortunately following brawl in The Avengers he fell back into another universe. This new universe is filled with poor writing, a crappy story, and hokey characters. I thoroughly enjoyed Iron Man and Iron Man 2, when I saw that Jon Favreau would not be directing the third installment, I became extremely wary about the direction of Iron Man. I cannot believe that they gave a 200 million dollar movie to a relatively inexperienced Shane Black. I further cannot believe that they read the script and signed off on it. They really need to run this stuff by Joss Wheden, as he is really the spearhead of all the Avengers. Shane Black should never direct or write an action movie ever again.<br/><br/>Get ready for lame jokes, childish humor, hokey sentiments, and poor action sequences. Also there are so many plot holes, it will drive you insane. Robert Downey Jr. plays a Tony Starkesque character named conveniently named Tony Stark, except this version of Tony Stark has lost his charm and is no longer the ""Bad-ass"" Jon Favreau created. As I do not except this piece of trash as a true Iron Man film, I'll just refer to the character ""Tony Stark"" as Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>So Robert Downey Jr starts the film off narrating about a lame party he was at in Switzerland in 1999, he briefly meets some guy (Guy Pierce) and snubs him, he also sleeps with a young scientist who's not really serious about her work. Then it's present time, he's suffering in a relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow (Potts), he spends his time building random suits (big plot hole, why suits he'll never wear) instead of with her. During this time attacks start happening, it's very obvious who's behind them, the director doesn't even try to hide it. Big stuff starts happening, SHIELD and the Avengers do nothing and aren't even mentioned even though everyone in the film talks non-stop about them (nother big plot hole). So Robert Downey Jr, has to save the world, from super-humans who are a cross between Wolverine and Human Tourch (Fan 4).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie just made me angry, it is NOT an Iron Man film. I hope that in The Avengers: Age of Ultron they have Tony Stark wake up from a coma and completely disregard this movie as a figment of Tony Stark's imagination."

","After watching the first Iron Man, I was very impressed, however I did not watch the second one and so the storyline to Iron Man 3 did not make much sense to me. The film had a budget of $200,000,000 and made $174,144,585 in just the opening weekend in the USA.<br/><br/>The film is about Tony Stark trying to find the Mandarin (played by Sir Ben Kingsley), however, things seem to take a turn when he discovers that the man that was seen as the Mandarin was only a decoy. This is where the film really starts, most of the action and fight scenes happen after this as Tony is looking for the Mandarin. During all of this, Pepper gets taken by the real Mandarin, which causes a lot of conflict in the film. The ending of the film was a real surprise, Pepper killed the Mandarin, her character had been pretty quiet during the rest of the film, then this ending happens and it is almost shocking.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3, unlike the others, contains a lot of humour which makes the film more enjoyable. However, the fact that the film is so long did make a lot of people think that it was a bit rubbish and didn't need it all. Also, some people think that the twist with the Mandarin ruined the film, as it was a bit stupid that he was only a decoy after everything that had happened, some people believe this made it better.<br/><br/>I think this film was an improvement from the first one due to the use of humour in the film, it made it a lot better to watch. However, I do prefer the first Iron Man, it was a lot simpler and was easy to follow all the way through, unlike Iron Man 3 that has a lot of twists and turns. I feel the Iron Man films have hit a dead end now, there is nothing more they could do to make a new film, it wouldn't make any money as people have already lost interest."

","""Old days, never thought they'd come back to bit me. Why would they?"" After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has changed. He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to ""bring it on."" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on.

"Tehmeh","7","1","2","30 August 2013"," Love/hate relationship.
","Finally watched it.<br/><br/>I'm not a great fan of Marvel/Disney collaboration. Let's get some of my main gripes out first. Hear me out, Disney/Marvel:<br/><br/>Don't force child characters into these movies. It's exactly that, forcing and it feels like it too (although it didn't bother me as much as I originally thought). Don't make it seem like a punch from an IM suit does nothing to a regular person, it would break their necks. Don't force this many jokes into a movie series that already, at the very lowest level, has enough humor that works. Don't include some trite gunfights with absolutely no sense of danger into these movies. Don't think that including Bill Maher and Joan Rivers isn't ridiculous. Don't think a mediocre (or bad) plot isn't mediocre (or bad) because tons of crap is happening all the time as a smokescreen. Overall, some things do not make sense and not only that, but some of the scenes negate some established ""facts"" from the first two films. <br/><br/>Disney, I hate you. Go away. Go ruin some teen female actors, you ridiculous, despicable shadow of a company you once were. There, now I got those out of the way. There were annoyances, yes. They could've toned down the silliness, some useless scenes and characters and make things a little more mean, more serious business. Sad that they didn't, because simply by removing stuff and not adding to those I mentioned, they would've made this a better Iron Man movie. If my complaints have nothing to do with Disney and everything to do the director and writer, then...nah, I still hate Disney.<br/><br/>Now, to the good and neutral things. It is very, very entertaining. There's a lot of stuff happening almost all the time. Some of the action is inventive and all of it looks good. Some of the jokes that don't suck are pretty good. Iron Man 3 is never boring - not once - and almost every scene has a couple of layers. Not deep layers, but ""not boring""-layers. IM3 is very rewatchable. On my blu-ray version the picture quality is great as well as the sound, and I liked the ""Agent Carter"" - featurette.<br/><br/>This is more of a Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man movie, which is...interesting. On the downside, Tony isn't wearing his suit much. We see them a lot, he just isn't in them most of the time. That's pretty disappointing, but there's an upside: more Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>When RDJ is not telling a forced joke, he makes a good one, and he owns this character right now as well as Harrison Ford owns Indy/Solo and Hugh Jackman owns Wolverine. He is a joy to watch and additionally handles more serious and emotional scenes very well too. Jarvis has a slightly bigger role in this, which I really do like. He's really a character here and Paul Bettany's voicework is excellent. And yes, I do like Gwyneth Paltrow. She's adorable. Don't agree with what they do with her character, but that aside, it's all good. Guy Pearce is at times just OK, but there are glimpses of him being pretty good too. Ben Kingsley...well, interesting to the very least and he delivers exactly what the filmmakers intended. Don Cheadle got some stuff to do in this film, which is nice. Shame that I don't care about half of it.<br/><br/>This really is a weird one. Plenty of good, fun stuff and plenty of bad, forced stuff and negating some rules of Iron Man - universe. You can tell it's directed by a man who has made his living with action comedies. And I don't say that just as a lame insult: there are some pretty nice ideas, little tonal shifts to keep things ""fun"" and the movie always keeps going forward with quite a pace. There's lot to like about Shane Black, after all I love 80's action movies far more than generic and shallow PG13-nonsense we get nowadays, and Shane Black has earned his credentials with good movies we still love today. So while he doesn't cater to the fanboys as much as I'd personally like, he does deliver a fun ride and overall a very nice movie experience.<br/><br/>For me this could've been the best of all three IM movies, but it isn't. That said, it's easy to understand those who like this one the most. I don't regret buying it, and for me it's much, much more entertaining than Iron Man 2. The first one wasn't topped of course. I gave the first film a 9, IM2 got a very generous 6, so this one gets a 7.<br/><br/>I'd advise approaching ""Iron man 3"" not as a serious comic book adaptation, but just as an entertaining movie. As such, it does not disappoint. IM3 is certainly more enjoyable than the final movies in Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, the original X-men trilogy and Nolan's Batman trilogy. <br/><br/>IM3 feels like a film you can watch a few times if you don't come to hate its shortcomings and questionable handling of source material too much. (edit: rewatchable indeed, watched it three times already)"

","We have seen what the Ironman is capable of in Ironman1, ironman2 and The Avengers. His powers, intelligence, attitude and so on. But in this movie we see the weaknesses of him and how he overcomes them to save the world and live up to his name. I would say that this movie is a Marvel version of The Dark Knight Rises. The movie is good in its own way but has a few flaws like the weak ironman suits, tony stark's stupid idea of announcing his address to the world so that the enemy can attack him, tony's negligence causing him to be the root cause to the origin of the Mandarin, making ironman look so beatable in the action sequences etc. Except for these flaws the movie is great!"

","Haunted by the events of Avengers Assemble, Iron Man has to get himself together to thwart terrorist The Mandarin who is aided by an old acquaintance. <br/><br/>A faster paced instalment to the series, Shane Black effortlessly takes over the directing reigns, it has the right dose of action, humour and emotion. Even though the few surprises and twists are heavy handed- namely the The Mandarin and Pepper Potts thread Robert Downey Jr. gets to portray Tony Stark once again and develop the character a little further. <br/><br/>Although Guy Pearce is given an unconvincing make up and hair introduction once he returns clean cut he excels and steals the show as bad guy Aldrich Killian. Rebecca Hall is form in a smaller role and Ben Kingsley is entertaining with his Captain Jack-like swagger as The Mandarin. A few of the Iron Man's series previous characters show up and never out stay their welcome.<br/><br/>Black impressively handles the big budget spectacles and action scene sequences with precision, the special effects are outstanding. However, Stark losing his suit so often become a tad tiresome. Like its predecessor this has an interesting subtext with regards to terrorists, the Middle East and Starks relationship with the suit. There's also a novel brave closure ending, nevertheless it's a good outing with a humorous post credit sequence.<br/><br/>Debatably Iron Man's most rounded outing for the masses."

","This is a movie that falls under the category for me as needing 2 views to fully appreciate it. If your a devoted Iron Man fan familiar with the comics and the many cartoons he's been in you are likely to want to walk out halfway through. If your only experience with Iron man is the current Marvel movies you'll love it. The movie has excellent action, excellent special effects and Robert Downey jr is at the top of his game with his best performance yet. The advertising of this film is its main fault. The trailers promised a more serious movie and the arrival of the long anticipated nemesis of Iron Man, the Mandarin. Without giving much away it fails to meet both those things which is why I have to dock a star for the deception and for the lack of interest in pleasing the hardcore fans who after all is why these characters got popular enough to bring to the big screen. That being said this movie is a lot of fun and better than the second although still cant top the charm and perfect balance of humor and action the first movie had. There is a lot of fun to be had and aside from some small plot holes and one shockingly odd twist its one of the better marvel movies to date. Im not your movie goer whose is woed into loving a movie due to its action content or special effects as many people are, i look for character development and good story and this movie has all of that and some great action as well. I will say I felt Iron Patriot ( formerly War Machine) was yet again not given his due which is a bummer since this is the last solo Iron Man movie. Hopefully he turns up in the Avengers 2 and is given the role he deserves. Well worth the watch, skip the 3D though...not noticeable in the least bit and I have a 3D TV so I know good 3D versus bad and this qualifies as bad."

I just don't think it was as strong as the previous 3 movies.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie was the lack of actual Iron Man in it. You rarely get to see Iron Man in all of his glory, and then when you finally do, he is easily ripped apart by the enemy.

","Most movie franchises are born from a great blockbuster of a first installment and then equally or more expensive sequels that draw people to the box office. It's upon the movie staff and execs to put together a cohesive story in order to ensure the survival of that franchise. Iron Man is no different.<br/><br/>Marvel can practically mint money right now with their various exploits. That being said, Iron Man 3 did not wow me like I wanted. Iron Man 3 had the great fortune of following up a lackluster part 2 but the misfortune of following up the first Iron Man.<br/><br/>The story was OK. It was actually too much to it. Sometimes, in an effort to break from the herd, many movies will convolute a plot to make it better when that only makes it worse. Many comic book nemeses are born from tragedy and pain that is universally understood and then others are born from simple slights (real or not). The nemesis in this movie was from the latter type. The contrived, shallow and very uninteresting latter type. That's not enough to ruin a movie, but it is certainly enough to hamper it.<br/><br/>There was a lot I liked and yet a lot I didn't like, but in the end there wasn't enough Iron Man."

","Iron Man 3 continues the franchise on a familiar note: it has action, international weapon politics, technobabble, and Robert Downey Jr's trademark banter. The story takes a somewhat dark path but overall the film has a lighthearted outlook and has its fair share of comedy.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley is pretty awesome in his role as The Mandarin, and the twist involving his character is clever and surprisingly surprising. Other than that, the story doesn't offer much that's original. Guy Pearce's character (a mad scientist idolizing and resenting Tony Stark) works at the beginning but goes on a downward slope and ends up ridiculous.

","Before releasing a movie, hype is created among the people using trailers, posters, events etc. And so Iron Man 3 also did the same. But I've never seen a movie where so much hype is created around a character (in this case ""The Mandarin"") and then nothing is delivered. Seeing the trailer and other promos, as I did, one would expect the movie to feature a strong clash between the Iron Man and The Mandarin, but there was nothing like this. Whatever role the Mandarin had in this movie was a silly joke. The silliest of movie twist I've ever seen in a movie. I was very disappointed when I found out there was no Mandarin. Its like watching Jurassic park without the dinosaurs, and instead of the dinosaurs u r being chased by kangaroos and koala bears. or watching Titanic without the titanic.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin, looked so evil in the trailers. I expected an epic battle between the two. Two things this movie wasted was Ben Kingsley and the Mandarin. Else it would have been a great movie. Ben Kingsley is such a good actor and its a delight to see him. Here he was underused. I haven't read the comic books of Mandarin but when i went through the internet looking for the Mandarin, there was so much to Mandarin. The archenemy of Iron Man, Martial Arts specialist, The energy rings.<br/><br/>It is not that I didn't like the movie. I liked the movie and am giving it 6 stars. This movie shows Tony Stark without the Iron Man suit which shows that he is the Iron Man with or without the Suit. <br/><br/>I just hope they make a movie with Mandarin also, the Real Mandarin."

I think it was fun seeing Stark run around kicking butt as himself and not his alter ego.<br/><br/>However, the title of the movie is ""Iron Man 3"", not ""Tony Stark, The Crime Fighter."" As much as I enjoyed seeing the Stark storyline, I have to admit that I left the theater a bit unsatisfied. I bought a ticket to see Iron Man, not Tony Stark, The Crime Fighter or War Machine.<br/><br/>Iron Man is there but relegated to the battle at the end of the movie. It's a bit absurd how fragile the Iron Man (Men - plural, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't give it away) armor is. Iron Man can battle the Chitauri and their mightiest giant weapons but fall apart upon being struck by a few guys on fire.<br/><br/>In summary, I liked the Stark storyline but feel it took away from the true focus, Iron Man. In my opinion, the scenes with Iron Man in them were weak and unsatisfying. More is not always better (also, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't give away what this means)."

","Only can I truly express my feelings towards Iron Man 3 by spoiling the plot, which 'iron'ically spoiled the film for me. To not do so would simply be an insult to my own opinion.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 initiates what many have categorised as the second phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, leading up to Avengers 2. It picks up from where the Avengers left off in 2012, though Tony Stark himself is having difficulty picking himself up following the events of the hugely successful collaborative superhero film. One of the great features of Iron Man 3 is seeing Robert Downey Jr. portray a broken character, whose psyche has been damaged seemingly beyond repair, despite his ingenious ability to create and repair machines of inconceivable abilities. While albeit a convenience in the film's concluding chapter, the manner in which Tony Stark occupies his mind still makes for an intriguing character, played by an actor who has developed in each of his cinematic appearances so superbly that it is unimaginable that any other performer regardless of talent, would dare step into the Iron Man suit following Downey Jr.<br/><br/>Undeniably entertaining, you don't have time to contemplate on whether it may be vaguely indulgent and forced due to how compelling the action sequences really are. The IMAX experience just emphasises the captivatingly choreographed superhero set pieces so exhilaratingly that you feel so far on the edge of your seat, you'll probably end up a few rows ahead of where you were originally sitting. However, our attention is only preoccupied by pure entertainment in part. The other element of our conscious captivity regards the film's primary villain, The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's fear inducing antagonist provides a contemporary and terrorising villainous milestone, yet to be achieved by any Iron Man, and perhaps even Marvel cinematic adversary. Unlike its predecessors, Iron Man 3 appeared to have succeeded in creating a phenomenal opponent that matched the intellect of Tony Stark and the power of Iron Man.<br/><br/>Oh, but then an instance of exposition at the core of the film explodes disastrously as it turns out, The Mandarin is a fictional creation of the film's secondary villain, Aldrich Killian, played by Guy Pearce. What is devastating about this unforeseen, illogical and excitement crushing plot twist, is its unnecessary contribution to further complicating narrative matters. Not to discredit Pearce's performance, which is terrific, but Kingsley's interpretation of The Mandarin (before the revelation that he is just an actor, portraying The Mandarin for Killian: the 'real' Mandarin) is nothing short of exquisite; if that term can be used to apply to a perpetrator of terrorism. The marketers sold the film to us in a manner that presented The Mandarin as an antagonist to fear, but once Kingsley is quite abruptly replaced by Pearce in the foreground, the essence and prowess that the character had for the initial hour of the film, is lost amidst an superfluous twist that feels like a dreadful parody of The Incredibles (2004) and Batman Begins (2005).<br/><br/>While the above mentioned revelation is something one wishes they could forget throughout the remaining portion of the film, unfortunately it stays with you like Kingsley's performance had the potential to stay with us had it been given the opportunity to flourish in its entirety. As if this is some sort of Iron Man tradition, the filmmakers somehow manage to strike out by producing three consecutive Iron Man films, which all share a similar demise of disappointing second halves, primarily due to the adaptation of the villains.<br/><br/>Despite my disdain for an infuriatingly dissatisfying story, Iron Man 3 does indisputably offer an array of action-packed mayhem that is almost, but not quite, enough for you to forget your dislikes of the film. Shane Black additionally incorporates a wonderfully appropriate comedic element to the franchise that only further enhances our enjoyment from start to finish (exempting the middle). As a jolt for the much anticipated summer film period, Iron Man 3 certainly kick-starts the season with a feature with great replay value, primarily due to some, definitely not all, characters, action and comedy elements.<br/><br/>Even with its abysmal twist, which I am unable to fully articulate my displeasure for, as well as an overall quite crowded narrative that becomes nauseating as it attempts to pack too much iron into our diets, Iron Man 3 is irrefutably entertaining. Unlikely to please the hardcore Iron Man fanatics, Shane Black's first endeavour into the character is more 'suit'ing for those that just want to be thrilled for 135 minutes. Not as a comic book reader, but as a cinemagoer I was disappointed in part by Iron Man 3's inexplicable indulgence into unnecessary narrative territory, though I would only be lying to myself to argue that I was not consistently enjoying myself throughout the (almost) entire Marvellous experience.<br/><br/>Oh, and do stay for the post-credits scene."
"Howlin Wolf","7","1","2","21 May 2013"," Stark learns more harsh lessons about power and responsibility
","The plot here is definitely stronger than the second one. The previous film had a rich setup that seemed to go nowhere in the last act, whereas this starts out with a pretty basic theme that becomes more complex as the narrative progresses. There's a definite 'Manchurian Candidate' vibe at work, here. The people in power have their puppets, but Stark has no-one to hide behind; everyone knows who he is and what he's done, and that brings on its own stresses and pressures that the story takes its time to work through.<br/><br/>One plot development that sadly wasn't fleshed out enough to convince me is the suits You have the newly acquired ability to control and command them via remote assistance, and yet you destroy them as soon as the threat is vanquished?! I know he wanted to concentrate on Pepper, but surely that involves USING the suits less, not canning them completely? Introducing such a new facility only to dispense with it pretty arbitrarily makes it feel more like a deus ex machina than a realistic element that fits seamlessly with Tony' s background. Plus, it's also too convenient in the service of the plot that the suit he ends up with for the majority of his endeavours just happens to be a model that's not working properly!<br/><br/>Still, there's more going on here and more to think about than in the tired second instalment, so on those terms, it's a definite improvement."
"bobbybussing","7","1","2","20 May 2013"," A great way to start off Phase II of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
","Okay, before I begin, I saw this movie one week ago and had to think it over for a while before I decided to write out my full thoughts on the film. So, here they are:<br/><br/>First of all, I was expecting something bigger and deeper than the last two Iron Man installments. From the looks of the trailers and TV spots, the Mandarin was going to push Tony to his limits and will make him question whether the suit makes the man or the man makes the suit. The trailers and TV spots added a sense of doom to the film; a sense that it will be one of a kind, there's no going back.<br/><br/>...unfortunately, that was not the case. But do not fret, this movie was still great, but it was (as expected) not without some gleaming flaws. But let's talk about why this movie kicks your a** first. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is just as good, lovable and snarky as Tony Stark, and I would go out on a limb and say that this is Downey's best work as Tony Stark yet! If you do not like this movie, you will at least come out of the theaters agreeing with your friends/family that Downey was perfect and pretty much held this movie up like Atlas holding the sphere on Van Halen's ""5150"" album cover.<br/><br/>Another thing that kicked a** about this movie was the action scenes. There's no doubt that they really refined the action in this movie (even though it did come in spades) and upped the ante. The CGI was decent, but at times, it was pretty noticeable that certain objects and characters were computer-generated. One of the things I wish they did a little bit better with was the editing.<br/><br/>The acting was also fairly good. Like I said, Downey was perfect as Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow did a pretty fair job as Pepper, and I think this was also one of Paltrow's best outings as the character, but that's just me. Guy Pearce as the film's baddie Aldrich Killian surprised me greatly. I expected him to be a clone of Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2 but I was VERY wrong. Pearce is a diverse actor and it really shows in this film. Pearce is pretty underrated and this should be a minor show of evidence. Overall, the acting was top-notch. <br/><br/>Now... on to the flaws a.k.a. why this film didn't impress me AS much.<br/><br/>First of all... the Mandarin... the d*mn Mandarin...<br/><br/>What they did to Mandarin was almost unbelievable. I had to shake my head a couple times and even pinch my arm to comprehend what they did to this beloved character. They took one of Iron Man's greatest foes and turned him into a mockery. While I have my own reasons for being angry about that, I can't necessarily blame Shane Black or Drew Pearce for trying something different, but I believe one of the main reasons why people are ticked off at this film (besides the obvious) was the fact that they built up the Mandarin and made him BEYOND hyped up. They marketed him just as he was in the comics: a threatening, new villain that will put Tony Stark to the ultimate test. Instead, the Mandarin was written out as a limey drunk with a drug problem. Not only that, the Mandarin was FAKE! The Mandarin doesn't even exist, and to push it even further, they made KILLIAN out to be the real Mandarin, not the dude who looked exactly like the Mandarin! What kind of sense does that make? <br/><br/>But once again, I can't necessarily blame Black or Pearce for testing the waters with audiences. The thing is, that ""test"" didn't exactly bode well for die-hard fans of the lore like me. The only thing positive out of this was that Ben Kingsley did a great job being both sinister (even if he faked it) and a washed-up actor who drinks too much and pops too many pills. Oh well. <br/><br/>Another thing that brought this movie down a lot was the fact that they really undermined certain characters. Don Cheadle's character Rhodey only seems to serve as a recurring brick joke because of his new name as Iron Patriot (which also incurred the ire of plenty because Iron Patriot was really Norman Osborn's alias when he had a variant of the Iron Man armor) and it was only in the finale that he was worth at least SOMETHING to the plot besides a reason to make audiences chuckle. Stark also seems to have gotten soft on his development of the new suits, because when he actually starts kicking a**, his suit is like aluminum and just gets torn apart like butter compared to his previous appearances, where his suit was actually made of... you know, IRON!<br/><br/>One last thing, the Extremis virus didn't really live up to its comic book counterpart, which was purely a serum of sorts that speeds of the healing process of the human body. Here, it not only does that, but turns the people with Extremis into Human Torch wannabes that function like the T-100 from Terminator 2. Pretty odd.<br/><br/>Overall, Iron Man 3 is pretty good, but it has a LOT of major flaws that really bring it down to its knees almost like Tony on the official movie poster. It had a lot of promise but some of that promise was washed away. However, its efforts to impress were not without some good results. As I said in the summary, a great way to start off the new era of the MCU, and I'd say it is better than Iron Man 2 but not by much, even if I liked Iron Man 2. I give it 7 stars out of 10."
"troymerig","4","1","2","17 May 2013"," Should have been titled ""Tony Stark""
","Wow. What a disappointment. Let me start off by saying that calling this an Iron Man movie is inaccurate. The Iron Man suit is barely even in it and when it is, it's practically made of glass. It's as if I could punch through the suit all of a sudden.<br/><br/>As for the Mandarin, I've never read the comics so I don't know about Iron Man and the Mandarin's comic history. From what I have read from the other users, though, they ruined him. As for myself, I hated him and the other super villains. How many times have we seen the regenerating thing? How about some creativity? <br/><br/>I also thought the movie was kind of slow for a superhero movie. There was just too much of Tony acting like Batman. Suddenly, he is a world class martial artist. Ugh. And his anxiety attacks were completely unnecessary. They did nothing for the movie.<br/><br/>Come on, Marvel. You have to have something better than this in you."

","I wish that when I was a kid they had been able to makes movies like this, with amazing CGI and incredible special effects! Being that I am not a kid any more, and I was a little disappointed with Iron Man 3, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>Most people won't be disappointed by Iron Man 3, so if you're on the fence about seeing it hop off and go check it out. There are plenty of surprises, wild Iron Man gadgets and of course plenty of action.<br/><br/>Likes: First I really liked the villain(s) in this one. The ""Mandarin"" was a good choice for bad guy and Ben Kingsly played the part perfectly. Aldrich Killian played by Guy Peirce did a superb job of the true mastermind of evil in this film. The CGI and the special effects were top notch as expected from any multi-million dollar project like this one. At first I did enjoy all of Tony Stark's different Iron Man suites, but it did get a little corny and over used towards the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Dislikes: What I didn't like about the film was Tony stark really does not do all that much time in the Iron Man suite. What I really did not like about Iron Man 3 was the fact that Iron Man / Tony Stark is suffering having panic attacks from his time with the Avengers! He acts like a wimp through a good portion of the movie. And that was just not very cool.<br/><br/>Thoughts: After seeing Iron Man 2 I was a little disappointed that I sat through it and was trying to be convinced by the writers that I should feel sorry for a mega wealthy playboy who is having trouble health problems, and now the writers want me to feel bad for the same guy who is having PTSD. Simply lame writing choices if you ask me. Overall though both movies were good in my opinion, but both had things that I didn't like. Simply lame writing choices if you ask me. Overall though both movies were good in my opinion, but both had things that simply irritated me. If the studio and writers are not careful they are in danger of going the way of the Batman series of the 90's, that started off great and just got completely worthless in my opinion."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","2","16 May 2013"," Very watchable 3rd installment...Just isn't a grand one
","There was quite a lot of hype going for this flick. Especially since it's a superhero movie and because it's the third or fourth installment for this superhero in movies. And despite the hype I thought this flick was alright but just isn't as epic or grand or even all that entertaining as I thought it would be. I mean it was a fun watch and didn't get bored of it like in ""Iron Man 2"" but just isn't all that great either. The final battle in this where like over 40 Iron Man suits come together to fight the bad guys is cool and all. And thus worth the admission, but the build up is a bit disappointing. Not awful or anything but kinda disappointing. There wasn't much Iron Man in the previous ""Iron Man"" movies but I think there is just enough of Iron Man in this one but barely passable. There is however a long gap showing Tony Stark investigating and trying to figure out a way to beat the villains without his suit. It's cool how they tried to make Tony use his intelligence which is his main weapon, instead of the Iron Man suit. Since Tony Stark despite his genius level intelligence has no powers. But just wasn't done in a way where it seems all that intelligent, clever or awesome. Very watchable but isn't impactful, despite him going all MacGyver on one part. And the main twist in this is alright during the watch but after it's finished and I started to think about it and then it started to irritate me a bit. The Mandarin is not only a iconic villain in the Marvel universe but it's Iron Man's archenemy. Like how The Joker is the archenemy to Batman. And both villains broadcasts themselves, except The Joker met the audiences expectations when Batman faced The Joker and it was freaking awesome. This one decides to give the audiences a middle finger after the trailer hyped up this villain. This movie completely screwed him over for a twist and in my opinion the sacrifice wasn't worth the twist. I don't know if they wanted to make this movie unique or was anxious for a twist. There would have been plenty of ways to throw a few curve balls at the audiences and not tick them off. Especially when a movie like this has a budget over 200 million. And would have made the final showdown more meaningful. Here is a idea, since the final battle in this flick has over 40 Iron Man suits battling. They could have made it so the Iron Man suits was used to use as offense or defense against The Mandarin's Ten Rings of Power, since each suit has their own special sets of skills. And it would absolutely would have been cool to watch. Few new characters also adds to this movie in a positive manner though...Mostly. It's a entertaining watch but just wasn't as entertained as I hoped to be and just didn't find it all that exciting. This is a very watchable third installment, just isn't a grand one despite the well crafted and yet somewhat lacking final battle.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"lagudafuad","7","1","2","16 May 2013"," It was nice, full of comic and Iron Man suits
","I have not been a huge fan of any movie that drags longer than just two parts, for that reason I delayed in watching this new Iron man, in fact the last one wasn't so great so I wasn't expecting much here, but boy was I impressed. When Disney took over Marvel this was one movie that I knew took in some cash to get done and I was skeptical, as to me cash is not what makes good movies, it is good stories, well Iron man 3 had a good story and the supporting cast were just off the hook. The movie had a nice comic feel, and the action scenes were relentless, the writers were always leaving me speechless by the turn of events making me eager to see where the movie was going.<br/><br/>The writers decided to keep all things on the level of science, in the Iron Man comic book series the Mandarin is his archenemy and he is portrayed to be a genius scientist and an extremely skilled martial artist. The Mandarin showcases some powers which sources are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Here in this movie the Mandarin is just a face of the true villain and there is no evidence of him having a common sense, the move had a pure scientific genius hiding behind the face of Mandarin.<br/><br/>The movie picks up with a flash back of when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was having a New Year's Eve party, there he met scientist Maya Hansen. Maya was working on an invention called Extremis—an experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Maya wanted to work with Stark to make this drug work, but Stark rejected the offer.<br/><br/>Years later, Stark's experiences during the alien invasion of New York were making him restless. Out of that he built several dozen Iron Man suits, all tied to work with his subconscious, this act created friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). A terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been the orchestrator of a string of bombings all done with no forensic evidence to trace the type of bomb used. When Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is badly injured in one such attack, Stark overcomes his stupor and issues a televised threat to the Mandarin.<br/><br/>That led to Mandarin retaliating bringing down Starks home and the world thought Stark died, so Stark used his now presume state to hunt down the Mandarin and discovered that the Mandarin is not who he thought he is.<br/><br/>This movie is clearing cash in the box office, and I believe it will cross the 1 billion mark soon, so if you have not seen this movie, I wonder what you are waiting for<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"redryan64","7","1","2","15 May 2013"," How About a little Back to Basics!
","REMEMBERING THAT HUMOR has long been both an integral part as well as a sort of trademark of writer Stan Lee's work, the IRON MAN films certainly must rank high on the totem pole of comics to film adaptations. Added to this is the interpretation of the character by Mr. Robert Downey, Jr. and the wise cracking dialog between the principal characters, Downey and Miss Gwyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>AS FOR THE SPECIAL effects,. need we say more? The FX in the modern super hero flick are a given. Long before a patron plinks down the price of a ticket, he knows what to expect. He (or She) is never surprised with the smörgåsbord of explosions, car chases, gun battles and general mayhem that unfolds several times during a two hour feature. As Stan Lee would say, ""'Nuff said."" <br/><br/>NOT SURPRISINGLY OUR main criticism of IRON MAN 3 involves what we like to refer to this pandemic of ""Creeping Revisionism"" on the part of so many of these screenwriters. Whereas, we certainly do not expect that a scribe who's worth his weight in Golden Age Comics should or would just rewrite the same old stuff over and over again! What'd be the point?<br/><br/>BUT THE BASIS of any updating should not violate. For example: in BATMAN (1989) the Joker is named as the killer* of Bruce Wayne's parents and the Joker is killed off at films end.** In SPIDERMAN, Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) displays some sort of mutation in the wrists that shoots the spider webs; whereas that ""power"" had always been the result of some sort of ""wrist squirt guns""; which dispatched webs of a type of super strong latex (or something).<br/><br/>THIS PASSION FOR rewriting is most evident is one aspect of IRON MAN 3. That is their treatment and handling of the character of The Mandarin.<br/><br/>WE RECALL THE origin of the feud between Tony Stark's alter ego and this rogue Chinese Warlord. To begin with, the Mandarin was obviously a sort of knock off of Sax Rohmer's DR. FU MANCHU; being a 'Roadshow' Fu Manchu, if you will. That would also put him on the same family tree with Alex Raymond's villain, Emperor Ming (the Merciless) in FLASH GORDON.<br/><br/>WHAT WE GET instead is a sort of comics hybrid between the real Mandarin and Hosama Bin Laden. Add to that a voice that has the accent of some ""Good Old Boy."" The ultimate misuse of literary license is in making the Mandarin a sham, a phony front man for the true villain, (Guy Pearce).<br/><br/>OTHER THAN THAT, we view the big action scenes in most of these Super Hero Epics as looking increasingly like the electronic games, which they've spawned. Anyway, the line between the two becomes more and more blurred.<br/><br/>NOTE * Any Batman fan knows that the true killer was Joe Chill, a low level street thug & stick up man.<br/><br/>NOTE: ** The process of Joker's dying is repeated in DARK KNIGHT; leaving one to conclude that the Batman Franchise is turning into SOUTH PARK."

","It's Christmas time for Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, who after the events in New York (also known as The Avengers) want nothing more than to return to a life of philanthropy and ease. Unfortunately it's not as easy as all that as Stark is plagued with post-vortex panic attacks and insomnia, with which the only way to cope is to tinker and spend evening upon evening in his workshop creating various suit prototypes. Then, as if that wasn't troubling enough, some terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin is high jacking television, making threats and blowing up various locations and/or people. <br/><br/>In a way this third installment of the Iron Man franchise is the darkest. For the first time we see Stark in a truly vulnerable state. He loses his friend Happy to a coma and after a public, mediated threat to The Mandarin, manages to lose his mansion, flashy cars and for the majority of the film, his suits. That and a bout of post-traumatic stress and we, my friends, have a dilapidated superhero.The villainous protagonists are also detrimentally ruthless, from the stereotypically ethnic Mandarin (played wonderfully by Ben Kingsley in a role full of surprises) shooting someone in the head on live television, to Aldrich Killian (a previously snubbed-by-Stark scientific engineer) playing with temperatures of over 3000 degrees – the threat feels inconceivably surmountable. <br/><br/>Thank goodness then for the likes of Shane Black who contrasts this sense of inevitable doom with subtle gags (kudos for the inclusion of Downton Abbey and a reference to Croydon) and sharp, sassy dialogue as- ever brilliantly performed by Robert Downey Jr. Laughs both big and small, in addition to an unlikely sidekick in the form of a cool young kid named Harley, gives Iron Man 3 its heart and ultimately carries the film. <br/><br/>It would not be a Marvel blockbuster however, without a good dose of explosive action which Iron Man 3 absolutely delivers and kudos to the special effects team who work wonders with certain suit trickery. Equally the T-1000-esque super-hot humans were visually effective, constantly regenerating and glowing as a result of Killian's Extremis and Advanced Idea Mechanics. However the action also led to the films' downfall. Sequences such as the skydiving 'barrel of monkeys' felt a bit over the top and the last thirty minutes or so did drag on a little too long. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, these are minor qualms outshone by Black's main strength – fast-paced, entertaining dialogue with a mixture of zing, heart and soul, excellently implemented into what is essentially a fun yet smart, action-filled romp. All of which made stronger, by wonderful performances from Kingsley, Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce who so obviously revels in playing the bad guy. <br/><br/>As Marvel's first outing since The Avengers, the pressure was on and it is a true testament to the strength of Iron Man 3 that The Hulk and co were not missed (although stick around after the credits just in case you still have a hankering). However as the believed last installment of the Iron Man franchise, blockbusters boasting this strong a calibre will be - and boy, what a send off."
"Xarnis","5","1","2","14 May 2013"," A very good movie, but it has its flaws
","Iron Man 3 is a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel cinematic universe that ultimately falls short of the standard by The Avengers.<br/><br/>There are glaring plot holes, clichés, and underdeveloped characters, but there is a lot to like in Iron Man 3. Shane Black manages to inject his own style into the film, giving it a fresher feel. The dialogue is crackling and witty, and the performance from Robert Downey Jr is, as always, top notch.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the fresh direction from Black cant overcome traditional superhero movie tropes, but that's expected from Marvel films. More glaring are the villain's muddled motives and Rebecca Hall's character who is basically a throwaway aside from the opening scene. Not only is Hall's character a throwaway, but so is the young boy that Stark comes Ito contact with about 1/3 through the film. That entire plot point felt unnecessary and more unrealistic than most points in the last two Iron Man films.<br/><br/>Overall, Iron Man Three is fun to watch if you want some action and a few laughs, but if you're looking for something like The Dark Knight, look elsewhere."

Overly self-conscious acting and explosions, most of them conspicuous excuses to show off our new armor and effects. An unintimidating threat. Blatant Avengers plugging.<br/><br/>Number 3 does the same thing. It just kinda pretends it doesn't.<br/><br/>Thankfully Iron Man 3 does give us an actual story and character development.

Because it's way better, way better, but it's not a good movie.<br/><br/>If you go see it with college buddies, it'll be funny. Go see it with your parents, it'll be entertaining. It takes place post-Avengers, so be ready for the references.<br/><br/>If you're into the superhero genre right now, I will recommend it. I just won't call it Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>Now here are the spoilers.<br/><br/>If you read the comics or know the story, you got really excited when you saw the trailer the trailer and they implied the sentient-suit storyline. I will say in the books it's way cooler, the suit goes crazy and becomes a villain, that doesn't happen in the movie. The movie alternative is actually really cool, though. I'm not sure they could have done that story full-on the way it is in the books because they've already established the fact that JARVIS is in control of the suits. In the books Jarvis is an actual person and the only thing in the suits is a separate VI.<br/><br/>The overall story shows that Stark was somewhat traumatized by his experience with the Avengers in New York and spends months just making more and more suits with different abilities. He even gives them cool names.<br/><br/>When the Mandarin and AIM show up (both established villains in the books, with awesome reboots) he realizes that he has full blown Anxiety and has to deal with the fact that he's genuinely not okay.<br/><br/>After writing a recent article on the stigma of mental illness, I can applaud the writers on this development. It's also in keeping with the books; Tony Stark is usually not without some crippling illness or trauma worth noting. He's been benched for Alcoholism, nerve damage, drug abuse, and currently I believe there was something about his body actually being comatose but forced to be active using the arc reactor in his chest (I might be wrong).<br/><br/>There's also the fact that this movie passes the Bechdel test, the standard measuring whether or not a movie is feminist-friendly. Maya and Pepper are strong women (if not at all independent), one is a revolutionary geneticist and one is the CEO of an influential multinational company. That's pretty awesome to me.<br/><br/>Now the plot twist about who the villains are is something you're not going to see coming. Believe me, I'm not going to spoil that one, but omygaz. I will say, I will only say, Ben Kingsley was the best casting choice I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Like I said above, if you're a comics fan or you're into the genre right now, I'd go see it.

","Filled past the brim with a tighter script with fewer quips and even more action than the previous two installments, Shane Black's take on the metal-man's saga is gripping, fantastic entertainment with a capital E. Guns, robots, robot suits, self-healing people who can regrow limbs, you know, the usual stuff.<br/><br/>The new villain to enter the world of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is The Mandarin, a mysterious, disheveled terrorist who's supposed to bear quite the resemblance to Osama bin Laden (although bin Laden himself is referenced in the movie). The Mandarin orchestrates several attacks on the US, but, tellingly, the explosions leave no trace of actual bomb. The Mandarin terms these attacks as lessons for the American people, and as they escalate in stature a nation turns its lonely eyes to Mr. Tony Stark, who's still trying to mentally process the events of The Avengers.<br/><br/>You might remember that in The Avengers, Iron Man temporarily sacrificed himself to save Earth by traveling through a worm hole and fighting off alien bad guys alongside Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor. For a man who up until that point was essentially a playboy who settled the occasional revenge/grievance, Stark has a lot to go through. Now he suffers from horrific insomnia (72 hours awake!) and night terrors. His place in the universe has been forever altered, and so has he psychologically. So he ensconces himself within his laboratory/basement and works on Iron Man suits to his heart's content, forty-something, actually, each one with different capabilities, each designed to defend the Earth against, well, anything.<br/><br/>But this has made for a brooding superhero. He can't sleep, so he does what he does best - build - to the eternal chagrin of his love, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's now head of Stark Industries (well, High Up, anyway). Tony's behavior both frightens and confuses her, and now this business with The Mandarin - will Iron Man get sucked into another adventure?<br/><br/>Here's how this movie differs from its predecessors. We no longer see only the invulnerable, cocky, risk-taking Stark. This new Tony is much more like Batman, looking for a way to escape from his demons and not even knowing what those demons are. He suffers panic attacks and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This makes for a much more evolved, shall we say, superhero. It ain't just about him anymore, or about Pepper. It's about the life, the universe, and everything. And his mortality shows, like the slip of a woman who's dressed hurriedly, and he doesn't like it one bit.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D. It's worth it, doesn't seem forced. I didn't bother with the IMAX, because I don't really need to be that immersed in a comic-book movie, but your mileage may vary. As far as I was concerned, the 3D was more than enough. <br/><br/>Stark makes copious use of his technology, but there comes a time in the film when he has basically nothing with which to work. I'm talking no suit, no JARVIS, no Pepper, no lab, no nothing. He has to rely on his intelligence and creativity and resourcefulness - the very same traits that got him out of that cave in the first Iron Man movie. It's not an altogether pain-free experience.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle returns as Rhodes, whom the government puts in the War Machine suit from Iron Man 2, repainted in red, white, and yes blue, sort of a nod to ol' Captain America, called Iron Patriot. Nifty, and it reminded me of the early part of the Captain America movie, in which Cap essentially has to sell out and perform as a sideshow act for the troops, to keep up morale. With a Good Guy robot on their side, the government is pleased - until...well, this is truly not a spoiler, but a resident baddie finds a way to control Rhodes' suit, and we next have a subplot regarding the abduction of the president and the true identity of The Mandarin (guess what - Stark's past is involved).<br/><br/>Now, those who are avid followers of the comic books may well be unhappy with some changes. Deal with it. The movie is not in a different dimension from its cinematic ancestors, and that's really the correct comparison. Some minor characters may have changed a little from the comics. Does it mean the movie suffers? Of course not.<br/><br/>There was a lot more humility than I'd come to expect from these movies, more humanity, more fear of mortality. That injection of reality, following so close behind the tragedies within The Avengers, makes this a very good genre movie. Yes, there are surprises, and yes, there are moments when your heart skips a beat, and yes, there are truly beautiful moments. But in all, this is a high-energy, hyperactive film that still manages to be philosophical and even regretful."
"ilovepahoo","10","1","2","12 May 2013"," Iron Man 3: Interesting, But With Mispalced Humor
","Be Warned: Spoilers ARE included.<br/><br/>Iron Man 1 was a wonderful light film with lots of laughs. Iron Man 3 however didn't do much for me. I thought that the humor was misplaced and even if some of it was entertaining, i wasn't very amused because I was so tense. I just felt that this was much more serious and dark. The fact that Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) could breathe fire was absolutely insane and I thought it was much too outlandish. I suppose the whole ""Extremis"" idea didn't really appeal to me. I thought it was much too outlandish for my taste. The first 2 Iron Man films were strange perhaps but almost plausible and maybe even believable. However, this one is totally impossible. When Pepper Potts falls into the great pit of fire, I think it would have been better for her either to die or to have been caught by Tony before. It was WAY too predictable that she would live and I think the best endings should be bittersweet. They shouldn't all end happily ever after and even though I really like her character, I might have enjoyed the film more if she had not lived. Anyway, i rated this a 6 and I hope some of you agree with my viewpoints. Thank you."

","This film was a nice entry in the Ironman series, although probably not the film fans of the comics would of wanted. Being both, a fan of the films and comics I was perched on the fence with this one. First of all the cast were great Downey Jr is a brilliant Tony Stark and I thought the film was quite amusing in places, a great film for the casual fan. Although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I read that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film I was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that I would come to expect from such a story arc. The mandarin character gets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a middle finger to the fans (although Kingsley is pretty funny.) Anyway my least favorite film of the series but still a good, enjoyable film."

"rob_picken","6","1","2","10 May 2013"," Proof that not everything good comes in three's
","Like every Marvel fan, I was eagerly anticipating Marvel's ""Phase 2"" in the movie universe, first of which was the 3rd instalment of Robert Downy Juniors run as Iron Man.<br/><br/>However this time around, it's a little bit different, as Jon Favreau steps down as director and in his place steps Shane Black (Lethal Weapon 1-4, Last Action Hero, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). And if there's anything comic book movies have tough me, not everything good comes in 3's (Superman III, Batman Forever/Batman & Robin, Blade Trinity... the list goes on). <br/><br/>Now that's not to say its on the same level as ""Batman & Robin"" far from it, however after sitting through a somewhat lengthy movie (it's a lot longer than the last two), it definitely shows why a change of director isn't always a good idea ( anybody remember X-Men 3?? Yeah probably best not to..). While the last two get their fair share of criticism, they were at least consistent plot wise whereas this one sadly, is all over the shop. While this is designed as a follow up to last Summers box office smash ""The Avengers"", it really doesn't feel like it at times. <br/><br/>Now.... on to the characters. While RDJ and Cheadle do a fantastic job as Iron Man and War Machine, they're barely ever there. Unlike the last two films, the screen time is mostly given to Tony Stark rather than Iron Man, who takes a beating early on in the film by The Mandarin (more on him later). Along the way he befriends a boy who later becomes his ""sidekick"" (I use that term loosely but it's true) and he comes back to fight. Only..... The Mandarin isn't quite what we're lead to first believe and we later find out a big spoiler later on.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad movie as I've said... but it's definitely not the strongest in the Iron Man movies either. Of course this review is purely opinion, and you're more than welcome to go and watch it yourself, however if you're a comic book fan like myself there's a chance you won't like this movie.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Like Nolan's third Batman, where he is portrayed as a cripple, hobbling out of retirement at half strength, here we have an Iron Man lamed with busted and under-powered gear throughout. What are we paying for if not to see our superheroes be super? <br/><br/>Then there was the lame plot. Stark dares the Mandarin to come and get him, gives his home address, and then doesn't bother to suit up, all the while having the wife in the house, exposed to risk. How stupid. <br/><br/>Equally stupid is that the Mandarin actually comes, with nothing more impressive than a few missile firing helicopters, despite knowing what Iron Man is capable of, and having no reason to suppose our man wouldn't be all suited up and waiting. Or at least have his radar turned on."
"Jey047","7","1","2","9 May 2013"," Good Start, but ultimately disappointing
","Iron Man 3 started out well. It's a decent action-thriller-comedy, but ultimately disappointing as an Iron Man movie. The main reason for this is that there's very little Iron Man in the movie. For a solid 80% of the movie (at least) we get a lot of Tony Stark running around sans suit and quite a bit of remote suit action mostly controlled by Jarvis, though occasionally by Stark. There's very little of actually Tony-in-the-suit Iron Man time and action. Even during the big fight sequences neither Tony nor Rhodey actually get much action in their suits (Rhodey actually has no action sequences in the suit, unless you call being instantly incapacitated and forced out of the suit action).<br/><br/>A little less Tony and a little more Iron Man would have made a lot of difference. As it is, the movie should have been called ""Tony Stark with the Iron Man Suit."" Then there's what they did to the Mandarin. He started out well, sort of a Ra's Al Ghul type of mysterious terrorist with unknown motivations. A good way of presenting the character when you don't have several decades and hours of screen time to develop the character's comic book mythos. Unfortunately, half way through the movie they make the Mandarin a joke and a clown, and a potential powerful and intimidating opponent for Iron Man is quickly discarded.<br/><br/>And then there's the cherry on the icing of bad decisions - a guy who breathes fire. The entire audience in the theatre I was at groaned when that happened - an incident only slighted mitigated by Stark remarking: ""You breathe fire now?"" The rest of the bad guys ultimately fall flat because you never get to find out what their motivations are? Why is Killian doing what he's doing? Why does Hanson do what she does? No one's motivations are explained, leaving them flat and colourless.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a extended sequence that almost seems like a possible farewell to the RDJ-Stark-Iron Man character, and a quick run through of what might have actually been a better story if they had dealt with Stark's alcoholism rather than creating an anxiety disorder for him.<br/><br/>I think people are going to miss the movie this could have been, which would have far surpassed what we ended up getting."
"FSfilmblog","8","1","2","9 May 2013"," Shane Black's take on old red and yellow shiny boots
","The third in the ever increasing popular Iron Man series, follows on from the enormous Avengers film where we find Tony Stark having to battle anxiety attacks and sleepless nights from his experiences fighting extraterrestrials in New York. Not able to cope or fully recover, Stark hides himself amongst his suits and gadgets neglecting his partner Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow in a more substantial role this time around). The story starts though with a flashback, going back to 1999, before Stark became Iron Man.<br/><br/>The events that unfolds, informs us of how a budding young scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) comes to Stark with a new idea which unfortunately, he dismisses, this in turn results on his past decisions coming back to haunt him... Fast forward to the future and there is a more imminent danger in the form of The Mandarin (played with great joy and humour by Sir Ben Kingsley), who targets the US and threatens to kill civilians via bombings.<br/><br/>Stark ignores the publicity and news on the Madarian and doesn't see it as his duty to get involve but when his ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Favreau), becomes one of the latest victims and suffers from major injuries, Stark issues a threat on national news and announces his address to Mandarin which was an unfortunately the wrong thing to do.....<br/><br/>There is quite a bit of substance to the story and there is a some choice dialogue littered throughout the film. Not really surprising come from the director Shane Black. Anyone who is familiar with his screenplays will know he has some killer quotable lines (just check out The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Stark is once again imbued with great charm and retorts, but it isn't only the heroes who come out with funny dialogues, even the henchmen come out with some comedic lines.<br/><br/>This is a much improvement compared to the last film, which did feel a little tired and more of warm up towards the big gathering of superheroes that was The Avengers, this time around Downey Jr is given more of a job of acting, instead of just his face in a helmet. The film's logically progression is to show what he can do with out his powers, or in this case his multi million dollar suits and gadgets....which is of course to rely on his wits and charm.<br/><br/>It's probably fair to say that this is more of Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man film. That's not to say it's a bad thing. There are still some amazing set pieces within the film to satisfy the action junkies (most notably standout would be the multiple passengers rescue in mid air). The plot just feels more meaningful and thought out. <br/><br/>If this is to Downey's Jr last stint as Iron Man (he will reprise the role in the forthcoming Avengers sequel), this is a good send off to a character he has made his own and anyone looking to step into those red Iron boots, will have a hellava job to match (let alone improve) his interpretation.<br/><br/>read more of my reviews here: http://fsfilm.blogspot.co.uk/"

"flaming-idiot-production","Null","1","2","6 May 2013"," Finally, Iron Man versus the Mandarin
","Iron Man Three has the unique distinction of being a part of not just the Iron Man Trilogy, but also of the Marvel Universe in general and has to fit in seamlessly there, while still holding its own as a stand-alone film.<br/><br/>Does it perform under such pressures? To a very large degree, yes.<br/><br/>The plot follows Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) facing the consequences of his own rash actions in the past, forcing him to take on his biggest enemy yet, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). In the process, Tony goes on a self-discovery journey, makes a few friends and rekindles his spark with Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) Usually, in the third part of a trilogy, it is an obligation to break down the hero before he rises up to discover what he truly is. Keeping this in mind, the physical attacks on Tony Stark are absolutely mind-blowing but the psychological damage on him seems extremely forced and unimpressive.<br/><br/>The Trailers showed a few scenes of the destruction of the Stark Mansion, but nothing can prepare you for the visuals that you will end up seeing. Director Shane Black manages to set up a mammoth canvas to paint a rich, vivid and absolutely smashing film.<br/><br/>The film deftly switches between the various layers and story lines while being coherent. The action sequences are exemplary and the performances by Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) and Ty Simpkins (Harley the kid) are very good. Gweneth Paltrow has more to do in the movie as does Don Cheadle (Colonel Rhodes aka War Machine aka Iron Patriot). Jon Favreau (Happy Hogan) is also given decent screen space and performs admirably.<br/><br/>But, while many factors have worked in its favor, the film suffers from a few flaws as well. The dialog is not as crisp or witty, the laugh out loud moments are few and far apart. Most importantly, the film creates a vicious set up that is let down by an elaborate but weak climax.<br/><br/>Also, there remains a nagging thought that Ben Kingsley as Mandarin had the capacity to truly strike fear a la Heath Ledger as The Joker. Instead all he became was a victim of a script twist. Fans of the Comic books will know that Mandarin is the Arch-Nemesis for Iron Man and what becomes of him is extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>Still, the film has managed to salvage itself from the debacle that was Iron Man 2 and hats off to Shane Black for creating something of such epic proportions.<br/><br/>P.S. One would have wished that the end credits scene contained some reference to the Guardians of the Galaxy Movie or maybe even Ant Man. But its worth the wait, nonetheless."
"TyRawrrnosaurus","7","1","2","5 May 2013"," 'Iron Man 3′ Creates a Better Hero, but Forgets About the Villains
","Exactly one year after Joss Whedon's The Avengers, audiences every where have been anxiously awaiting Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3. You would think with how successful The Avengers has become, Iron Man 3 should have no problem coasting toward success. Financially, Iron Man 3 should do gangbusters – it already has overseas – but since Marvel has opened Pandora's box to a greater cinematic universe, the true victory will rely on whether this film can hold up on its own without the crutch of the other Avengers. <br/><br/>The first of it's kind, no other film has ever taken on the burden of being the sequel to two separate stories. Although both Iron Man movies and The Avengers are part of the same universe, Iron Man 3 must be looked at from both angles differently. Marvel has now forced this upon all of its properties. This may work well in the comic book world, but can it feel right when it is on the big screen? With that said, director Shane Black had a huge weight on his shoulders to deliver not only a comprehensible Iron Man sequel, but also a continuation of where The Avengers left off.<br/><br/>A lot happens in Iron Man 3, but luckily Shane Black never makes it difficult to follow. Black and co-writer Drew Pearce have developed a terrific screenplay for Tony Stark to grow as a character while also writing a shining example of how a superhero can stand up when the chips are down. For a good portion of the movie, Tony can be seen without his armor and how we see him deal with this situation makes for wonderful entry into the superhero genre. Robert Downey Jr. couldn't have been any better as Tony Stark – it's almost as if he was born for this role. If this is the last time we see him portray this character, he certainly goes out with a bang.<br/><br/>With a lot of the emphasis placed on Tony in this film, sadly we are not granted a lot of time with the villains to explore their motivations. Their intentions are clear to some extent, but not all their plans seem logical or thought out. Not completely understanding the villains' goals provides very little tension or immediacy for Tony to save the day. Extremis, especially, is also never explained into detail and the rules of how the treatment works on different people is vague. There is a very bizarre twist that goes off canon from the comics that will cause a huge divide among movie goers that I see as a huge downfall for potential Iron Man films. I didn't hate it, but it's not something I truly cared for.<br/><br/>All of the performances are top notch, especially from Sir Ben Kingsley. He works The Mandarin like it was second nature. Gwyneth brings even more vivacity to Pepper that positions the character very well in the end. Rebecca Hall was unfortunately wasted as an actress and not given much to do, but Guy Pearce does a fine job bringing life to a character with little depth.<br/><br/>The direction of the story was handled well, but one of the biggest problems I had was with the pacing. Certain moments are rushed without giving them time to marinate, especially the points where Tony's character arc changes and then again at the very end. This movie is filled to the brim with exposition and subplots, but if it had a little more time to expand certain areas while fine-tuning others Iron Man 3 could have been knocked it out of the park.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is grittier and more raw on every level – far more adult than any other Marvel Studios film to date. It could have easily obtained an R-rating if Shane Black had his way. Technically it is on par with what we have come to expect from a Marvel superhero movie. It is visually superior to a lot of the CGI creations we see today too, but the 3D is less to be desired. On many levels Iron Man 3 holds well to the Marvel cinematic style, but at the same time Black infuses his own flare which differs greatly from that of Jon Favreau in Iron Man and Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>As a sequel to Iron Man 2, this film is solid. It vastly improves the scope of Tony Stark's impact on the world and is a great stand alone edition to the Iron Man franchise. But as a sequel to The Avengers this film fails on many levels. There are references to the team and what happened in New York, but nothing that could tie this film to the bigger picture. Not even S.H.I.E.LD. plays a role in this film and at no point are we told where anyone else is to get a sense of why they could not come to Tony's aide. You would think with all the terrorist threats, someone from The Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D. would come into play if the life of the President is in danger. Nope.<br/><br/>For anyone who loves what Marvel is doing and goes in expecting a great Iron Man film, you'll be treated to a fantastic ride. And those hoping for another movie on scale of The Avengers may leave a bit disappointed. Iron Man 3 is a decent stand alone Iron Man movie, but in no way does it succeed as a continuation of The Avengers. Despite its flaws, Iron Man 3 is a hilariously enjoyable film that expands the character of Tony Stark very well and is filled with tons of spectacular action for anyone to enjoy."

","I found this film to be very disappointing. I have been a huge Iron man fan since I was very young, so I have been looking forward to this film for about a year and a half. The main issue I had with this film, was It's misuse of key characters: like the Mandarin, James Rhodes, and Maya Hansen. The film instead focuses on a stupid kid sidekick, ""super pepper"" and a fire breathing Aldrich Killian. The lack of including S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers was also an ill advised decision made by the newly appointed director Shane Black who you may remember from predator or the end credits from the lethal weapon films. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have already seen: Place beyond the pines, 42, Oblivion, and Pain and gain. Which are all far better films, but If you must see Iron man 3 immediately, see it cheap. Because otherwise you will be upset for spending more then about 10 dollars on this film. Robert Downey jr. gives another strong performance as Tony Stark, and made me decide to give this movie a seven instead of five. Don't expect to see much of the main man in his metal suit though. Except during the last action scene which is very redeeming, and seems to have made most reviewers forget about the films flaws. Like I said this film is okay, but there are far better films out right now, and this one just isn't worth the ticket price. Thanks for your time, and happy movie-going."

Star Trek The Motion Picture is a perfect example. The trekkers, myself included, wanted the reunion of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest. The special effects and sets pushed Star Trek beyond the boundaries of TV. It wasn't a very good movie but people went to see it for the stars and special effects and it made MONEY!"

My disappointment isn't so much about this just being a poor movie, it is more about the direction the characters and story went. Here we go....<br/><br/>I'm devastated by what they did to War Machine. They can not include him in any movies after this one. He's was just so emasculated in this movie and he can't be taken seriously now.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley was building a very good Mandarin character and then that crashed and burned. I understand that he wasn't ""actually"" the Mandarin, but the trailers and the first half of the movie built you up for that. The plot twist just didn't work and left me really disappointed. That sort of plot twist can work if the real bad guy is more interesting than the fake one. That wasn't the case here and a real director would have known that.<br/><br/>So... anybody can wear and operate an Iron Man suit? No training or security access required? Not good writing, it's just not good writing.<br/><br/>Both Stark's and Killian's technology in this film were over the top. Yes, I know it is based on a comic book and had to be stepped up since the last film, but the tech in this movie was strictly fantasy with no effort towards realism at all.<br/><br/>I guess my biggest disappointment is that this isn't just one movie. This is the entire Marvel Universe that is taking a hit with this one. After the excellent work on the Avengers last summer, to see the characters and story line be so damaged by a new director is disappointing."

","I really enjoyed the first half of this film. It played well to Tony S's personality, ambition, and overall troubled state of mind coming off the near-disaster of New York city being vaporized. Perhaps that near-death experience gave him some PTSD there!<br/><br/>The villains seemed rather undeveloped-- thrown in like cheap marketing tricks to give the film some much needed fodder for Tony's suits to blow up. <br/><br/>The flying suits were a bit overplayed, and seemed to fall apart WAY TOO EASILY. After the first five times, it seemed like they were held together by mere plastic connectors. They could have slowly introduced us to the concept of the suit being able to dissesemble-- it was too much too fast and used too heavily as a plot device to save the day.<br/><br/>Ah the ending. I had a total WTF moment the second TS decided to blow up the suits. What on earth would trigger such a thought? He had nearly been killed, had his home destroyed-- why scrap the very devices that he had built his legacy on? And really? Getting surgery to have that shrapnel removed? THAT IS JUST PLAIN RIDICULOUS. Anyone in their right mind would have gotten it removed as soon as they got to a hospital! Also 'getting Pepper fixed' was a real cheap move, taking the emotion buildup straight out of the ending. What a disappointing way to go out-- on this film, not to mention the not so subtle James Bond reference. The ending scene after the credits was cheap also, and not worth waiting for.

","Iron Man has always been one of my favorite Marvel heroes; He has a great character, his plots are always cool, and his suits always intrigued me. With that, I only have one question for Marvel. What happened with Iron Man 3? (Warning, ragey spoilers ahead.) Where to begin. Let's start with the villain. If the villain in Iron Man 3 were only to be AIM, that is completely fine. It'd be a cool science vs. science matchup where one works for evil and one works for good, that is totally fine. But why, oh why, would you bring in The Mandarin--an amazing super villain that would provide great battle scenes and CGI--in on it? It just doesn't make sense, and wasted a great opportunity. Secondly, if the point of Iron Man 3 was to humanize Tony Stark and make the suit less vital to the plot, that too is fine. But then WHY bring in 42 of them at the end? It just doesn't make sense! In the first two titles, each suit served a purpose to the storyline, and the viewer felt attached to it. Like the Mach 1 in the first title; it became the symbol of Tony Stark's escape. I had NO attachment to any of the suits, as he only was really around one, and it just was a comedic plot device, and done poorly. The only thing I really enjoyed of the movie were the one liners, which mostly had me laughing very hard; particularly the one of Tony and Harley on the street of Rose Hill.

","Iron man 3. One of the movies I was dying to see. When my friends somehow managed to get the tickets I went out of my mind. I will have to explain the movie in two parts: the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The good.<br/><br/>1) The acting. There is not a person in this movie that did a bad role. Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, Guy Pierce as Killian, the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and the almighty Downey Jr. Each and every one of them are so vivid and entertaining that one just could't not enjoy the ride. Their characters were, opposed to the former movies, more layered, had more humane problems, they actually made Iron man so human that it was a delight to watch. Of course, Downey Jr.'s acting made the whole concept even more interesting. Pierce was amazing. His diabolical persona is frightening, but the most disturbing and frightening thing is with how much ease does he do it. His physical and mental change from the first sequence to the last is about the same quality as Daniel Day Lewis' (just for comparison, Lewis is not part of Iron man 3). Kingsley is a prototype of how a great actor, after a staggeringly powerful career, can have fun. He really had fun, and everyone in the theater could tell. The problem was that his character was Devastated/MUTILATED by a horrible idea and script.<br/><br/>2) The humor. This movie is packed with it. There is not a sequence in which I wasn't crying of laughter. Sometimes the jokes are so well hidden not all of them were noticeable at first, but they were there. I think that after seeing the movie about two or three times all of the jokes could be noticed, and one could still have a great laugh even though all of the jokes are known.<br/><br/>3) The action sequences. This movie is packed with them. They are breathtaking and they hold you on the edge of your seat. The plane sequence is magnificent and really scary (especially if one is afraid of heights), and the final sequence is marvelous. Dynamic and powerful, with magnificent CGI that was UNNOTICEABLE!!! Perfect.<br/><br/>The bad.<br/><br/>4) The script. If I could use curse words I would. Trust me. This is a school example of how a movie is rushed into production just so it could raise money. The basic plot doesn't exist, the enemies don't have a real agenda, their evil look is way more Sci-Fi than necessary, but the twist made me want to kill the director and writers. It had potential, it could have had class, but this is a version that should have been more thought of and needed to be better. Also, the whole idea of the movie is filled with flaws and errors that a better writer could have easily fixed.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Iron man 3 is a good film to watch with your friends on a Saturday night and then go for a beer. It has great acting, magnificent jokes, it will give you a few thrills but it will devastate you with a ridiculous and unnecessary twist and no actual bad guy agenda. It is different than its predecessors because it is a lot less comic book styled, but in Iron Man's case comic book style is to be expected. 7/10 just because of the acting, action, jokes and because Paltrow is really, and I mean really sexy.<br/><br/>In addition: The Avengers were a better Iron man movie than this!!!"
"cherylblodgett39","5","1","2","4 May 2013"," Maybe the hype was too much
","This show was OK. The questions I had was, was this a love story, action flick or a movie to ""find ones self worth"". Don't get me wrong but the graphics were great but how many machines does one person need? Where were they (since they can sense danger) when the house was getting blown up? Oh yea getting blown up. While in all this, everyone comes out unscathed. Reading the other reviews, I would have to agree on some parts. IM says the suits only for him but man he dressed almost everyone in the movie with his suit. As well, IM can defeat aliens (Advengers) but can not take on these ""earthling experiments"". I would have to agree with comedy in a movie is OK but how that was displaced in the movie confused movie goers on what type of script/movie this really was. What's with the kid helping him ""find himself""? But in the end, some pretty cool stuff presented him frm IM (nice car). Overall, the story was ""so so"" (clip after the credits was well presented) & already awaiting the DVD version as it would have the commentary to explain everything."
"seconlucavy009","6","1","2","3 May 2013"," Yet another formulaic Iron Man movie
","Watched it yesterday at the local theatre. I heard some people talk about how it is the best Iron Man movie of the three. Well, let me tell you, it is as formulaic as it gets. The bad guy is shown with the rather tiring motive of world domination and has a female accomplice who as usual is enamoured of Tony Stark and saves his skin.<br/><br/>Also Tony's squeeze has a few bad ass moments herself. He creates a dozen computer controlled suites for Doomsday but then destroys them after the final fight. Well what if it happens again, huh Tony? Sure, the effects are good but the plot is weak, and it is not hard to guess what happens next. The surprise hardly feels like it because we have already guessed it. Also the humour is cheesy, it hardly matches up to the first movie."
"badajoz-1","1","2","7","19 March 2014"," Truly Awful
","'Iron Man 3' has two highlights - Ms Paltrow in an Iron Man suit and seen with awesome red devil eyes. The rest of the movie is rubbish, pathetically attempting to be 'oh so serious' as Tony Stark tries to to work his way out of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder from 'Avengers Assemble' action in New York. And doesn't he make a meal ( a very pathetic one ) out of it. By the end Robert Downey Jnr looks bored stiff and we have long lost interest! Again this is one of those blockbusters that has to have a CGI action scene whenever the writers/director thinks the audience is getting bored. The plot is a tired retread of the lunatic mad disappointed scientist (Guy Pierce) trying to bring the USA to its knees with a fake terrorist (amusingly played by Ben Kingsley). While Tony Stark is wandering around the Mid West (like Superman when he lost his powers!) trying to find answers and himself. The plot requires you not to understand who the bad zombie-like 'blow yourself up' terrorists are or what are the limits of their capabilities - because some can be killed and others magically regenerate! Yes, this film is lazily written, putridly directed, and barely acted, with an honourable exception made for Gwyneth Paltrow, who obviously demanded more of a part of the action. Ah well. The final blow out and blow up spectacular finale with umpteen dozen flying metal suits fighting numerous explosive zombies is just sheer and utter c***. And the film made hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office - I despair."

"Left-Handed_Liz","8","2","7","6 May 2013"," Thrilling movie for fans of the Iron Man franchise
","Ever since Batman Begins in 2005, cinema fans have been living in a world ruled by what I have termed Dark Knight Syndrome: Action-adventure and comic book movies nowadays are expected to be cerebral and dark, and not in the way of the noir-ish, theatrical Batman films of Tim Burton. <br/><br/>While action movies have always had a high body count and buildings exploding, the consequences weigh heavier on today's mainstream movie hero: Loved ones suffer and die. The hero is put in a situation where he is stripped of his power, all his secret weapons, and forced to literally fight for his life. Themes run throughout of revenge and atonement, facing inner demons and past mistakes. And while such themes are powerful, all that brooding weighs as heavily on the audience as it does the characters. Which is why, for as much as I love the complexities of films like the now-completed Dark Knight Trilogy and the rebooted James Bond, I truly enjoy Iron Man for its ability to keep the pulse racing, but also to laugh at itself and its over-the-top situations, and keep spirits high. <br/><br/>Iron Man has been framed from the outset as the story of Tony Stark's path toward redemption. Like Batman, he chooses to use his wealth and power for good, but rather than fighting crime as the result of a personal tragedy, he becomes a hero in the hopes of cleaning up his act, while somehow never losing his hedonism and arrogance. This third film continues the theme of reckoning for past sins, opening with narration from Tony himself featuring the usual old hat about the past coming back to bite you in the ass, and inner demons and so on. We see Tony focused on his own vulnerability and mortality in a much more believable way than the previous film (where, ironically, he was actually dying), as he throws himself into creating more mech suits, sleep deprived and plagued by nightmares. The focus here is on the man, not the mech, as the two are treated as almost separate characters, especially here, with the suit being able to move on its own (or dragged through the snow like a sled when de-powered). Also similar to The Dark Knight Rises is the film's interpretation of the Mandarin, an all-too-familiar mishmash of foreign affectations and over-the-top mannerisms, and the inevitable twist reveal of who really holds the power. <br/><br/>Where this film differs from, and is in a certain way superior to, other blockbusters of a similar nature, is in the humor and high spirits it has throughout. Iron Man as a film franchise has always had a quirky, out-of-left-field sense of comedy, which can hit its target or miss completely, and come even in dramatic or intense scenes. Even though the films' attempts to make connections with the War on Terror and the Iraq War can frequently seem crass, if not downright exploitative, I believe that, if this film is any evidence, the effort was to heal, rather than to traumatize. The theme throughout is one of healing and reconciliation (Tony's anxiety attacks are all related to the alien ""terrorist"" attack in New York that occurred in The Avengers), and suspension of disbelief is stretched far enough that it's hard to call BS when the main players all get happy endings. <br/><br/>As a serious movie, Iron Man 3 is uneven, to say the least. In this case, though, I'd say being an entertaining and interesting movie is more important. The action scenes are absolutely brilliant, with shining moments for the supporting cast. Gwyneth Paltrow's scene in the Iron Man suit is sadly brief, but she gets a few great moments later on; meanwhile, Don Cheadle as Rhodey gets some truly impressive action stunts sans armor. Though some may find it repetitive, I loved the innovation of the coded armor, which flies through the air and assembles piece by piece. If nothing else, it made the fights more interesting, and was certainly better utilized than the suitcase-portable armor from the second film. <br/><br/>Overall, coming from someone who's a fan of fun, interesting movies, even when they don't know the source material very well, I give Iron Man 3 a solid thumbs-up. If a movie has you jumping up and down in the aisle after it's over, it's doing something right. The first movie, I felt entertained; the second, I felt nothing. Third, I was grinning like an idiot. ""Tony Stark will return,"" the stinger promises, and I'll be quite excited to see what he'll do when he does."
"lssor111-435-710861","8","2","7","6 May 2013"," Tony Stark IS Iron Man
","This movie summed up just about everything the first two began, how does a superhero juggle his or hers personal and public life. Tony Stark has made no bones about it, he is Iron Man, however Man is a suit. Who is Tony Stark if his suit is not available when needed? This movie answers that question, and brings us the human sides of our characters. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of suit action in the movie, but balanced out by strong human interaction and some ""Bondiness"" when needed. Being the 3rd Iron Man movie, we expect the characters to evolve and grow. Indeed they do, leaving questions about the future. A reviewer wrote that this movie was ""unacceptable"". Good grief, it's a movie for the masses, not a direct insult to your entertainment palette. While paced oddly at times, with many short action scenes in favor of long pieces of dialogue, I'm not sure what the basher's expected, but there's plenty of action, especially near the end, some hilarious comedy, and even without the suit for a while, Tony IS Iron Man!"
"elsgray99","7","2","7","4 May 2013"," Why does everyone hate this?
","I personally did see this as a bit of a let down, however the Marvel community has done the best they could on this. Tony Stark is back to his old talkative cheeky self and brings a lot of comedy to the film. Iron Man destroys his enemies the only way he knows how, leaves nothing left. So why is everyone moody with this film? Have all your periods synced up or something? Come on guys, although the film was a bit more comedy than usual, this was still awesome.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was great in all sorts of different places; -The script was well written. -The plot was still great. -All suits were amazing! -Pepper Potts was great. -The special effects were great, with parts of Iron blasting onto Tony's Body. -The exploding enemies.<br/><br/>The one problem I found was, they never explained why Aldridge wanted to blow stuff up? Was this Marvel's attempted at a Joker? The only one complaint I had!<br/><br/>Robert Downing Jr. was great in this. He never disappoints when it comes to Iron Man. He was funny, clever and as per normal, great with his gadgets.<br/><br/>This film was not as good as the first and second, and it was very hard to live up to them two, stop being picky, leave that to the critics, come on guys, this was an amazing film and we are all butchering it! If the first two Iron Man's didn't exist, I see this film getting at least a 8.5 out of 10 rather than 7.9! Come on guys, we are the Marvel Universe, do this film justice and boost the ratings guys, it deserves more!"

","Just to set the record straight for all you hard core comic book folks who keep complaining that these movie are not true to the comics they are as true as they can be and then they are a Marvel Universe of their own. The sooner that you accept this the better off you will be. It really not that large of a leap I mean really how many alternative story lines are there for every character in the Marvel Universe? Is Peter Parker with Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane? Is Wolverine 50, 100, or 500 years old?.... and on and on. Do you feel me. If you just come to the conclusion that this is the Movie Marvel Universe then you will watch Iron Man 3 and positively love the plot twists and cinematic approach put forth this go around. The mandarin is done brilliantly and the marketing for the movie gave nothing away. RDJ's Iron Man approach real life issues in only the way he can which is entirely unique and exactly as individualistic as everybody on earth is. I loved the exploration of the greater man behind the suit because let face it Tony Stark is the Gem that built the Iron Man Suit not the other way around same with Don C's War Machine. The only problem I had with the movie was that I felt the villains ultimate goal was not clearly fleshed out. What was his end game? World domination is the obvious bad guy answer but to what ends? Did he feel like he could make the world better with his work or was it a bone to pick or does he just want to watch the world burn what was going on their. I can't except the absurd notion of making a switch job because I don't think any American citizen would go for it regardless of the circumstances provided we are just to stubborn for that( I'm not going to say more about this because I don't want to give to much away... If you watched it you know what I'm talking about). Go watch it and Plllllease throw away your preconceived notion on what a Marvel film should be."
"xamtaro","7","2","7","30 April 2013"," A little Rusty...
","Marvel has dug themselves in deep with Avengers. Woe to any other family friendly superhero blockbuster to ever come out as it will forever be held against the standard set by Avengers. Woe to Iron Man 3, which not only stacks up badly against Marvel's prior superhero film but falls victim to sequel degeneration.<br/><br/>Our story takes place after the events of The Avengers and Tony Stark is having anxiety attacks after his near death experience in New York city fighting off an alien invasion. At the same time, he is trying to be a good boyfriend to Pepper Potts in order to ""protect the one he loves"". But in comes an old rival Alderich Killian who either wants to seduce Pepper with his snakelike suaveness or just loves acting like the bad guy he is. Meanwhile, the terrorist leader ""The Mandarin"" has launched a slew of attacks around the world in order to teach America ""a lesson"". Quite a heavy start to the movie. Until, that is, one particular Mandarin attack hits close to home, putting previous Iron Man director Jon Freveau into a coma (hence perhaps why Shane Black took his job). Tony is furious and in his ego fueled anger does the stupidest thing in all superhero history: he gives his address on public television! As expected, villains attack his house and kidnap his girlfriend. So much for wanting to ""protect the one he loves"". Tony is forced to go into hiding and fight back, without the help of his high tech armor, against genetically enhanced foes with melting magma powers.<br/><br/>Here is the only genius move this film makes: letting Tony Stark kick ass without his high tech armor. The hero known as iron man is not bound by thus it of armor, but he is the man inside. Tony Stark is iron man and no one else can be him. With only his wits, ingenious mind and resourcefulness, Tony proves himself a true hero. However, these moments are handled less like character development and more like another ""tony is awesome""sequence. Stark still has the same jerk ass attitude from previous films, still has his planet sized ego; it seems that all that has happened to him since he first chose to become Iron Man had not changed him at all.<br/><br/>What did change was all the elements taken from the original comic books. The human bombs from Matt Fraction's Invincible iron man series have been haphazardly combined with Warren Ellis' Extremis concept. The end result is not the ""next stage of augmented human evolution"" as per the comics but quite literally ""melter people"". Yes there is an iron man villain called The Melter whose powers is to melt things. Not sticking to the source material is fine, but blatantly poking fun and insulting the source material is a totally different matter. Case in point: the mandarin.<br/><br/>Simply put, the mandarin is meant to be Iron Man's dark opposite: mysticism against might, Supernatural against science. If Tony Stark were Batman, the Mandarin is his Joker. But Shane Black and pals took that character to the crap pile. Instead of being the analogy for the nature of modern terrorism as promotional material for the film claimed, the Mandarin is revealed as a complete joke. First, they ripoff the ""big reveal"" from Batman Begin's Ras Al Ghul. Then, like some kid's lousy April Fools prank they spit on the very character of the Mandarin turning him from the Monarch of Mayhem into the dysfunctional love child of Austin Powers and Mr Bean.<br/><br/>With all its special effects flair and big budget action pieces, Iron Man 3 cannot decide whether to take its subject matter seriously or not. Just as they are going into some good politics or philosophy, we cut to another comedy act for cheap laughs courtesy of Robert Downey jr. His acting is great, everyone's is. But the way it is handled breaks the tone of the movie. You have a film with unlimited potential for surfacing some serious political and philosophical subject matter. You have a film that could show a flawed character coming full circle with his heroes' journey. You have a film.......that does nothing of that sort and is perfectly content with being a comedy ridden summer blockbuster complete with an irritating kid sidekick for Iron Man.<br/><br/>Lesson: If you want to tackle serious subject matter, make a serious film and take the villain seriously. Iron Man 3 reeks of unoriginality, drawing many elements from The Dark Knight trilogy: hero loses everything and goes into exile, hero faces an adversary who turns out to nothing but a ""front"" for a more sinister bad guy, hero is trying to be a good boyfriend but endangers his loved one, hero is forced to rely on his wits alone without fancy gadgets, hero wipes the slate clean in the end and starts anew. Familiar? Of course it is. No doubt the casual movie goer will be drawn in with spectacular fight sequences, big budget special effects and Robert Downey Jr's charisma. Oh and obviously by good ""word of mouth"" from the success of The Avengers. to No doubt Iron Man 3 will be a big hit by riding on the success of The Avengers. And at very least, it paints a successful trilogy whose first film gave birth to Marvel's cinematic universe."

","I found Iron man 3 very entertaining. I had high assumptions regarding the movie, but I ended up enjoying it even more than I knew to expect.<br/><br/>I think the movie was better than its prequels in many ways. It was full of events, the tension in many parts was exceedingly thrilling and the plot went on fluently. The new characters suited the plot perfectly and I found it really hard not to love them. The movie also gave us a change to get to know the old characters more deeply. As for Tony, it was amazing how the movie brought up so many of his sides, the humorous, sarcastic and smug part, but also the other, more deep side of him. I have never liked Pepper as much as I do now, and the movie served Happy and Rhodey as well.<br/><br/>The movie was also visually beautiful and the effects were stunning. I give credit to the brilliant visual development, too. The explosions, battles and other scenes alike were realistic and exciting.<br/><br/>Altogether, Iron Man 3 was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend watching it, were you a fan of Marvel or not!"

I found this part the best movie of Marvel Cinematography after Avengers so far!<br/><br/>Action scenes, whenever we see Iron Man fighting the bad guys are perfectly proportional to Tony Stark storyline, trying to defeat a fear in himself. It is a perfect way to show this difference between the person and his suit, and raise a question, about who is Iron Man - a suit or a man?<br/><br/>People say the antagonist look just so unreal and ""too much fiction"" like. However I want to remind all of these movie fans, that Iron Man is nothing but a MOVIE BASED ON COMICS! When I was going on Iron Man 3, I did not expect to see a ""realistic SCI-FI"", I expected to see a quality special effect, which will bring me into the atmosphere of Stark Industries world, and I was totally satisfied! <br/><br/>I am not going to talk about Robert DJ and Gwyneth performance, as I fount it as amazing as it was in previous parts.<br/><br/>I really hope I would at least make you doubt your negative thoughts on this movie, as I together with the rest of comics fans found it incredibly good.<br/><br/>Thank you."

","After seeing this movie, and after all the great press it got I came on IMDb to see what others though about it and I was shocked to see such negative feedback! I quickly set up an account so I could write a review and hopefully present a better overview of the movie. <br/><br/>Let me start with saying I understand why a die hard fans may be upset with the portrayal of the Mandarin, however to everyone else it was great! If you don't know who the Mandarin is (which most people wont) then trust me you will appreciate the move taken here as well. <br/><br/>Yes there are a few insignificant plot holes, but I only realised these afterwards thinking about the movie and they didn't take away from the core experience<br/><br/>These two issues are nothing however when you take into account the movies upsides, the classic RDJ comedy was the best its been with the packed theater laughing continuously and the action was probably the best id seen in any super hero movie bar 'the avengers'. And to me, action and comedy are the two most important parts to IM, and a more vulnerable IM made things much more interesting also.<br/><br/>This movie was not made for fanboys, rather the mainstream public. It was the most enjoyable movie by far and so if you're just some average joe that hasn't read an IM comic before (like 99% of the public) do not be discouraged from seeing this movie!"

People who like the dark knight trilogy because its 'dark' even though no one dies will find this great. This film has it all, great special effects, action sequences, comedy and concepts.<br/><br/>Its Main bonus that it has over the other two installments is that is not just another bad guy in a rip off suit. Those looking for another Avengers will be expecting too much, and may well be disappointed, but they need to save the team ups for Avengers 2! <br/><br/>My only fault in this movie was the lack of scenes with Rhodey in his suit, War Machinedeserves more screen time!

"MovieAddict2016","5","2","8","13 May 2013"," Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang
","Shane Black was a promising choice to take over the reins of the Iron Man franchise. Marvel is known for their cut-throat operating tactics, and, after rumours of internal strife with Jon Favreau on Iron Man 2 (word has it he felt they were rushing him and his production -- which, in hindsight, given the lackluster response to the film, is probably a fair assessment), they unceremoniously ditched him for the guy who made Robert Downey Jr's lead role comeback vehicle, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,"" in 2005.<br/><br/>Black was the Tarantino of '80s action screenplays, an overnight sensation who was hired to act in ""Predator"" purely so that Joel Silver could get free on-set script rewrites. He had a string of big hits into the early '90s until a couple bombs stung him and he retreated for ages. It's sort of weird that he chose a $200 million franchise picture to be his route of re-emergence - but so it goes. The trademarks of Black's scripts are here: the movie is set at Christmastime, has a lot of witty banter, and there's probably a lot more humour than in the last couple Iron Mans.<br/><br/>Here's where my first fault lies: the tone of this movie is decidedly different from the first two. I think that was deliberate and a wise choice, given that the first two Iron Man movies seemed to be set more firmly in reality, and ""Avengers"" (and the Thors and Cap Ams) sort of opened Tony Stark's world to something more fantastic and unbelievable. If you rewatch Iron Man, if an alien suddenly showed up at the end it would be a jarring tonal shift. But after Avengers, anything is possible, so Black takes the action a little further, takes the Extremis plot to extremes (pardon the pun), and makes the movie a little more goofy than I expected.<br/><br/>Here's what is odd, though: if they're trying to reestablish Iron Man as more fantastical than he was in the first two installments, why the controversial Mandarin subplot? I don't have a dog in the race so to speak since I don't read the comics, but if they're going to try to make the Mandarin a 'realistic' interpretation, why bother to (some might say) ruin the iconic character instead of presenting him with his magical powers? Would having powerful rings be *that* much weirder than gods from Asgard showing up or a giant green hulk? I also thought Black's dialogue, though clever, was under-served by some of the woeful supporting actors. The main henchman working for Guy Pearce's character was entirely non-intimidating -- they should have gotten someone whose supposed menace wasn't so laughable. The female Extremis warriors, all supermodel status with their flawless makeup, just made me roll my eyes. Black gives all these characters cheesy one-liners that wouldn't be so cheesy if they weren't such bad actors. When you're sparring with Robert Downey Jr you need someone who can match the verbal delivery - that's why Val Kilmer's smarminess was a perfect complement to Downey in Kiss Kiss - but Black consistently gives Downey poor pairings. It's sad when the little kid ends up being the best one of the lot.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is fairly wasted again and Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do. Such is normal for the franchise so far but you can't help but feel that whole (fairly odd) hour build-up with Tony out of the suit for much of the time they could have better developed these characters. The biggest disappointment, though, is Guy Pearce. If you thought they wasted Mickey Rourke in the last film, wait til you get a hold of Pearce. First he's given the Jim Carrey role in Batman Forever to redo in the beginning, then he's just a sort of charmless yet hammy villain later on. His motivations are clichÃ©d and underdeveloped. Pearce is a brilliant actor and filmmakers continue to waste his talents.<br/><br/>The movie has some cool action sequences and the $200 mil is up on the screen. The CGI is some of the best in any film made to date. But it's also becoming all so mind-numbing. The big long action sequence at the end goes on and on, and because 99% of it is so clearly CGI, much of it becomes uninspiring. You lose interest in Tony's humanity when so many of his feats betray physical limits: I think there's a hundred shots in this movie where he's leaping off a high building of some kind and jumps into an Iron Man suit mid-air and flies around and does something just in the nick of time to save someone.<br/><br/>I don't know - maybe I'm just burnt out by the onslaught of Marvel products and how relentless they've been with jamming these movies down our collective throat - but I really think I'm getting bored by this franchise already. Judging by some of his recent comments, so is Downey. Part of me hopes he does take a hiatus from Iron Man so he can start acting in proper films again - a sequel to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang would actually be quite nice."

You cannot, North Korea does not have a Mandarin and would not make any sense culturally; Captain America's nemesis from the 70's - Yellow Claw is another antiquated relic and even Shang Chi could fall that way except he is designed to break away from that mould, as the son of Fu Manchu who seeks to do right and not what suits a Middle Kingdom from World War 2...<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke as the Russianised Whiplash was more relevant and yet how Marvel treated the premise in Iron Man 2 for me seemed very cheapened when one considers Gorbachev & Perestroika.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was fine, if a book & film are the same then it's boring, it's the adaptation which makes for cleverness or a bomb - ""Outland"" with Sean Connery is only case where movie was better than the book for me until Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>That is why it is so necessary to throw most of the comic books you know out the window, then Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man 3 was brilliant, it is an excellent capper to a grand trilogy which was part of a larger plan to realise the making of the Avengers.<br/><br/>So making Mandarin as a drugged up patsy for the real villain was understandable, when you consider this is another type of commentary on the War Against Terror, which still channels Fahrenheit 911 & Swordfish but in a different twist which still has mettle.<br/><br/>The whole film is about transformations. Killian started as a greasy long haired geek who can barely walk; Tony Stark began the trilogy as a womanising alcoholic and concluded in IM3 as an Uber-MacGyver who got anxiety attacks because he learned to be in love and care for his staff and even appreciate his ""tools"" of Jarvis & Dummy. Tony was forced to learn that it's not the armour which carries him through, it is his mind which makes it all pull together.<br/><br/>There are those who watch this from the outside and want to know why Mark 42 armour was so flimsy - when you have a prototype are you placing all the bells & whistles first or making sure the basic functions are coordinated? Using Star Trek: Next Generation the TV Series as a corollary, the NCC 1701-D had fewer weapons than the original Enterprise although it was a better designed ship.<br/><br/>If you knew nothing of the comics this would be great in its own right, this is to draw Non Readers & Fanboys simultaneously. Killian's transformation was the reverse of Mandarin, and his vendetta seemed realistic for me (Guy Pearce's acting on par with Robert Downey Jr when you recall Pearce has been 3 heroes - Time Machine, Lockdown & Count Of Monte Cristo, yet the only other bad guy was when he appeared in Adam Sandler's Bedtime Stories)? If a Comic Book movie follows slavishly to what was printed before, then where is the thrill or surprise in watching?<br/><br/>France did it with an Asterix film (where he met Cleopatra), but what they did was to add not subtract from the book... Marvel used the same treatment of creating an Alternative Universe with Spider-Man, Wolverine and the Xmen and all had satisfying Box Office results! IM3 sews up the development of a petulant rich-kid into a responsible technocrat acknowledging his actions have global repercussions, with Tony Stark's chest now fully healed this allows for superior armour which can fight Thanos or whosoever in Avengers 2, without having to divert as a pacemaker, which is an evolution not peculiar to the films but on par with the comics too! Ironic? ;)"

","First of all, let me dismiss every bad review here. They are just angry that the script didn't follow more of the comic book world---which by the way, sucks anyways. This is by far the best of the Iron Man series. The movie starts slow...and then builds into major action. I won't give any details away, but the movie script is good, the character development is good, and the special effects are mind blowing. I WANT to offend all those that gave the movie a poor rating...and say...get a life (it's not the worst Marvel movie ever). I would probably go see this movie again if I could afford it. So, yes, the movie is great, borderlining on the best of the best. Go see it and write your own review.<br/><br/>Eddie Jackson http://eddiejackson.net"
"ryan-285","9","2","8","7 May 2013"," Impressive!
","Iron Man 3 surpassed my expectations. I was very surprised by one aspect especially - It works as an action/comedy movie, rather than a ""Comic Book Movie"". Regular movie goers can follow everything without a ""nerd in tow"". Since I am usually the ""nerd in tow"" for my wife this was the 1st Marvel movie that didn't require a discussion answering the ""why did this happen?"" and ""what was this all about?"" questions that typically accompany an outing.<br/><br/>The film works almost stand alone from the universe. There are minimal references to the other heroes apart from a couple of lines. While events from the Avengers are a plot point, I really don't feel like not having seen the previous Marvel movies would cause any issues. The fact that nothing really seemed to be set up for future continuities either, dialed back the synergy somewhat. This is not intended as a negative, just an observation. I usually revel in the little hints that are dropped concerning other characters or future developments and there didn't seem to be many. However, those hints could be in the film and I just missed them.<br/><br/>Now that the nerdy bits are out of the way, the film is superbly paced, almost never dragging, and pretty much always interesting. As a whole it just flows well. The action is filmed excellently. The acting is top notch. The jokes hit pretty much every time too. The visual effects continue Marvel's high standards. Even the 3D was done well - every scene has depth and made me feel like I was in the world just that little bit more.<br/><br/>There is some debate about some very spoiler related aspects of the film. I personally feel that everything worked very well in the context of the established film universe. But to each their own of course.<br/><br/>Highly recommended - see Iron Man 3 in the theater and in 3D. I think you will enjoy it - even if you aren't normally a Comic Book Movie fan"

","First off, I am so surprised at all the negative comments! Especially the ones that say it is the worst super hero movie they have ever seen. Ummmm...I would say Batman and Robin falls into that category! Not this film! This movie falls in line with the Avengers!!!! One of the things people need to keep in mind is that this is a movie about a comic book character! If you are a comic lover, then you know they are supposed to be funny, over the top, great dialogue, action, and at times the things that happen are unbelievable! Iron Man 3 is all of those things and more.<br/><br/>This movie has everything going for it! Wonderful acting, amazing special effects, a great an entertaining story, spectacular humor, and a really cool twist! I actually think that this movie is better than Iron Man 2! The first one is my favorite because it is an origin film of how it all began! Please do not let the negative reviews deter you from going to see it! You will have a blast, you will laugh, and at the end of the movie you will be happy you saw it on the Big Screen!"

","Contains Spoilers I just cannot believe all these whiners who are shredding this movie to bits. This was the best of the 3 IM movies so far.IM1 was OK, first in the new franchise. Ridiculous ending where Stark admits he's IM. IM two came up with this bogus villain. Really not fulfilling. Pretty slow story for a superhero movie.<br/><br/>My expectations were low for IM3, but when I saw the Mandarin was in it, I said, great, finally one of IM's longtime villains takes him on. Yes, I will admit that seeing the Mandarin reduced to a puppet was hard to take. But you know, already the franchise had changed so much from the comics, that I said, WTH, just go with it.<br/><br/>So the Disney aspect takes over, and you just have fun. Seeing Stark suffer physical and mental pain was a great story line. Seeing Pepper finally get more action was great. This kid, a little annoying, but hey, again, it's a Disney film, so they all have kids. Get over it.<br/><br/>RDJ was fantastic. Again. Guy Pearce also fantastic as the bad guy. I loved this movie.

"earcher72","8","2","8","3 May 2013"," Pretty darned good movie
","I was a little worried about this movie, as the early returns on this page had some pretty excoriating reviews. However, we attended a late- night showing last night, and it prompted me to actually make an account and post a review.<br/><br/>This movie is quite entertaining. Funny, action-packed, and really, a pretty good story. Robert Downey Jr. continues to show why he was the absolute best choice to play Tony Stark in these movies. Razor sharp delivery, and timing, as always. He gets to stretch a little more this time around, with a host of issues chipping away at his cocky exterior. The whole tone, in fact, is much darker than previous Iron Man movies, despite the comedy, with Tony's whole life thrown into turmoil. <br/><br/>The middle does play a bit like a Lethal Weapon movie, with Black falling back on what got him noticed in the first place; comedic interaction with disparate personalities in stressful situations. The scenes with Rhodey and Tony are funny and interesting. <br/><br/>I am now going to use this forum to disagree with some previous reviewers, and here come the spoilers...<br/><br/>First of all, I liked the Mandarin Twist halfway through the movie. I certainly didn't see that one coming! Some have said that this destroys the comics' vision and story. I have been a comic reader all my life, and long ago realized that the stories in the comics are never going to be perfectly true to them when translated to the film medium. Just acknowledging this has allowed me more happiness to enjoy this movie and those like ""X-Men: First Class."" You get the gist of the comics story, with lots of little inside bits, but things are going to change. I for one am glad there were no 'magical' rings...And, of course, the door is still open for Aldridge to assume the mantle of the Mandarin (""I am the Mandarin"") in any future installments. <br/><br/>I also liked the addition of the young kid in the middle act. This provided some of the best comedic moments of the film, and gave something to the character development of Tony Stark. <br/><br/>The third point from previous reviews is Tony's surgery. In my opinion, the reason he did not do this previously was the fact that the chest reactor made him feel like the suit was a part of him. Even if he could have done so, removing the reactor would have somehow made him less Iron Man. His realization that he can be Iron Man, and yet not be a slave to the shrapnel in his chest is a major point. <br/><br/>So...all in all I quite enjoyed this movie. I might have a couple of little quibbles (how come the president couldn't do anything in the IP suit, but Rhodey could trigger the repulsors and fly them away?) but all -in-all, very satisfying. I was entertained by this movie, and really, isn't that the point?"
"dermaskin13","9","2","8","3 May 2013"," Good popcorn Film, whats the fuss
","May be a spoiler or two*<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie for what it was. i had no expectations. and perhaps thats why i liked this film much more than the other reviewers. Now i want to preface this by saying i love the escapism and distraction movies offer. you name it, i've probably watched it, but COME on guys and gals. lighten up! y'all acting like you don't know the machine that is Hollywood. So it didn't follow the original book. whats new. it was still entertaining. I started to wonder while reading some of these reviews if they were from people who didn't get the part' or disgruntled people somehow attached to the movie as it really wasn't bad. I've seen worse and worse remakes. wanna talk comic book i was not overly interested in health ledgers joker , only getting such raves because he died. Jack Nicholson did it better, but such is the Hollywood machine. Look, the comedy seemed to me in all the right places. nerd turned psycho suave villain believable in his obsessive 'you will see me now' revenge and the one, two one- two with the kid was fun addition it did seem to move the plot forward and appeal to kids and yes, toy manufactures rub their hands with delight but i can see how the leads who all have kiddies prob pushed for this inclusion but i digress. stop looking into things not worth looking into turn your critical eye on the political machine and stop allowing the brain melt of Hollywood to distract you from more important issue. Also<br/><br/>I cant help but be surprised at how many people got on here to review this movie with such passion of opinion and i cant help wonder if these same people are taking the time to complain about the money they lose on electing people to power who aren't looking out for their best interests and it sickens me that these same type of reviewers petitioned and raised money to get a veronica mars movie made with an actress whose long since retired the role. gross misdirection of people power and money."

","Ah! The man in the suit returns but is the story about the suit or the man? The good thing about the story is it concentrates at the man rather than the suit. The director shane black did a very good job by showing tony stark without suit most of the movie. The movie has good humor also. You can enjoy it very much in 3d as I did enjoy myself. And what does it have, the director destroyed tony starks house, some suits,and leaves tony with a suit that often misbehaves and not so much useful for a heavy battle. But instead he gave the viewers the powerful man behind the suit. And at least tony undergoes a surgery to remove the sharpnel(idea did not occur to john foreavu) and pepper survives a fall from 200ft height. But you still enjoy with a little surprise at the climax by getting(i will not reveal it. I want the viewers to guess it). So its a perfect flick to end the trilogy? Or will there be IM4?"
"triseult","7","2","8","28 April 2013"," High-octane return to form for the Iron Man movie series
","Kudos to Iron Man 3 for avoiding the third-superhero-movie curse. Marvel's ""Phase 2"" is off to a great start, with a movie that feels perfectly stand-alone, and which delivers character-centric, lighthearted action.<br/><br/>The script starts off a bit rambling and all over the place, but it doesn't take very long for big action set pieces to roll in and make us cheer for Tony Stark. Not that we need a lot to cheer him: Stark is as charming and funny as ever, and he steals the show every second he's on screen.<br/><br/>The action is loud and imaginative; the character angst is amped up and the stakes are high. This is a cool summer action superhero flick, much better than Iron Man 2. My only disappointment is the Mandarin, who starts as a very strong visual presence, but turns into something less impressive than I hoped.<br/><br/>I'm curious to see other Phase 2 movies, now. I may not collect Marvel superhero comics any longer, but I sure feel like I'm subscribed to Marvel movies. As long as they make them all like this--focused, lighthearted, fun, and character-driven--I'll keep on watching."
"baronsambdi","8","2","8","27 April 2013"," Bad movie, Great Fun! :D
","This movie is extremely bad in terms of plot and consistency, yet it's a blast of fun!<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 plays much with the audience expectations by contrasting the trailers and promotional material while delivering instead a non-dramatic, electrifying and plain fun movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, these 'twists' by not following an established formula, actually go nowhere.

"nairtejas","8","2","8","27 April 2013"," Not As Great As Its Predecessors. Period.
","The effects are magnificent, twists are jaw-dropping, performances are simply amazing, but the makers could not invent a story which indeed cripples the plot. So they planned to make it a trilogy. A moolah- minting brouhaha.<br/><br/>RDJ is awesome as you all could've guessed but the screen space shared by Gwyneth & Rebecca is equal to what Anil Kapoor did in Ghost Protocol. Pity. Kingsley is great with all his accent & grueling diction. Pearce is vindictive & absolutely in his character all way long. The villains impress more here than the superhero (or his friends range - from a kid (& his sister) to suspicious women) does. Or maybe because the awesomeness of TStark has dwindled due to incessant chafing. Maybe.<br/><br/>Some fairly fathomable flaws & lack of logic retards the viewing experience for the first half. But, second half is marvelously carved. Good direction. Good post-credit Easter egg. Nice rendition.<br/><br/>Music reminded me of Inception & it is terrific. Screenplay/effects/SFX/CGI is all top notch & make a great complement.<br/><br/>But... IM3 is vague in its foundation, so yes I spent some rupees for the movie, but I won't buy the BluRay (& that would cripple my MCUniverse collection along with that disastrous CAmerica) because it is just not worth. The 3D was bad, probably because of the post-production hassle.<br/><br/>Why do I rate it 7.7 out of 10? Because I enjoyed the 2nd half more than I enjoyed the last installment of The Dark Knight or if you are a Batman fan... sixth & seventh installment of Star Trek. The lights, luster & adrenaline is pumped up towards the end, while the conclusion is kinda kinky (read bongo-bongo).<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: If you follow the Marvel Universe, IM3 is a pretty relishing watch but not great as its predecessors...<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"jcasey369","7","2","8","25 April 2013"," Not quite as amazing as 1 / 2 / Avengers. Here's my thoughts why.
","****** MASSIVE-SPOILERS ****** You can tell I'm a huge fan of the Iron Man / Avengers films because I never usually feel the need to talk about a film as much as I have this one.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie was good! It just wasn't up to the exceptional standard as the other three. My favourite scene was when Pepper was saved near the start when Tony sent his suit to ""cocoon"" her as she was flying towards the wall. That had me saying ""YES!!"" out loud and grinning :) Was cool seeing her don the suit. That was the only point in the movie I got excited though :( Secondly, I did the bad thing and watched the first Iron Man 3 trailer a few months ago. I never usually do it but I didn't think it would spoil the film as it was an early, quite short trailer. It looked great and it did a good job at not giving away too much. But it also did a good job of portraying the film as something it's not. It made some emphasis on Mandarin's rings etc. and didn't show the little boy etc.<br/><br/>Here is what I identified as the reasons I was left feeling underwhelmed.<br/><br/>A bit too much slapstick (particularly in the battles). The first movies did see Tony Stark and his gadgets have the occasional mistakes, and that was amusing and played to make the character more realistic and show he wasn't perfect. In 3 though, it happened in nearly every scene and just took away his ""cool"" factor. The film came close to being so silly it could have been an Iron Man spoof. You can't be arrogant and come across as awesome if you're really just always making mistakes and getting in a mess. His suit was always falling apart and it lost the realism that the other films had as he would regularly fall to his death with hardly any armour on and survive without a scratch and get up to fight someone without the suit, showing no pain at all.<br/><br/>The kick-ass tracks from AC/DC that were closely linked with Tony Stark's style and were removed completely from 3. The most awesome scene in recent cinematic history is in Avengers when Iron Man hacks the radio of the Avenger's gun ship during the first battle with Loki, plays ""Shoot to Thrill"" and then says his cool line and crashes down and stop the fight.<br/><br/>Over the top (in a bad way). Simply throwing various aspects of the iron man lore into the film as 'cheap thrills' to make some ""money shots"" for the film trailer to make a quick summer block buster. Such as the ~40 different Iron Man suits which they only gave a second of screen time to each. Some of the iconic ones such as the (apparent) ""Hulkbuster"" suit only being shown for a split second running under something, getting stuck and then lifting it with its back. Additionally, the whole battle on the ship yard, there were many iron man suits flying around, circling and doing nothing. Right up to the very end where (seemingly) all the bad guys but one was dead. Tony was desperately trying to climb some scaffolding to rescue Pepper for several minutes, and finally go to her but couldn't reach her and then she fell to her death. This whole time you could see the Iron Man suits aimlessly circling them in the background. Any one of them could have come to help or even rescue Pepper from the fall. I know obviously she had to fall to make the whole regeneration scene work but this just emphasises the silliness of having 40 iron man suits hidden away and then just blowing them all up afterwards. It's called Iron Man, not Iron Men. Don't ruin the franchise by watering it down with the possibility of having many clones of the main character.<br/><br/>Mandarin was handled in a rather messed up way. It was a funny and interesting at first, but I kept thinking he would suddenly get back into character, put on some rings and try to kill Tony as if he was just pretending to be a clueless actor. I still don't get what happened here. I don't know much about the villain's lore but from what I've read and heard, he has 10 rings which give him abilities. So what on earth was this all about saying mandarin wasn't real, it was just an actor. Although, near the end the real bad guy did says he was mandarin, but he had no rings... I can only imagine he comes back in the next movie and makes them? Some review site I read said that the film was let down because they chose an unmemorable villain, that annoyed me as all Iron Man villains, in fact, Iron Man himself as ""unmemorable"" for the typical movie goer. I had never read a comic book till I saw the first two Iron Man movies but I loved every second of them. And I had never heard of ""Iron Man"" till the first film.<br/><br/>Not enough R&D. In past movies you saw Tony working hard in his lab trying to crack a problem to gain that extra improvement for his suit. This adds to the realism as you can see his inventions aren't just magically conjured up, he works hard to develop them. In this film they gloss over this aspect and you just see tonnes of new gadgets but no ""Going into hardware mode"" type scene. What we did get was a shopping spree montage in a hardware store, a kid fixing/keeping company the iron man suit and a few seconds of putting on an electric glove.<br/><br/>Lastly, a minor point, Stark Towers wasn't shown at all. I loved that place. Seeing Pepper and Tony hanging out in the apartment above NYC was awesome."
"haosstoposto","9","3","15","29 April 2013"," Finally - a real Iron Man
","I must say I went reluctantly to see this movie. The first two parts were in my opinion nothing special but for the sake of completism I did see Iron Man 3 and I am very glad that I did. It is a spectacular movie with a superb, almost epic music, composed by Brian Tyler. This time we have a very different Tony Stark then in the first two parts. In the past he was all show, a playboy who wants to attract attention. Now we see him suffer from anxiety attacks and fear after the trauma he experienced in the movie The Avengers"". He lives alone with his girlfriend Pepper in his mansion and he has become a quieter personality, obsessed with his power-suits which give him sense of security. The problem with the first two parts was lack of suspense. We knew that his suits will protect him from harm, and to be honest his enemies were not stronger than he. Now we have an interesting enemy for him, an illusive terrorist named the Mandarin who wants to punish USA and at the same time educate"" US president. He is a mixture between Bin Laden and Fu Manchu. He represents a blending of all western prejudices and fears regarding the eastern civilizations from the middle to the far east. He is a shadowy figure, surrounded by his fanatical followers, philosophical, honourless and extremely cruel. In this movie we also have a contemporary aspect concerning the war on terror and the connection between the US politicians and the oil industry. But not everything is as it seems, and that would be a major spoiler which I will not mention here. There are some other villains with superpowers which are very dangerous indeed. This time Tony Stark does not have much of his hi-tech gadgets at his disposal, only a single malfunctioning power-suit, which is a very good thing story-wise because it creates suspense. Everything is more difficult for him this time and finally we see him in action using his brains instead of power-suits. With this limitations, we see Tony Stark make a transition from superhero to hero, something the audience can relate to more easily. All in all, this is excellent action movie, with clever story, interesting twists and explosive ending. Highly recommended."

","Tony Stark has anxiety issues following the New York incident and the development of his relationship with Pepper Potts: this coincides with terrorist The Mandarin escalating his sequence of atrocities. And perhaps it all dates back to an incident long ago in Tony's past...<br/><br/>Iron Man Three (note: not Iron Man 3) delivers everything shown in the trailer, and quite a lot which was not what I expected. I did not expect this film to be so funny, for a start, but I laughed quite a lot, and by no means always at Stark's snarky put-downs. In fact, so much in this film was not what I expected that it becomes difficult to say much without spoilering, and I wouldn't want to do that.<br/><br/>So I'll stick with saying that I enjoyed it a great deal: far more than IM2, and I think probably more than the first one."

","As I said earlier, this is the best Iron Movie yet, but I should clarify, this is more of a Tony Stark movie. First of all, it's not better than ""The Avengers"", which is by far the best Marvel movie to date. ""The Avengers"", in my opinion, is also still the best Iron Man movie. It has some great Tony Stark dialogue and the best Iron Man action by far. Secondly, I would classify this as a Tony Stark movie as we see Tony Stark in action as a flawed desperate man much more than we see Iron Man. This is a different vehicle than we've seen before with the Iron Man trilogy. Shane Black takes this film in a different direction that Jon Favreau has in the past, and it is a welcome, albeit different direction.<br/><br/>I'm not one who will usually complain about longer run times of movies. I like more bang for your buck in most cases, I will usually watch deleted scenes on DVD's, even if they are probably best deleted. This would be a case where although the first half hour of the movie was not bad, it did make the movie a bit too long. The movie starts with the Stark compound exploding, and then we revert back to 1999 and get an elaborate back story to catch us up to current events. We then eventually get to the Stark home getting obliterated, and this is where I feel the movie should have begun. After this, there wasn't really a lull or any down time.<br/><br/>This is a Tony Stark movie. He invents, loses people he cares about, has issues, and gets damaged. The audience then gets to root for a mortal man on the path to possible redemption. This works pretty well for me. I will say it was a bit frustrating to not have him in the Iron Man suit more in the movie, just as it annoyed me that in ""Dark Knight Rises""; Batman was only present in it for about 30 minutes. If I had to guess, I would say Stark is in an actual Iron Man suit for less than five minutes of the movie. There were plenty of Iron Men and action scenes, and Cheadle as Iron Patriot, but Stark as Iron Man in action didn't happen until way too long in my opinion. This however may be something that helped the movie in ways as well. I loved the scenes with Stark. Downey Jr. fits this character like a glove, and while he may be replaced in the Marvel universe one day, I don't think anyone will play Tony Stark's cynical, snide character with any more finesse or perfection. There is more humor in this film than any Marvel film previously, and it's all pretty much Stark's witty dialogue and banter. We basically go with Stark on a manhunt for the bad guys after an explosion and attack hit too close to home. It is entertaining to see a mortal, vulnerable Stark who has to use wits and ingenuity (like Macgyver) to out gun the bad guys.<br/><br/>I did not have a problem with any of the villains in this film. I won't spoil the specifics of the enemies, but the genetic issues some of them have make them extra human and work pretty well and make quite an adversary for Iron Man. I was glad he didn't end up fighting against more Iron Men. While the film isn't as dark or desperate as I thought it would be, and the villains aren't as ruthless as seen in the previews, it's pretty entertaining. The tone reminded me more of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" which was directed by Black. The protagonist was in often in trouble but many times the viewer doesn't feel the weight or danger of the situation. While I didn't see this one in 3D or IMAX yet, I'm thinking I will have to. Good times.<br/><br/>To read much more go to www.moviescoundrel.com"

","I went to see this movie with relatively high expectations because of the splendid trailer and the good things i read about it. It makes me happy to report that it lived up to the expectations, like many said before. Also something what many said before is the fact that we see a lot more of the human side of Tony, other than the egocentric billionaire...And that's a good thing. Pepper on the other hand is more 'present' in the movie and i appreciated that a lot. The story in general is actually better than i expected, or as i'm used to in most action movies. It's difficult to write about the story without spoiling things so i'm going to keep it with that for the story. The special effects are (like all the Iron Man's) very spectacular and there's some new tech too, to keep Iron Man up to date ;p. <br/><br/>I'm really afraid of spoiling things, so i'm going to wrap up here! GO WATCH IT! You won't regret it!"

","I just finished watching this movie exactly 1 hour ago. Yes, the ending was not a fantastic complicated and absolutely mind blowing twist, but it was the ending that we all awaited, and Robert Downey didn't fail to deliver it beautifully. although the ending is somewhat expected, there are a few minor surprises throughout the movie, like when the mandarin just turns out to be an absolutely hilarious joke and a complete phony. the few comic lines that were splayed out in the movie did somewhat give it a light touch ( i especially liked that young kid aka potato gun kid). Gwyneth also plays her part beautifully, and i was touched when tony pulls his suit to protect her first :P All in all, it was a real joy watching this movie, it had that type of ending that just allows you to rest quietly knowing one of your favorite movies just ended well. highly recommended :D"
"Bokis2","8","2","9","2 May 2013"," A great movie with superb acting and really great action
","Before you read this, note that English is not my first language so expect some grammatic errors down below...<br/><br/>I loved the first Iron Man movie but I thought that Iron Man 2 was an unnecessary follow up that didn't match the greatness of the first one. I for one was really looking forward to this movie and I wanted to see if this was the sequel that Iron Man really deserved.<br/><br/>When the first trailer for this movie hit, a lot of people, including me, thought that we were to expect a darker and grittier movie. That turned out to be false alarm. This is by far the funniest movie in the series and it feels fresh and new, despite it being the third installment in the Iron Man franchise.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a voice over by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and he tells us his story, in case anyone didn't know about him yet.<br/><br/>You can say that the whole story of Iron Man has been a long journey of character development. In the first movie Tony Starks world is changed when he is kidnapped and he decides to use his technology for the good of mankind. In the second movie Tony grows into the role of being a superhero. Tony has to accept that he isn't the only superhero in the world and the fact that some things are beyond his control in the Avengers. <br/><br/>In Iron Man 3 Tony has to kind of go back to his roots and realize what is worth fighting for.<br/><br/>When we get up to speed we see tony tinkering with his new armor, MK 42, in his workshop. It turns out that Tony has been busy building new Iron Man suits as a distraction to forget the scary events of the Avengers. <br/><br/>The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a terrorist leader, starts to threaten the whole United States in live videos sent directly on TV. When Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tonys body guard, gets injured and put in coma by one of the Mandarins attacks things get personal for Tony and he declares war against the Mandarin. <br/><br/>The story centers around Tonys journey to get the terrorist leader while he is hunted by figures from his past such as Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), a brilliant scientist and one of Tonys old one night stands, and another scientist called Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who works on the serum called Extremis. Extremis can by hacking its way into the repair center of the brain repair body parts and oh, I forgot, turn the hosts into burning soldiers. These burning soldiers look really nice on screen and they provide some terrific action scenes. The Extremis serum is an essential part of the movies plot.<br/><br/>Along the way Tony has to rely on his own intellect and not on his trusty suits that he is used to do.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 offers some of the best action scenes I have ever seen both with Tony and his friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle). Even Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is in the action this time. And wow, what action she offers!<br/><br/>This is in my opinion a fantastic movie. The acting is top notch from almost everyone, especially from RDJ, Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce. It is good to see that Gwyneth Palthrow and Don Cheadle get more space in this movie as well, since they had pretty dull roles in the previous movies. One thing that hit me was the chemistry between every actor. Everyone is acting so well against each other and it makes every scene interesting and enjoyable. Like the scenes with Tony and the fatherless boy, Harley (Ty Simpkins). Ty and RDJ are so well synergized and the lines that they exchange are spot on.<br/><br/>The score made by Brian Tyler is fantastic and really hits the right notes (no pun intended). Sometimes it even rivals the Avengers soundtrack by Alan Silvestri (and that says a lot). <br/><br/>Maybe some of you reading this have heard about the twist that involves the Mandarin. I don't want to spoil it for you but it is pretty interesting. It may not be the most original twist ever but it's still a nice move nonetheless. I would've maybe preferred a more ass kicking Mandarin but I liked this version of the character anyway. I like when directors can take some space and do what they think would be good even if that involves changing an already established character.<br/><br/>Oh and I almost forgot! The visuals for this movie are really good and all of Tonys suits look great. You can really tell that the budget for this movie was high and used in a great way.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it feels well thought through, it has breathtaking action, the acting is great and that the story has a nice focus. I only have some minor complains about this movie but that is not enough to drag this movie down. Iron Man 3 is a summer blockbuster with all the right ingredients and this truly is the sequel we all wanted for Iron Man in the first place. 9/10"

","Given that the top review here is one that whines and groans and moans about how ""bad"" this movie is compared to Avengers --- I'm gonna tell you up front that Yes, Avengers was impressive. But I'll floor you by saying that Iron Man 3 held it's own and was the best of the lot.<br/><br/>In Iron Man 1 & 2 we saw the ego of Tony Stark, playboy billionaire who felt he had nothing to loose, so why not build a toy only he could play with. Both movies were about ego. Nothing more, nothing less. And as the comics showed us --- Tony Stark really is all ego.<br/><br/>But here in the real world we have things that we love that we are always fearful of losing. This movie brings that back home and shows us that for all his boisterous noise and grandiose ideas ---- Tony Stark really is a guy like the rest of us who cares about SOMETHING in this world other than himself. Consider for a moment the fact that in IM1 & 2 most of the ""save the world"" good deeds were really just something for Mr Stark to do to bolster his self-image in the media. Here --- we have a hero who actually realizes it's not always about himself. Sometimes you need to step back and let others help you along if you're really gonna progress.<br/><br/>All that said --- Guy Pearce's role was pitch perfect. Ben Kingsley's character was eerie, creepy and stunning to the end... I love that the man can give you a surprise you don't see coming --- and keep a straight face about himself. The villains were impressive and the Iron Man Suit upgrades even more so --- but the heart of this story really is Tony Stark finding out that the world isn't always about himself. Ego is a prison that makes it hard to love anyone other than yourself... and without love, what is life anyway?"
"hammancameron","8","2","9","28 April 2013"," Iron Man 3: A movie which delivers and doesn't disappoint!
","Iron Man 3 Review (No Spoilers)<br/><br/>Hello everyone and today I'll be giving you my thoughts and review on the must anticipated Iron Man 3. I want to start off by saying how much this movie exceeded my expectations. It was a brilliant, action-filled, funny and overall a great movie, which serves the Marvel Universe wonderfully. This movie delivered on a series of levels , which only some movies achieve. It executed the emotion, action, characters, plot-development and ending spot on! We explore parts of Tony Stark that we didn't see in Iron Man 1,2 and the Avengers before. Robert Downing Junior's betrayal of the character was simply brilliant. From the start of the movie, I was taken in by the character and that draws and emerges you in the movie. We also see familiar faces such as James Roads and Pepper Potts, once again great acting delivered by Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Mandarin was interesting and nothing what you'd expect from the trailers (Wink wink). The more compelling villain in the movie was Aldrich Killian. I feel that I can't go into detail of those characters, unless I include spoilers in this review, which I'm not. But hopefully you guys will see what I mean when you see the movie. The ending was great. Let again I can't go into detail what happens to kept this review spoiler free, but what I can tell you that the ending was very satisfying to conclude this movie. I would also like to say that there is an after credits scene after 60 years of the credits, but worth it. <br/><br/>I know some people might think that I'm praising the movie too much. I'm really not. It generally was a great movie and the best Iron Man movie out of the 3 released.<br/><br/>The verdict: Iron Man 3 is a movie which serves justice well to the Marvel universe and a great way to kick off 'Phase 2'. I give this movie a solid 4/5 stars. It had everything worthy of a 4 star movie, however it could have gone further in terms of depth to some characters and plot to get the prestigious 5 star rating. This movie levels the quality of the 'Avengers' if not a bit more, which comes to show how great I thought this movie was.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 solid stars."
"barkerpodcasts","8","2","9","27 April 2013"," No sign of an Avengers Hangover
","OK, Reviewing a film so quick after it's release can put people off reading it, so I shall proceed with NO SPOILERS as I think people should experience films themselves, BUT I will nod to parts of the film, that if you have seen will understand. If You don't want to risk a SPOILER FREE Review of the film possibly ruining it for you, then STOP reading and GO SEE THE FILM and come back.<br/><br/>Right, Iron Man 3! The Shane Black Directed, Robert Downey Jr Starring Threequel to the Iron Man Series. Picking up after the events in new York ( That's The Avengers to those who weren't sure what they were talking about - I Know there were a few people asking that ) and we are shown Tony Stark trying to shake off the whole mental-ness of Aliens, Worm Holes, Big Green Men and a Man with a Hammer falling from the Sky. The Film proceeds to delve into more of Tony Stark and his inner demons coming to the surface due to his previous Drink induced, Arrogant and Egotistical party lifestyle coming back to haunt him. Showing his attitude towards the people he loves the most and how he is prepared to do anything to save them. Bring in an old acquaintance who has ideas and ways to help heal people in the midst of a Terrorist ( or a Teacher as he likes to call himself ) appearing on the TV Screens and threatening to Bomb more and more places until he can get The presidents attention. That is pretty much all I can say story wise. That's the general set up. BAD GUY appears, Rival Scientist Guy appears, James Rhodes ( AKA War Machine/Iron Patriot ) is around to lend a hand and Pepper Potts is caught in the crossfire. Simple Stuff.<br/><br/>The Entire Film was thoroughly enjoyable, although slightly predictable at times ( and extremely UN-predictable at times ) but none of this was a problem. Coming off the back of The Avengers Movie and the lack lustre Iron Man 2, This film had a lot riding on it.<br/><br/>With Jon Favreau Out of the Directors seat, but still much a part of the film as Tony and Peppers Security Man ( And given a meaty scene to deal with ) it was all eyes on Shane Black. Now a lot of people won't have heard of Shane Black, So let me give you the names of a few films he has written - Lethal Weapon 1 and 2 - The Long Kiss Goodnight - The Last Boy Scout - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( Which he Debut Directed )<br/><br/>So Straight away, if you know these films, the script is a major part of his entire appeal. In Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( Also starring RDJ ) he exploded on the scene with slick directing and witty dialogue. I'm pretty sure this was a main factor for getting the job, as well as RDJ putting in a good word for him. From the Out, this felt like a NEW tone and style for an Iron Man film. With it's immediate witty and slick dialogue between all the characters and the Action set ups that fill you with dread, the film set off with a new aim.........and that aim was to make Tony Stark more than just a man in a suit!<br/><br/>I for one would say Tony Stark spends 80% of this film OUT of the Suit, making The Iron Man Suit a sub character.This Film is all about Tony Stark and I for one am all for that. The main reason Iron Man works is due to the way the character is played. In the Comic Book world the Suit/Armour is usually the thing people want to see. People want to see more Batman than Bruce Wayne, More Superman than Clark Kent, More Wonder Woman than Diana and so on. Iron Man works more simply because RDJ plays Tony Stark so well and makes you root for him, even though his ethics and morals to begin with are a bit dubious.<br/><br/>The entire film was brilliantly paced, never dulling and always bringing in great Action sequences ( the Plane Rescue is a triumph ) and brilliant and witty Dialogue<br/><br/>Kid: You're going to leave me just like my Father did Tony Stark: (pause) yes.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were great and played their parts great. Guy Pearce ( an underrated actor in my opinion ) is great as usual as the rival scientist who Tony Stark isn't a fan of, Rebecca Hall ( Who made the Skirt and Trainers combo look Sexy ) was underused but still worth her due in the film, Paul Bettany ( The Voice of Jarvis ) was great in some witty and exceptional exchanges, Gwyneth Paltrow ( Utterly Gorgeous ) finally gets to do something worthwhile as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle ( Subtly Excellent ) manages to tease us with more to come with his character and Ben Kingsley ( Ben F*****G Kingsley ) is without a doubt the BEST thing in this movie! He really took this role with both hands and really went to town with it. A Joy to watch!<br/><br/>So All in All I was exceptionally pleased with Iron Man 3. I think it sets up Phase 2 of The Marvel Avengers Saga and has gotten me excited to see Thor 2 and Captain America 2 when they are released.<br/><br/>Verdict: Great Film, NOT a masterpiece but definitely well worth a watch.<br/><br/>Have you seen it? what did you think? Let me know. @BarkerPodcasts"
"aldri-feb","6","2","9","26 April 2013"," Fine Superhero Movie
","'Iron Man 3' is a satisfying superhero movie with almost similar formula from other 'The Avengers' franchise. This movie is fit as an opening summer film: it's big blockbuster movie with massive action scenes and really fun to see. The studio has right decisions choosing Shane Black as director instead of maintaining Jon Favreau who had destroyed second installment. He knows how to handle this franchise well without adding unnecessary scene and silly jokes like the second one. And of course there's no complaint about Robert Downey's performance as Tony Stark, he's done great as usual.<br/><br/>Still there are some weakness in 'Iron Man 3'. Unlike the first 'Iron Man' which had offered spectacular action scenes but still realistic in storyline, this film is too cartoonish and predictable, also nothing fresh in it. I think they don't want to take any risks and making it at the safe zone like most of 'The Avengers' franchise. They try to satisfy the fans without attracting new viewers. Also the villain is under- developed, there is similarity character between Mandarin and Syndrome in Disney's Pixar: 'The Incredibles'. I suggest not to see it in IMAX 3D, it's a waste. Although the 3D is not horrible but there is nothing special in it.<br/><br/>Afterall, 'Iron Man 3' is an amazing, thrilling and entertaining summer blockbuster movie. Most people who see it would agree about how cool this movie is. The studio undeniable creating flawless visual effects that make the action scenes look real. Marvel 'The Avengers' fans, teenager and kids are gonna love it. I'm personally quite disappointed after watching it cause there is no improvement in this third installment that I'm waiting for. 'Iron Man 3' is below the first 'Iron Man' and also not as good as 'The Avengers' or even 'Captain America' but Shane Black success to lift up this franchise into a better future after a mess in 'Iron Man 2'."
"home_run_twins","Null","2","9","25 April 2013"," Iron Man 3 truly finishes this particular trilogy on the highest quality note possible.
","The first Iron Man was a pleasant surprise to most everyone. Iron Man 2 was a bit of a prologue to The Avengers and part of why it was good and part of why it rubbed some people the wrong way. Iron Man 3 now takes what worked from those two films and, frankly, does it better. Right now, I'm calling this one the best of the three.<br/><br/>Why? Well, first and foremost the writing in Iron Man 3 delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 3 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. How Tony and company reacted to certain thing is what resulted in the audience going along for the ride. They did that perfectly in this sequel. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they did a great job. Just like Avengers, Iron Man 3 delivers some of the best scenes out of any action film that I've seen in years."
"sidfargas","Null","2","9","25 April 2013"," EXCEPTIONAL MOVIE! Complex, Emotional, Funny and Fun!
","Iron Man 3 really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. It does the near impossible and that's improve on the first two films. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. The entire journey and entire film is amazing but it's worth mentioning that they build on what worked in The Avengers. Tony's outward displays of bravado and wit have always hidden a deeply troubled and complex character. His demons are always under the surface. They make sure to recall the events of Avengers where this mortal hero faced impossible odds and even death in the darkest of deep space. That would rattle any person and I'm so glad they didn't gloss that over. It adds depth never before seen in these type of films. Tony was deeply affected and is deeply troubled. Now, add a twisted and truly formidable villain presence in Kingley's Mandarin and what they delivered was a movie as good as it gets. I loved the ending and how everything was handled because it can't be what anyone expected! This is without question the BEST film to finish a trilogy that's ever been made. The best ""number three"" film all-time in now Iron Man's title and Iron Man's title alone."

","Shane Black's hilarious comic book movie spoof!<br/><br/>
Ostensibly a Dizzee franchise sequel, the latest entry in megalomaniac capitalist Tony Stark's cybernetic journal is nothing more than a parody of what has come before, a special effects-stuffed turkey whose stale, cold leftovers would not even satisfy a porky Comic Con fan boy. <br/><br/>The cowards at Marvel, afraid to unleash a truly righteous villain against Stark's falsely patriotic robot alter ego, dump the bin Laden-like Mandarin character halfway through this loud, prolonged video game masquerading as cinema in favor of a fey, bare-chested Richard Branson knockoff intent on destroying the world and bedding Gwyneth Paltrow, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>The Mandarin is a phony, as fake as RDJ's waxen-faced performance, with the early scenes of revolutionary fervor and violent reaction to continued colonial oppression merely feints in a convoluted plot to - well, to get us to the end of the hopelessly overlong CGI spectacle. Capitalism rules the narrative, as it does the real world, so a tween boy's happiness spelled out in toys bought with Stark blood money is as close to a cheerful ending as this shameful cartoon can get. 
Shane Black, who promised us his last action hero a couple of decades ago, is resurrected from Hollywood no man's land to fumble his way through the pixelated panels of this comic book disaster, tying it all together in a pretty digital package with much explosion and mayhem, his 1980's modus operandi. That there is ""no there there"" is as much trouble to Marvel and Black as their frightened western consumer's approach to eliminating an actual antagonist. 
Tony Stark is, and always has been, a rat of an arms dealer turned savior of the Armor-ican way. This is no more evident in the fact that he allows his hot girlfriend to be turned into a genetically altered monster, then casually ""saves her life"" off screen, while in the coda he gets his heart repaired by the best surgeon money can buy: himself. This is a movie filled with such offhand adolescent irrelevancies. Adults could not care a whit about any of it.<br/><br/>If the bottom-line overlords at Dizzy had allowed it, Iron Man should have gone metal boot to combat boot with the ""terrorist"" Mandarin, and then we'd see the real fallout of Stark's first insidious armorer's holiday to the Middle East (can you say Jericho missile, anyone). As Gandalf might say, ""dealing out death and judgment"" is not so easy. It certainly shouldn't be left to some smartass arms company CEO.<br/><br/>Like the faux patriotism and plastic industrial America the movie's makers obviously worship, the CGI-blasted mayhem of the movie's climax is nothing but fake sighs and moans. All that matters is Stark gets his mojo back - and never has to face off against displaced people's anger. The Mandarin might be a ""terrorist,"" but as depicted in the first half of the movie he is certainly righteously angry - and very funny. Stark, Dizzee, Marvel and all corporate goons deserve retribution at the hands of the people's chaos, but instead they sit around the board table chuckling at this prolonged SNL spoof they have concocted for the fan boys, and the millions r(e)aped in profits as yet another company boss wins the day."

I was super excited when I first heard of this movie I am not going to lie, A clash between the Mandarin and Tony would have been incredible but alas we are left with Trevor. Also, this movie truly showed the man outside the armor, as Tony spends a lot of his time being a rich MacGyver.<br/><br/>Anyway to end this rant the armor as usual is fun to watch and is slick at that with a fun battle at the end with a jolly surprise to it. I give this a 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful acting and fight scenes, as well as the humor that was implemented. ""Some people call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","5 July 2015"," Lacks innovation
","To me this is one of the lesser Marvel films, meaning it belongs to the same category as Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk in terms of quality. By all objective accounts it's still a good film, don't get me wrong, but it cannot hold a candle to the better Marvel films.<br/><br/>Why, you may ask? A couple of reasons. First, the general plot. It's simply the same story that we've already seen in the two previous Iron Man films. In the first one it was great. Science, technology, gorgeous flying around, missiles, explosions, quick-witter banter, Robert Downey Jr. in the role of his life. The second one also benefited from those same qualities and failed for other reasons. But now, in the third installment of the franchise? The novelty has truly worn off. Sure, one might argue that it's nice to have a formula and that it wouldn't feel like an Iron Man story without certain elements. I argue that it'd be nice to explore other aspects of Tony Stark's character instead of watching him endlessly battle enemies of his own making. At least this time the villain isn't just a carbon copy of him, only evil. Well... he kind of is, but at least not as blatantly.<br/><br/>And to the film's credit, there is some new ground covered and it's nice that the plot takes the events of The Avengers into account. Downey Jr. is still a fantastic Tony Stark and in this film he's given a chance to explore and play the character at his lowest point, which works pretty well indeed. The action also works, the suits are still gorgeous, the special effects beautiful and it's a professionally done film in every way possible.<br/><br/>The second problem, however, are the characters, at least the new ones. They're simply not all that interesting. There are a couple of good twists, but when a guy walks into the room and he's so smarmy that he might as well carry a flashing neon sign with VILLAIN written on it, it's not that much of a surprise when he turns out to be the bad guy. The new kid sidekick they bring in is also aggravating, annoying and needed about as much as an ice cone machine in Greenland.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is not a bad film. It's perfectly functional as a summer blockbuster and a good popcorn film by all accounts. But when you compare it to the Phase One movies, its flaws start to show."

That being the case, I was already on the side of Iron Man movies when I saw this, and am a big superhero movie fan, so for this movie to lose me as much as it did... that's a true feat. This time though, being a fan of the comics actually makes you like the movie less. Even though I hated this movie the first time I saw it, I have grown to enjoy it a little bit. That being said, I still consider this movie to be sub-par. Why? Well, here are just a few reasons. The Mandarin. Yes, this is what I meant by saying if you like the comics, you won't like this movie. The Mandarin is not a menacing super villain armed with alien technology, he's not a warlord, he is not in anyway THE Iron Man villain, in fact... he's not even a villain. The Mandarin is a figure head used by the real villain (more on him in a bit) to draw the attention of the U.S., and not only that, but they took the twist one step farther and turned him into a punch line; he's nothing more than a drunk actor masquerading as a terrorist. And that... no, just no. Look, I understand the comics have to be adapted, I get that, I understand even very popular characters might not be suited for the big screen, I get that too, but the one thing you shouldn't do is disrespect the source material. Taking a few jokes at the dumber moments from the comics is alright (even the actual comic books do that), but this isn't a poke at the comics, this is a slap in the face to the fans, and this instantly put me firmly on the side of against Iron Man 3. This could've been a good twist if they'd used like a c-list villain, but the #1 Iron Man villain? No, that just doesn't work. Another big problem I have with this movie is the massive changes to Tony Stark. I didn't like them. I like seeing Tony looking like he's in trouble, but it should actually be the villain of the movie who breaks him, not just the villain from Avengers. We should see Aldrich Killian (or preferably; The Mandarin) break Tony, push him to his breaking point, and see Tony come back, rise up, and defeat his enemy. A bit like TDKR, but that wouldn't be the only thing they copied from The Dark Knight Rises. Seeing Tony having panic attacks and anxiety issues over the mere mention of the events in The Avengers is a little too much though, and the real villain, Aldrich Killian, is a disposable bad guy for Tony to struggle with for two hours, he's not an arch-nemesis, he's not anything important to Tony, he's just another villain to kill off. Not exactly the way your trilogy you should go out. Another problem I had was all the plot holes, but I try to overlook plot holes whenever possible, because, I'm more interested in the story and characters than every little detail. Still, Tony not bringing out his suits earlier in the movie is a glaring issue that I have a hard time ignoring. Problem #5: the mechanized suits. I know this is in the comics, but having Tony pilot his suits by remote control, and making an army of suits that are easily disposable? I'm pretty sure this movie confirmed at least three of the Five Nightmares from that epic story line (c'mon, you know you wanna see Ezekiel Stane! A villain who could rival RDJ for screen presence? Oh yeah!). Also, it makes Tony not feel particularly special. He just builds the suits, why not just let someone else hold the remote? I have one last problem with this movie and with most of the Phase two movies in general. Joke overload. Seriously, there are too many jokes in this movie, and they are very ill-timed. I don't mind alleviating some tension with a bit of humor, but this movie just straight up has no tension, and that makes me lose interest pretty quickly to be honest. However, I still find Iron Man 3 to be very enjoyable, in a mindless kind of way. Once you realize it isn't very good, it's actually a pretty easy movie to have fun with. It's not like Batman & Robin bad, it's just not very good. In the end, Iron Man 3 is a sub par movie, with good action, good effects, lazy writing, a weak story, and a bad tone."
"Lejink","2","1","3","13 June 2015"," Not ferrous good
","I really liked the first two Iron Man films. They were flashy, techy, exciting and even funny at times. With Robert Downey Junior in the title role, the producers had the perfect fit for not only the Iron Man but also the wise-cracking playboy millionaire inventor behind the mask.<br/><br/>This third outing though is a big let down. The plot is a mess, with Guy Pearce hamming it up as a sort of meta-human Terminator 2, out to humiliate the U.S. via the kidnap of their president, using another super-villain The Mandarin as the medium to initially spread fear and panic amongst the general public with various Bin Laden type terrorist actions. Unfortunately for America and naturally the free world, Iron Man is between costumes and not operating at full strength so that even with the assistance of the similarly-powered War Machine / Iron Patriot, he's pushed to his limits in the expected mayhem-inducing final battle between the two.<br/><br/>So what has gone wrong? For one thing Iron Man doesn't appear in armour very much in the film (although his previous prototypes come to the rescue by the end) - I don't know, maybe Downie Junior wanted more face-time on screen. The suit-on, suit-off routine is greatly overdone and the in-suit commentaries, this time by two costumed heroes, grate too, while the climactic battle would be more properly termed an anti-climactic battle. The idea of Ben Kingsley's Wizard of Oz-like Mandarin doesn't serve the character well and by now Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts character is very irritating too. Worst of all there are two awkward and embarrassing condescensions to the comic-fan base and I guess target cinema-audience too as Downey Junior is forced into cringe-worthy, humourless scenes with a savvy pre-teen kid and later an adult nerd-fan in a van. <br/><br/>With an incessant, booming, rock soundtrack just to round things off, I saw this in the end as a poorly written, routinely filmed and ultimately empty blockbuster which doesn't bode well for future entries in the franchise.<br/><br/>Time to get out the WD40, methinks."

","I was a teeny weeny bit disappointed with this after having seen the previous movie in the series. Whereas Iron Man 2 is a light-hearted affair, Iron Man 3 tries to be (a little bit) more sinister and gritty and I felt as a result it fell a little wide of the mark.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is still excellent as Iron Man and there are still plenty of genuinely funny moments. It's the bad guys that let this down for me. Iron Man 2 went for a mad, bad, caricature of a bad guy that provided a perfect foil to Downey Jr's quirky Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, they went for a genius sinister scientist type that probably suited a James Bond move more than this.<br/><br/>Still, a good showpiece finale made it largely worth it."

"caseynicholson","5","1","3","31 March 2015"," Remember That Time When Marvel Made a Transformers Movie???
","Over the past couple of months I've been preparing for ""Avengers 2"" by rewatching all of the MCU Marvel movies--partly due to my own OCD tendencies, and partly due to the fact that I'm introducing them to my girlfriend. This week we made it up to ""Iron Man 3"", which I had to track down on Blu Ray because Disney has made it so hard to rent online.<br/><br/>I came to this week's viewing hopeful that this movie would leave me with a better impression than it did when I saw it in the theater two years ago. It's been 22 months, so I didn't remember exactly why I didn't like the movie the first go around--I just remember having the depressing feeling as I was leaving the theater of ""Well, Marvel has officially beat that dead horse into the ground.""<br/><br/>Seeing the film the second time didn't do much to improve my opinion. I will say, though, that I feel like I have a bit more of a grasp on why this film just doesn't work than I did when I first saw it in the theater. It all boils down to too much action and not enough story telling. Marvel essentially made this movie in the format of the Transformers movies. <br/><br/>Let's dissect that a bit. What does it mean not to have good storytelling in an Iron Man film? Well, in this particular movie the problem is that there's not enough development of certain aspects of the plot. Instead the plot is kind of just thrown at you. Take the Mandarin for example. You don't really get any explanation of the Mandarin before he first appears on screen. All of a sudden the Mandarin's home movie that is taking over every TV set in America flashes up on the TV screen and you're supposed to know who he is. <br/><br/>Now, the caveat to that is that it is true that it's easy enough to figure out who the Mandarin is as the movie goes along. It's not that this film leaves you completely in the dark. It's easy enough to follow--but the problem is that it just simply doesn't work as GOOD storytelling. (Although I must say, while up till now I've been speaking about the Mandarin in regard to how the film introduces him to us in this movie--for the comic book fans out there, no spoilers here, but they really did a huge disservice to the Mandarin as this movie goes along...just terrible).<br/><br/>Another example of poor storytelling in this film would be the villains along the way who have the uncanny ability to regenerate wounds and also seem to have nuclear reactors built into their guts somehow. When they first appear on screen we're given no indication of who they are or why they have this amazing ability. That wouldn't be a problem if the tension between the initial ignorance and the suspense of wanting to know that was eventually resolved well with a clear cut explanation of what is going on there. But that is never really given. Yes, yes, I got it--I know how they received their powers (I'm trying not to write a spoiler here). I understand completely what accounts for these strange characters. But, again, the problem is not that the audience isn't smart enough to ""get it"". The problem is that even if you do get it, the movie still just doesn't do a good job of telling its story.<br/><br/>Then you couple that with the gratuitous, grandiose action scenes, and basically what you have here is a Michael Bay film. The action is just over the top in an extreme way. It's not balanced. There's too much poorly explained story crammed into too little of a chunk of time, with very little cohesive storytelling and too much emphasis on explosions and special effects.<br/><br/>All that said, this is one of, if not the, worst movies in the MCU line of films. It's not that the story wasn't good in and of itself--the concept was fine and could have been made into a very good film overall. But it wasn't made into a good film. It was made into ""Iron Man 3"".<br/><br/>That being the case, I've given this movie a 5/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it a 4 or a 3. I've given it a 5 just purely based on the fact that I enjoy the characters in the film and the overall concept of the film in spite of everything else I've said in this review. It's watchable in a mediocre, ""that wasn't the best"" kind of way. Fortunately Marvel recovers from this well with its next three films."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","28 March 2015"," A Welcome Improvement Over Its Predecessor!
","Marking the commencement of the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe after the first one culminated with The Avengers, Iron Man 3 presents a definite improvement over its insufferably boring predecessor but it still falls short of the magical experience that was the first Iron Man film. However, it does carry a new energy & has a refreshing vibe to it, thanks to the new director at helm.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 continues the story of Tony Stark who's recovering from post-traumatic stress caused by the events of The Avengers. Unable to sleep & genuinely afraid of losing what he loves, Stark's life is turned upside down after he issues a threat to a radical terrorist who retaliates by destroying his personal world, leaving him far more vulnerable than ever before & forcing him to rebuild from the scratch.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Shane Black, Iron Man 3 really benefits from a fresh perspective & is an enjoyable ride for the most part but it is also marred by its attempt to try out way too many things at once, out of which only a few work out in a convincing manner. Technical aspects are finely executed for its Cinematography favours a slightly darker tone, Editing steadily paces its narrative while Brian Tyler's adds more vibrancy to it.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley & Rebecca Hall join the reprising cast & ably fill up their given roles while Robert Downey Jr. once again manages to impress the most. The best thing about this sequel is the position it puts Tony Stark in & Downey Jr. does a terrific job in bringing that vulnerability on the screen. Also, while I was a bit furious at what they did with Iron Man's arch-nemesis, I did later warm up to what their intent was here.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Iron Man 3 is a solid follow up to Iron Man & you don't even have to go through the crap that was Iron Man 2 to get to this one. The film's intent to cover the darker issues at hand while keeping itself light-hearted & plenty of fun is a combination that never gels so well, is at friction on many occasions & is bound to divide its viewers, but its improvement over everything that was so wrong with its predecessor nevertheless makes it a welcome chapter, if not a worthy one."

This movie grabbed the character Ironman in mid ascension to the level of a Batman/ superman/ Spiderman notoriety and yanked him back down to Thor and Cap's level. The script was trash, the direction was trash and the mythology got trashed. I Marvel learned from this and moves on. And for anyone that says ""but the action was"". Go shoot yourself.

","Iron Man 3 the sequel to the very successful Iron Man films. However and almost certainly so, Iron Man 3 is not as good as the first Iron Man film, but better than the second. Iron Man 3 though, it works well enough. <br/><br/>Now onto it, Iron Man 3 starts off with a flashback to Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) earlier youth days. At a 1999 party, Stark crosses paths with two men and a woman who would later have a profound influence on his life, Ho Yinsen who would later save his life and inspire him to become a super hero, Maya Hansen, a scientist whose research would come back to haunt him, and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who would later become Stark's deadly enemy. In a voice-over narration, Stark talks about the momentous events he carelessly set in motion that day years ago.<br/><br/>Now fast forward to several years in the present day Stark's life is picked up, along with others from the previous films, including Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau). Stark has settled down with Potts and Hogan is now head of security for Stark's company.<br/><br/>Later onto the film, we are introduced to a megalomaniac named The Mandarin, whom is causing havoc with assassinations, kidnappings and bombings. When Happy is injured in one of these bombings, he becomes a target for Iron Man. In response to a media question, Stark issues a direct challenge to the Mandarin and, giving his home address out to the media, invites him to do his worst.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 has it's ups and downs but overall the film works for the chemistry and charisma of Robert Downey Jr., along with Gwyneth Paltrow. The action sequences are well shot, and the visuals are stunning as we are introduced to more of the Iron Man suits, which are visually compelling as a wholesome. However, the villains could have been better, while they were their it did not have a sense of Tony Stark being in any kind of real danger. The ending is a solid way to end the franchise as it ties everything together nicely."
"phubbs","5","1","3","18 November 2014"," Iron Man 3
","Is it me or does the entire premise of this film rip off 'Batman Forever'? Think back to that 1995 Schumacher film when 'Edward Nygma' approaches Bruce Wayne asking him to check out his new invention, but Wayne denies him. Nygma then goes off filled with hatred for Wayne, reinvents himself as The Riddler and becomes his arch nemesis.<br/><br/>Now look at the start of this film. Killian approaches Stark about his new company, Stark denies him, so off he goes filled with vengeance, recreates himself as a nemesis to Stark and the Iron Man hero, using his company alongside a new experiment. Notice any similarities here?<br/><br/>I'm no Iron Man fanboy, I don't know all about the Iron Man lore, but that still doesn't detract from the fact they really fudged up The Mandarin. The whole setup for this guy is really well done, it really is. We see lots of news footage, stock footage and hand held camera footage of the character as it buzzes around various TV stations. Its all been created in the same vain as reality, obviously in recent years with Osama Bin Laden and various other terrorist propaganda, what you would (and still do) see every night on the news. Footage of him with his extremists, firing guns, preaching, making statements etc...<br/><br/>The Mandarin is envisioned just like this and it all looks very realistic, threatening and intimidating, Black and his team really do make this villain look good, like he's really gonna be a hard underground nut to crack for Stark. But then out of nowhere the whole setup is thrown out the window because the character is fake, a front, a big setup created by Killian to cover himself and his experiments. Neat twist? yes, very much so...good idea? no definitely not, not for a franchise like this. A franchise where a villain like The Mandarin is very popular and people wanna see The Mandarin not a puppet creation.<br/><br/>A film like this hinges on its villain, usually the villain makes the film. In this case they made a great looking villain with Kingsley (despite his rather odd drawl) but they threw it away. Plus you also gotta ask yourself who would actually agree to act or play a villain to cover someone else? surely common sense would dictate that you're only gonna cause a lot of trouble for yourself? even if you didn't actually do any of the things you claim, you're still gonna be in the sh*t for being involved with terrorism. Just doesn't make any real sense to me.<br/><br/>Must admit I liked Kingsley's little performance in the reveal sequence, a kind of typical drunk, drugged up British hippie, but it just made a mockery of the whole film. Makes you feel you're watching a spoof not a serious adaptation.<br/><br/>Nice little touches of humour throughout as we have come to expect from this franchise and Downey Jr. The small team up with the little kid isn't as cheesy as it sounds and offers some nice dialog, although one sequence seems to be pretty similar to a certain John Candy/Macaulay Culkin film from many moons ago.<br/><br/>On the whole the film is really quite average in my opinion. I didn't think that much of the whole Extremis idea and the way characters looked when they went all ballistic. The visuals and ideas kinda looked like something from a hammy sci-fi flick to me, it all felt a bit X-Men-ish, a franchise I never liked. I still don't really get how this regenerative power causes people to have such extreme heat power, its suppose to help them heal no? so why the heat? Plus I really don't see how Stark manages to kill most of them when they can regenerate so easily, when Savin is killed, why couldn't he regenerate from it? The Extremis soldiers seemed so much more powerful, they could easily take down Iron Man suits as shown by Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>The finale is on impressive scale but messy really. Lots of Iron Man suits flying all over the place, difficult to make out what exactly is going on, Extremis henchmen/women leaping all over the shop. It all sounds cool and the idea is cool but like some other superhero comicbook flicks it becomes a fast blur of CGI, an incoherent badly lit chaotic brawl between metal suits and CGI people. Plus I gotta ask, why didn't Stark just utilize all his Iron Man suits together originally? before Jarvis went offline, and why does Stark keep running around without his suit?! just stay in it you fool!<br/><br/>I must say I'm disappointed with this trilogy bookend. The first film was superb, the second (in my opinion) was clearly not as good as the first but still a solid action film. This third entry has lost me completely with bad plot decisions and untidy action sequences (something which the made the first so good, it was very clear without excess CGI mess). <br/><br/>So the question is...was this all just narration, a therapy session for Stark to get some previous history of his chest with Banner or is that it? no more Iron Man films and no Iron Man for 'Avengers 2'?<br/><br/>5/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","3","13 August 2014"," A solid second sequel if not as good as the first
","The first film was great and among the better Marvel films and the second while a step-down did for all the major problems it had did a lot of things right. As unpopular an opinion as this might be, Iron Man 3 was a solid second sequel and a notch better than the second. Yes it is agreed personally that the Mandarin was not very well handled, he could have been better developed and was cheapened by the face-palm inducing plot twist. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow are given very little to do to the extent that Cheadle actually is wasted. And Hans Zimmer's score was a disappointment, I like Zimmer but the score was too much of an over-loud drone that was often too in-your-face and there were numerous times when the orchestration didn't fit. Iron Man 3 still does a lot right, it's very expertly made with the best special effects quality of the three films, striking locations and use of gadgets and very stylish cinematography and editing, never showing any signs of drabness, garishness or choppiness. The action sequences have plenty of great spectacle and are very exciting, especially the plane sequence and the explosive climax, that is by far the best climax of the three(the first's was rushed and overblown to me and the second's while an improvement was rather brief and could have started earlier than it did). The script had plenty of breezy black humour, great exuberance and enough surprises that are done smartly and cleverly. You may miss the mix of comic nostalgia and currant relevance that the direction in the previous two films had but the darker, without being overly-serious approach served the grittier-than-usual story here well and Shane Black does show that he is comfortable in action and in the drama and thriller aspects. The story is more involving and far less familiar than that of the second's, the only reservation being the plot-twist for the Mandarin, and doesn't feel cluttered this time round, and emotional impact, tension, fun and coherence are not sacrificed at least. Robert Downey Jnr. mixes brooding intensity and deadpan comic timing adeptly(if not as fresh and powerhouse quality as in the first) and for the villains Ben Kingsley actually plays deceptive quite brilliantly and Guy Pearce is also very effective. The supporting cast are very good on the whole, though the way they're written varies. All in all, not as good as the first Iron Man but a solid second sequel that is not wholly deserving of the dislike/indifference it gets, though the criticisms are valid. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Enjoyable third Iron Man film, far better than the second. It has a lot of detractors, and I can see some of their points, but ultimately I was never bored and had a good time watching it. One of the major complaints is about how they handled the character of the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's biggest villains from the comics. If I had read about it beforehand, I probably would have agreed. But watching it play out, I actually liked it and thought it was quite clever. My only real quibble is that the other villain of the movie (Guy Pearce) is underwhelming. The returning cast members Downey, Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau are all great. This is probably the best movie in the series for Paltrow, in particular. It doesn't hurt that she's very hot in this. The best scenes involve Downey and a young boy (Ty Simpkins). Fanboys might balk at some parts of this one but I think most people will find it entertaining."

We have a sinister, almost Osama Bin Laden type bad guy called The Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley whose later reveal as a druggie, out of work actor is rather inspired allowing Kingsley to put on a different more playful performance.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen previous Marvel films and the other Iron Man films could probably work out from the initial scenes who the ultimate baddie will be and along the way you have mayhem, destruction and Stark doing his own 'McGuyver' thing in the middle.<br/><br/>This time Stark narrates the ongoing story and you have to wait for the post credits sequence as to who he is narrating the story to and once again Downey is the anchor who drives the film and has made the Iron Man films a success despite its flaws, although this is better than the last one which is a credit to Black."

","And they just keep coming down the pikeWhen will the obsession with Marvel Comic Book heroes/heroines fizzle? Obviously not in the near future as this comic book recreation IRON MAN 3 has made almost as much money as HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE - $1,215,439,994 and counting. Money talks and in this case it shouts, so we are likely in for more Iron Man episodes. <br/><br/>'A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.' This quote form the film is cogent in that it nods to the feeling of some viewers. The plot is more about 'things' than story but in case a story line is needed then the following help decipher the reason this movie takes over 2 hours to tell: 'IRON MAN 3 pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) against an enemy Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and his 'front' ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?' That makes the film sound like it has a tale to tell.<br/><br/>Actually the writing (Drew Pearce, Shane Black, Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Warren Ellis, Adi Granov – whew!) tosses some terrific one-liners that do entertain, but the main character is the special effects crew. Actors Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau, Ty Simpkins, Paul Bettany's voice and a host of real TV personalities help the derring-do do, and likely in 3D this is quick a show. But these escapism films are wearing thin – except in the pocket books of the producers. Grady Harp, January 14"
"pkdmm","8","1","3","5 January 2014"," Exciting and Attractive
","I saw this a weeks ago. This is very exciting and attractive film. The characters are very good. Robert Downey, Jr is always cool and funny, and just right for the role of Iron Man and Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow /Pepper Potts's action scenes are really exciting. The plot is unique and interesting. There are not only uniqueness of Tony but also suffering and love for Potts. This movie starts from the cause of the story and includes the ending. The special effects is near perfect, and the action is very great. The armor's battle and explosion scenes are heart stopping. However, I think that the soundtrack lacks a little stylish. There is not peculiar style of Iron Man. Moreover I want to see scenes about the mechanism of Iron Man, what ability, what purpose, how to assemble."
"ianj-brown","8","1","3","4 January 2014"," really great action and comedy
","Iron man/ Tony Stark is one of my favorite marvel characters after Hawkeye. In the previous movies I feel like it is just his tech doing all the work and fighting for him (which Captain America pointed out in the Avengers). However in this movie the director takes Tony Stark to a whole new level. In this movie Iron man starts to use fighting techniques instead of just blasting people sky high (but he does still blast people around). A lot of people said bad things about this movie and I disagree. Even though I thought this movie was great i did have a problem with The Mandarin. Seriously, I feel like the director just got lazy with The Mandarin. Maybe I wouldn't have such a problem with it if the previews didn't at like The Mandarin was such a big deal. At the end of the movie Tony Stark blows up his Iron Man suits and I would have been okay with it, but in 2015 they're coming out with another Avengers. I wonder how the director is going to pull that off."

","Any film, no matter how hot the franchise is or has been, needs a plot and some coherence. This film had neither in my opinion. I, luckily, waited and rented it on DVD, but still feel like I wasted my money. Robert Downy, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rebecca Hall did a good job with a horrible plot line and terrible dialogue, but that's not enough to save a terrible film. If you want to know how the producers, director, writers and crew could waste so much money producing this bad a film, look at the bonus features on the DVD. The sole feature is 17 minutes on how they made repeated skydives to make the special effects sequences of about a minute of the 130 minute movie realistic because computer graphic images (cgi) are not. Then after shooting all these skydives they replaced the real background and much of the actors parts with cgi. Instead of telling a story, they spent the majority of the production time playing and being fascinated with special effects. That may have amused some of the cast and the crew, but does not and will not amuse or entertain the audience. What a terrible shame."
"geekgirl101","4","1","3","16 October 2013"," What was the point in this movie?
","After seeing Marvel rewrite its own version of its own comic strips into movies and doing a far much better job at it I was looking forward to this one, even though Iron Man 2 was a bit meh and confusing. After all it's Marvel, and the comics are written by Marvel, what could go wrong?...<br/><br/>Short answer: Everything in this movie.<br/><br/>So Stark gives away his home location on live TV telling all the bad guys where he lives and to come and get him. And that's precisely what they do. After turning his luxury home into powder his costume breaks down and so he now spends a good chunk of the movie trying to fix it with the aid of some kid fan.<br/><br/>Only we learn right at the end of the movie that it's not his only costume. He has not one, not two, but hundreds of them! Which leaves the question, why focus all his attention on fixing the one costume to fight the bad guys when he has hundreds at his disposal?<br/><br/>The answer is pretty apparent when the Iron Man army is easily torn apart like paper dolls. No wonder Stark was focusing all his attention on his original suit. These weren't Iron Man suits, these were Plastic Man suits.<br/><br/>And then what does he decide to do at the very end? He blows them all up! He has an operation done to remove the shrapnel from his chest, a contradiction to the Marvel comics where he was unable to have the shrapnel removed without it killing him, which is why he had the device in his chest to save his life in the first place!<br/><br/>His decision to give up being Iron Man so that he and his wife can live a normal life is almost immediately set in full reverse when he goes back to the rubble of his home to pick up bits for building a new costume and states at the end ""you can take away my suits, you can take away my home, but there's one thing you can never take away from me - I am Iron Man.""<br/><br/>Most confusing and pointless ending ever. Please don't make any more Marvel... please."

"leonblackwood","5","1","3","16 September 2013"," Expected Better! 5/10
","Review: I was really looking forward to this movie, but it doesn't touch the first Iron Man. I think that I prefer when Downey Jr is being cocky then when he is love struck and vulnerable. The big showdown at the end was a bit messy and it seemed like the director just wanted to show off his CGI skills. I also wasn't that impressed with Don Cheadle, but Terrence Howard wasn't that much better. I liked the chemistry between Downey and the little kid, but it was the storyline that let the movie down. Judging by the money that the movie made, the audiences obviously are into this franchise, but I was expecting some reference to the Avengers or at least, Samuel L. Jackson popping up like he has in the previous Ironman's. The writers need to come up with some fresh material and try not to rely on gimmicks and flashy shots. Expected Better!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Robert Downey Jr. puts in his usual great performance and the chemistry between him and Gwenyth Paltrow was believable. I must admit, for a superhero, Ironman got his ass kicked way to many times which is why he is trying to improve the suit all the way through the movie. Because of the disappointing 2nd movie, I was hoping that they would have brought in a director that could bring something amazing, but its pretty average in my opinion. I had to watch the showdown at the end a few times because there is so much going on, but I'm sure that the comic fans will love it.<br/><br/>Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $1.2billion<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Ironman franchise, and there is loads of action for people to enjoy. 5/10"
"thenameuwishuhad","6","1","3","18 August 2013"," Not the best but worth watching
","I had many mixed feelings about this movie. It has a different feel from the other two movies. It's not bad to the point where it's unwatchable but it's not good that it's an amazing movie. It's somewhere in between but calling it ""okay"" isn't enough to describe this movie. <br/><br/>This movie has it's ups and downs. The beginning started off pretty bad. I was really annoyed Jon Favreau's character. Whenever he was on screen it made me feel like I was watching an unfunny comedy. He completely changed the feel of an action movie. He was an unforgettable character. The scene with him that bothered me the most is when he goes to the Chinese Theater. That part was completely unnecessary. If he had acted like any other character then he would have waited for back up. I mean come on. He's not in the shape to fight anyone. Luckily for me, unfortunately for his character, he gets severely hurt that takes him out of the movie until the end and you can't even remember he was there.<br/><br/>The Mandarin, the real one played by Guy Pearce, didn't feel like he belonged there. Guy Pearce is an excellent actor but I didn't see him in this movie. He always has a personality in each movie. He always changes his look. He makes a commitment. Guy didn't change his look to drastic measures like ""Prometheus"" or even smaller ones like ""Lawless"". He just looked like a hairier version of himself. His acting was also not his normal ""top notch"".<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley was alright in this movie. He wasn't at his best either but it wasn't dreadful. By the time you find out that his character was actually an actor you've reached the point where you accept this film as an action comedy. His character did have the better jokes. He was one of the more interesting too even though he didn't do much. He still managed to entertain me.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. was great in this movie. He brought back the same Iron Man that we all loved from the first film. He really made the difference. He had his egotistical attitude. He was once again scrapped of a suit and had to build one again. I don't have much to say about him since he was just great.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow was excellent too. I heard many people say that she was in the movie too much to the point where it was unbearable. I would say that she got the same amount of screen time as anyone else. It didn't matter though because she was on the same level as Robert. The two on screen were an excellent pair as they have been since the first film.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall was there but didn't change much. Don Cheadle still doesn't cut it as a perfect Rhodey but he was definitely better than he was in ""Iron Man 2"".<br/><br/>The story wasn't the best. It starts slow and comedic until Tony Stark threatens the Mandarin. He gets attacked at his home and then flees. Throughout the film it's filled with ups and downs.<br/><br/>The visual effects could have been done better. They were good but nothing that stands out beyond other films such as ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" or ""Prometheus"".<br/><br/>The directing was bad. It's as if he didn't know if he wanted to make it a comedy or an action which goes along with this films cinematography. The camera was fine but the lighting was terrible. The lighting helped make it comedic. This all sort of evens out towards the end where you have a very entertaining fight scene filmed in a very steady way.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is worth the time. It's extremely flawed but it's enough that you'll enjoy it."

","I have to repeat the title because it's the sad truth... are the heroic movies resorting to comedy to lengthen its entirety in hopes of keeping the story ""interesting?"" Where are the serious action films? This film was less than entertaining from the music choice in the beginning to the way the criminals lacked conviction to do anything actually menacing. So let me start with the pathetic criminal ""mastermind"" in this movie... Guy Pearce can only do so much to the point where his performance is actually nauseating. I couldn't even believe this movie was being serious with the idea of creating a man who fueled himself revenge due to the fact the world's most sought after billionaire didn't meet him on the roof to discuss an important matter, this is complete and utter childishness. He couldn't schedule to meet with Mr. Stark later on. Once again, the convenience of the film's sieging of an opportunity towards elaborating on a plot that died the moment they involved revenge was utterly pathetic, and the fact that this movie made 1.2 billion dollars makes me question whether people care anymore towards whether or not their money goes towards something beautiful; which this movie was far from. I couldn't stand any of the characters in this movie because the script was non-engaging, almost every five minutes there was a giggle joke intervening the concept of the story so by the time the movie was over it comes off more as a comedy more than an a film to be taken as a serious installment towards the Avengers II. Which is why the first Iron Man, will always be the best out of the franchise no matter how many more films there are in the coming years involving Tony Stark. If this is the best they had to offer after three years for Iron Man then this franchise can go nowhere but down."

"tomassparups","5","1","3","18 July 2013"," Not a fan
","The third installment in the ""Iron"" Man film franchise has been hyped up for quite some time now. Though it has gained a lot of positive reviews, I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed. As per usual it stars Robert Downey Jr as billionaire Tony Stark, also known as ""Iron Man"" and Gwyneth Paltrow as ""Pepper Potts"". Ben Kingsley plays a terrorist known as the ""Mandarin"" who is executing various terror attacks that not only threaten the safety of U.S inhabitants, but the safety of ""Iron Man"" himself. As the story progresses we find out that the Mandarin's co co conspirator is a scientist named ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce) who stark had humiliated years ago. Needless to say, one liners and explosions ensue<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of the ""Marvel Comics"" movies. I have always found them rather annoying and somewhat obnoxious. Although, I did enjoy the first ""Iron Man"" film i was not a big fan of ""The Avengers"", nor ""Iron Man 2"". The main problem with this film is the story. I am going to reveal some major plot points, so if you don't want spoilers do not continue reading this review. The entire plot twist involving the Mandarin being an actor hired by Aldrich Killian was completely ludicrous. It felt incredibly lazy and damaged the story to great extents. I understand that superhero films tend to be over the top, but ""Iron Man 3"" goes to such extents of absurdity that it goes from being regular popcorn action to being completely unbearable. The best part of the film is probably Robert Downey Jr. He manages to still remain charismatic and likable.<br/><br/>Though, I was expecting more out of this film, I did find it enjoyable to some extent. Robert Downey Jr, Guy Pearce, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley were fine on a performance level, but the sloppy storytelling and silly plot twists ruined the movie for me. Iron Man 3 is a fun movie, but in my opinion a disappointing one."

","When I first saw the trailers for iron man 3, I thought the movie looked great. I can easily say that I was looking forward to this movie. When it first started off, I thought it was pretty good. One of the things I don't usually like about these superhero movies in how cheesy they can be. Being a comic book junkie, I find I like the movies better when they are grittier and more realistic (dark knight,amazing Spider-Man, XM first class, etc.) I can say that at least for the first half, iron man 3 is the darkest of the IM movies. So yeah, I was enjoying the movie. At around half way through it, I thought to myself,"" man they're gonna have to do something seriously stupid to screw this up now"".....and they did. I'm not into spoilers so I'll just say this: if you are at all a fan of the iron man comics, you are going to hate this movie. They took one of the most iconic marvel villains and just ruined him. If you aren't a big fan of the old IM stuff, it probably won't bother you as much, but for me, it ruined this movie. I probably would've given this film a 4/10, but the acting was pretty good and there was a badass throw-down at the end which earned it a point."
"alex_j-573-361716","6","1","3","18 June 2013"," This movie caught me off guard. And not in a good way.
","I'm going to go straight into it. The film explores the concept of ""it's the man not the machine"" so basically this is more of a Tony Stark film and less an iron man film. Which is a good thing we get to see that Tony start really is his own greatest weapon, or at least it's his intellect, his ability to create things from scratch and think quick out of grim situation. Yes there is of course some good iron man action but the depth of this movie revolves around Tony, he is now dealing with PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) so that is affecting his relationship with pepper and what not. So the film did have some strong elements, but here come the bad ones, the comedy relief took away from the tone that the movie was trying to set up and i had a really hard time taking the movie seriously which annoyed me, I would have liked to have seen another iron man and war machine team up but the result of them being together felt abit more like some buddy cop film, and thats nothing against buddy cop films i love rush hour, lethal weapon etc, but the tone felt way off. Let me talk about the twist now, i probably should do a separate review just based on the twist but i'll just spit it out here and now. First off i didn't like it at all for several reasons, if i go into all the details this review will become too long for anyone to want to read. I will just say I am a comic fan and have waited a long time for the mandarin to be brought to the big screen ever since his reference in the first Iron man film. I also felt disappointed to know all the hype during the marketing and trailers turned out to be pretty much a lie. I felt the character portrayal by Ben Kingsley was working just fine and would have loved to see how the movie would play out if he was the actual central villain and not some fictional persona created by Guy Pearce's character. I didn't mind that he didn't have 10 power rings and all that i understand changes and reinterpretations need to be made for the sake of incorporating this character to a more realistic cinematic universe. But i found what they did went waaaay beyond that and it was unnecessary. Guy Pearce to me was not the mandarin, he had nothing in common with the character in the comics and i felt the director was like"" well...lets not the leave the film completely mandarinless"" so they had Guy pearce shout out "" I AM the mandarin"" near the end which to me was if anything metaphoric and only technical. Yea the twist was unexpected but so was the twist in the film"" The Village"" just because a twist surprises you doesn't always mean it should be done. In this case it may have worked but in my opinion they simply didn't do it right and that ruined the film for me. Also his armors breaking all the time got repetitive and annoying at times, it took away from the significance of the other two films and also diminishes that sense of uniqueness, after all he is supposed to be the INVINCIBLE iron man. I get they wanted to show Tony stark as being more vulnerable, but they already did when exploring his other issues as mentioned before in my review. All in all i guess it was alright but in a fans perspective i would give this movie a much lower rating and I feel this movie more or less disregards the fans, and as a fan no matter how hard i try to like this movie it's just so damn difficult."

I understand this is science fiction but Iron Man, unlike other super hero, does not have super power but simply great technology. It's nearly believable (well if one day we can find such an energy source power). In this one, it's just going a little bit haywire. <br/><br/>And yes, I'm talking about the script.<br/><br/>Some of the bad guys have specific powers that are hardly explained mainly because they don't make much sense.

The twist can be disappointing to some hardcore fans but I feel that many people just laugh and enjoy it when the shock wears off, although because of the twist the trailers are very misleading. Its also not as dark as the trailers conveyed , there is a lot of humour, with some great comedic timing from Robert Downey Jr. There are quite a lot of Goofs in this movie ( I even spotted some in theatre at my first viewing) but it doesn't take away any of the fun from this great movie"

","I had read many negative reviews about this movie before watching it but now that I have seen it myself, I beg to differ. The problem is that a superhero movie is stereotyped to be an action comedy movie for kids or teenagers. However, the trend is now changed. The superhero movies are now getting more into Drama and emotions. Iron Man 3 and Dark Knight Rises are same in this regard. In both movies, the superhero is seen as a normal person 90% of the movie and wears his costume in the end. But it is bigger than this. Iron Man 3 shows that a superhero is also a human. They can have emotional troubles like other people. Tony is suffering from Panic Attacks, he is having trouble in his personal life as well â€“ Just like normal humans! I think there is a lot to be learned from this movie, if you watch it with an open mind. Don't expect to see Iron man flying here and there killing the bad guys throughout the movie. There is enough action at the end of the movie. I would recommend it to Iron mans, it's a must watch!"

Yes probably.<br/><br/>Overall the Acting was very poor, RDJ turned in the same wooden performance he did in the last 4 films, except this time the role did not call for a wooden actor. The film felt overall like a B-Movie with an A++ CGI effect budget. IT is not his fault he is what he is. The role provided for him required a more robust acting experience however.<br/><br/>the Movie has no center. It lacks a positive message. It lacks a triumph of good over evil.

The plot also incorporates the talents of Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall as Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen, respectively, characters and distant memories from Stark's past who return to challenge his authority..<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining and well-made. It delivers some fantastic dialogue, sharp humor and incredible non-stop action sequences! Unlike most trilogies, one doesn't have to have followed the series to understand what's happening in Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>The script is ambitious but NOT wise enough to be rightfully cathartic.."

"rawkidd","3","1","3","26 May 2013"," What Special FX can do
","Well, one thing must be said: The Trailer fully served the producers goal: Drag as many as possible people into the theater.<br/><br/>Like a lot of people already said: Iron Man 3 is fully packed with CGI, VFX, XYZ but has everything else than a compelling story or such. I don't want to spoil anything but come on, this is all you can do with a fantastic cast? <br/><br/>By the way: Robert Downey Jr. needs to go over the books when it comes down to choosing the next movie roles because while making a fortune with these popcorn movies he dangers himself by losing role credibility. Why? In my opinion these kind of movies don't require acting skills very much this is Downey Jr.'s 4th appearance in the Iron Man series (Avengers included) so I tend to think he's choosing roles or movies that make him tons of money but don't challenge him as an actor.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think you really have to be an Iron Man fan in order to spend your money on this. I went to see this because of the horrible weather on a Sunday afternoon. And this is, what the movie does best: it distracts you from something annoying."
"contrep685","3","1","3","26 May 2013"," Huge Disappointment
","I'm not a die hard fan of the series but I enjoyed the first two. I was extremely disappointed during and after the film ended. Stark's actions and decisions didn't make any sense and I'm getting tired of his arrogance and sarcasm. Didn't have any of the ""magic"" from the first two films. I didn't feel his character evolved in any manner and, in fact, he seems to have regressed. I was told there were a lot of one liners that were funny but they were missed on me. Very little humor and unbelievable how immature Stark has become. I won't give away the ending but it was obvious what would occur and not enough to pull the whole movie together. It's a shame but I think they should stop now. Please, just stop the madness! Wish I could get my time and money back."

","It' been a long time since I got so disappointed at a Theater. After a very good Iron Man 1, and not so great Iron Man 2, I wasn't particularly anxious to see the final sequel. But when the great reviews started to come up in IMDb, Rottentomatoes, great supporting actors in Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley and since it was directed by Shane Black, I thought, hey how wrong can it be? Well, it was worse than that, and Iron Man 2 is almost a masterpiece next to it. In the initial 45 minutes I was always excusing what was happening up to that point, giving it a chance and expecting it to get much better Then I realized that wasn't going to happen, in fact it only got worse, the script was everywhere, it had so much idiocy it that I went into desperation. I even think Tony Stark never even make it to the set, it was all completely unrecognizable. What I used to get through the last hour was to remember the great spectacle I had seen a couple of days earlier at the big screen for the first time, the restoration of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 4K. Every time I thought of it was ""Wow"", then I looked ahead and it was ""Uhh"" As a heads up, the only other sequel that I found similar in such poor quality, was ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" It's not as bad, but it gets pretty close. You've been warned"
"Bruce722","9","1","3","25 May 2013"," Great movie with tons of action and humor.
","I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Iron Man 3 so I was a little concerned going into the theater. However, in my opinion the movie was outstanding. The cast and characters were fantastic just like the first two and the plot developed well and, unlike the first two, didn't have so many plot holes. The villain was thankfully not a robot and had some depth as well, which was one of the biggest things Iron Man 2 lacked. There was also plenty of humor, actually, there was more humor than the first two combined and almost all of it felt well timed and fit into the flow of the film. There were a few jokes or quips that felt forced but for the most part there were a lot of laughs to go around. The only real area of weakness for the movie were the overpowered villains. *SPOILER* The villains were so OP it made watching certain battle sequences a little ridiculous. It shouldn't take several Mark suits to take out one of the villains henchmen. And like in the second film, their powers have a limited range (whip in part 2, the need to touch you in this one) so them being capable of going toe-to-toe, let alone overtake a Mark suit was kind of a joke. Nonetheless, the movie was fantastic and these weaker elements, while they sound like a big deal here, are really easy to look past."
"beatlesdudeireland","9","1","3","22 May 2013"," An excellent action packed blockbuster
","Typically, blockbusters work on two levels: An economic model for studios to make immense profits, and to provide a crowd pleasing cinema for the masses, laden with witty one liners, explosive visceral thrills and spectacle. <br/><br/>Themes, film techniques, and the imprint of a collaborative film-making process, are deliberately veiled under the crafty illusion cinema affords. The Director goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure that their film reads like a product, not a work of artistic prowess. <br/><br/>Why Iron Man 3 perplexes me as a blockbuster, is that it not only provides the aforementioned thrills, but for a cine-literate film student, a depth of analysis. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, delivers a superb nuanced portrait of the cynical, egotistic billionaire, with director Shane Black attempting to eschew the iron suit for the majority of the film, and instead portraying the human complexities and weaknesses of the superhero. The theme of identity, separates the man from the suit. Stark, ceremoniously, contemplates the difference between him and the suit, the idea that the suit is a product of industry, and he a product of human life. The ending therefore, may be seen in light of Hollywood's enduring populist love for human sentimentality over the embrace of advanced technology. Warning the planet of the threat such powerful innovations pose.<br/><br/>I don't know whether 21st Century Hollywood reveres or continues to look down upon women, but Iron Man 3 certainly postulates an ambiguous relationship between feminism and cinema. Pepper Potts functions both as an autonomous female, worthy of running a successful multinational conglomerate, and yet acts as the stereotypical damsel in distress, needing rescue from Tony on multiple occasions. Yet the ending when Pepper Potts, ultimately kills the main antagonist, warrants a merit for strong female characters. Though arguably the strength of the woman comes from science rather than natural means, meaning that Black discredits inherent female power. However, it is also safe to argue that Stark is powerless without the suit. <br/><br/>The playing with the representation of the villain is one that both annoyed, and surprised audiences. The supposed malevolent villain Mandarin is nothing more than fake; an actor making viral videos, much like one does on Youtube. How does this bode for the audiences? It bows down to disgust, anger from the comic book demographic polarising them from the film, while conversely ensnaring regular audiences in the questions of identity and duplicity. <br/><br/>Overall, the film proved to have decent action, direction, editing, and story. A worthy blockbuster for our time."

","This movie clearly is a lot different than the previous movies in the sequence. Instead of continuing the from Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3 goes back into the past when Tony Stark makes a mistake that today threatens to loose the most important thing for him in the world, Pepper.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of story throughout and action only towards the end and the fact that the plot hasn't really continued from where it was left in Iron Man 2 which may disappoint some viewers. But let's not forget Iron Man 2 wan't the last time Tony Stark appeared in a movie. It was in The Avengers. So Iron Man 3 is really the post Avengers than post Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>Iron Man suit has undergone a lot major technological advancements in this movie. The suit is now completely robotic i.e, You don't even need to be wearing the suit to be able to fight. The suit now basically is a robot controlled by Jarvis when Tony isn't in it. Also the suit can be worn on the fly, which was hinted in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Overall a complete entertaining, worth watching movie."

Close calls are way too overused. The kid side plot was OK, but was not used in an appreciable way to make the story any more valuable. Ultimately Iron Man is more of another RED suited superhero to the kid in the end by way of gift saturation. <br/><br/>Overall it was very poorly done.

","Enjoyed 1 & 2 a lot and can say I was really looking forward to this sequel. It is crap and am VERY disappointed. I literally don't know what to say. Sorry in advance to be so negative but these were my peeves: - The Iron Man can withstand Thor's ass-whooping and a beating from the Hulk, but not heat. and the clothes the ""Extremist's"" wear must be made out of something stronger than his suit. - Killian can breath fire; lame! - The thirty or so suits should have been used toward the beginning instead of the end when he had them readily available all along. - Iron Patriot? Mandarin? Where did that come from? Writers, you need to stick to your sources. This was not a genius plot twist. Now someones got to work real freaken hard to explain that one off. In fact don't. Just pretend that effing up the Mandarin and War Machine didn't even happen. - The suits can fit on anybody Tony wishes, but not Rhodes when he really needs one. - The other ""Extremists"" can die to their death when falling from 200ft into fire and explosions, but not Pepper. - Anxiety attacks were not needed. - The boy side kick thing was not needed. - The fan in the van was not needed. - Really Happy, you don't know how to flip an iPad screen over? - Some suits were cool, some were just plain dumb. So then wear the cool suits that worked in the first 2 films right?!! - I understand the arc reactor was never in his chest in the comics but that was ingrained in the first two movies. Why now is he getting it removed? Maybe I'm a bit too critical but i've never almost walked out of a movie before, and I rarely do not like a movie I see in theaters; and I want my popcorn and coke back that I wasted for this film."
"danamadeus","Null","1","3","15 May 2013"," Not trolling, just being honest
","Iron Man 3 is... screw it, you know what Iron Man 3 is, you know who Tony Stark is. Anyways, Iron Man 3 picks up after the events of Avengers: ""what happened in New York"", as the movie refers to that movie. I know there's a lot of every-which-way hype over this movie already but hopefully I can navigate my way through that and just give my unaffected view.<br/><br/>But let's get down to brass tax, Iron Man 3 is an Iron Man movie, for better or worse. For me, mostly for worse because that FIRST trailer, (and none of the ones after it) promised a much edgier tone, and a finally not on-top-of-the-world Stark, giving the series a vitally necessary change of pace. I'm not saying I wanted The Dark Knight or anything, just something with more gravitas and a little less fizz. And the film dismisses the notion almost immediately. Yes, Tony does have some post-traumatic stress/sleep-deprivation stuff going on here, but it's not treated with any measure of depth or significance. Like everything else in the film, (EVERYthing, the characters, the plot, the fight scenes), it's treated as a throwaway gag, and has one of the most laughable half-baked resolutions I have ever seen for any plot arc. <br/><br/>And lets face it, the mile-a-minute barrage of repartee-esque dialogue, and the infamous glib Stark one-liners which were so fresh and fun back when Iron Man came out... are all really tired and stale now; and that's pretty much the first half-hour of this movie.<br/><br/>Once the film kicks into summer movie gear, it becomes an insipidly endless barrage of self-referential humor, broad slapstick, and lots (and LOTS) of noisy, flashy set pieces. And I'm not some action-hater or anything. I loved The Avengers. I just found the throw-downs in this overly bombastic, not particularly interesting, and pervasively noisy. That's not to say there weren't moments then and again that I thought were cool or found somewhat amusing, they were just drowned out by the rest.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 feels and plays much more like G.I Joe than any marvel movie. That especially goes for the ludicrous plot that stole it's villain origin story from an animated kidpic from ten years ago, it's baddies from (yes) G.I. Joe, and The Terminator, (sooooo Terminator, oh my gosh!!) and every cliché' from every buddy action flick ever. I feel like somebody's gonna be like ""NO! that's cuz it was a throwback, look at who directed it jerk!"". But when your plot is derivative AND ridiculous... yeah, that's all.<br/><br/>Some people will definitely enjoy IM 3 just fine. It's certainly one of the most ambitious superhero films thus far in terms of the amount and scale of action. But I would say, even Thor was much better as a movie because of its solid script and well-drawn characters. (Avengers miraculously managed to have both).<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a mediocre film, which I happened to see coming off another mediocre film...so there's that. But my overall opinion stands that it's garish excess, endless self-referential commentary, and disregard of potentially interesting plot elements, (not to mention some completely squandered characters) renders it an underwhelming film-going experience. It might just be me, but I find ""good"" films to be entertaining. But oh well... it's gonna make sh**-loads. Oh I forgot to mention: my favorite part of the movie... Jon Favreau!! Did anyone else notice his unmistakably Vincent Vega getup in the first scene?? **/*****"

"cu_ee","3","1","3","11 May 2013"," Throwaway action, annoying plot
","This is one of those action movies that suffers from an excess of action. It can't go for 5 minutes without a fight scene where Tony Stark is supposedly in mortal danger. Of course with a movie like this you know the good guys will survive and win in the end, but when it happens every 5 minutes it's simply impossible to get emotionally invested in any given scene. You know there will be some punching, some kicking, some explosions, and RDJ will walk away basically unscathed. It's tedious.<br/><br/>Likewise, instead of only having a handful of Iron Man suits, this movie literally has dozens, and their impressiveness and significance is diminished accordingly. Especially in the final scene where the suits are torn apart like tissue paper.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the bad guys (and the plot). Supposedly the bad guys are taking a drug that gives them the ability to regenerate limbs and heal quickly. And sometimes unintentionally explode. Fine. But it also inexplicably causes them to have super strength, reflexes, and martial arts abilities. (Huh?) And to make their eyeballs glow red/evil. And to make their limbs so phenomenally hot that they can punch through indestructible metal. And basically to have whatever powers are convenient for a particular scene. In one scene, a main bad guy is killed by two blast from Iron Man's palm-guns, but towards the end, the bad guys can't even be killed by being INSIDE a self-destructing Iron Man suit. (But they can be killed by Gwyneth Paltrow doing a backflip?) It's the epitome of lazy storytelling and it's infuriating, especially since we know these movies can be (and have been) done so much better."

","I think the other reviewers have covered most of the weak points of the film - the lame villain, the weakness of the iron man suits, etc. I agree with all of those points. The film seems to have devolved into something more along the lines of a Michael Bay Transformers schlock with stereotypical inclusion of a love story, cute kid sidekick and worst of all the flag-waiving jingoism of the Team America nonsense. TBH it's the last point that I found the most irritating. It's also absurd to think that in a reality where aliens have attacked and superheroes are running around, the villain's main goal is to gain some power over the US govt. In such a world the govt seems hardly irrelevant IMO."

Something else that bothered me is that they changed Rhody's actor again! Now he's played by Tyler Perry for the first fifteen minutes of the film, and Ryan Reynolds in blackface for the rest. That's kinda racist, IMO, but the worst part of the movie was the Mandarin. I'm sure Sir Ben Kingsley is a great actor, but in this movie he only has one scene, and that scene is just them filming the trailer for Iron Man 3, while Robert Downey Jr. flips off the audience. Otherwise, great movie, a lot better than Ang Lee's Hulk. Stay After the credits though, they tease the next Avengers movie by showing the entire last Avengers Movie."
"DRhumour","3","1","3","10 May 2013"," The problems with Iron Man 3.
","The problems with the movie were: Pepper says she worked with Aldrich years ago but there was no back story. Pepper wears the Iron Man suit in the beginning but doesn't get the suit she wears in the comics at the end. Tony has anxiety problems at the start of the film but just disappears in the middle for no reason. Rhodey says he prefers the War Machine suit to the Iron Patriot suit but doesn't get to be War Machine during the big fight at the end. Tony doesn't take Extremis so he doesn't get his powers to control machines. The Mandarin was not the incredible character he is in the comic with his magic rings. Instead he was a front that Killian used to steer the public eye away from him. Shane Black completely destroyed Iron Man's arch enemy. The Mandarin is to 'Iron man 3' as Deadpool is to X-men Origins. Despite the movie being called 'Iron Man 3' it was Pepper who beat the main villain. Tony mainly sent the suit into battle whilst he controlled it from a safe distant which is the same as a character going through an incredible adventure then we find out it was all a dream. After the final battle Tony sets all his suits to self destruct just to make a few fireworks. The film was supposed to be about Tony surviving on his own devices yet he gets help from a small boy. Tony makes the suit fly onto Pepper at the beginning of the film but says to Rhodey during the big fight that he can't put a suit on him because their only tailored for Tony. At the end of the film Tony has his Arc Reactor and the Shrapnel removed from his heart and then throws his Arc Reactor away after saying in 'The Avengers' ""It's a part of me now"". Tony doesn't get a main suit for the end fight he just jumps around in the ones he summons to him.<br/><br/>Shane Black has truly ruined what could've been the greatest saga ever made."

I wanted to see the Hulkbuster suit and I think once I got about a half second glimpse of it? Tony Starks armor must be made of aluminum these guys seems to just pull them apart with ease. not to mention war machines armor all they have to to is grab his arm and he shuts down. they steal his armor with no passwords or security of any kind reinforcing the seconds films idea from the government that these suits could just fall into the hands of anyone. don't these suits have any kind of insane security software or backup plan if they are that dangerous? the end when he blows up all his suits doesn't make sense? if they are so dangerous what happens when people on the dock or divers start finding pieces of them? if the world is that dangerous I'm sure a lot of people would be diving for arc reactors? if you are looking for anything resembling the previous Ironman films don't hold your breath. they didn't seem to put a lot of effort into the planning and making of this one? it felt rushed like trying to profit off the name and other two films. they made a big mistake getting a different director and special effects studio to make it. there have only been a few times I have really wanted my money back from the theater and this was one of them."
"ph0693","8","1","3","9 May 2013"," IRON MAN 3 *Spoiler FREE*
","It's Robert Downey Jr.'s possible swan song to his role of Tony Stark, how does it hold up? <br/><br/>To make it easy for everyone: Iron Man 1 > Iron Man 3 > Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>I doubted from the start that a final film in a trilogy could ever top the first (if it was good) film and I was right. Still, Iron Man 3 was a surprise, a pleasant surprise luckily. Its complexities lie even deeper than what meets the eye. It deals with a lot more modern day anxieties than its Avengers/Shield subplot heavy predecessor and its funny. Funnier than any of the other Phase one movies. Don't let the dark, edgy trailers fool you, because you'll be (extremely) unpleasantly disappointed if you were seeking a dark or serious movie(or anything like the Dark Knight series). <br/><br/>Despite this, Iron Man 3's tone is consistent so expect an Action Comedy. Does the comedy sometimes compromise the drama? Yes. But it works and never feels too cheesy. There's a part of me that wished Tony would get in his suit more often and do Iron Man stuff. But that was the point of the movie, to show that the man made the suit, that showed that Tony Stark is Iron Man no matter what. On the bright side, it shows that Tony's real power is his brain, so you'll get to see neat McGuyver-like stuff. <br/><br/>The only real negatives that show in my opinion is the CGI. I know everyone will scream plot holes or the twist but if you watch closely enough (or visit IMDb forums), most of the the former will be answered. The latter, unfortunately, is subjective. Those who see the movie as an insult to their dedication to the lore, or those who want/prefer a more traditional villain, will leave the series with a bad taste in their mouth. They maybe even be done with Marvel for good. Others who aren't really comic fans, like movies that have unusual surprises, and can see the movie for what it is (an Action-Comedy) can roll with it just fine.<br/><br/>Overall Iron Man 3 was a great film, especially for taking the risks that it did. It did a good job of connecting all 3 films together (with cameos, pivotal references, etc.) and tying up Tony's story arc with a neat bow. While future Phase two films look promising, it will be a difficult task for them to be as unique as Iron Man 3."

"ghost_dog86","7","1","3","7 May 2013"," New director, same entertainment factor.
","On the plus side, director Shane Black essentially does with ""Iron Man 3"" what Sam Mendes did for the Bond franchise with ""Skyfall"". He put it back on track (at least creatively anyway). It's not like ""Iron Man 2"" was a bad superhero movie (especially next to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") but coming off of the initial blockbuster that was ""Iron Man"", director John Favreau had much to live up to. Thus, for a lot of people ""Iron Man 2"" was a minor disappointment, of which Black has been sent in to correct. Now, does Black accomplish something profound here? Something Favreau wasn't able to do with the previous Iron Man's? Well, the answer is no, not really. Though the material is funnier, much of the visuals are explosion-centric and there is a startling amount of Gwyenth Paltrow abs, the direction isn't as different as many are claiming (which is a good thing). In the end, ""Iron Man 3"" is more of Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic sensibility, and that's basically all that matters when talking about this franchise.<br/><br/>Synopsis: When Tony Stark/Iron Man begins suffering from panic attacks on the wake of terrorist attacks by the Bin Laden-esque evil doer, The Mandarin, he begins to reevaluate what being Iron Man actually means to his livelihood and sanity. So, while that storyline sounds dark (or Nolan-esque) ""Iron Man 3"" sadly contains a more prominent and quite generic storyline, having to do with an alternate villain. A villain who has been cleverly left out of the trailers, but after an experiment gone wrong, plans to take over the world (don't they always?).When these two story lines combine, the plot itself isn't as strong as I expected. In fact, at times it becomes a bit overcomplicated. But again, the Iron Man franchise has always been more about the performances and the snappy dialogue than the plot.<br/><br/>Supporting Cast: Ty Simpkins (or mini-Robert Downey Jr. as I like to call him) the little boy who plays Harley Keener, steals the show for the relatively small amount of time he is on screen. Actually it is the chemistry between him and Downey Jr. during their scenes together, which are unequivocally the funniest moments of the film. As for Paltrow, who returns in her role as Pepper Potts, she is pretty blah. But not enough to be a distraction, somoving on.<br/><br/>Side Note: Undeniably, the most questionable aspect of ""Iron Man 3"" has to be the (dare I say) innovative way Black chooses to play out the role of The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley) whose character takes a comically unexpected, but spoiler-ridden turn half way through the movie. That said, when the villain in a superhero movie is delivering an abundance of funny lines, one could make the argument that at times the dialogue and scenarios have become a bit too Joss Whedon for their own good. And before you say it, I realize that Whedon wasn't a part of the writing team of ""Iron Man 3"". But maybe my issue with this overly comedic tone used for The Mandarin character goes back to the fundamental flaw with trying to compare the future of Disney's Marvel world with the future of DC comic films. On the wings of Christopher Nolan, DC has gone down the path of heavy drama, creating characters who are more flawed, more disturbed and more realistic. Now, Marvel seems to be going the other way with it, keeping an old fashioned sense of comic book levity, with film after film constructed on comedic foundations; i.e. ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"". Meaning, even though there is superhero action throughout, in Marvel films there are not only many comic relief characters, but also protagonists and antagonist who are quirky and quick with a funny one liner. So with that logic, the fact that ""Iron Man 3"" must be labeled as a superhero action/comedy, should not be held against it by fans of The Dark Knight franchise (like myself). In other words, from this point forward, if you are going to see a Marvel film, be expected to laugh. On the other hand, everything I've just stated may end up being toilet fodder with the upcoming release of Marvel's ""The Wolverine"".<br/><br/>Final Thought: Don't bother waiting around to see what clip is shown after the credits of this film. Trust me. The movie is long enough and the post credits clip is definitely not worth holding in a bladder full of urine for.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>The simplistic genre of comic book action hero films usually fail to excite me. Yes, there have been exceptions to the rule: Marvel's The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman, The Dark Knight quickly come to mind, as does the original Ironman. But in general for me, most comic book action fantasies are of the black and white variety: the good guys vs. crazed villains, plots to take over the world vs. plans to save it, the evildoer almost destroying our hero who makes a triumphant comeback, the CGI constantly overwhelming the real stunt work. Yes, the formula is set and hardly ever detours from its goal. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the third installment of the Ironman franchise, which is more of the same one can expect from this genre, but also a rare commodity that adds some grayer tones to the story with its wry and cynical humor, its stronger character development, and a crowd- pleasing performance by its lead actor, Robert Downey, Jr. <br/><br/>￼The formulaic plot of Ironman 3 goes like this: Our flawed and egotistical playboy Tony Stark dons the Ironman suit once again to stop world domination (and for some personal revenge, or course). With the aid of his loyal friend, Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and his trusty girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), at his side, Stark fights evil in the form of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a madman who regularly interrupts the airwaves threatening the annihilation of world order. Also on hand are a rich entrepreneur named Aldrich Killlian (well played by Guy Pearce) who must have an ulterior motive and Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, a scientist who must supply some more conflict. <br/><br/>This leads to various action set pieces that tend to wow the audience and give that special adrenalin rush to today's movie-going audience. These action sequences vary in success due to the frenzied editing and too many close-ups that interfere with the action. (One exception is an especially thrilling segment involving an air rescue mission to save falling passengers that is beautifully staged.)<br/><br/>￼Solidly directed by Shane Black, Ironman 3 essentially remains escapist pop entertainment. But with the world a-changing, reality is beginning to add a darker tone to the mayhem on the screen. The era of lively pop extravaganza is beginning to lose some of its color. Just how far can you escape from the horrors of terrorism, death, and violence these days, with the on-going epidemic of sadism and brutality we now witness on a daily basis? With so many images of 9/11, the Boston Marathon bombing, and ransom serial shootings plaguing our consciousness, can we now be immune to the real life senselessness of killing, even if this PG rated film sanitizes the gore by showing very little bloodshed? Can we allow ourselves to be so desensitized to the carnage in the form of entertainment for an hour or two? <br/><br/>￼The filmmakers seem to have taken too many liberties in updating the source and giving it a modern slant, profiling the enemy to be Middle Eastern. Black deliberately changes the ethnicity of the main villain from the original comic book source. (Perhaps the Chinese backers of the film objected.) This new Mandarin, much younger in the comic book version and without any superpowers in this film, has even aged to resemble Osama Ban Laden and this uncomfortable image plus the film's more serious point of view grounds the film in the real world. Granted the successful Ironman franchise has always had a realistic edge to its comic book trappings. But now reality has reared its ugly head. Explosions are a commonplace occurrence and destruction without consequence is everywhere in Ironman 3. (This film made me seriously question at what price do we pay for entertainment value nowadays.)<br/><br/>That said, the film has some assets amid some missteps, from its fine production values and its inspired casting. Downey and Paltrow continue to have the right chemistry between them, even if the script by Drew Pearce and the director gets a bit wobbly at times. Transitions between the narrative exposition and the gung-ho warfare and gadgetry became tedious and dull. An unfortunate amount of time is spent with a cute tyke at the midway point that might appeal to the pre-teen set but slows down the film's momentum. Also, while Guy Pearce brings the perfect sense of deranged danger to his character, Kingsley makes some unusual choice with his vocal delivery which I found more off-putting than menacing. (He sometimes sounded like a high-pitched Walter Cronkite.) <br/><br/>Ironman 3 is a well-made Hollywood blockbuster that totally engages its audience with some powerful images, strong acting, and even has a twist or two to convert any naysayers. ( The ""surprising"" twists didn't surprise me at all.) Still, I personally needed more fantasy in my escapism, a further leap from the harsh reality of our world that this film was unable to give me. In retrospect, maybe the black and white extremes of past efforts are better than the grayer shades on view. I guess today's superheroes do have it even tougher after all. GRADE: B-"
"natashabowiepinky","6","1","3","5 May 2013"," Something Explodes!!! (again)
","I swear, the plots of these films get crazier and crazier. Who cares though, when you have Robert Downey Jnr's ability to diffuse every tense situation with an irrelevant one-liner. Does this guy EVER worry? As for Gwyneth Paltrow, life is good... she earns almost as much as the guy playing the title character... for a small fraction of the screen time. Reminds me of Judi Dench winning an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare In Love... despite only gracing us with her presence for just eight minutes. Nice work if you can get it...<br/><br/>BAM. SLAM. WHACK. SQUEAK. (Okay, I made that last one up). The movie is one big noise from beginning to end, with plenty of stuff getting blown up real good and a final battle with so many automated robot suits it resembles a cut scene from a Transformers film. This puts it above the rather dull part 2, but a shade below the more plot and character orientated numero uno. Highlight for me was Ben Kingsley's performance as the dim-witted 'terrorist' who loves his beer and football. Well, don't we all? The summer season starts here... 6/10"

","I'm going to ignore the fact that they completely (and I do mean completely) destroyed the Mandarin as a villain. If you're so scared of the Chinese banning your movies, then just don't use the character. There are others.<br/><br/>I digress. This movie started out very well. A nice mix of action, humor, and suspense to keep the audience engaged and entertained. If it had ended at 90 minutes, I would have wanted to see more. Then I suppose, they could have actually spent another 90 minutes developing the final motivations for any of the main characters, because I couldn't figure anything out for the last hour.<br/><br/>What was Killian's motivation? Was it to better Stark, who wronged him that one night (although he seemed to be doing JUST FINE after the fact, so he really should have thanked him as he did...), was it to run the country? Well kinda, except he never clearly expressed any desire to run anything. Was it for access to more money for research? Well he had all the military contracts he wanted, so it didn't seem like he was short. WELL HE'S JUST THE BAD GUY GO ACCEPT IT.<br/><br/>But wait - he has an army of henchmen - many former military wounded. They were very loyal. Why? Cause he healed them right? But that wasn't explained - and then they kill one of their own - for what exactly? a smokescreen? But these are army guys - they don't just kill their own unless there's a damn good reason. I'm supposed to believe that former soldiers get their arms back and suddenly they forget their sworn oath of duty? Really? Then there's the anxiety attacks - why? Aside from being some of the worst acting RDJ has done (he looks like he's faking it EVERY TIME), again there's no explanation as to what or why. There's a throwaway line, but this was never alluded to in the Avengers and it wasn't really developed in IM3 and it serves as a distraction more than anything else.<br/><br/>There's so much more wrong with this. Calling it Iron Man was also offensive, as he's Iron Man for barely 15 minutes of screen time, and even then he's mostly getting beaten up. I'm sorry, this is the same superhero who got shot by a tank with barely a scratch - and suddenly his armor is getting melted by the human equivalent of a soldering iron? Really? And did I mention the horridly inappropriate points of humor during the final battle? Way to just totally deflate any sense of tension in the scene. Why not have Benny Hill music playing in the background? Wouldn't have been out of place.<br/><br/>Honestly, if the first half of this movie wasn't as good as it was this would be getting 1 star. Better than Iron Man 2 - yes. But barely."

","However, I don't know what they were thinking with villains here. Judging by the trailers, I thought they were going to make this one realistic like the first Iron Man. That wasn't the case. The Avengers took everything to a whole new level of silliness. Iron Man 3 continues that path.<br/><br/>If you were expecting a real sequel to Iron Man (not the semi-sequel that was Iron Man 2), don't get your hopes up. <br/><br/>Overall, this is obviously not anywhere close to being as good as Iron Man, but this is a step above Iron Man 2. <br/><br/>I will say every time the villains are not on screen, the movie is great. You have to just bare through when they are on screen."

I know some people who liked what was done with The Mandarin,saying that they were fooled by the trailer and they liked it.Actually that may be considered the ""smart"" part in the movie,but I wasn't totally fond of it. I liked ""Ty Simpkins"" as the side-kick kid,he did pretty well and gave taste to the story.The battle near the end was good,not cliché and well executed.One problem was that stuff that fans liked were misused:The Iron Patriot was accepted as Rhody,but had no significant role,the suit at the end of the trailer was thought to be a Hulkbuster(which it wasn't)was seen once in the movie I believe,and not to mention again The Mandarin. All the actors were great,just the story wasn't helping. I actually loved the post-credit scene more than many in-film scenes.

","In my opinion, I felt that Iron Man 1 had both innovation and as an engineer, even potentially inspiring educational value on it's side. Iron Man 2 also had a way of communicating the the potential positive and negative impact of technological innovation....then it all came crashing down with the Avengers movies which seemed to me to comprise mainly of fight scenes and CGI.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 has reintroduced the tech innovation albeit mainly in a bio-tech/genetic instead of an electro-mechanical context. As a innovatively minded engineer who has pitched my fair share, of (high and low quality) innovations, it's good to see the standpoint of take-it-or- leave-it-investor and desperate-tech-entrepreneur represented too! <br/><br/>I can see why some are saying that the plot is disjointed, but it is in fact quite the opposite. None of the technology is introduced for frivolous reasons and the film surprises on quite few occasions.<br/><br/>Not as easy to watch film as 1 or 2, but thought provoking nonetheless."
"velvoofell","9","2","10","27 April 2013"," Fan-Challenging but Ultimately Successful Third Episode.
","Often, such as in the case of 'The Green Lantern', comic book movies are declaimed to be lesser than their source material. The cluttered mythology is either forced all at once into one film or film producers squeeze all the costumery, monsters, mad scientists and fun out of a title so as to deem it almost unrecognisable.<br/><br/>The 'Iron Man' film franchise had it tough from the get-go in 2008. Tony Stark was a sixties throwback into whom creator Stan Lee had parlayed cool-at-the-time-not-so-cool- now misogyny and materialism, sticking him in a clunking great robot costume that made him look like an angry fire hydrant at times. He was a near unknown character to anyone outside of the humid, cumin-flavoured recesses of a comic-book nook. <br/><br/>Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jnr did well to play into the new-found trend for anti- political correctness. Hot on the heels of Daniel Craig's bastardly, born-again Bond, Downey's Stark was every bit the callous, corporate mogul playboy struck down by destiny to rethink his life and re-harness his talents.<br/><br/>Favreau selected Downey Jnr for many reasons, principally for the spooky parallels twixt actor and character but also because of Downey Jnr's career re-defining performance in Shane Black's whip-smart dialogued 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.<br/><br/>'Iron Man 3' returns the favour to Black by having him helm this new instalment. This new movie takes a cue from Chris Nolan - how could a ""real world"" version of the sci-fi-fantasy of comic books play out - and looks behind the corporeal and figurative masks of hero and villain. To wit, Black plays geek-defying games with stalwart Marvel villain 'The Mandarin', offering a take that may please conspiracy theorists with views on who Al Quaeda really are rather than comic book fans. It is a very brave move and one which is satisfyingly resolved - 'The Mandarin' is in this film, he just may not be who you think he is.<br/><br/>Overall, with cute kid and damsel in distress tropes comically toyed with, the film is a success and made me decide that Downey Jnr and the Favreau films (he produced this one as well as reprising Happy Hogan here) are my favourite take on the Iron-Man mythos. There are false notes in this film too - Don Cheadle's Rhodey seems better completely out of his Iron Man suit and the Shane Black wisecracks/grabassing can be indulgent in some scenes - but this is a geek-discussion-fuelling, edge-of-the-seat-gripping great night out at the flicks!"
"shankarjayanth","8","2","10","26 April 2013"," Robert Downey Jr.//Tony Stark//Iron Man - They always entertain you
","Iron Man 3 was an epic ending to the Iron Man trilogy. There is nothing to say about Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark, he is the perfect one for the role of Tony Stark. Breathtaking scenes, stunning 'suit-ups' and the occasional 'Jarvis Pun' make this movie a lot entertaining and fun to watch. I always liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, and she did a fantastic job in Iron Man 3. I'd put her above Robert Downey Jr. in terms of their contribution to the plot and entertainment factor, just fantastic. Ben Kinglsey as The Mandarin blended well with the overall plot. Guy Pearce was pretty bad ass and provided the protagonist with just the thing that a superhero needs to push himself to the limits for protecting and defending the innocent and the good.<br/><br/>The plot itself has a very powerful vibe to it, the conflict of conscience comes up at the right moments, making the plot unpredictable because you'd be left guessing with the way these conflicts are portrayed. These are the subtle things that keep the plot interesting. And just when the viewer feels 'there is too much seriousness in the frame for sometime now', quick one-liners crop up and make you laugh out loud. <br/><br/>People shouted and cheered quite a few times, thanks to the stunning scenes. I can't give so much as a review on the individual departments as I have no clear idea about which department does what. Fans of superhero movies, The Iron Man fans, the Tony Stark fans and the Robert Downey Jr. fans would enjoy it a lot. <br/><br/>Note: You don't want to miss the first 5 minutes, the plot is such that you would have to 'guess' what you missed to understand certain things as the movie comes to a close. And seriously, reviews of any movie shouldn't contain any part of the story or scenes! At least not until a few months of its release!"

","There's a not-so-disturbing trend in superhero mythology now...one where the superhero is unmasked and stripped of his superpowers, forced to confront his nemesis, is nearly defeated, but triumphs over evil in the end. We saw this happen in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and now in ""Iron Man 3"". Perhaps the next Thor movie will see Thor battle evil minus the hammer...<br/><br/>But this is about Iron Man - the third one in the series, and what an awesome third one it is. Tony Stark the man is more in evidence here, either unarmed, or armed in bits and pieces of his prehensile iron man suit. The villain is the suitably menacing Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who turns out to be a front for someone far more sinister. Did I say ""unarmed""? That's far from the truth since Tony Stark comes armed with an endless supply of quips, ingenuity, brains, mechanical skills...and when all else fails, he gets by ""with a little help from his friends"". Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark as though he was born to it - the physicality as well as the intellectual force is very evident. So is the brash humor...now the Stark hallmark.<br/><br/>All the other players in the movie - Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall - are competent and inhabit their roles completely. Ben Kingsley is incredibly good in a role that takes a sudden unexpected turn. But at the end of the day, they are all mere supporting characters for Robert Downey Jr., and the movie never lets us forget it.<br/><br/>The action sequences are incredible and keep you enthralled...the 3D effects have you actually cowering in your seat. The attack on the Stark mansion, and the final showdown are the best I have seen in a very long time - fantastic without being over the top, and perfect for 3D.<br/><br/>Watch it - you won't be disappointed."
"ag-icon","8","2","10","24 April 2013"," Same old Marvel movie without the adrenaline rush!
","Iron Man 3 hits the spot with a bottom line that says ""I'm better than the first two installments, watch me!"", and for good reason. The superhero franchise, which serves as a blockbuster sequel to both 2010's Iron Man 2 and last year's The Avengers, made a bold but direly needed move by revamping its gears and offering new goodies for the Iron Man fanatic to set his eyes on – all thanks to its writer-director Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). <br/><br/>For the third time, we see Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man 1 & 2, Sherlock Holmes) put on his Tony Stark cover, the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" engineer, who takes on the flight without a cape as Iron Man. This time though, he is confronted by Black's Al-Qaeda version of the villain known as ""The Mandarin"" straight out from the Tales of Suspense #50 Iron Man comic book introduced in 1964. <br/><br/>The movie would present The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in relation to Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a brilliant scientist from Stark's past 13 years ago, who came up with Extremis, a project that aims to perfect a serum that can upgrade human DNA – which was taken from Warren Ellis's story arc in the Iron Man comic book series called Extremis. This, however, becomes a plot to take out Tony and terrorize the United States by creating an army of serum-infused subjects whose eyes turn freakishly red and are armed with enhanced strength and rapid regeneration abilities (I don't know, but Killian breathing fire makes no sense for me though). Tony Stark then teams up with his air force buddy James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and a kid from Tennessee named Harley (Ty Simpkins) to save the day as usual (it wouldn't be a superhero movie if he didn't). <br/><br/>With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) being taken by the enemy, his Malibu sea-side mansion being blown to pieces, his anxiety disorder attacks, not to mention the lab rats of Killian hunting him down, and War Machine being named Iron Patriot, Tony Stark is given a new reason to suit up and be the superhero that is Iron Man.<br/><br/>This clearly steps outside of what rapidly became a stale storyline as started by the first and repeated by the second IM movie: Let everybody in the world see the sophisticated red and gold suit, and battle the villain wearing a bigger suit at the end of the day. With Shane Black, Iron Man was given a new aspect and direction (thank God). Together with the usual but better humor and robotically spectacular action scenes, finally, the story had Tony Stark put into drama which is something uncommon considering his spry, greasy and hilarious character. With the dramatic scenes being added, one can get a fresh glimpse at reality dragging Tony Stark down back to Earth. Even the subplot developing between Stark and Harley can give the audience that warm feeling amidst the tension from all the ruckus going on – until Stark ditches the kid, of course.<br/><br/>But here's an interesting question: Considering that this is a sequel to last year's The Avengers, why won't Iron Man call upon his super-friends or S.H.I.E.L.D to help him? There were even moments in the film where ""Avengers"" was mentioned. Marvel studios president Kevin Feige answers this by saying that there are times when superheroes are on their own and that there are times when they are together. He also says that judging from Stark's determination and nature after being attacked, he had to sort it on his own (Maybe a flashback of Stark telling Captain America that he ""doesn't play well with others"" from The Avengers trailer might help).<br/><br/>Give me visual effects and machine explosions all day, they are stunning and spectacular as always, combined with not just one Iron Man suit, but dozens, even Pepper wears one! (Which I found sexy, by the way). Stark's one-liners and the over-all script were way better than the second movie. Also, the story offered some twists which were quite unexpected, one of which was hysterical in all sense of the word unlikely involving Ben Kingsley's character, making him steal the spotlight for a moment. In other words, it had a little bit of everything, including a sky- diving stunt with thirteen Air Force One personnel (who would've thought?), and that expected short clip at the end of the credits (Hello Dr. Bruce Banner!). <br/><br/>What better actor can play the role of Tony Stark the way Robert Downey Jr. does. His comic yet subtle antics at giving the character justice never failed all throughout the three IM flicks. And with a great supporting cast who all delivered great performances: Gwyneth Paltrow being hotter and sexier and does a good job at keeping Tony under control, Guy Pearce giving out a resounding bad guy role, and Ben Kingsley just both dark and hilarious in this movie, not to mention that Bin Laden get-up with that epic ponytail, Shane Black delivers an exciting superhero movie that lived up to the hype. Two thumbs up indeed!"

","The first film was really good, the second film was a tiny bit of a let down, but I heard this third film was an improvement, and I saw that it was rated well by the critics, so I went to the cinema to see it, from director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Basically the film starts with a flashback to a New Years Eve party in 1999 where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was with female scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), who invented the experimental regenerative treatment called Extremis, which intended to recover severely injured people. At the party Tony was invited by disabled and nerdy looking scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who owns company Advanced Idea Mechanics (AID), to have a place in the company, but he rejects the offer, and saying he would meet him later leaves him humiliated. Forwarding to the present day, Tony is still recovering from the events during the alien invasion in New York (during Avengers Assemble) and having panic attacks, so he has built several Iron Man suits to relieve himself, but this is also creating friction between him and his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile a series of bombings by a terrorist called The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) with no forensic evidence left behind at the scenes has left intelligence agencies bewildered, but when Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), security chief of Stark Industries, is injured, that is when Tony threatens the terrorist on television. Tony says for the Madarin to come and get him, he is later visited by Hansen who comes to warn him of danger, and the terrorist responds to the televised threat by sending helicopter gunships to destroy the Stark house, but he saves Hansen and Pepper from the attack. Escaping the attack in one of his suits Tony blacks out and crashes somewhere in Tennessee, where a bombing took place, following the crash the suit or experimental armour has no sufficient power to get him back to California, and everyone believes that he is dead. He gets help from ten year old Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins) in investigating the incident in the town, the explosion has all the similarities to a Mandarin attack, and he deduces from his technological thinking that soldiers subjected to Extremis have reacted badly to the effects and it caused them to explode, he witnessed this with agents Ellen Brandt (Stephanie Szostak) and Eric Savin (James Badge Dale) attacking him. With the boy's help Tony traces the location of the Mandarin to Miami, but meeting the dangerous looking man from television Tony is surprised that he is actually a British born actor named Trevor Slattery, the Mandarin is a creation of the true villain, now good looking and Extremis cured Killian. When Tony is captured by Killian, the villain tells him that he has kidnapped Pepper, and that she has been subjected to Extremis as a blackmail to force him to help the improve the effects of the experiment, Hansen is killed for having a change of heart, and Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly War Machine now re-branded as the Iron Patriot, is lured into a trap to steal his armour. Tony manages to escape and help Rhodes, he knows that the plan by Killian is to use and control the Iron Patriot suit to attack President Ellis (William Sadler) aboard Air Force One, so the two heroes head for the impounded damaged oil tanker where the villain is hiding out. Going against the numerous henchmen Tony activates all of his suits, and controlled by JARVIS (voiced by Paul Bettany) they fight the thugs, while Rhodes rescues the President, before saving Pepper who has survived the Extremis effects. Killian is trapped in one of the Iron Man suits to be self destroyed, but this fails to kill him, but Pepper intervenes with her newfound powers and he is killed, and to prove his dedication to her Tony orders JARVIS to destroy all the armour suits, the shrapnel embedded in his heart is removed in surgery, and he throws his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, but remarks he will always be Iron Man. Also starring Ashley Hamilton as Jack Taggert, Dale Dickey as Mrs. Davis, Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez, Xueqi Wang as Doctor Wu, Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen, Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, Stan Lee as Pageant Judge and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in a post credits sequence. Downey Jr. is still likable being knowledgeable and jokey, Pearce is a great choice as the knowingly nasty villain, Kingsley is great being deceptive and amusing, and supporting cast members Paltrow and Cheadle get their good moments as well. The story is much better worked out than the previous, the fight and destruction sequences are engaging, especially the house attack and final fight, the special effects are really cool with all the suits in action, technological gadgets and explosions, there is plenty of fun to be had with this terrific fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

","So the favorite super hero of millions Iron Man and its third installment arrived at the theaters with full swing and of course this time in a much grand canvas.With the gigantic production cost Marvel pictures have left no stone unturned in any of the departments say it casting, acting, special effects or the marketing. To start with, the famous sense of humor of Mr. Tony Stark this time forms a combo with the true emotions and finally Miss Pepper Potts finds the caring, sharing side of Mr.Stark for her. The chemistry between the couple has been the trade mark of the franchisee, though this time Mr. Shane Black with the director's hat emphasized on the romantic side of the super hero. Terrorism at the heart with the commingle of American politics, this time the baddie Mandarin reaches the secure zone of WHITE HOUSE and his demand for a call from the Prez and the resulting betrayal and Miss Pepper falling from 200 ft height was perhaps the two shocking moment that turned the reel world and the real world silent for a while. The DNA Coding and the resulting fire power which has been used as the lethal weapon by Mr.Mandarin stands believable but again somewhat repetitive and falls into the category of the same age old Hollywood action formula of mutation and desolation. The audience will definitely be spellbound by the special effects but somehow the movie wrapped up being an action-romantic outing. The revelation of Mr. Ben Kingsley as the fake Mandarin was a little earlier and that is the only loop hole in the screenplay that I felt. Overall the movie is a full on entertainer and all the checklists of a super hero movie is ticked.Children gonna love it, adults gonna like it and we poor reviewers like it but with some Ifs and buts.. Eight Cheers for the movie and one more for Miss Pepper's amazing fight scene at the climax..Go For It !!!"

","iron man 3 in many ways seems to be like the last bond movie (skyfall),in that it represents the protagonist, tony stark in more human and soft approach rather than his usual playboy and narcissistic ways.but this hardly means that the movie is dull or drab,to the contrary the movie has many plot twists the are bound to bring a chuckle out of everyone.Shane Black has truly made a movie that is worth your money, the story entails many moments of absolute hilarity yet maintains a suspense that won't leave you to the end.(the end comes with a rather big plot twist and mystery ,to comprehend refer to the iron man comic wikipedia page).and as usual there are the nerdy moments with the suite, a new person *insert condiment here*gains superpowers and tony ends up as a new man. but as in any movie there some annoying traits that carry on ,for example Tony's constant hissyfits that Jarvis terms as 'panic attacks'.some purists would be disappointed given that the movie loses some of its rich heritage of jaw drop women,and the quirky and apt attitude of stark . this is a movie that is worthy of the badge of iron man 3 and your money."
"Gordon-11","Null","3","21","27 April 2013"," A great blockbuster
","This film is about Tony Stark investigating a series of explosions without traces of explosives.<br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" is very good! The plot is great, well developed and paced. Unlike other recent blockbusters, there is a good mix of action and comedy, and more importantly the plot makes sense and makes you beg for more. It is refreshing to see a superhero with goofy moments and even anxiety attacks, reminding us that no one is perfect. The special effects are extremely fast, everything looks so real and convincing. The mid-air rescue scene is so breathtaking and beautiful, I could not take my eyes off the screen. I really enjoyed watching ""Iron Man 3"". And remember to stay until after the credits, when you will see Mark Ruffalo in a cameo scene."

","I have to admit that I loved everything about this film but I did fall in love with the character the first time around. This movie is every bit as good as the first but even better in my opinion.<br/><br/>They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Well, Avengers gave this film the opportunity to move beyond what has come before and it appears there was a lot of hard work and thought that went in to making it because it's exceptional in every way. And, we are all lucky to get to see it. Iron Man 3 is exactly where and how the character should appear after the events of Avengers. I love the idea that after the Avengers Tony basically goes a bit crazy with paranoia and builds MANY new suits of armor just to be ready for anything. This really speaks to his mindset and where he is going from this point forth. It's true character development and advancement. Sometimes it's not all for the better but that's life and that's certainly what sets Marvel heroes apart from all others. The flaws and feet of clay are on display but the emotion and relatbilty are off the charts in this film. I can say the same thing about the action. There were some thrilling things that happened in the first two Iron Man films but NOTHING like we see in this movie.<br/><br/>It's certainly on a par with Avengers. Iron Man 3 is the best solo film Marvel has made and that's high praise indeed."

","Iron Man 3 oh how eager I was to see this film.<br/><br/>Tony Stark is seen in a different light in the film he gets stripped from his armour and we get asked the question does the suit make the man or the man make the suit? The movie certainly pleased me and Robert Downey Jr steals every scene. This film is much more humorous than the others which was good but the constant need to puncture every half- serious moment with a witty one liner grew tiresome. Tony Stark had differently improved his tech though, I was amazed. The last full paced action scene was differently the best out of all the Iron Man films and will please many I also loved how Pepper Potts got to kick some ass! The special effects were done exceptionally well! The Mandarin I thought was a great villain until the twist. I was actually a bit disappointed as our new villain didn't cut it for me. Overall was a good movie better then the second not sure about the first.<br/><br/>Overall I give Iron Man 3 a 8/10 <br/><br/>-Being a big Marvel fan there seemed there was something missing. I think it had to do with they totally completely did not mention SHIELD at all- I mean when Tony Stark was in trouble they didn't try to contact him or Pepper Potts like the previous films."

","Wanted to give this 6/10, but couldn't. So much of this felt inconsequential in that I know all these characters are in the other movies, so I have no reason to be worried if they'll live or die. A lot of this felt like it was throwing everything at me in the hopes that I'll be entertained. There were so many explosions and spectacle, way too much to be beneficial to the narrative. So much of the character conflict relies on callback to The Avengers movie as well- it's called Iron Man 3, not Avengers 2. Additionally, Downey Jr. gave a pretty shallow performance of an anxiety attack, it felt really out of touch.
I will say that the end fight was impressive, but it was still difficult to suspend my disbelief entirely - Tony's falling and getting beat up so much but he doesn't seem very bruised at all.
The post credits scene was nonsensical- you're telling me that a super rich genius wouldn't hire an actual certified therapist to talk through his anxiety? Really?
Overall, a very by-the-numbers superhero movie that didn't seem to have much of a purpose other than concluding the Iron Man arc, which didn't need to be 130 minutes long."

"carter-47153","8","1","4","24 August 2015"," The Identity of Iron Man
","Tony Stark is a character that was created to court controversy. Comic creator Stan Lee has admittedly stated that in creating Tony Stark his goal was to create an arms dealer during the Vietnam era who becomes a hero. The challenging element to this creative decision was in making him likable to a generation of youths who were against the Vietnam War. By injuring him mortally through a heart wound and making him vulnerable and then leading him to essentially don a suit of armor like a chivilaristic knight, Stan Lee was able to create a sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation. Throughout Mr. Stark's storied history, comic creators have added further moral conflict into his character. These additional conflicts have included alcoholism and absolute black & white decisions.<br/><br/>The question posed by this unique character is what is it that makes up the worth of an individual; is it the contributions made toward the community or is it something more innate? In the film Iron Man 3, Mr. Stark struggles with the idea of is his value as Iron Man or as a person able to contribute to society with his own natural talents. This is a question that he is only able to answer when his quality of life, his technology, friends and family are taken away from him.<br/><br/>This is a dilemma that many people have to face at some point in their lifetime. Generally when someone introduces themselves to a new acquaintance they state their name and their occupation. By doing this a person is prioritizing their occupation over other areas in their life. This displays a sense of identity within how a person contributes to their community whether it be local or regionally.<br/><br/>This is a concept that is reinforced through our upbringing and family life. The message that some receive is that there is value not only in your occupation but that there are occupations that are better than others. This leads to behaviors geared to attain the best occupation possible to display yourself. Some of these behaviors include gearing our life to be more available for work such as where we live, what we do in our leisure time and other personal decisions.<br/><br/>While there are other areas of life that suffer in importance in opposition to a person's occupation such as volunteer time, personal relationships, personal development and so on. While the potential of community impact and personal value is just as great for the other areas of life; they are put on the back burner for the professional life. This causes some individuals to become numb to a complete life and to minimize the importance of such a life. It is only when we lose what we consider to be our life that we are able to find value in the rest of our life. It is regrettable that this tends to only happen when we are forced to in order to find happiness within our lives."

I can think of stories that haven't gotten filmed, but Hollywood is stuck on superhero sequels, tween pop, and remakes of horror flicks and foreign films*. Therefore, ""Iron Man 3"" just doesn't seem original. It especially comes across as a letdown when you consider that Robert Downey Jr. has starred in ""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"".

","Having seen the first Iron Man movie, which was great and really entertaining, my expectations of the second was really high. <br/><br/>Then came the second Iron, which was basically a mediocre movie and totally disappointed me. I was really hoping the third one to come out good. But unfortunately it was a disappointment too. <br/><br/>There wasn't a good solid plot throughout the movie. Some characters were too intense, and without any background explanation of some of the characters, you'd just had to accept that they were evil by default. Which I don't like. <br/><br/>It reminded my of the ""The Incredibles"" where the main character Mr. Incredible's neglect of Buddy Pine transforms him into a super-villain. It's the same story here, with a bit more twist at the end.<br/><br/>Even the CG were mediocre. The Iron Man suit animations were not even in class with some good CG animation in some PC games. But at the end, Tony Stark's reference to the metaphoric cocoon was some how intriguing. Hopefully there will be good writers on the next sequels. And I don't mean the Avengers."

","This had a more complex plot than IM1 or 2, and it tries very much to show Iron Man as a human being, not so much the super hero in an ultra high-tech suit.<br/><br/>Laudable in some senses but I think in many ways I prefer the Tony Stark of IM1, where he rises against incredible odds to become the SH who terrorizes evildoers.<br/><br/>His smug cockiness and downright stupidity in revealing his home address on national TV invites disaster. Should he have been surprised when the helicopter gunships showed up? Later he apologies to Pepper for putting her life at such grave risk, and declares he will never do it again. Let's see how long a scriptwriter's memory is...<br/><br/>Bit of a wonder also how his house did not have ANY sort of air-defenses. Even if he had not been so stupid to reveal it's location, couldn't a determined enemy have tracked him down eventually?<br/><br/>The scene where he rescues 13 falling people is certainly a memorable one, though it seems that a deliberate effort was made not to show TS in the suit much. The scenes where suits are destroyed in ""oops"" moments are amusing but seem out of character for multi-million dollar pieces of hardware - surely they have an anti-collision mechanism as even top cars do, to prevent such mishaps.<br/><br/>The CGI is great if you are prepared to just let the eye candy roll and not think too deeply about what is actually happening."
"tomgillespie2002","5","1","4","28 August 2013"," A mixed bag
","After five movies and one giant superhero mash-up, the Marvel superhero formula is getting as stale as old bread. With the only Marvel stand- alone superhero film to have a sequel (so far - Thor: The Dark World and Captain American: The Winter Soldier are imminent) being Iron Man, did the world really need a third entry into this franchise? More importantly, did we want it? Well, with over $1 billion in the bank and the label of fifth highest grossing film of all time, the answer is an overwhelming yes. The franchise certainly needed a fresh injection of life - Jon Favreau's massively disappointing follow up to his impressive Iron Man (2008) perhaps showed his inexperience as director, though he has stayed on to reprise his role as bodyguard Happy Hogan (looking worryingly bloated). Changes have been made, and although the critics seemed to lap up Iron Man 3, audiences opinions seem strangely polar opposite.<br/><br/>Interesting choices for director have always been Marvel's thing, to allow a respected or rookie director a chance to inject their own sensibilities into the familiar superhero film. Sometimes it pays off - Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian background gave Thor (2011) a certain gravitas when it could have been plain silly. But sometimes it doesn't, such as the choice of Joe Johnston - whose career is a very mixed bag anyway - for Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which I found rather dull. So for Iron Man 3, in steps Shane Black, 80's buddy-comedy extraordinaire, whose filmography was somewhat re-discovered in fits of nostalgia of late, especially after the excellent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). And deservedly so, as Black's obvious talent for writing led to movies such as Lethal Weapon (1987) setting the benchmark for countless buddy movies to follow (and ultimately damage the sub-genre). So Iron Man 3 would bring Tony Stark back down to Earth, allowing a more intimate side to be seen and a chance for the supporting characters to finally make their mark.<br/><br/>It's certainly more down to Earth, with less of Tony Stark's quick- humour and arrogant prancing (which is what we love him for, especially with Downey Jr.). His new foe would finally be a match for him - not just a man in a different sort of Iron Man suit, but a true criminal mastermind that would meet him physically and mentally, in the same way that Bane smashed Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012). And after the opening third, Tony Stark is simply Tony Stark. His suits have been all but destroyed, his friends are far away, and the prototype escape suit he is left with is damaged almost beyond repair, so even the trusty JARVIS (voiced by Paul Bettany) isn't there to help. He must now use his wits, but without his suit, he is physically and mentally vulnerable, not helped by the pursuing super soldier Savin (James Badge Dale).<br/><br/>This is where I find that superhero movies get interesting, when the central character is stripped of all his powers and we see the true man (or woman!) underneath. Yet Stark's task is a rather tedious one, trying to put the pieces together of a relatively simplistic yet clumsily executed central plot with the help of a precocious child (played by Ty Simpkins), who just so happens to have an obsession with engineering. Didn't child sidekicks die out in the early 1990's when film-makers realised that no-one likes them? If it is in fact Shane Black's way to give a nod-and-wink to the audience, then there's not really any call for it. This is not a throwback to buddy movies so in-jokes of the like have no place here.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to be said about Black after seeing this, is that he must have balls made of diamonds. Alec Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) certainly would have employed him in real estate. The decision he made regarding the main villain of the story is one that had the comic-book nerds shaking the foundations of their parents' basements, and one that had me appalled. I cannot say much without revealing the twist, but it's a baffling decision, one that would have been rather clever under different circumstances. It leads to Stark's nemesis being just as dull as previous instalments, which have been the main problem with the franchise. Finally we could have had a bad guy up to Christopher Nolan's standards, but it is side-stepped in favour of something all the more familiar.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a mixed bag. Action-wise, this is the best so far, with excellent CGI work leading to a thrilling climax which includes an army of iron men suits. But the humour - Black's forte and something that has been spot-on in the first two movies - seems forced and, at times, awkward. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Tony's best friend and frequenter of War Machine, has a larger role, but the chemistry and banter between the two lifelong friends is just not there. They are certainly no Riggs and Murtaugh. It also outstays its welcome, stretching credibility as far as it will go to the point of the ridiculous (since when has Tony Stark been Jason Bourne?), but it is a definite improvement of Iron Man 2 (2010), employing a more interesting internal struggle for Stark than mere daddy issues, and a more satisfying climax. As a whole, Iron Man 3 was undoubtedly a let-down for me, quite shocking given the talent involved, but my eagerness to see the film and my unquenched thirst for superhero movies proves that Marvel's formula still works even if some of their output just isn't up to scratch.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.co.uk"

","This works for me, if only a bit, in spite of all the superhero trappings, which are tired even by Marvel standards. Typical post- 9/11 hero plot, with a bit of harmless shuffling of sides but pressing the same business as the White House movies earlier this year: for all its technologic might and security, poor America is at the mercy of chaotic, evil forces and needs war machines from the skies.<br/><br/>What if the Osama-lookalike is really a puppet and a disgruntled American is behind the plan? Tony Stark's assertion that it's not about politics but good old-fashioned revenge stays. The bombings and televised messages stay, tapping into a more visceral fear than logic can dress in retrospect. Those images register closer to televised reality, while the actual villain is a more removed cartoon, a genetic supermutant.<br/><br/>But moving on. This time they got Shane Black to write and direct and he brings a sensibility of equal parts deflating and indulging the iconography that he has honed in previous films and that Downey knows and can support. In fact that's his main job these days in this and Sherlock. A punch and a wink. <br/><br/>And one reason why many didn't like this is that it's really a Tony Stark movie, which means a Robert Downey movie.<br/><br/>Probably it came down to a simple practical matter for the makers; more Iron Man time needs a faceless robot (and Downey pretending he's in a suit) which minimizes Downey's charming draw as actor.<br/><br/>So he spends most of his time outside the suit, improvising. And many of the situations this time revolve around the fact that his gadgets won't work, those that would yield the Iron Man movie. Sporadically they do, so we get bursts of uninteresting Marvel noise. But often, only parts of the suit will fly to him performing only part of their task. Often, they'll blow up in his face revealing a flummoxed Downey like a silent era comedian, a Lloyd or Chaplin, mystified at some thingamajig that won't work.<br/><br/>It's all about a screwy actor feigning a struggle with machinery he's built. Clever and amusing. Along the way, we meet another screwy actor inside the story with drug problems. But that is all continuously swallowed up in the larger Marvel contraption he has to deliver, where the comedian's soulmate and world peace alike are grandiosely threatened in the dull way of Marvel.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Marvel's grandiose aims with functional mechanics are reflected in the visual map of mind Guy Pearce shows early in the film. Impressive to look at but merely an embroidered function. For a brief time, neurologists thought they could come up with a computational model of mind that would explain all. No dice. Consciousness is its own space."

"danieljknight","7","1","4","5 August 2013"," Excellent special effects, average cliché script, confused characters
","I enjoyed the movie but felt let down as no doubt many have. What stood out the most to me was the missed opportunities to come up with some twists, including ones you'd think would have been used but were anti- climactic. Some parts made no sense to me being that they were contradictory.<br/><br/>Baffling fails:<br/><br/>When Stark's house was being pummeled, you'd expect to see Pepper and the botanist sliding around and grabbing on to things for their life, but strangely it's Tony mainly falling, and who falls. It seemed more logical that the girls would fall, and he'd rescue them, instead, weirdly, for no apparent explained reason, Jarvis shoots Tony out to seemingly the middle of no where far from the girls, leaving them at the mercy of more attacks or killed from some accident due to the compromised structure.<br/><br/>The latest iron man suit goes onto Pepper without apparent explanation at one point, and she's able to use the suit, yet later in the movie when Iron Patriot asks for a suit, Tony says ""Sorry, they're all coded to me."" Then how was Tony able to get the suit onto Pepper?! And how was another suit able to get onto the president if it comes on automatically and not manually? It seemed Tony was able to use mental control combined with verbal, but where was the verbal when he got it onto Pepper? Stupid. Also Pepper is taller than Stark, so how was the suit able to fit on her, does it have height adjustment!?<br/><br/>Another thing that was nonsensical was the regeneration of characters who lost limbs: in order for large amputations to be healed as was the case in the movie, you'd need matter for that, you can't just come up with the material for a new limb out of thin air, you'd have to eat or have at least the fat in your body necessary for such a healing. The same goes for the absurd healing powers shown for Wolverine in movies he was in. It would have made sense if the characters with the regeneration ability were shown immediately scarfing down some high calorie meals they had and drinking water to regenerate, but nope, just magic and hoping for a stupid dumbed down kiddy audience that entertains comic idiots and parents just hoping to shut their kids' whining for entertainment up for a few days.<br/><br/>Didn't like how the kid partner in the movie made a clearly pretentious adult comment-toned, ""that's what they all say"" when Tony asked him if he believed the bomb story too.<br/><br/>I also thought it curious that the bad guy (actually just realized how this looks like anti-conspiracy theorist propaganda in the movie while typing this) implies that terrorist front men like Bin Laden were merely puppets of the rich, yet in the movie, I forget who, said the President allowed some oil rich guys who spilled oil to get away without punishment, so, why then the big rescue of the president like he was someone worth saving if he was a villain himself? Why was instead the Vice President arrested, and WITHOUT EXPLANATION, only some implication that he was partnered with the Mandarin? I'm starting to hate this movie now that I type all this out. It would have been better if Stark said to the Pres after rescuing him, ""Oh before you go, please, stop bailing out the rich, we have enough money to bail ourselves out.""<br/><br/>Lost entertainment avenues: the botanist just gets shot dead, no saving herself at the last second by injecting herself with an overdose of her super formula, just, dead, at least seemingly. Hopefully she reappears later on mysteriously healed and with no powers in a later movie. And Pepper, after falling to her seeming death is out of the picture for too long in my opinion and was awkward in that you'd think if you fell into a big bonfire, you'd get up after your healing powers kicked in, and they should have right away, and ran out screaming, at least if you were Pepper. But no, she shows up at THE LAST SECOND so to speak, to rescue Tony. Come on. So she was on fire the whole time and didn't die? That's kinda unrealistic.<br/><br/>Also nonsensical was that one mean military girl with the burn marks: and why didn't her burn marks heal? After typing that it occurred to me it could have been because those were real burn marks, even if not, why didn't they heal, does the formula not work on scar tissue? I guess not.<br/><br/>I also did not like the pathetic over dramatic scenes where Tony is displaying soft post traumatic stress disorder and trying to make it come off as severe. It DID however look like the acting of a narcissist, and in a previous Iron Man he admitted to being one, so if the idea was to make Tony look like a typical narcissist drama queen, yeah, it works, but it seemed to me more like a poor script idea trying to come off as deep and later funny when he PTSDed out on the kid.<br/><br/>I want to give it an 8 for the kinda of pro teaparty ""that terrorist bogeyman is just a stooge of the rich"" comment, but with the Iron Patriot theme, and putting the president in an Iron Man suit, just looked like a movie about vanity over justice. I'm not saying it was actual propaganda, perhaps pandering to the government as usual to get some private funding for the next movie, or popular buzz from the Obama admin (which would alienate conservatives if was the plan), and can't since the Avengers movie showed rebellion against the government command to nuke Manhattan, which made the gov look stupid.<br/><br/>As a Christian, I'd give it a one for being godless."

The character development of Tony Stark was good when he was forced to overcome several obstacles, but the movie focused too much on the one character and very little attention was given to the rest of the characters. So in conclusion the movie was a disappointment and had a boring plot but had good although limited character development, but is a nice movie to watch if you are looking for some action scenes with stunts and special effects.<br/><br/>INNER MOTIVATION=7 OUTER MOTIVATION=5 FINAL RATING= 6 out of 10"
"Inception29","7","1","4","21 July 2013"," Good film but villain twist is disappointing
","In my opinion this was a good and enjoyable film but the villain twist was disappointing. <br/><br/>The cast was solid and all put in good performances as their characters with Robert Downey Jr standing out yet again for his portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man and the soundtrack went great a long with the action.<br/><br/>I have to say though I was annoyed with how they chose to deal with the villain 'The Mandarin'. At the start Ben Kingsley looked very mysterious and intimidating and it definitely looked as if he was going to be a great and powerful villain with Guy Pearce's character looking like a worthy sidekick but to then turn him in to just an actor and making Guy Pearce the 'real' mandarin left me disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall though this was still a good film and I am excited to continue to watch the build up for the next Avengers installment."

","After watching this movie and going through the whole trilogy you can feel a little disapponited. It is a very entertaining and humorous film. Robert Downey Junior and Gywneth Platrow give a great performance but the story itself has so many plot holes that it almost spoils the entire movie. Even if you are familiar with the whole Iron Man series you will still sit through this movie and ask a few questions. Another thing that upset me was what they done with the War Machine character played well by Don Cheadle. They could of done more with him and got him involved in more action scenes but he barely gets stuck in. Solid performances also by Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. Double villains with a twist. <br/><br/>Special effects are as good as ever with any Marvel Comic Studio film.<br/><br/>This is a great film despite the dodgy plot but if you can get past that you will enjoy this movie a lot. So i would say Iron Man 2 was slightly better than this sequel. Iron Man 2 i would rate as a 8.5 and Iron Man 3 a straight 8.<br/><br/>SCENE LOOKOUT: Airplane scene with passengers and Irom Man"

"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","1","4","10 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 Review
","To start things off, let me say this, ""Iron Man 3"" is not only the best Iron Man movie to date, but also the best Avengers build up movie. This film has it all from its great sense of humor to the amazing action set pieces. The story here is more personal than any of the other film in the series as it focuses more on Tony Stark than his suit of armor. We get a sense of depth to the character and the psychological problems he has since putting on the suit. Iron Man becomes more like a cocoon rather than something that actually enhances the man. Throughout the movie we see his over dependency on the suit and how much weight it puts on is shoulder, which is well elucidated by Tony pulling the suit through the snow.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film in certain areas felt off mainly do to how fast they were jumping from topic to topic. However, the action sequences are always spot on and really gets the audience involved. Tony's house exploding is a great highlight of the film and my personal favorite set piece as it tell a lot of story of the relationship of Tony and Pepper through stuff blowing up. Another thing to note in the film is its humor. It is funny and timed well. Some of it can be off putting in certain scenes or moments, but for the most part these particular segments are few and between.<br/><br/>The characters are great and the actors do a fine job. Robert Downey Jr. has finally found the perfect balance of arrogance and likability in Tony Stark. He's great as the character and we finally get to see other side of him that we've never seen before. Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is finally a useful character. She holds her own and it's great seeing this character grow and given attention to. Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin is great. I particularly like how they introduce him with some great edited shots that highlight the amount of power and terror he poses. Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce are great in their roles as well, but the standouts are easily Downey, Paltrow, and Kingsley.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Iron Man 3"" is a really good popcorn flick that is not only entertaining, but engaging. It's great seeing these characters develop and also seeing these actors hone on their personalities. The action and humor, for the most part, are spot on and give the movie the right amount of energy. There is a twist towards the last third of the film that can be jarring, but if you go with it, you'll enjoy the film a lot more. I give it 4/5, incredibly entertaining and the best Iron Man movie yet."
"FallsDownz","7","1","4","8 May 2013"," It's good but not great
","Iron Man 3 is another Super Hero Movies from Marvel and it's in the ""Phase 2"" So it's another setup for The Avengers 2 or maybe some others Marvel movies , so we've already saw 2 movies of Iron Man this is the third time (and lots of people thinks that this is a final one of Iron Man ) the question is , is it good ? Yeah it's pretty good <br/><br/>The Things I Like : I just really liked the Action Scene in the Climax it's just so smooth and so connected even it's really fast action. The Second things that i liked is the story about Tony that after The Avengers he's just kind of damaged he's not the same and i really like that. There's some cool stuff and exciting scene in there too. Ben Kingsley OMG he's just did a great great job in acting.<br/><br/>The Things I Don't Like : The villains is just so disappointed when i saw the trailer i just so exciting about this new villains calls ""Mandarin"" but when it came out it's just so disappointed. And the story is a bit of predictable.<br/><br/>And the last things i want to talk is about some story about villains i kind of a halfway of it , i mean i don't like it but i don't hate it too that things is about this "" Mandarin "" things i liked that they just caught people of guard and surprise the fans of Iron Man and they just turned this in to villains fakes things. But the others half i kind of a don't like it because when i saw the trailer i hope that i'll see this new villain that just beat Iron Man because now he's not 100% yet or something and he's seems powerful but instead they give me this. I kind of a halfway here again i don't know that this is bad idea ? maybe ? or maybe this is a good fresh idea ? yeah probably i mean it's up to you too.<br/><br/>Overall i just liked the new Iron Man but i think the first one is a bit better IMO."
"Mr-Fusion","6","1","4","5 May 2013"," The new armor's top-heavy
","Let me just say right now that I love what they did with the Mandarin in this movie. We'd been wanting to see the ""big bad"" since 2008, we're finally getting our wish (retooled as a middle eastern terrorist, but so is everything nowadays) . . . and it's just Ben Kingsley on a pirate broadcast. No real Mandy. That sort of subversion is ballsy (and I can understand the feathers it ruffled), but I love it. Kingsley steals the movie, by the way.<br/><br/>But IRON MAN 3 ultimately tries to pack too much in - and without the grace of its predecessor, it's a meandering mess. There's just too much happening. And I'm a Guy Pearce fan, but Aldrich Killian and the whole Extremis thing were pretty lame. And that final battle was one unabashed toy commercial. I wholeheartedly admit that Shane Black's involvement got my hopes up for this thing, but it's too bloated for its own good.<br/><br/>6/10"
"nhanguyen","8","1","4","4 May 2013"," Do you expect to have more in the battle at the end
","I think the film is good, nice story, lots of humor, a happy ending The battle at the end is very impressive with a lot of iron robots in different armors. When i saw them flying i thought it would be a very dramatic fighting But i think if only the producer could provide more scenes for the iron suits to perform, it would be very interesting. There are just a few fighting scenes, and although there are dozens of suits,we could only see a few of them. I expect to see more suits with different functions I specially like the big and strong robot which run from the river, it is also featured in the trailer. But i could only see them for a few seconds. What a pity!! i expected they could do something important for Tony. Most important, i think it should have a leader suit which is strongest among them. It will make a real battle."
"orlandotourist8462","8","1","4","4 May 2013"," Marvel's Phase 2 begins strong
","So now that ""The Avengers"" is all taken care off, how does The Invincible Iron Man, Tony Stark, handle life afterwards<br/><br/>After the Battle of New York in ""The Avengers"", Tony Stark has been traumatized, since out of the six members, he was the one who nearly sacrificed his life to save the city. He's been spending his whole time building suits, giving him a total of forty-two Iron Man suits. As this is going this mysterious figure called The Mandarin, is sending terrorist threats to the United States and is launching attacks in several places around the country. This leads to an attack on Tony's Malibu mansion and he is forced to rely on being Tony Stark, and not Tony in the Iron Man suit, as he comes up with a way to combat the Mandarin and these mysterious forces that have been injected with this virus called Extremis.<br/><br/>So there is a lot that I like about the movie. Robert Downey Jr. is still a great Tony Stark, it's got some really great writing from writer/director Shane Black. There are many great moments of funny dialogue and given that it works with the slightly darker tone is a plus. The acting from the other cast members was good. Gwyneth Paltrow gets to do more in this movie then in the past two movies that really satisfied me. We get to see Rhodey (Don Cheadle) be a bad ass in and out of the Iron Patriot armor. Guy Pearce is someone that I hated, not in the sense that he was bad, it's just he made Aldrich Killian absolutely evil, which made me root for Tony even more. Sir Ben Kingsley is good as The Mandarin even though there is something they do with his character that I really hated. One actress that I want to briefly mention that I liked was Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen. I want to bring her up because ""Extremis"" was the only Iron Man comic I've read and she was everything I imagined Maya to be in that story. Speaking of which, the Extremis soldiers were a perfect translation from the page to the screen. There are also some spectacular action set pieces, that put me on the edge of my seat, got me tense and excited at the same time.<br/><br/>Now there are two problems that I have with the movie. One is more of a nitpick and the other is a twist in the movie that I hated and I'm sure are going to upset a lot of comic fans. The nitpick is that the end credits make it feel like the true end to the Iron Man Trilogy, and being that this is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark will indeed return. The one thing that I hated about this movie involved the Mandarin. <br/><br/>(THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO SPOILER TERRITORY, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED)<br/><br/>The Mandarin was being built up throughout the movie and in the movie you find out that he's just an actor doing these terror videos as the leader of the Ten Rings (the organization that kidnapped Tony Stark in Iron Man). You find out that Killian is the true Mandarin, and being a Marvel fan that was kind of hard for me to swallow. However as the movie kept going and especially when we get to that intense scene involving Air Force One, I started to be more forgiving.<br/><br/>Despite that problem, I really enjoyed this movie, it's currently my least favorite of the three Iron Man movies (and I know that's unpopular to say since many people hate Iron Man 2), but now that I know of that twist, I might enjoy it better the second time. It's the most emotionally powerful of the three, it's really funny, with more surprises here and there that I enjoyed and not only is it a great way to start off blockbuster season, but a great way to start up Phase 2."
"rivertam26","7","1","4","2 May 2013"," Growing up
","I would like to preface this review by saying I don't know much about the comic books that Iron Man comes from but I do know it serves as an inspiration. Upon exiting the theatre I heard some people complaining that the film differed from the source material and weren't very happy. That being said as someone uninfluenced by those standards I thought the film was great! Director Shane Black of the fantastic and criminally under seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang takes the helm with appreciated results. Jon Favereau fared well the first two creating a grandiose, sarcastic, sassy mouthed but fantastical universe filled with big characters people have loved spending time with. The first one is still the best in my opinion, it lost a little luster in the sequel but this follow up entry brings the franchise into it's smaller, more character driven roots which is much appreciated and changes the overall effect. The film humanizes Tony Stark played by the lovably jerky Robert Downy Jr. as he lashes out at a terrorist and suffers the consequences when he is attacked at home. Most of his equipment is destroyed and his girlfriend Pepper is nearly killed. Presumed dead by the public he moves ahead trying to solve the villains mystery and begin to rebuild his machinery so to speak. There's lots of clever quips and even emotionally resonant add ons. the humor is there for the most part but doesn't feel as funny but the action sequences are truly breathtaking. And there is finally a kick ass character arc for Pepper Potts played with a seductive ferocity by Gwyneth Paltrow. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the original material or even if it makes all that much sense but it is grade A entertainment and most of all it shows that the franchise is growing in a more adult direction a brave act in a slew of constant cinematic immaturity. 3.5/5"
"Paul1990","5","1","4","2 May 2013"," Divided response
","I can't work out whether I like this film and for some reason every newspaper review I've read can't seem to give it enough praise, which personally I found very confusing. So I'm glad to see from these other reviews that people are pointing out similar issues with the film that ruined the experience for me. The main thing that stands out is that this doesn't feel like an Iron Man movie at all. If I were to review it as a film isolated from the Marvel franchise, I would probably say it was fun, witty and had a good amount of action. However it is an Iron man movie and this is where my problem lies.<br/><br/>One of my greatest pleasures about watching these films is seeing Tony create and step into the Iron Man suit. More than anything Iron Man is cool and the previous films really capture this. This film just doesn't do the Iron man suit justice. I didn't like the new design of the suit. The suit seemed incredibly vulnerable in comparison to past movies and contradicts the powers of the suit. But my main problem was that there wasn't much Iron Man. Every Iron Man film should always fulfill one thing, and that's Tony Stark being Iron Man and there just wasn't enough of this, even the longest sequence Iron Man sequence (plane scene) you find out Tony is remotely controlling it, so he isn't even in it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark and he gave a good performance in this film. But I'm paying to see what Tony Stark can do as Ironman, not what Tony Stark can do without Ironman and ultimately this left me leaving the cinema feeling unsatisfied.<br/><br/>If your not particularly a big fan of the Iron man franchise you'll probably enjoy this film. But if like me you're an Iron man fan and you still haven't seen the film, don't hold your expectations too high, as there will be various things that will annoy you that I haven't touched upon."
"darthchris19","5","1","4","1 May 2013"," Awesome and a disappointment at the same time!
","This movie is hard to review since I am a comic book fan and I do not know how to look at this picture. Reviewing it as an objective viewer there are a lot of stuff to like in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. kills it again in his role and his comedic timing is excellent. I even enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrows performance. Guy Pearce also plays a pretty awesome villain and Ben Kingsley nails it as the Mandarin. Don Cheadle however is a different story. He does not have a lot of scenes and he does not have an important role in this movie....Jon Favreau had more of a role here than him which is a shame, since in the comics War Machine actually becomes Iron Man for a time. And Some humor does not always work in this movie because it feels like fart jokes a lot of times. Also do not expect to see a lot of Iron Man in this film and even when he you do the suit breaks apart almost immediately. The reason why I give it a 5 is because of a scene during the 2nd half of the film which ruins everything about the Iron Man saga which the comic book fans came to expect. Its a scene that truly ruins everything you know from the comics and it does not make sense why the creators of the movie went down this path. But if you can swallow that scene then the rating is an 8."
"KrazzyDJ","7","1","4","28 April 2013"," He still is Iron Man
","We've all seen the trailers. And we've all probably built up a certain vibe about the movie - that its taking the dark route a.l.a. DC movies. So, if it doesn't end up living up to that vibe that its built around itself, its bound to disappoint viewers, mildly or hugely. Because in this case, the dark route actually seemed like a perfect fit for the third installment.<br/><br/>Sample this: After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark suddenly realizes that there are other supremely powerful beings in existence, that he's not alone, and that when compared with the others, he's certainly not the strongest of the bunch. So he develops post-traumatic stress, starts getting anxiety attacks, and in the process has built himself an army of suits - an Iron Legion - all because he just doesn't feel safe anymore. This causes friction between him and everyone else he knows - between him and Pepper and their romance, between him and Rhodey and their friendship, and between him and Happy affecting their bonding. Lots of room for exploration there right ??? Add to that, an emerging terrorist threat in the form of The Mandarin whose organization, The Ten Rings was alluded to in the first movie and you have an opportunity to bring things a full circle. The Mandarin being Iron Man's most prominent foe in comic book legacy only helps.<br/><br/>But sadly, it looks like the movie doesn't care to exploit all of these to their fullest. I'm not saying it doesn't use these issues at all, Tony's vulnerabilities are played out brilliantly. Its just that they could have done so much more with this material and the trailers gave us reason after reason to expect that they have that we end up a tad bit dissatisfied or should I say even mildly frustrated. And the pacing of the movie is quite feverish which isn't a problem if the characters are involving enough. But when they keep spurting out one-liners after another with a comic intent, it gets a bit irritating. Again, I'm saying a bit and not hugely irritating.<br/><br/>There's no reason to scoff at the movie's production values. In fact, being a Marvel movie, I shouldn't even be commenting on how amazing the visuals are, or with Black at the helm, the action is top-notch. It would simply be wasting characters in this review if details are described. But yes, the airplane crash and the subsequent fall sequence deserves mention - its the only sequence in the movie that gave me real goosebumps. I'd say that sequence makes up for some of the movie's flaws never mind the brief duration that it last's for.<br/><br/>Downey is at the top of his game here. He plays a more mature, sensible and disturbed Stark unlike the jolly good alcoholic of the previous movies. However he does retain his sense of humor which is good in a way but not so good when done excessively. The girls get little screen time but give in their best. As for the bad guys, they're all effective and any further comments on their performance would mean spoiling a big twist in the movie.<br/><br/>With Iron Man 3, Marvel's Phase II has begun. And while this may not be the best of starts, its certainly not a bad one by any means. A little bit of fine tuning and even sticking to the vibe the trailers projected would have made this movie a serious force to bicker or reckon with. As it is though, Iron Man 3 is a pretty decent summer flick. Just don't expect anything extraordinary out of it.<br/><br/>I was about to give it a 7, but I'll raise the score by 0.5 for Downey's performance and for the airplane sequence.<br/><br/>Score: 7.5 / 10"
"cnitinb","7","1","4","27 April 2013"," Tony faces terminator(like bad guys) and has panic attacks!
","Director Shane Black's Iron Man 3 begins in a flashback, in the year 1999, when Tony stark is just being himself and ends up sleeping with a scientist and disappointing another. This sets up a very interesting prologue to what could have a been an amazing adaption of the 'Extremis' comic series. It does manage to keep you entertained till the end (post credits in fact) and later if a realization sneaks in on you that maybe it wasn't all that memorable, you are not alone. <br/><br/>The movie has two super villains, the Mandrin (a well know character in the comics) played expertly by Sir Ben Kingsley and Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce) the 'Extremis'( a regeneration technology) scientist. Strangely enough the latter turns out to be more menacing in the end, in this nerd-turns-super villain yarn that is not entirely original. Even the extremis goons and Killian himself will definitely remind you of those famous killer machines with regenerating powers. (read: Terminators)<br/><br/>The protagonist Tony stark is having a personal crisis post 'Avengers initiative' after facing ""gods', aliens and a Hulk"". The Aliens(Chitauri) have not only physically drained him but have crept into his nightmares causing anxiety disorder. His girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) has taken over the reins of the company again, but it is evident that Tony's insomnia and stress has taken a toll on their relationship. <br/><br/>The creators have tried to include the famous comic arc in a way that might have seemed creative on paper, satisfying both the comic geeks and the rest of the movie goers, but in execution, something goes amiss. It is hard to pin point what exactly is lacking, the action scenes, especially the one involving the sky dive from the air force one, is jaw droppingly good. The characterizations have more dept. Last year we saw a billionaire face his deepest fears, suffer thoroughly only to 'rise' a hero again (but he gives it all up in the end) , this year we see another billionaire go through pretty much the same thing . Pepper Potts is joined by Maya Hansen(Rebecca Hall) as the co female lead and both their characters are fairly well sketched. The plot has a good many twists too, yet there is something very evidently formulaic. One particular surprise is momentarily amusing but ultimately turns into a huge disappointment, it will seem like major character and a versatile actor were simply unused. <br/><br/>Usually a movie with the above mentioned faults will collapse like a poorly constructed tower and disappear into oblivion, but not Marvel's Iron Man 3. There won't be a free moment to dwell on the missteps, for the movie runs at break neck speed throwing an action sequence one moment, clever but emotional scenes like the one involving tony stark and a smart ten year old kid, in another. It is a pure entertainer from start to finish pulsing with mind blowing CGI and witty one liners one would expect from an iron man film. Although it should be mentioned that the post processing 3D here looks nowhere as good as the Avengers did. <br/><br/>So in the end, complaining that Iron man 3 is not thought provoking or dark enough is just inane. This is no Nolan flick. It is a vibrant and deeply engrossing summer blockbuster from Marvel who should be praised for trying to bring out the human side of iron man while making it completely worthwhile. Looking forward to the next marvel movie this fall, just hoping the God of thunder doesn't come back with anxiety issues. Damn you Aliens!"

","Iron Man 3 (2013) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) calls out a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and soon everything he knows or cares about is in danger. With the help of a special chemical created by a madman (Guy Pearce), the Mandarin plans to destroy the world and take Iron Man out with it. IRON MAN 3 isn't a flawless movie but it's certainly a very entertaining one that packs plenty of punch from the opening sequence to the last. I personally enjoyed the second film in the series, although I'm well aware than many hated it and those same people are calling this one a return to form. Well, this here is certainly a step up from the second film and it almost reaches the level of the first one. I think the greatest thing going for this third film is that it offers up pretty of funny moments. As usual Stark is full of jokes and wise-cracks and of course Downey is just perfect in delivering them. If the first two films didn't already prove it this one here certainly does but Downey was just perfect casting for this character and I can't think of anyone who would have been better. The supporting cast is strong as usual with Kingsley turning in a very good performance as the villain and his voice in the terrorist videos was extremely effective. Both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow return and are fun but I can't say the screenplay did either of them any favors. Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau and Ty Simkins were good and it's always fun seeing Miguel Ferrer. It was especially great seeing Pearce back in a good role and the underrated actor does a very good job with it. The action scenes are all extremely well-done and I thought the CGI was very impressive and mixed in well with the live action. The story itself wasn't the strongest in the world but there's no question that the screenplay got the humor right and it gave us situations and characters that kept us involved. Director Shane Black keeps the film moving at a very fast pace and there's no question that he never lets the viewer doze off or lose interest in what's going on. IRON MAN 3 is certainly a great way to kick off the summer season and it's good to see that three films in (four if you count THE AVENGERS) they're still delivering the goods."

","""Iron Man 3"" was pretty good! The acting of Robert Downey Jr. was excellent. The whole movie was funny enough and it also had several breathtaking moments. I watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still fascinated. Picture was perfect in its 2d release and I suppose that there won't be much upgrades in its 3d version. Gwynneth Paltrow was decent, but still wasn't as good as Downey. Ben Kingsley was perfect! His British humour made all the minutes he appears on screen to move the whole theatre into laughter! All the battle scenes were amazing and most of them made me stare on the screen and leave my pop-corn and cola for later! Having watched the two initial films a week ago I really had into my mind to see whether a third installment on the franchise was needed. Well, ""Iron Man 3"" is the best film of the trilogy and I dare to say that it was better than most of other superhero movies. I'm really looking forward for the next film with Iron Man!!!! Till then I'll watch The Avengers!!!"

Their CGI is getting worse every film, and they do not care about story or plot. There is nothing keeping these movies watchable at all."
"Scott-hind","8","1","5","23 September 2014"," Great film. Don't let reviews fool you
","This movie got a lot of stick. Why? Thats the question I ask. <br/><br/>I am not a superhero movie fan. And that is why I love iron man three. It isn't a mind numbing mash of explosions and pointless action like most superhero movie tend to become. The movie focus on tony stark battling his own demons and struggling to do so rather than iron man just showing off and shooting things. (Iron man 2 coming to mind) Robert downing JR shows the world just how good he really is as an actor and dominates the screen with subtlety and diversity ANY actor would be proud of. Guy Peirce is as brilliant as ever, and the plot is gripping and tight.<br/><br/>OK so it drifted from the comic books somewhat. But let's be honest, who really cares? How many of us know a great deal of info about the comic books? The Nolan batman trilogy did the same and became the best comic book movies of all time! <br/><br/>There a lot of bad reviews on this movie, and I can see how it can split audiences. DO NOT JUDGE. Watch it first."
"spreitzerjohn","1","1","5","2 October 2013"," Very disappointed in Marvel.
","Well in my opinion Iron Man 3 is atrocious monstrosity of a movie. Beware spoiler alerts ahead! I did enjoy the human element they brought to Tony Stark with his PTSD and his portrayal of how crafty is without his suits. They still royally screwed up the plot and here is why: First, they took the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's greatest nemesis and made him a complete joke. While I believe it would of been tough to explain the Mandarin's powers and where he got them I am sure they could of done it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_(comics)(especially if they mention Thor and Avenger's references). Second they took the Extremis story arch and completely tore it apart. Extremis is meant to be Tony Stark's biggest challenge yet and eventually leads him to perfect his suit by syncing his reflexes with the Iron Man suit (there has always been a delay from the commands he issues to the suits reaction.) Third, while I was impressed that they introduced Iron Man's different suits (he has made suits for different jobs, like the Hulk Buster.) They provided a very shaky narrative for their creations. Fourth, they had the worst ending you could ever come up with. The death of the antagonist was lame. I recommend everyone should watch the anime version of the Extremis story arch. This is how they should of done the movie. I am very disappointed in Marvel, the director, and everyone else who didn't speak up on how bad this movie is. I do not have high hopes for the next Iron Man movie. http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Iron_Man_Extremis/70204996"
"tombiddy87","5","1","5","11 September 2013"," A disappointing end to a otherwise impressive trilogy
","It may not be the Iron Man were used to but new director Shane Black brings us a more personal story of the man behind the mask as we see a vulnerable Tony Starks trying to come with his own inner battles.<br/><br/>When a terrorist, known as the Mandarin starts to hijack the airwaves to send messages, threatening America with a plan to send countless strikes to the country Tony takes action and gives a live broadcast to avenge all who the Mandarin has harmed and in the process is forced to go on the run after a attempt is made on his life. He starts to question who needs Iron Man more, the public or himself. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Junior gives one of his best performances as the billionaire genius as this latest instalment we a much more vulnerable character, very different to the cocky playboy we have come to know and it does show his talent as he does spend much more time out of the iron suit. The love of Tony's life, Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow shows how far she has come since the first film and plays a big role in the first act. The Mandarin who is also Iron Man's arch nemesis is not a particularly accurate adaption from the comics and certainly falls short of expectations. <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 does have it moments with some pretty impressive effects but there are great lengths when very little happens and the narrative suffers in the process. It's still worth a watch but don't expect a repeat of what we were given in the opening film of this trilogy."

This was easily the worst movie of the 7 movies released in the Marvel cinematic universe to date.<br/><br/>After Iron Man 1 and 2 and the Avengers, I was starting to fall in love with Robert Downey Jr. He was still an amazing actor in Iron Man 3, but with such crappy writing and dialog I don't know how he was even willing to be in this movie. (Well probably helps that they paid him a little.)"
"themissingpatient","3","1","5","28 August 2013"," An Iron Man film without Iron Man
","Tony Stark's past comes back to destroy him in Iron Man 3. When a terrorist known as The Mandarin emerges and almost kills Stark's ex-bodyguard in a bombing, Tony swears to get vengeance by killing The Mandarin himself. This time Tony Stark's ego might have lead him to go too far as his actions put more than just his own life in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Iron Man was a surprise hit and one of the three best super-hero films next to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2. It began introducing us to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a role he seemed born to play. Like in all super-hero films, it had some far-fetched ideas yet it was able to keep a level of believability due to some key ingredients that more of these films need to be using in order to keep from embarrassing themselves. The first ingredient was to not just explain but to show how the technology worked, like in Batman Begins. The other key ingredient was to keep a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, making everything light and fun, never taking itself too seriously. Some great laugh-out-loud moments were provided thanks to Robert Downey, Jr. in his performance. Add a twisted villain and an adrenaline-fueled hard rock soundtrack and you've got a lovable super-hero that balances comedy with explosive action.<br/><br/>While Iron Man 2 made the mistake of under-using what could have been better villains with Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell, the few action scenes there were showed Jon Favreau had become a master at directing edge-of-your-seat sequences. And while it was held back with a subplot setting up The Avengers, it contained some cleverly written, witty dialogue that delivered the same humor that made the first one so much fun.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 takes a storyline from the Extremis mini-series with a new director, Shane Black. The first sign that Black was taking Iron Man in the wrong direction was the use of the most over-played song of 1999 and what could be considered one of the most annoying excuses for music of all time. Forget classic rock themes from AC/DC or Audioslave, this time we are burdened with having to be reminded of the worse thing that came out of 1999, Blue (Da Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65. Some things should be left in the past, buried in shame and hopefully forgotten, never be played or heard again for the rest of our lives.<br/><br/>Music aside, there's an unnecessary voice-over and the witty dialogue we've come to expect has been replaced with slapstick comedy. This includes Tony being hit in the groin with a piece of his new prototype suit, which is left unexplained as to how it is suppose to work, and toilet humor involving the villain. Guy Peace is a good choice for a new bad guy behind the Extremis technology, yet this is also left unexplained as to how it works or what it's purpose is. Ben Kingsley is a great addition but the film is as guilty as the last sequel with under-using such a great actor.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 suffers from trying to do too much. In the beginning it seems Shane Black wants to make a serious character study of Tony Stark, this could have proved interesting but then, as the film moves forward, it is clear he is also trying to appease the younger fans of The Avengers with out-of-place, cartoon antics including a fire-breathing villain. All believability is thrown out the window causing any excitement or suspense to be lost. What made Iron Man work so well was it didn't take itself too seriously, as this one does. The fun is lost."
"stillvendetta","Null","1","5","22 August 2013"," It's OK, but not as good as Dragonball Evolution
","This was probably the worst entry in the Iron Man series. It's even more disappointing since it was the first followup to the Avengers. You can't just go from great to average like that. And this was definitely an average film.<br/><br/>1. The villain was horrible - What was he even trying to do? What were his motivations? It just seemed like everything he was doing was random. He seemed to have no plan at all.<br/><br/>2. The acting - Look, Guy Pearce is actually a good actor, but I guess it was the script and the director because he was awful in this. I think he didn't know what he was getting himself into when he took on this role. I think he thought he was going to get good material to work with.<br/><br/>Same goes for Ben Kingsley. Wonderful actor, horrible in this. Which is kinda ironic when you consider his character in the movie.<br/><br/>I blame the writer and director.<br/><br/>3. Dragged on, not funny - This movie should have been 1 hour and 30 minutes. That's pretty short for this type of movie, but you can blame the script for that. There were parts that were simply unnecessary, and there were supposed ""funny moments"" that had me shaking my head.<br/><br/>Some other things this movie had going for it. Anti-climatic, joyless, incoherent, and ridiculous. When did Tony Stark become James Bond? He's all of a sudden Ethan Hunt without the suit in this.<br/><br/>Another thing I wanted to touch on. Stupidity. So Tony has this program, a fleet of Iron Man drones that he can call on at any point. He activates the program at the end for the final fight, but doesn't activate it when his house is under attack and both and Pepper might not make it out alive.<br/><br/>There was also him destroying all the suits at the end. That made no sense at all.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was just OK, but it's no Dragonball Evolution. Could have been much better."
"siderite","6","1","5","7 August 2013"," Oh, no, another American president is in danger!
","When I rate a film, I do it in comparison with the others of his genre. Luckily, for Iron Man 3 I have two other movies of the exact same type available, so that makes it easier. Unluckily, this is by far the worst film in the series. It doesn't mean it's very bad, just that it fails comparatively.<br/><br/>The story is that a vicious terrorist appears to ""teach lessons"" to the American president and the US in general. All nice and beautiful, but before presenting this plot, it starts with Stark reminiscing about the past and presenting two major players. If it weren't for that, one would have kept asking oneself what is going on and kept a bit of the thrill on instead of guessing the plot from the get go.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Iron Man gets his ass kicked. The manner is so simplistic an naive that it raises doubts about the entire franchise. Barely escaping he meets a kid that helps him out. Actually, that was the best part of the film. The kid story and their interaction was what saved this movie from being total special effects cr*p.<br/><br/>Then the true horror is revealed with something so unlikely or believable that it made me laugh. You see, for terror and revenge, the villain has advanced the human race a few steps in its evolution and concomitantly solved any energy issues the world has ever had. Then Iron Man kicks his ass. Why?<br/><br/>The ending was totally horrible, as a continuation of the start. Same lame voice explaining things, Stark realising he is the man and then a funny scene at the end, after the credits, which is not that funny.<br/><br/>I have high hopes for Iron Man 4, though, as the villain can only be the biggest enemy of Starks: George R. R. Martin! Meanwhile, this film was weak."

","In a post-Avengers world, billionaire/genius/playboy/philanthropist Tony Stark is deeply troubled; the eye-opening events of New York City have left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and an obsessive, nearly uncontrollable urge to perfect his Iron Man technology. Not only does this put a strain on his blossoming relationship with Pepper Potts, it also makes him that much more vulnerable to his newest foe: The Mandarin, a wily terrorist whose reach knows no bounds. With his world slowly being torn apart, Stark must find it in himself to conquer his demons and put a stop to the latest threat. Much darker than its predecessors, both in story and in presentation, but the film's tone is a frustratingly uneven blend of broad comedy and deeply penetrating human drama. Not quite on target, but still entertaining thanks to a formidable cast, outstanding special effects, and high-octane action scenes that leave you on the edge of your seat. **½"

","After all the hype it's finally here. There have been suggestions that this was the conclusion to the trilogy which is Iron Man! If so you'll be left wanting more. This installment lacked the pace of the first 2 movies but never the less remained on course to be a hit. Tony Stark was up to his usual antics but the movie lacked the edge we are used to it felt like Stark was going through the motions with all too much ease. The twisting plot line wasn't so twisting and the action wasn't up to its usual manic best. Pretty decent performances all round but I can't say it was as good as 1 or 2! Maybe the change of director led to the lack umph who knows.

","Iron Man 3 by Shane Black is filled with entertainment. I really enjoyed this film, has good acting, action scenes, and dialogue, thanks to buddy Shane. This movie was focused on Iron Man proving that his genius is his superpower, and doesn't need to be inside that metal thing. This film has a lot of Iron man using his brains to get him out of situations. He created a new feature for his suit which he magnetizes the suit to himself. The plot is where this film isn't so great. Comic book fans may have been let down in this film because of the famous plot twist. I understand why fans may be angry, I personally didn't mind the twist, but I didn't think it was that well done either. In summary, lots of good stuff in this film, but the story could of used more intensity."
"bravelybravesirrobin","6","1","5","7 May 2013"," After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping and having anxiety attacks.
","The Iron Man series of films has a couple of key strengths that put it just ahead of other super hero movies: Robert Downey Junior, the character of Tony Stark and snarky banter. Robert Downey Junior is delightful to watch as Tony Stark quipping his way through life, cracking jokes and just generally being effortlessly cool. He's a lot more fun to be with than brooding tortured souls like Batman, Spider-Man or the Hulk.<br/><br/>The producers of the series know this too and so in the third installment of the franchise they give the audience exactly what we want, lots of Tony Stark being glib, making jokes and being charming. Bringing in Shane Black (writer of Lethal Weapon and director of Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang which is another Robert Downey Junior quip fest) was a great decision in this vein as the man knows how to delivery good banter.<br/><br/>But whilst the dialogue was always the best part of the previous films it wasn't the only aspect necessary to make Iron Man 1, 2 and the Avengers work. For all his glibness Tony Stark as a character has depth. He's a conflicted character using his bravado to mask real feelings of inadequacy, of losing control of his life and fear of death. <br/><br/>This film seems aware that it has to have a character arc for Tony Stark but it forgets to have one. It starts well. In fact the set-up is great. After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping, kept awake at night by nightmares of how he nearly died stopping the alien threat and haunted in the day by hallucinations and anxiety attacks. With his best weapon, his mind, seemingly fracturing two threats emerge. One a terrorist with unclear aims but seemingly immense power named the Mandarin, and the other a mistake from his past in the form of a biomechanical virus named Extremis. In short order Tony is stripped of his home, his supporting cast and even his Iron Man armour. Now the only tool he has left to fight back with is his mind, and he may be slowly losing that too.<br/><br/>That is a brilliant first act with just two problems.<br/><br/>Firstly that's the start of Iron Man 1 with Tony kidnapped and forced to use his wits to escape. Spoilers, he builds a suit of armour and kicks ass. Further spoilers, that does not happen in this film. <br/><br/>Secondly, and more importantly, all of that set up gets tossed away haphazardly in the second act. Tony gets a pep talk from a cute kid and suddenly decides, okay, no more PTSD. There isn't any pay off. It's like the film knows it has to get rid of that stuff so we can have our big fight in the third act but can't think of a satisfying way to do so, so it just drops it.<br/><br/>The psychological set up isn't the only thing that's jettisoned either. The most glaring example of this problem is the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic in the early scenes; a terrifying and enigmatic presence that literally interrupts the film to deliver ominous warnings of doom. He's tremendously scary and the audience is eager to learn more about him. Then the second act undercuts all of that with a reveal that, whilst hilarious, leaves a gaping hole where the antagonist should be. Guy Pearce's mad scientist character Aldrich Killian suddenly has to step in and be the bad guy but he doesn't have the charisma or the personality to carry it. That's no slight on Guy Pearce by the way it's a fault with the script. We just don't get enough time with Killian to care when he suddenly becomes the big bad.<br/><br/>The suit is another, similar, problem. At the start of the film Tony gets separated from his Iron Man armours and has to make do with a malfunctioning prototype. Now, unlike the other problematic aspects this one does build on the set-up. Tony has to use improvised weapons and his fast mouth to deal with physical threats until his armour is repaired. All of this builds up to Tony getting back in the suit and kicking righteous butt in the third act. And it does.<br/><br/>The problem is they then proceed to do it again, and again. Tony gets suit, loses suit, gets suit. In fact the final battle is literally Tony getting into one suit after another as each breaks down or gets destroyed in turn. I know that the aim is to literalise the theme of Tony having to rebuild himself but the effect is just one big cinematic cock tease. Your film is called Iron Man, a significant part of the appeal of your film is seeing the man in the robot suit hitting things; get to the money shot people!<br/><br/>Despite my complaints it's not a bad film by any means. I enjoyed it more than Iron Man 2 (which was a bloated overcrowded mess) and there's a lot to like. I loved the banter. I loved the multiple armour designs in the final fight. I loved the stunt with the people falling from the plane. I really, really loved Gary. It's just frustrating that there's one third of a truly great film here that gets sabotaged by its own plot twists.<br/><br/>Flawed but enjoyable. <br/><br/>Find out more about me and more film reviews at http://about.me/adamhalls"
"TheSquiss","8","1","5","7 May 2013"," Biff, bash, bang & plenty more. And what a villain in The Mandarin!
","I'm tempted to say Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise so far in this strand of the Marvel universe. While the 2008 original was thrilling and introduced the world to the mega-rich playboy Tony Stark and his creation perfectly, 2010's sequel floundered at times. With Shane Black taking over the helm from Jon Favreau, Iron Man is back with a punch and it's an absolute blast.<br/><br/>When Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) personal life is severely threatened and his home obliterated by a terrorist, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), it becomes personal. Iron Man 3 is not so much about saving America from another larger-than-life villain but about personal revenge. Stark finds himself out of his depth and needing to rely on instincts and the core of his knowledge rather than the excessively equipped laboratories and workshops. As he battles villainy that runs deep, the stress on his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his own panic attacks, Stark must face the truth of the real question that plagues him: Does the man maketh the suit or the suit maketh the man? <br/><br/>Iron Man 3 opens with a fun pre-history of Stark where we see what an arrogant fool he was. It serves as an easy introduction to principal guest characters Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) as well as a giving a wink to the fanboys and a nod to the previous two films. It sets the film up nicely as a romp with plenty of gadgets, effects, explosions and a broad smile. More than anything, Iron Man 3 is fun and, at times, very funny.<br/><br/>Black, directing only his second feature (after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), has co-written the screenplay with Drew Pearce and his own taste for fun and excess is stamped all the way through it. We see far more of what makes Stark tick; his foibles are laid out for us to mull over and, rather than making him seem weak, he becomes more approachable, more tangible, to us. Downey Jr. is on familiar ground but stretches more to give a fuller performance. There are no surprises but he is satisfyingly suave and cheekily engaging.<br/><br/>Black gives Paltrow more to play with in this third installment. Whereas she was previously consigned to forgettable girl on the arm, her Pepper has a more integral role in the film and, even more, a substantial effect on Stark's life and decisions. Here we see that she genuinely matters to him. She is fun, she cares and she isn't going to stand for any more of his bad behavior.<br/><br/>Hall, as old flame scientist Maya, is just there. She appears in Iron Man 3 and is effective but, a day later, her presence is barely memorable and she fades behind even the vocal performance of Paul Bettany as Jarvis, the computer with more human qualities and attitude than, well, Maya.<br/><br/>Pearce almost reprises his role as Peter Weyland (from Prometheus) but with perhaps a little more tongue in his cheek and a step towards Bond villain status. We have too little of him to really enjoy but his moments on the screen are enjoyable as he evolves from geek to super-brained scientist with a political agenda. Pearce moves easily from star to supporting actor and rarely phones in his performances as certain other stars seem to on 'easy mortgage payment' movies. He adds a welcome edge to a film that would otherwise be all about explosions and digital effects but never slows down the pace.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3, however, belongs to one man, and he doesn't wear a metal suit. When we first meet Kinsley's Mandarin it looks as though we're in for a king-sized dollop of ham, as the trailer testifies, that should have been consigned to the bin along with The Hood (No, don't try to defend Thunderbirds, it just won't cut it with me!). But as the film rolls on and his character unfolds, Kingsley provides the greatest moments in a thoroughly enjoyable romp and one is left to wonder whether Downey Jr. respects him for his portrayal as the villain or is severely miffed at having his film well and truly stolen from him. The Mandarin is as memorable a character from Sir Ben as Behrani, Don Logan and Itzhak Stern; and just look at these characters to understand the true versatility of one of the finest actors working on stage and screen today! <br/><br/>There are certain names that, when they appear on the screen, leave no room for ambiguity. We know what we're getting from Pixar, Disney, Aardman Animations. The same is true of Marvel and Stan Lee; we're in it for the action, for the spectacle, for the disposable entertainment that will biff, bash and bang. Iron Man 3 gives us all of that and plenty more and it doesn't need 3D to make it work. Having watched it in good old two dimensions, only one scene looks as though it would have been more complete with the third dimension and it was in there purely for the gimmickry. Iron Man 3 doesn't need those cheap tricks with the talent in front of and behind the camera.<br/><br/>The final text upon the screen declares that Tony Stark will return. Whether that will be in Iron Man 4 or just the touted The Avengers 2 remains to be seen. But if this is the end of Iron Man in his own right, what a way to bow out! Who knows what the future holds for the franchise? For now, let's just sit back and enjoy every moment of this fantastic, explosive ride.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"seanandfreddy","8","1","5","6 May 2013"," The best in the series and a sign of things to come
","Iron man 3 is the continuation of Tony Stark's story post Avengers. Here we see a different man, a changed man who now has frequent panic attacks and is less cocky and more self sacrificing. He now must deal with The Mandarin and uncover a deeper tale of intrigue and everlasting life.<br/><br/>Now an interesting thing about the movie is how fans are not happy, and while I understand, I don't agree. The film is a high actions roller-coaster with twists and turns, comedic relief and some dramatic moments. But fans are unhappy of the humor and the villain.<br/><br/>Regarding the humor, I think the film is better for it. It's still Iron man with it and it will make you laugh often, maybe a little too often but enough that it strikes a great balance in most scenes and doesn't take away from the drama (most of the time).<br/><br/>However the villain makes sense why fans are angry. It is a sudden reveal that he's just a Hollywood actor hired by Killian to play the role and while it makes sense in story terms, I believe it's too rushed and the actual villain of Killian is a lot less interesting than The Mandarin who had potential.<br/><br/>Overall Iron Man 3 is a great end to a trilogy with its ups and downs and promises big for The Avengers 2 and while the story has its issues, the action, the humor, the drama and the characters all make up for that giving a film thats worth re-watching despite its long length."
"jta6207","8","1","5","4 May 2013"," A Mechanic. A Twist. A Surgery.
","This movie is not perfect, but none are. It is very enjoyable though. I would like to add a few things before I start this review. I am a comic movie fan, I have always know about Iron Man and I would think 90% of comic book characters. Besides some of the Civil War storyline and some older Spiderman and X-Men comics I have not read many others. I did grow up with most of the Marvel TV shows that were on in the 90's though. I have seen most of the motion comics that have been made over the past few years. I did see Extremis so I knew the general storyline that was going into this movie. I honestly don't know why people get so upset that comic book movies don't follow the comic arcs that they are based on 100% how they were written. If you wanted something 100% the same as the comic arc why would you waste your money on a movie? The producers, writers and directors of these movies want to make the story their own based off of the base material the comics that are offered and make it their own story. The first Iron Man is the best in my opinion. From what I have seen on other reviews and the message boards this seems to be true for the most part. This movie is the second best in the trilogy in my opinion, hopefully though it will expand off of this and go into more SOLO Iron Man movies. I understand that at least Tony Stark will be in The Avengers 2 from the end credits of this movie. The movie opened in a way that was very different than the rest of the marvel movies of late. I personally like the Marvel logo with the pages fluttering but it's not a problem. It opened with a conference from back in 1999 on New Year's Eve that introduced Killian and Maya, as well as Happy with a nice 90's mullet. So in the first few minutes we are introduced to most of the key players of the movie, AIM, and the idea of Extremis. It was a very fast paced movie, a lot of what you see in the trailers happened in the first 30 minutes to an hour into the film. Yes there were some plot holes but no movie is without some. If you're going to see Iron Man to diagnose every little thing that is either not cannon with the comics, or not 100% scientifically accurate you are wasting you time. It's a story that been created from the comics for us to spend our money and enjoy. Or watch online like some people do which is not a good idea. The Twist did not bother me, they had a reasonable explanation for it, it wasn't terribly forced, and it was fairly simple. I have seen many reviews comparing it tooSPOILER AHEADBatman Begins. I can see the comparison but it is not really like Batman Begins completely. Yes it was the leader pretending to be someone else with someone else pretending to be the leader. The big difference being in Batman no one other than Batman knew who the leader was. Whereas in Iron Man, The Mandarin is out there for the public to see, know, and fear. The Mandarin was a product of the think tank that was AIM. It made sense when you thought about it, it was so simple anyone could understand and it helped move the story along. Getting to see all of the new suits is something that I think every fan of this series has been waiting for. I've personally wanted to see a Hulk-Buster suit. There were a lot of them that came at the end and he maybe wears five of them. But you never get to see what they can fully do or what makes them different from each other. One thing that I don't like that's not a huge problem is that fact that the War Machine suit was designed by Hammer in IM2 and the Iron Patriot by AIM in IM3. I also would've liked to have seen Hammer, known what was going on with him or something. He was an interesting, funny, bad guy, hopefully not forgotten in future films. I liked the end scene because I really loved the chemistry the two actors have in The Avengers and in Zodiac and in both movies there chemistry is completely different. I did feel though where Maya said Tony used to talk about space exploration and Guardians of the Galaxy is coming up that maybe the end scene should've been him flying into space. Or it could've been like the end of Iron Man 1 or 2 where they introduced the idea of the Avengers and Thor, So Wasp or Ant-Man would've made sense but the scene was fun and clever. Some things I would like to see added to the Marvel Universe would have to be Black Panther, War Machine/Iron Patriot standalone film(s), more SHIELDpossible Redford takeoverand definitely more Stark and Banner together as well as a Hulk movie with Ruffalo. I do feel like if this is the end as RDJ as Iron Man that Don Cheedle will either become Iron Man, be War Machine/Iron Patriot, or be a backup character. The surgery does not suggest that he is not Iron Man anymore, because somewhat alike to Batman, Iron Man is a symbol. As well as the fact that Rhodey, Pepper and a couple other people use suits without the reactors in THEM, but rather in the suit. So now he is no longer in danger but can rather chooses to stay Iron Man because HE IS Iron Man. Overall a very good movie, good action, a lot of comedy, very entertaining, making you want to see Thor, Captain America and The Avengers 2. Everyone can find something to love about this movie."
"robiisgod","8","1","5","4 May 2013"," A good Tony Stark movie
","I remember that after seeing the first trailer I was thrilled about the Mandarin and new suits. HOwever, after finally watching Iron Man 3, I was a bit confused.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong,it is a darn good movie, but I feel like some things were played out in a wrong way. In example, Mark 42 was supposed to be the most advanced suit of all. It was funny to watch all the glitches Tony had with that suit, but I was really disappointed how fragile the suits after Mark 7 became. In Avengers Mark 6 withstood a lightning attack from Thor, but here the suit is destroyed in an accident with a truck - c'mon on guys (it was funny, but stupid for Stark).<br/><br/>The main idea of movie being set a few months after the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions was neat.<br/><br/>Somehow, I am under the impression that this movie shouldn't have been called Iron Man 3, but Tony Stark - The Motion Picture. In my opinion, we see too much of Stark and too little of Iron Man. On the other hand, I was expecting to see more of Tony's tinkering around the suits, as in the first one when he was building his Mark 2 and its boosters and exteriors.<br/><br/>The take on Mandarin was new and surprising. However, I don't think the incarnation did justice to the character. I was expecting the Mandarin to be the true leader of the Ten Rings that kidnapped Stark in the first one, but no. I somehow hope that the real Mandarin will show up in later Iron Man or Avengers films.<br/><br/>The ending itself was great and unexpected, no matter what people say. Tony Stark will always be Iron man. But I somehow don't get the fact how Tony managed to cure Pepper. That should have been elaborated - did he upgrade the Extremis or what, and will he use it on himself in Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4? Who knows. However, Tony is a great tech maniac, not a chemist.<br/><br/>to conclude, I would give the movie 8/10"
"gregeichelberger","7","1","5","3 May 2013"," 'Iron Man 3': A worthy edition to close out the series
","""Iron Man 3"" closes out the Marvel Studios/Disney Pictures franchise in fine style, but still leaves some important logical questions, especially dealing with the upcoming sequels to other Marvel films as well as part two of the wildly successful ""The Avengers."" <br/><br/>Directed by Shane Black (a screenwriter of ""Predator,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""RoboCop"" fame; and the helmer of ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang""), who replaces Jon Favreau (who has a small role in this production), may be doing things by the numbers, but the effort is certainly far above the disappointing second installment, but falls below the classic original.<br/><br/>This time out, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr. who has come a long way since his debut in 1986's ""Back To School"") is having anxiety attacks and cannot sleep due to the stress of his superhero position, as well as the wear and tear on his body.<br/><br/>Having just saved the world - again - with the help of his Marvel cohorts, he finds himself dealing with more menaces, including an Osama bin-Laden-like villain, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley, who won an Academy Award for ""Gandhi"") and a scientist whom Stark humiliated years before, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce, ""LA Confidential,"" ""Prometheus"").<br/><br/>Killian, working with one of Stark's old girlfriends, Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall, ""The Town""), develops a DNA-altering drug which either causes takers to explode or become glowing, bright red atomic supermen. After each of these explosions, Mandarin somehow manages to hijack America's broadcasting capabilities to take credit and blame hapless Pres. Ellis (William Sadler, ""Trespass"") for the tragedies.<br/><br/>Stark, in an unwise fit of pique, boldly announces his address to the bad guy, a move that brings not only the world's media to his secluded ocean cliff domicile, but an air attack which devastates his home and leads to the capture of his significant other, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br/><br/>Taking a side trip to Tennessee to find out why a soldier blew himself and several other people to bits, Stark discovers (with the aid of moppet Harley, played by Ty Simpkins) things are not all that they seems to be.<br/><br/>He also finds out that the Mandarin is not all he seems to be, either, which leads to one of the few really funny scenes in the production (although the movie is peppered with snappy rejoinders and one-liners from the sardonic Stark).<br/><br/>Finally forced into a final confrontation to save not only Potts and the world, but himself, as well, Stark is compelled to call upon ally, the Iron Patriot (formerly War Machine, Don Cheadle), and a host of remote-controlled Iron Man suits.<br/><br/>These highly-charged action sequences may not be the most inventive ever put on screen, but certainly fit the bill for this closing segment. Not so special in the 3D department, the results are especially exhilarating and at once exasperating. Black's ability to overcome the lame bad guy (Mickey Rourke) in part two with two legitimate villains here (although, like previously written, there is a nice twist) makes ""Iron Man 3"" even more viable.<br/><br/>Playing Stark for the last time (persumably), Downey, Jr. (who has already collected two Oscar nominations for ""Chaplin"" and ""Tropic Thunder"") outdoes any of Black's morose, self-despising characters with his brooding introspection interrupted by bouts of sheer panic. Kingsley shines, as well, going from pure evil to various other emotions. Both performances are absolute joy and especially appreciated in an actioner like this.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there is the special effects, which like the last two films is supervised by Matt Aiken (""District 9,"" ""Avatar"" and ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"") and features faultless and seamless CGI which turns the evil army of Killian and the Mandarin's into frightening burning ember minions, while the Iron Men creations are wonderfully brilliant and detailed.<br/><br/>Also, be sure to look for the franchises trademarks: a quick, but hilarious cameo by character creator Stan Lee; and a great closing scene for those willing to sit through at least 10 minutes worth of credits.<br/><br/>Overall, while not as terrific as the first, it does return the series to its exciting and enticing roots and well worth a trip or two to the cinemaplex to absorb the entire experience."
"akik1259","7","1","5","3 May 2013"," Better than 2, about the same as 1
","I have never really been a big Iron Man fan, and I thought the first movie was just fine, and the second was very hit-and- miss, with more misses than hits. This movie was overall better than 2. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark with even more cool gadgets for his iron man suits. This movie takes place after the Avengers and there are a few flashbacks referencing it from Tony's PTSD.<br/><br/>The villain this time is the Mandarin, a violent world-threatening terrorist, played by Ben Kinglsey. Without giving too much away, he targets Tony and makes his life miserable. I actually though the Mandarin was a weak villain though. Some people may not like what they end up doing with him either. <br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle return as Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. War Machine returns and is also now called Iron Patriot. I liked both characters more in this movie than the other 2 and they have more important roles here. Pepper is in the first act, then disappears for a long time, then returns in the third act and I like what they did with her character. <br/><br/>The movie is the darkest in tone of the trilogy, because of how Tony's world falls apart around him, but there is still a lot of funny dialogue and banter between characters, like in the other 2. A lot of this movie concerns Tony Stark only, not Iron Man. But the good thing is that Tony is not a total jerk like in the previous movie, he actually has a heart and tries to connect with people and help save the day.<br/><br/>A few complaints I have are that the movie lags a bit in the middle, but not to a crawling pace. War Machine/Iron Patriot makes a few appearances but barely does anything. There are several plot twists in this movie, some I liked, some I didn't, like what they did with the Mandarin. The weapons that the Mandarin creates are completely unrealistic to me and seem like they belong in an entirely different movie. Also, he 3d was just OK, but not quite as good as I expected.<br/><br/>Overall the movie works. It's a good summer film (taking place at Christmas) and mostly delivers what it promises. If you liked the second one then you'll definitely like this one."
"dmurilloroman","8","1","5","3 May 2013"," An Appropriate Sendoff for the Iron Man
","Iron Man 3 stunned me with it's solid visuals and most of all the recreation of Tony Stark's persona, instead of just a ""millionare playboy,"" he has an emotionally involving background that makes you care and is still pretty snarly but he never gives off a negative vibe. Comedically, it is never overpowered or too weak there are really inventive bits with numerous minor characters being involved in most of it . Each character has their own ""moment"" such as Jon Favreau, who is a real treat throughout the entire intro. Out of the 3 films this one is ranked right in the middle, the first one was such a surprise that it could reinvent our view on superheroes while the second one completely wrecked Stark's character without a sufficient villain. I'm not going to spoil anything but the villain in this film, The Mandarin seems like one of the most menacing and original antagonists that I've seen in a Marvel film but it could have gone with a serious and still entertaining tone but it ended up going in a more comedic route that is not necessarily cheap but I would of personally preferred more maturity but nonetheless, the film was still satisfying. All of the performances are pretty standard and nothing you would not have expected. The film itself is extremely layered with intensity/risk as it progresses and has a really memorable scene involving a rescue in mid-air. In it's conclusion, it was not as rushed as most people say and it was filled with amazing action, some twists, and a really appropriate send off to this franchise even though the conclusion was not as climatic as The Dark Knight films."
"cattjones","8","1","5","3 May 2013"," Best One Yet
","When I was getting ready to go and see this film I looked it up and discovered that it was two plus hours long. I groaned, and hoped that there would not be a lot of fluff. To my pleasant surprise there was not. It was the first time in a long time, that I could not feel the time go by. There were a couple of surprises that I did not see coming, which made the film even more entertaining. I also liked the fact that the film made reference to what happened to the Avengers back in New York. It gives all the Marvel characters a sense of connectivity. I even saw the same connectivity in the Trailer for the next Thor, where Loki is locked up for what he had done. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) is true to form and brings with him his usual wit and humor. Ben Kingsley (The Mandarin) was brilliant as usual, but I had no idea that his range was so expansive and that he could play this type of role. I think that a lot of folks will be surprised. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) who is the mad scientist of the bunch, is one of the more creative villains ever created. The ""tug-at-your-heartstrings"" role went to Ty Simpkin (Harley Keener), who is quickly befriended by Tony as a mini partner in stopping the bad guys. Although Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) did not have a lot of screen time, her character made a definite impact on the outcome. Don Cheadle (James Rhodes) reprises his character very well, although he gets a bit of a make-over that is kind of cheesy. Director Shane Black has really made a name for himself behind the camera instead of in front of one. I have to say that I liked this Iron Man better than the previous films. I think it was because this film focused more on the man instead of the superhero. We get a chance to see Tony as a little vulnerable and that he has issues just like the rest of us. I did not see this film in 3D, but I could see where some of the action scenes would have been more explosive in that format. I have to say that I left the theater smiling because I thoroughly had a good time (you will too). I give this film a glaring green light."
"RichardSRussell-1","7","1","5","3 May 2013"," A Quintessential Smart-Aleck Summer Action Blockbuster
","Iron Man 3 (2:11, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) — fantasy: comics & pulps, biggie, sequel<br/><br/>OK, I'd like to write a full review of Iron Man 3, but there are lots of plot twists in it, and I couldn't get very far into a plot description before having to shut up about them. This story complexity enhances the overall experience for me, but it's still just a glorious action-packed comic-book romp at heart, and so it's kind of hard to take it ALL that seriously. Screenwriters Drew Pearce and Shane Black (who also directed) certainly don't do anything to discourage that attitude, either.<br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), depicted as unaccustomedly angst-ridden over Earth's near- miss in last summer's The Avengers, bookends the film with motormouth talk therapy about his inability to sleep and anxiety attacks. These beset him at plot-convenient points in the movie but otherwise are far from crippling when it really matters, certainly not interfering with snappy sarcastic lines at every opportunity.<br/><br/>The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is a suitably menacing bad guy in the Evil Emperor of the Universe mold, but he's not everything he appears to be. His main attributes are the ability to take control of all TV channels in America at once (something Rupert Murdoch would pay gigabux to acquire), a combination Burning Hands and Cure Serious Wounds spell, utter ruthlessness, and a flair for hammy theatrics. Again, not to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>In addition to his loyal and super-competent aides, the human Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the AI Jarvis (voice of Paul Bettany), Tony Stark may (or may not) be able to count on 2 figures from his past, who pitched innovative ideas at him during his devil-may-care playboy days when he was partying like it was 1999 (because it was): biological researcher Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and fellow inventor/entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They went on to succeed in their respective fields without the aid of Stark Industries, but they seem kind of taken with the idea of teaming up to save the world from malicious evildoers, since it got such good press in 2012.<br/><br/>If you follow pro football at all, you know that there's been a lot of concern over player concussions, even despite helmets. These happen either when a fast-moving player is stopped suddenly and the brain bangs into the inside of the skull, or when a relatively stationary skull takes a hard smack and whacks into the brain. Either way, even if the hard outer shell remains intact and unscathed, the vulnerable squishy parts inside take the damage and pay the price. This fundamental fact of physical biology is utterly, utterly ignored in Iron Man 3. As are many other laws of science. As if anyone really cares.<br/><br/>Did I mention Project Extremis? The White House plot? Iron Patriot? The many cameo appearances? The Exxon Valdez manque? The self-propelled armor elements? Harley, the cute little boy from Rose Hill, Tennessee, with the instincts of a future Tony Stark? Miss Elk Ridge? The rocket attack on not-at-all stately Stark Mansion? The chain-skydiving aerial rescue? Yeah, they managed to cram all that into the 2:11 running time, too. Man, you can see where they spent the money, and you sure get your OWN money's worth.<br/><br/>Imax totally worth it; 3-D (conversion) not, but you get the 3-D if you go with the Imax, so there you are."
"ssvikas","7","1","5","28 April 2013"," Not overwhelming but entertaining enough
","After Batman, Iron-Man is probably the coolest one among super-heroes not just because the suits and gadgets, but because of the attitude with which they carry on their tasks of being vigilantes. Incidentally, the films made on them in this decade have had intriguing villains and have been enormously successful and have been visually stunning. Super-heroes and all the swashbuckling action is here to stay!<br/><br/>In the third edition of 'Iron-Man', the focus is mostly on Tony Stark rather than the antics his suit can perform. It's more an effort to portray that Iron Man is more about him rather than the suit. To that extent, they have succeeded but, as a result, the movie seems rather bland as compared to the stylized effects we'd previously seen.<br/><br/>The film flashes back to Switzerland to the New Year's celebration at the turn of the Millennium where Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is busy hanging out with botanist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) that he ignores a crippled scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). An unexplained blast briefly disturbs their night; but this is soon forgotten. <br/><br/>Cut to present day, America seems to be haunted by a new villain who calls himself the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) claiming responsibility for blasts that seem to be occurring just about anywhere. And, a new version of Killian, now well built and suave approaches Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) at Stark Industries seeking a partnership to advance his genetic technology called Extremis, which she refuses. <br/><br/>A turn of events leads to Tony Stark challenging the Mandarin to a fight, at his home, to which the villain promptly responds by destroying it. Stark and Potts barely survive the attack and the former now seeks to get to the bottom of this. <br/><br/>Some spoilers; we are told that the genetically modified bodies heat up to three thousand degrees before blowing up. And while everything around them is vaporized, their clothes are only slightly tattered. Fire resistant clothing, huh? And there is no real clarity on what can actually destroy the genetically modified villains. <br/><br/>The most annoyingly boring scenes include those in Tennessee. Did Stark really have to go there? And what was so significant in that file that he tries to retrieve? And what was that precocious kid doing out there, all by himself! If at all an Indian film maker came up stuff like this, the audience and critics would have ripped it apart. <br/><br/>Putting this aside, the visuals effects are spectacular. If Iron-Man 2 sported a suit that comes out of a briefcase, Iron-Man 3 has a Mark 42 suit whose parts are programmed to remotely fly down towards him and get attached to Stark. Also in the movie is Colonel Rhodes' War Machine branded as Iron Patriot in Red-Blue-White. <br/><br/>The villain is menacing and makes Iron-Man's life difficult. He is not only physically strong but is also smart enough to be manipulative. Nothing more can be disclosed in a review without disclosing the details. Just one mention; since the villain is named the Mandarin, he is shown sporting Chinese tattoos and also breathes fire. <br/><br/>Acting performance is on par with the previous versions with Downey Jr, Paltrow and Don Cheadle reprising their roles. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley do well in their respective roles while Rebecca Hall didn't have enough screen time. Some info, Gwyneth Paltrow actually has six- pack abs. How cool is that!<br/><br/>The Verdict: Okay, granted that it has some failings and does get boring in parts; but the sheer star-power of Robert Downey Jr and some cool action keeps it alive. The post-credit scene also shows Stark meeting up with Dr Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk. Is an Avengers movie lined up? Never mind what's in the pipeline; watch 'Iron-Man 3'."
"raulgzayas","7","1","5","28 April 2013"," A good entertaining movie, but NOT the best of the series...
","OK... let me start by saying I personally watch movies for either two reasons: either to be entertained or to enjoy great acting and cinematography ( directing, photography, writing, etc), sometimes a movie get kudos on both aspects, sometimes, just on one, sometimes just fail miserably. Iron Man 3 is a movie to watch to be entertained... period. I am not expert of the superhero mythology, so I cannot have an opinion on that. The plot start at some point in time after the events where the Avengers save the world in NYC. Yes, there are some development on the character of Tony Stark.. that self-centered, egocentric, and eccentric billionaire that Mr Downey Jr. has played so well on the previous three movies ( including The Avengers), he will realize even when he is Iron Man, he's still human, so the lesson that he will learn is that being in the limelight does have a cost, and sometimes that cost might affect and even make you lose the people around you. I do think this is the movie of the series that have tried ( because not all are good) to exploit the joke element the most..I let you be the judged of that. I still do think that the first movie is the best. As for the villain? well, personally I think for entertaining purposes and my personal rating, that's exactly why this one does not rate better for me , and once again, personally, the worst of the villains Iron Man has faced so far...why? simple...they never explained the reason WHY he do it, plus a big disappointed for me when Tony finally faces The Mandarin. If you enjoyed the previous two, would you be disappointed on the third? Absolutely not, but you might step out of the theather sharing one of the more repeated commentary on all movie blockbuster sagas since Star Wars : ""It was good, but the first one is still the best for me""- Enjoy."

The first act of Iron Man 3 is fantastic it funny, smart, action packed and just works but sadly the second act arrives now that's start with the Mandarin Kingsley knocks it out of the park but they under used the character of much. One thing the Iron Man movies is humor and this doesn't fail with that this movie has a lot. Most of the acting is fantastic like Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Robert Downey Jr. as always and Ty Simpkins as Harley you will see this kid in more movies, but there are some average acting like Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen At the end the day Iron Man 3 is good movie but doesn't have the Iron Man feel from the first two but still is a good movie. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"metroidprime16","7","1","5","28 April 2013"," Not the best Iron Man movie yet, but enjoyable.
","Realistically, I give it a 6/10. It wasn't the best Iron Man movie to date. Optimistically, I would go to 7/10 due to the pretty unreal graphics and 3D animation overall. That was pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>Now, for the movie itself, I went to watch it with a few friends of mine and even though we really laughed, along with everybody else in the room, there was this big gap, as it was not satisfying enough.<br/><br/>Firstly, I would like to point out the fact that Tony Stark in this film, does almost nothing new and exciting. I mean, he is IRON MAN, give him an idea, give him and epiphany to build something! Something that is exciting and more 'badass' than his previous inventions. Give him something to show off, as well as to show Tony to invent/build something from scratch, like he did in Iron Man 2 with the new element, where they also didn't give us enough information.<br/><br/>Secondly, as I only have two main concerns for this movie, is about character development. Roughly speaking, what they implemented in this movie was the following: 'Here is the bad guy, take him on'. I was like 'Huh?'. The movie lacks character growth way too much. They just gave Iron Man a villain out of NOWHERE, literally, and told him to fight him. Where did this guy even come from? What's his background? Why does he fit in this movie? Any goal? Purpose? Even a plan? That would seem nice, really. And what about this 'Extremis' drug/virus concept? What does it even do specifically? From my point of view, ladies and gentlemen, all I got from that, is that they developed a new drug to turn humans into fire- breathing dragons. That's it. And the fact that they use their body heat to melt other objects and have a tremendous increase in physical strength? What does that even tell us?<br/><br/>Overall, there were too many gaps in this movie. They should allow the characters to develop more and give the audience a goal that the villain is trying to achieve, with a reason and an explanation for this 'Extremis' virus. Also, as I mentioned above, give something to Tony Stark to build. We all loved the fact that Iron Man/Tony Stark is a 'mechanic' but we didn't get to see him actually BUILD something exciting. Nevertheless, the humor was there and it was quite the humor, I got to say. The 3D animation was just...outstanding.<br/><br/>To conclude for now, I simply wish they stopped butchering films that could actually make the best movies in the recent years, in the way they did with Iron Man 3 and many others beforehand.<br/><br/>Rated: 7/10."

It is Iron Man's best fight and challenge yet! However, the new suit...it was too CGI. And it was so bright. It was too bright to even look at. The rest of the CGI was fine, though! What is actually quite new is that we actually get to see Tony Stark fight without his suit on many times! While I wanted to see more of him inside the suit, I loved the fact that we get to see him fight without it on, which is quite impressive. We also get to see Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow) fight a few times, which is also quite impressive.<br/><br/>We also get to meet nice new characters along the way. And they are all fitted in quite nicely.<br/><br/>However, there are so many mistakes and plot holes that it's too noticeable and laughable. I wont give them all away, for most of them are spoilers, but let's just say, people made out of fire, and their t-shirts and pants don't burn. You will notice them as you watch the movie.<br/><br/>But apart from that, it's a new (original) comic book movie and is definitely worth seeing. 7/10 By the way, the twist was great!

First the villain, They use some horrible jokes to undo the character played by Ben Kingsley, the film instead follows a different villain which is lame and not forgettable. The jokes are cringeworthy. The action scenes are not exciting. And worst of all, the plot doesn't fit at all into the rest of the MCU.<br/><br/>I suggest you skip Iron Man 3"
"jonwilliams1979","1","1","6","8 September 2013"," If I'd wanted to see a comedy film I would have watched The Hangover...
","How does this film have positive reviews??!?!?<br/><br/>Remember that moment in Terminator 3 when Arnie puts on the comedy sunglasses and you thought ""this movie's going to be a lot more stupid than the last two movies""? Well this whole film is full of meaningless comedy sequences put in there for cheap laughs. It seems that the director, Shane Black, is more comfortable with comedy than pacing an action movie and stringing a plot together. How Marvel let a guy that wrote Lethal Weapon 25ish years ago direct this film I'll never know. I can only assume that Jon Favreau wanted to take a break and just appear as a character, but this film is much the worse for his absence behind the cameras.<br/><br/>The Mandarin character is totally destroyed by Black. First he appears as an anti-America terrorist with Sir Ben Kingsley looking like he could be an Al-Qaeda leader but, confusingly, using a voice that sound distinctly American. Him turning out to be merely a comedy persona takes away any last chance that this film had of achieving any kind of greatness.<br/><br/>Other franchises like Superman, Batman and Spider-Man have all introduced stories where the main character loses their powers and Black tried to do this by destroying Tony Stark's home and workshop but, after a long struggle to repair his remaining suit, it turns out that he actually has an arsenal of Iron Man suits in another cellar. To make things even more ridiculous, Stark blows up all his suits at the end of the film for no apparent reason. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>This film should be deleted from the catalogue of Marvel and Robert Downey Junior. Hopefully it's not a sign of things to come from the franchise."
"brimatt2412","10","1","6","11 May 2013"," Very nice action combined with good humor and story
","This has become my favorite of the Iron Man movies. <br/><br/>I liked it because: Good story about Tony Stark himself. I loved that they made the character human enough to encounter struggles such as the post-traumatic stress after the encounter with Loki and the aliens in The Avengers. It made for a far more compelling character then if he was simply able to shrug everything else off like Superman - he would have been far less relatable. His interactions with the kid are interesting, especially in light of the revelations about Tony's own strained relationship with his father in Iron Man 2. Some complain about Tony Stark dominating the screen over the Iron Man character - I actually liked that. I found the Stark part of the character more compelling. His relationship with Pepper was also continued with a satisfying story arc as well.<br/><br/>The twist. Many didn't like this, particular the hard core comic book fans (I'm not a hard core fan, more like very light to casual, and it will likely remain that way). I loved the twist. I liked the storyline with Killian and his scheme and found it more interesting than where they had seemed to be going with Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. That being said, I do think both Guy Pearce and Kingsley both did fantastic jobs in their roles.<br/><br/>The humor. Again, there were those who complained about it, but their tastes are very different from mine. Personally, I choose not to be uptight about movies, especially in a fantastical genre as the superhero movie. The humor not only makes the movie enjoyable (and I am not going to watch a superhero movie with the intention of seeing The Godfather or Citizen Kane - no, I go those types of movies to be entertained, as do many of the movie-going audience), but the humor also makes everything seem more human/real as well. The humorous moments were very welcome (and also adds to the likability of the Tony Stark character and the cast in general.)<br/><br/>The cast. In addition to Robert Downey, Pearce and Kingsley, the rest of the cast are great. Don Cheadle is a welcome presence as Rhodey, Gwyneth Paltrow's chemistry is good with Downey and James Badge Dale is a menacing presence as a henchman.<br/><br/>To sum up, the movie is great if you like action,humor, and story and aren't caught up too much into a perception of how certain characters should play out. That was the case with me and I enjoyed the movie immensely."

To those who haven't seen the film here's what's in store for you:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>RDJ awesome as ever - but more importantly with better character development which makes you believe heroes aren't always able to cope with all their inner demons. Next; a story which strips down the armour and investigates what really makes Tony Stark. Great action sequences proving you don't need the avengers to bring out the best in Stark's technological abilities. <br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>I think they probably could've used war machine more.<br/><br/>There's no real explanation as to what the bad guy's power actually is.<br/><br/>The ending leaves a lot of questions which didn't necessarily have to be introduced.<br/><br/>And (don't worry I'm getting onto the Mandarin) Guy Pearce is a great actor; however he delivers a performance which is kind of a bit too evil which leaves no real room for character development.<br/><br/>OK then: The Mandarin - don't read any further for spoilers.<br/><br/>I agree they could've used and actor which the calibre of Ben Kingsley a bit better rather than making him out to be a sham. I agree that the extremis was a bit strange in terms of how it affected ironman's suits (could argue it's a totally different suit which is the reason why its so badly affected) BUT: you can't base the entire movie on the technicality that A. Killian and the mandarin are 2 different people and B. The iron patriot was Norman Osborn.<br/><br/>This is a film ADAPTATION. It doesn't have to be word perfect to it's origins. Take a look at game of thrones - best, most talked about show at the moment which isn't afraid to bend the material ever so slightly to produce a good product.<br/><br/>This was an iron man movie, an iron man movie which was SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN IRON MAN 2! <br/><br/>Good Action. Good story. Good hero, with the promise he'll be coming back as well.<br/><br/>I don't regret buying my ticket at all."
"Rajesh-Narayanan01","8","1","6","5 May 2013"," A great movie worth watching in 3D
","Plot: Even a great hero, faces his match sometimes. This was perhaps what the Iron Man was missing the most. That is until the Mandarin came along. Showing little emotion, Ben Kingsley emulates a terrorist to perfection. Places are bombed with no trace of the type of explosive device left behind. He challenges everything Iron Man stands for. Slowly midst all the chaos, a pattern seems to emerge in the way the chaos unfolds. In the end, Tony Stark issues an open challenge to the Mandarin to come and fight him face-to-face.<br/><br/>Tony is made to pay dearly for this. Mandarin's reach is beyond Tony's wildest expectation. He takes hit after hit. In a couple of moments the life and home of Tony Stark come crashing down. He is put in such a precarious situation that losing all his tech (including the Iron Man) is probably the last of his woes! Even with his long time pal Colonel James Rhodes trying to help him out, Stark cannot get out of sudden anxiety attacks. In the meanwhile, he befriends a little boy when trying to figure out how to tackle Mandarin.<br/><br/>With the world looking vulnerable once again, Mandarin pushes on. His target now includes the President of the United States. With no one around to stop, evil seems to spread in all directions. Can the man inside the suit muster courage and help salvage his pride, is what forms the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Effects: This movie is technically brilliant. The sight of Iron Man crouching on one leg ready to spring to action is simply exhilarating. Given the fact that we get to see almost an army of Iron Men, makes it all the more enjoyable. The sound effects keep the visuals at pace. At no point could I feel the effect was overdone.<br/><br/>There are a couple of scenes really worth mentioning. For example, the brilliant scene that is shown in the trailer where Stark's mansion is torn down, is even more brilliant in its full length. There was one more visual where Dr. Killian gives a demonstration of the live feed of his brain. The concept itself is cool and I somehow felt the visual was even more glorious to watch on large screen.<br/><br/>The action sequences, though not that many (sadly) were still worth waiting for. The climax is like a crescendo and makes worth watching on a big 3D screen.<br/><br/>Cast: There is no viable replacement for Robert Downey, in my opinion. So the producer's better pay up and retain him in any immediate sequence (Avengers sequences included)! This guy nails the character so well. Paltrow makes a fine girlfriend, but I felt there were a few scenes like the one where she meets Dr. Killian after years, when she under performed.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley fits in so well. The way in which he portrays a terrorist and a show man with élan is really unbelievable. He is the show-stealer in all the scenes; even when he shares the stage with the inimitable Mr. Downey Jr. Others like Cheadle, Pearce do justice to their role. However I felt the later was underutilized. Ty Simpkins probably acted a wee bit more sheepish than was required but I think that kind of felt good on the whole.<br/><br/>Direction: Shane Black has done decently in his first Iron Man flick. If the intention was to show more of Stark (the human) than just the gloss and glamor of the man in the armor then he certainly excelled.<br/><br/>I do have second thoughts on whether this kind of story will hold good in the future. People flock to cinemas to see superheros like Iron Man kick evil bosses butts. But the director kind of makes up in the climax.<br/><br/>There is also this humor portion of the script, which was kind of nicely handled. There were a handful of scenes which had the audience in splits. Especially the one where Tony (all tied up) awaits his suit when he is talking to a couple of bad guys. Overall, I feel the director has portions to improve, but there is no major flaw that is worth talking about.<br/><br/>Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-iron-man-3-2013"
"Mtoomb","9","1","6","4 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 - Brilliant Despite Its Flaws
","Only because I've seen SO many bad reviews on here am I compelled to write an unbiased review. I'm not an Iron Man comic fan, but I'm a huge fan of the film franchise and Robert Downey Jr. So any hang ups others have with the storyline, I don't care.<br/><br/>I can tell you that the script, the dialogue, and the Downey are brilliant. I'm giving away my old age when I say I had Lethal Weapon flashbacks through the entire movie. Iron Man 3 is truly a triumph for Shane Black, and I give him props for fighting back from the brink and coming through looking good! The plot is complicated and doesn't always seem like there is one, but that's only because Black is playing it close to the chest for the big twists toward the end.<br/><br/>Tony Stark can't sleep in the wake of the Avengers, and he's having trouble coming to grips with his most selfless act at the end of that movie. Basically, he's a selfish guy, we love him for it... And yet here he has gone and given his life to save humanity (it was pretty much a fluke he survived, so I'm giving him props too for going all the way with it). You'd be pretty messed up too if you were a super-rich playboy one day, a introspective entrepreneur the next, and then nearly killed by sacrificing yourself to save Earth the last.<br/><br/>This movie is all about personal demons. It says so from the start... And why wouldn't it be? Both Black and Downey probably share the same sponsor... These guys have been to hell and back... They know about demons. From the first frame Tony is fighting his demons, and since life has a funny way of knowing when you're struggling, events begin to unfold that have him questioning his very existence as Iron Man. Can he save the world and protect the woman he loves? Can he be a selfless protector and an OCD hermit crab at the same time? Can he move away from a past full of trampling over others to get to where he wants to be? I realize these are pretty big themes for a summer blockbuster, but Iron Man 3 isn't your every-day actioner. This isn't The Avengers. This is an intensely personal film that finalizes the 3-movie-arc of Tony Stark's transformation from what he was, into what he will be. For a solid hour in the middle of the movie he's not even in the suit. He's out solving a mystery, chasing leads, and chumming it up with a surrogate child/inner child in Tennessee. Throw in a maniacal terrorist, a power-hungry industrialist, and an army of T100-looking Extremis soldiers, and you've got yourself a summer movie! I would have like more exposition with Rebecca Hall's character and the background on Extremis, and I would've liked more of a fore-shadow than ""Mark 42"" but all in all I have very little complaints about this film. It's well acted, it's hilarious, the Air Force One scene alone is worth price of admission, and I bit my nails the entire movie. I don't know why everyone seems to hate it, and by everyone I mean the few thousand people that troll IMDb... But I loved it.<br/><br/>Every single choice the filmmakers had to do the same old thing, they chose something else. Just when you think cliché is about to happen, Black spins it. It's really fun to watch. Plus like I said before, if you're a Lethal Weapon fan you'll love this flick. There's a Christmas theme, snappy one-liners, a buddy-cop-flick feel, and even an Xmas tree lot! Come on, how can I be the only one catching this?? The finale even takes place on a BOAT! (I realize that's Lethal Weapon 2, but you're getting my drift here right?) Brilliant movie. Don't believe the negative hype. It's smartly made, smartly written, and I think when all of these haters watch it again they'll realized what they missed before and change their minds. Go summer 2013 movie season!"
"DUKEJBM","Null","1","6","4 May 2013"," Finally, A Brilliant Number Three Film!
","I had high expectations going in to this film and it managed to hit or exceed almost all of them. I simply loved that nothing held to any type of cliché. Nearly every interaction delivered something unexpected and fresh. Stark was shaken to his very core by the events of Avengers and further more by the events early in this film. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Tony Stark's struggles both external and especially internal. Choosing to focus on Tony out of the armor is a wonderful decision. RDJ is as brilliant as he's ever been as Stark. Fans of the books (of which I'm one) may complain about certain character translations but I really have no complaints. Flexibility has always been a Marvel strength over the years and I liked how they flexed and twisted certain ideas here. The thing they get so right from the books is the ingenuity of Tony Stark. He's so much more than a man in a metal suit. It's his brain and his wit that are the true weapons. This movie goes out of its way to illustrate that brilliantly.<br/><br/>The armored adventure scenes do thrill but are spaced by gritty old fashion action and a movie filled with a lot of heart and humor. Again, it was well played and I found it to be genuinely refreshing while bold all at the same time. No one can accuse them of playing it safe.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, the results were spotty. Pepper is given her due and Killian is an amazing villain. The rest of the supporting cast is barely seen and underutilized. Despite one very cool hero moment, Rhodey isn't fleshed out at all. I can't say much about The Mandarin. Overall, it's a well crafted, funny and refreshing number three film that wraps up the trilogy beautifully."
"heartinstone","9","1","6","4 May 2013"," Best Iron Man yet
","The wait is over. Iron Man is back and in full force, and it was the best Iron Man movie to date. With a new director (Favreau was Executive Producer but it was directed this time by Shane Black), Iron Man surprisingly didn't loose any of its shine or appeal, which seldom happens when franchises change Directors.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, and will always be Tony Stark. Some actors get stuck with a type cast role, but in a rare instance, there are those roles in which no one else could play. Who else could play the rich, egotistical, genius playboy character of Stark? Who else could deliver such humor that is so genuine to the role? No one, that's who. Without RDJ, Iron Man would never deliver such a phenomenon of comic book movies.<br/><br/>The script was perfect for this film. The funniest Iron Man in the trilogy, the humor combined with the most action in any Iron Man movie kept you laughing till your stomach hurt or got you on the edge of your seat. The production designs of the suits - all of them - are amazing. Every single actor on screen pulled their weight and the chemistry played perfectly. Also, there is a lot of mention of what happened in the Avengers, and the story focuses somewhat on how that has affected Tony.<br/><br/>There was one twist near the end, to which I will definitely not reveal. Now, this twist is either good or bad depending on what people were expecting. It is a creative direction I never thought would happen, and the surprise caught me off guard. I'm still not sure if I am disappointed, but in essence - I could see why they played it that way. I won't spoil it. I can't, because it's such a big twist that it's like telling you the end of the movie where Tony Stark dies.<br/><br/>(hahaha. just kidding).<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was definitely worth the wait. And don't forget, stay at the end of the credits!"
"mjbs007","9","1","6","4 May 2013"," A thrill ride,with non stop twist and turns what the fans need
","This is a film I've been longing for and it did indeed didn't disappoint. It is a thrill ride, with non stop twists and turns what the fans need. Marvel has once again hit the jackpot with stellar performances from the man himself RDJ and Sir Ben, as well as a rounded story directed superbly by Shane Black. The plot does tend to slip in places but this shouldn't stop the enjoyment of the film, if this is the beginning of Marvels Phase 2 then we are all in for one hell of a ride up to The Avengers 2. My only hope is Mr Downey signs a new deal soon because there is nobody else on the planet who can play Tony Stark, this is the part he was born to play and nobody can do it better."
"u_sims","9","1","6","4 May 2013"," Dividing opinions all over the board, my personal view on it was positive.
","Shane Black (director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and screenwriter of Lethal Weapon) replaces Jon Favreau at the helm of the third film in the Iron Man series. He also co-writes it with Drew Pearce. Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau and Paul Bettany return as Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, James Rhodes, Happy Hogan and the voice of JARVIS. The direct sequel to 2008's Iron Man and 2010's Iron Man 2, but also to The Avengers (2012.) It is the first in ""Phase 2"" of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. As ""Phase 1"" was the Iron Man films, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and The Avengers, ""Phase 2"" consists of this, Thor: The Dark World in November, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in April 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy in August of the same year and capped off with The Avengers 2 in May 2015.<br/><br/>In Iron Man 3, Tony has made Mark XLII (42) armour - to put this in perspective his suit last seen in The Avengers was Mark VII (7.) After a new threat, terrorist The Mandarin, plunges Stark's life into ruin, he must rebuild himself and face retribution as the stress attacks and nightmares which have haunted him since his experiences in New York (The Avengers) get worse and the question which has eternally bugged him is discovered - does the man make the suit or the suit the man?<br/><br/>As a huge fan of superhero films (DC over Marvel, Justice League not as good as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Trilogy over Iron Man Trilogy, Superman not as good as Iron Man, etc) i have been anticipating Iron Man 3 for months. Ever since the first tears I experienced when Tony's suits exploded in the first trailer, I have hoped it would be amazing. And I wasn't disappointed. While not reaching the standards of the first Iron Man, it is better than the 2010 sequel (although I don't hate Iron Man 2 like many others seem to.) So, the acting. As always, Robert Downey Jr utterly knocks it out of the park. Even as Iron Man 3 is more thoughtful and also deeper than the previous instalments, the witty, well-written script gives him plenty of room to be funny. Gwyneth Paltrow is, as always, a pretty terrible actor and annoying while Don Cheadle was hideously underused. Guy Pearce was interesting and I liked him, as were James Badge Dale and even Jon Favreau in their smaller roles. Oh, and of course Ben Kingsley is wonderful, but also underused in my opinion. Rebecca Hall wasn't brilliant; she seemed a bit useless and irritating. However, if child actors annoy you then you can still watch this as the annoying child (Ty Simpkins) was only annoying for the purpose of the film and is absolutely fine in his role. The script was, as I mentioned before, on the same level as The Avengers it was so great, while the action left me with a dreamy expression as a moment near the end was so ridiculously awesome that I had a broad grin. The score was good as well. There is a twist in the film which is the main reason for the split in opinions, however as I am not an avid reader of the comics I didn't mind the change in lore. I won't reveal this twist as I'd prefer to keep this review spoiler-free. So overall, I would say that it has many strong aspects and is a thoroughly enjoyable ride. But it isn't a 10 because I found it to drag and meander a bit in the second act and, as mentioned previously, some characters were underused and some actors weren't great. Also, the ending seems a bit rushed. Finally, I would just like to praise the film one more time. Without giving away too much, there is a good theme about the face of terrorism and the real people behind things. If you like good films, watch this but it isn't really the sort of film you just watch without really focusing properly - you need to be in an ""Iron Man 3 mood"" to be able to watch it!"
"bayisatool","4","1","6","4 May 2013"," Better than 2 but...
","while I enjoyed this movie more than Iron Man 2 it still left me with a dissatisfied feeling. The movie did have its strong points which were some entertaining action sequences and Robert Downey Jr. witty performance. Otherwise the movie was a disappointment. For starters my biggest complaint is that we don't see that much of Iron Man and when we do his suit is always running low on power or malfunctioning. Another issue I had is that the movie had useless characters who could have easily been written out of the movie or combined with another character to save on time. I also felt that the movie ran about 20-30 minutes too long. Another issue I have with the movie is if Iron Man can get thrashed around by Thor's Hammer and keep coming back for more; then why do his suits end up getting destroyed so easily in this movie? Also they bring up the fact that Tony suffers from PTSD but they don't really address it beyond bringing it up. Oh and why did Tony let the Mandarin's forces destroy his house when he had an entire army of iron man suits hidden that could have taken out the the handful of helicopters that were sent to attack him!? Overall it was still a fun ride even if the plot was like iron man's suit; barely functional."
"bigcatcareer","8","1","6","3 May 2013"," Entertaining and fun
","Lots of explosions as always but funny moments, sweet moments, action moments, doesn't take itself too seriously, fun and engaging and entertaining action flick. How does one write 10 lines of text without giving away the movie. Suffice it to say it is worth seeing at the movies and paying for it. So many movies are lackluster and not worth the price of a ticket - like the Avenger movies which were not as fun and easily forgettable. Iron 3 wrapped up the story line very nicely, although who's to say there won't be more - but it works as it is and was better than Iron 2. Here is one more line. Come on now don't be like that. I think this is enough. And I love RDJ, yum."
"tvdefrancesco","7","1","6","3 May 2013"," Don't listen to the Nerds
","This movie is not as bad as everyone is making it seem. Especially if you've never read the comic series. I like the fact that the director had this twist in there because it is most likely what is happening in the real world. ""A Target"" who is financed from the Underground. I thought it was pretty cool. Their powers were a little much, especially the breathing fire scene, but there powers were also pretty sick. Not to mention its a freaking comic book, there supposed to be over the top.. Tony's tinkering was awesome, some of the special effects were amazing. He's taken the suit to the next level, the dude shits gold. Some of the fight scenes were awesome, especially the one at the end. He's a complete dick to that kid, but he makes up for it at the end. I agree there are some holes in the story. But between the special effects, the innovation of Tony Stark and Marvel, this movie is worth seeing. It could have been better sure, but it is good none the less. In the Word's of Nick Swardson ""If people saw that movie 50 years ago they would have blown there head's off in the street."""
"creepyhoodedboy","8","1","6","3 May 2013"," I Think People Just Want To Hate This...
","As the third film in the franchise, It seems all the people reviewing this just want it to suck. I found it to be very enjoyable, but yes, a little different from its predecessors. Admittedly, there is less action during the first two thirds of the film, but the story keeps you engaged and anxious to see how it will all come together. I felt this film played more as a comic book than the other two films, and was slightly darker then one and two. People sometimes fail to realize changing the director can change the general feel of the film, which i admit, was the case here. To claim this was ""the worst comic book film ever"" is absolutely ridiculous, take a look at Ghost Rider 2 and get back to me. I will say, the 3D in this one wasn't very impressive, but aside from that i found it to be a great film, worthy of the franchise, with a small twist and a tremendous final sequence that makes up for the story-driven beginning. One word of advice, unless your a die hard Iron Man fan, I suggest skipping the ""Easter Egg"" after the credits. All in all, very enjoyable film that i will most defiantly see again. 8/10, well worth my money, but skip it in 3D and save the extra $2. ."
"diac228","8","1","6","3 May 2013"," Entertaining, Thrilling, but Quite Upsetting
","Iron Man 3 reminds me of the modern-day comic books that we are reading nowadays. Like the movie, the comics in this day and age are a good blend of entertaining, thought-provoking, controversial, and frustrating—while constantly screwing with the usual continuity of the comic book characters. With an action-comedy staple writing the script and directing the movie, this film is the ultimate evidence of what happens when you choose an accomplished staff (See: the infuriating Dark Knight Rises) over a lesser-known staff that is head over heels in love with the comic (See: The ever-pleasing Avengers).<br/><br/>This frustratingly fun movie follows Tony Stark as he starts to hit rock bottom following the events of The Avengers and a rising threat that is attempting to spread terror and fear amongst the Americans---as if the aliens that had invaded New York previously wasn't enough. As Stark starts developing anxiety and worry about protecting his precious Pepper Potts, the Mandarin shakes things up by directly starting a war against Iron Man. Written by Shane Black, the movie feels less comic and more like a serious action movie with heavy buddy cop qualities seen in his earlier work.<br/><br/>The two biggest gripes that the hardcore and the old-schoolers will experience while watching this is the very grounded plot that doesn't allow us to see Iron Man in much actual combat, and also the rather baffling portrayal of The Mandarin. Iron Man 3 feels like Dark Knight Rises in terms of character running time, as Bruce Wayne/Tony Stark has far more screen time than their alter-egos. Luckily, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Stark remains spot-on and absolutely brilliant---whether he is cracking jokes or cracking under pressure. His surprise partnership with a lonely 6-year-old was a nice added touch.<br/><br/>Then there's The Mandarin.<br/><br/>Oh boy.<br/><br/>His portrayal here is so different from the comics that it may create a worldwide depression amongst the most avid of Iron Man fans. Even with an exhilarating final sequence that involves more Iron Man action and carnage than you can handle, the potential disgustingly bitter taste of seeing the very unique and rather ho-hum take on Iron Man's greatest nemesis will remain on your tongue.<br/><br/>What the movie industry still hasn't fully figured out is that comic books are like video games---you need a truly, madly, deeply dedicated fan to translate the work into the big screen successfully and to the appeal of the masses. With comics and games the fans are more invested, more embedded in the culture than most other kinds of entertainment. This is why there has yet to actually be a good video game movie (although Scott Pilgrim and Wreck-It Ralph are good gamer cultured movies) and just a handful of good comic book films.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 will most definitely entertain with its great blend of action, comedy, heart, and a small hintage of suspense, I will give it a cinematic stamp of approval. The special effects was impressive, the direction and editing was crisp, and the entire cast did well with the script they were given. But forgiveness is a difficult thing, and I am not sure Shane Black and the Marvel staff will be forgiven for their---direction with the Iron Man franchise and brand."
"ed-421","8","1","6","3 May 2013"," Deus ex machina redux, but enjoyable
","Deus ex machina -- a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved. Within this movie, that happens many times with Iron Man suits. For tension-building, it's a relief during moments when the suits are not in play, and Tony Stark has to save himself. I thus found myself enjoying the non-suit scenes more.<br/><br/>""I loved you in Christmas Story."" For a cinema buff, there are many asides that I was enjoying, but that many seemed to miss. <br/><br/>I didn't expect it, but Ty Simpkins, playing a 12-year old, comes across as one of the most likable characters. Robert Downey / Tony Stark acts as a person well adept at politely brushing people off, and it all plays off very well, as various ""little boy"" clichés are built up then hilariously destroyed. <br/><br/>Small-scale destruction was done well, but I may be spoiled by some games that did it better, such as Uncharted 2&3. The fight scenes were well done, but I liked the action in such movies as Inception, Ghost Protocol, Dark Knight, Avengers, Incredibles, and even Wrong Trousers more.<br/><br/>The 3D/IMAX effects did not seem worth the extra $10 to me.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie a lot, and nothing nags at me. But all the scenes I'm remembering involve Ty Simpkins / Tony Stark."

","Hmmmm, not over happy with it. CGI is good but looks more like a film from a few year ago. Story is so so, its kind of meh! and the twists were OK apart from main one, that one made me laugh for a second or two the think WTF have they done. Acting is good, its more of what we have seen really. Humor is hit and miss, some very funny bits and some that miss the spot. 3D, its OK, nothing that makes you grip the seat. The main issue I have with it is that I don't think they sat down and watched past Iron Man stuff, because in this film the suits seem to be made of tin lol when you watch it you will see what I mean, the guy went toe to toe with Thor and yet....oh wait and see. There are lots of silly errors, most films have them but they spoil it when they standout so much (big cuts that the paramedics seem happy to leave untreated, and nor does the character seem to care) might seem silly to point them out but on such a big film there should be nothing that pulls you out of the film and make you think eg ""why does she"" As it is the film is good but it is easy to score it lower than the first 2, although 2 was not a patch on the 1st one either.

","Firstly I would like to say this movie is a great movie! Everything from Stark's house getting destroyed to his suits controlled by his hands in the fight to the death at the end. I want to say something very fast that the ""Mandarin"" wasn't what I expected. That's why this rating lost 2 points. I expected the Mandarin to have ""The ten rings"" which actually do something. I did not expect him to be some phony actor which was useless in the story. Since I have read the comics I was very disappointing because mandarin was my favorite villain in the ""Iron Man"" series. But I have to say I really like Robert Downy Jr. He is a phenomenal actor and he fits the role of iron man perfectly."
"pieginodino","Null","1","6","26 April 2013"," THE Movie Of The Year! A pure Home Run!
","I really did like Iron Man 2 but at times that film felt like they were finding their way and searching for a way to build towards the possibility of Avengers. It worked because they did indeed find their way and however Avengers managed to hit the screen it hit the screen in style! What's great about Iron Man 3 is that there's no looking forward and certainly no feeling of a stumbling or searching plot. The writers on this film made just exactly the right size sandbox for the whole story. Everything seen on screen has some meaning now or at some point later in this story arc. There is no intention to pay anything off down the line in some other film. It's a very well written movie where most everything speaks to an overall theme of some kind. There's also some fine humor mixed in as everyone comes to expect in these Marvel films.<br/><br/>It really is a masterfully crafted film. That's why I'm so impressed with this movie. You know they could have phoned it in after Avengers. Just give Iron Man some Transformers level CGI action-fest and sit back and count the box office receipts. That really is the very last thing they did. Iron Man 3 is a remarkable movie on every level and would actually be a stand out film with none of that great action. Fortunately, Iron Man 3 delivers story first but it's coupled with the best action of the series. Marvel really did learn a lot from Avengers and those other pre-Avengers films. The lessons learned pays off big.<br/><br/>I'm also do glad they didn't get overindulgent. It's back to Tony and Pepper and their supporting cast. That's how it should be and needed to be. This movie is Tony's journey (mentally and physically) from start to finish chasing the bad guy and what a bad guy it is!!! The Mandarin is exquisite and he draws Tony out to places that he's obviously never been before. They hit a home run at every turn with this one."

It was a good film battling deep dark undertones finally resolved in the finale of The Avengers. <br/><br/>The film centres on Tony Stark unable to relax and unwind after the mother of all battles in New York (Kind of like me I suppose) so he delves into his work, neglects the ever cardboard Pepper Potts and seems to spend the majority of the film wearing a suit which falls apart at the slightest tap. All topped off by a very annoying flashback scene to remove any plot holes that may arise by adding a super villain that Mr Man of Iron helped create (all be it adversely)<br/><br/>Cue ex-director turned chubby employee of Miss Potts Favreau. Determined to make a point to his pointless cameos he ends up getting himself blown up chasing after Guy Pearce's henchman.I can deal with that. Then this virus that is supposedly like a drug though that context is never fully explored or supported is turning unsuspecting users into walking bombs. Exploding at random killing countless people and I suppose if it wasn't for Favreau's excessive weight gain acting like a shock absorber he would also have met his maker. But he doesn't and tony actually shows more emotion for Chubby (sorry Happy) than the woman who apparently has just moved in....<br/><br/>Tony then send a message to the Mandarin played by the effortlessly brilliant Sir Ben Kingsley (I will get to this character shortly). The message? Please come to my house here's my address I clearly don't care about my life or Pepper's. Needless to say he reacts and blows Stark's pad to the bottom of the ocean, Stark along with it, not before we are treated to a very nice, short lived scene of a suited up Pepper Potts. <br/><br/>What comes next is nice, a scene of a powerless, suit-less Tony Stark, stranded miles away from home (nothing 2 seconds of screen time in an Audi r8 cant fix) befriending a small child, whom I suppose is meant to represent Tony as a child. Some pretty awesome fights with the regenerating Extremis junkies that work for the Mandarin and after this little kid has fixed the Iron Man suit, Tony gets the location of this Mandarin.....with 1 hour still left to go.... <br/><br/>No, we are not treated to a Batman/Bane scenario what we are subjected to is the worst, most insulting plot twist of any film since Tom Cruise's brat of a lad showed up at the end of war of the worlds in one piece. The Mandarin, Iron Mans arch nemesis, his most formidable foe from the comic universe, feared and admired by fans for years, is portrayed as a homeless, alcoholic, failed actor. The whole character of the Mandarin and his Ten Rings is just discarded, used as a diversion for Guy Pearce's own terrorist ways. Created as a Scapegoat for all the destruction being done to America. At this point i felt I had two options, either walk out or forget the Mandarin was ever mentioned and just go with the flow. <br/><br/>I stuck it out. And I did enjoy it. The story seemed to move too fast but worked. <br/><br/>After Hijacking the Iron Patriot Armour and infiltrating air force one and kidnapping the President Pearce also kidnapped Pepper Potts with the help of a former one night stand/scientific interest of Tony Stark. Injecting Pepper with Extremis and Stringing up the President ready to be executed live on T.V. Pearce lures Downey Jr to his supposed death. But wait, Tony has 50 suits fly in to assist Rhodes and himself, or just fly around and do all the fighting themselves. I think out of the entire movie Tony Spends about 20-25 minutes actually in is suit. The rest of the time its JARVIS dishing the punishment. <br/><br/>After failing to catch Pepper Potts (does he really want to be with her??) 200 feet into fire laden ground Tony gets all vengeful and jumps from suit to suit (after they keep getting tapped and falling apart) in battle with Killian (Pearce) finally trapping him in one of his Iron Man Suits ( I think the writers Expected us to forget about the fact that Stark makes a huge point of saying that the suits are only coded to his DNA, never-mind) and then detonating it. <br/><br/>Somehow safely on the ground Stark is again confronted by Killian but up pops Potts fighting fit who, half suited, blows him into a million tiny pieces thus saving the day. The rest of the film somewhat confirms rumours that there will be no more Iron Man. Tony has his heart fixed and his mini arc Reactor removed and and destroys ALL of his suits.<br/><br/>As a movie and a sequel its a brilliant film, as a homage to Iron Man its disappointing hence the 7 stars."
"OverLordGoldDragon","10","1","7","11 May 2013"," Better than The Avengers & Avatar
","This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. It's the movie with Iron Man (Tony Stark) is at his best. He's forced to think like a genius throughout the movie in order to keep himself alive. The way he does it is amazing. As for all the other actors, they did a great job in their roles, especially the Iron Man's robot helper. It was always something that Iron Man could talk to. Throughout the entire movie I was deeply inside the world of Iron Man. After the movie I was still in it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Overall, the movie was beyond what my words can describe. It's a MUST SEE for any smart individual that's out there. You won't regret it."
"Pumpkin_Man","7","1","7","6 May 2013"," A Fresh New Take on the 'Iron Man' Franchise!!!
","I understand that this movie messed up The Mandarin character and a lot of comic book fans are mad, but I really enjoyed this new film. Shane Black gives us a dark and comedic new tale in the life of Tony Stark. I thought this new film was much better than Iron Man 2. I love that it takes place around the Christmas holiday. I love the references to 'The Avengers' After almost dying in The Avengers, Tony Stark has been having panic attacks and nightmares. When Happy Hogan is injured during a Mandarin terrorist attack, Tony takes it upon himself to bring The Mandarin to justice. When his house is destroyed, JARVIS sends Tony to rural Tennessee where a Mandarin bombing happened. I loved the comedic one-liners and the witty banter between Tony and a 10-year old boy named Harley. If you love the Iron Man series, you'll love IRON MAN 3!!!"
"cat_ranchero","8","1","7","5 May 2013"," A fitting end to the trilogy...
","A very well made film with the kind of top-notch special effects as we've come to expect from these guys. I'm not going to get into the 2D vs. 3D debate but I have to say I did watch it in 2D and I can't really see how 3D would have improved it. All the performances were excellent as usual with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow taking top plaudits (for me anyway). I also have to mention the young Ty Simpkins who plays a kid, Harley Keener, who befriends Tony when he's 'dead'. He played his part very well and we can only hope it leads to bigger things for the young man. I did enjoy this one though despite a rather complicated plot and the usual over-the-top fight sequence towards the end it's definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

"ferguson-6","7","1","7","5 May 2013"," The Prodigal Returns
","Greetings again from the darkness. My initial reaction upon seeing this opening day was that some fan boys are not going to be happy. Of course, this happens every time Hollywood makes changes to the original comic book material in hopes of attracting massive box office numbers. While I recognize many of the ""flaws"", I found this to be an interesting turn on the Tony Stark/Iron Man series.<br/><br/>Shane Black was brought in to direct and help write the script. Mr. Black is best known for his crackling buddy dialogue in movies like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also with Robert Downey Jr), but doesn't have significant directorial experience (his most recent effort was KKBB 5 years ago). My belief has always been that what sets this franchise apart is Robert Downey Jr's take on Tony Stark. A wise-cracking billionaire playboy technology and mechanical genius searching for his true identity. Mr. Black re-focuses the story on Stark. In fact, he basically takes everything away and has him start over.<br/><br/>Regardless of the story, many line up for these movies to see the special effects and the bad guys. The special effects are everywhere ... and loud ... and massive. The trailer shows a clip of Stark's Malibu mansion being destroyed, but the entire segment is quite impressive. The number of Iron Man suits seems unlimited at times and the big finale gave me the same feeling of a 4th of July fireworks display when it ends with so many clumps of fireworks being fired at once, that the impact is dulled. As for the bad guys, The Mandarin is one of the most fierce opponents faced by Iron Man in the comics. His portrayal here by Ben Kingsley is a blast to watch, but will undoubtedly upset the true fanboys. Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a demented mastermind, once snubbed by Stark - in a scene we witness in flashback.<br/><br/>My preference here is to focus on the fun elements since that's clearly what Marvel and Black are shooting for. Jon Favreau directed the first two entries in the franchise and here takes on a slightly bigger role as head of security for the Stark corporation ... and he provides some comic relief. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally gets to do more than roll her eyes, but she still has her damsel in distress moments. Don Cheadle returns as Col. Rhodes ... or War Machine ... now known as Iron Patriot, but mostly he is just waiting for his own movie. Rebecca Hall has some screen time as a smart woman who is not so wise in her choosing of partners. No comment. Ty Simpkins plays Harley, a country boy who helps Stark in his time of need. James Badge Dale, Miguel Ferrer, William Sadler, and Dale Dickey all have strong moments, but therein lies what may be the film's biggest weakness.<br/><br/>It's an incredibly impressive film to watch ... giant visuals, really good actors and quick, witty dialogue. But there seems to be an overload of each of these things. Guy Pearce's character is woefully underdeveloped. I so wanted more of his backstory and motivation. Same with Harley, the boy. Much could have been done with that. Miguel Ferrer, always a worthy opponent, must have had his best scenes left in editing. The scene with Ben Kingsley, Don Cheadle and Robert Downey Jr, may have been the best in the movie simply because we got a real peak at each of these character's personality. That's way more fun that another explosion! <br/><br/>The film pummels us with action, probably has too much Tony Stark and too little Iron Man for the fanboys, throws in a hard-to-swallow sub-plot regarding Anxiety issues for Stark, and underutilizes Guy Pearce in what could have been a world class evil doer. Still, despite all of that, it's fun to watch and Robert Downey Jr will always be Iron Man!"
"ryan-craven-528-410093","7","1","7","2 May 2013"," Fresh, thrilling and surprising, IM3 is NOT the disaster users are saying it is...
","It's Christmas. Tony Stark, the self proclaimed playboy, billionaire, philanthropist is in somewhat of a rut after the monumental events of The Avengers. He can't sleep, and when he does has haunting flashbacks of that day in Manhattan. What's worse, a new terrorist called The Mandarin emerges and induces more country spread panic for the Americans, whilst Aldrich Killian comes back for a spot of oneupmanship, with his new invention, the Extremis serum. <br/><br/>The creative journey taken by Black and Marvel with Stark is a smart one. In stripping back the armour (literally), they have not only rid the franchise of Iron Man 2's flaws, but also brought the focus well and truly back in their most powerful of weapons: Robert Downey Jr. Whereas in Iron Man 2 a certain complacency was evident in his performance, Downey completely eradicates that with an honest, vulnerable and achingly human performance, with his trademark wit and sarcasm very much present and correct. <br/><br/>His seemingly new found energy and drive for the franchise is compounded by the terrific supporting cast. Gyneth Paltrow once again proves a welcome presence, and her natural chemistry with Downey is made all the more shiny by the superb script; the actors here get the best dialogue to deliver of the whole franchise, and it is obvious the difference it has made. Ben Kingsley, in the trickiest role, proves very successful, with his menacing and surprising turn proving to be one of the major rewards of the film (and THAT twist will be a talking point for years to come. Off the record, I absolutely adored it.) Of the newcomers, though, it is Guy Pearce who makes the biggest impact, with a charismatic, threatening and wholly satisfying performance as Aldrich Killian, head honcho of think tank AIM. Don Cheadle seems to have settled in his much more defined and driven role of Rhodes, now with him being the straight Glover to Downey's Gibson, a genius decision from Black. <br/><br/>The most impressive thing at play here is balance. Writers Black and Pearce have created a sharp, witty and quite frankly hilarious script that feels fresh and original. They have brought back the off beat energy irreverent tone that made the first one such a blast. Gone are the plodding and leaden sub plots of the first sequel, and in comes a masterfully constructed rug pulling narrative; the perfect foundation to build on Marvel's most frivolous and entertaining character. Not only this, but IM3 marks the evolution of Marvel from a risk assessing, cautious world builder to a brash and brilliant risk taker. It seems in every sense that Marvel and Black have embraced and embodied the very attitude of Tony Stark. A welcome playfulness is present in Black's script writing; a mid act introduction of a child being the most convention-smashingly inspired, allowing Downey to show his remarkably adaptable and chameleon like range. He is able, in a blink of an eye, to go from vulnerable to lip-smackingly confident. Don't be concerned, Black avoids cliché with some brilliantly judged moments in this mid-act tone changer (on child revealing his abandonment, 'Dads leave, quit being such a pussy about it'). The emotion is never a sacrifice for the gags though, with the threat of The Mandarin and the vulnerability of Stark being ever present and constantly reminded of, even if at times the film runs the risk of being too gleefully irreverent. The script's accomplished smarts don't stop there, with Pearce and Black also managing to play on the damsel in distress plot device (is Pepper the saved or in fact the savior?), whilst also providing wholly satisfying and engaging arcs for its characters. Inevitably, though, the journey of Tony is the most thematically and emotionally satisfying, possibly of the whole Marvel canon.<br/><br/>A recurring criticism of both IM and IM2 was the uninspiring and repetitive action, with IM2 being undoubtedly the biggest offender. Simply put, two dudes in varying types of suits fighting each other isn't very interesting, nor is watching Iron Man kill hundreds of clone robots with one single swivel at all thrilling. IM3 solves this problem with aplomb, and then some. This is in no small part down to the ingenious use of Stark's mark 42, which can, on command, send its components flying onto Stark's body, allowing for hilarious slapstick and some genuinely tense set pieces. In fact, every action sequence in IM3 hits the spot; highlights being a Tom Clancy-esque action ballet executed flawlessly by an out of suit Stark, or the thrilling climax, which makes brilliant use of Tony's over-zealous amount of suits whilst offering further surprises and heart in the mouth moments. Iron Man 3 succeeds in all counts, meaning that we are left pining for Downey to sign another contract already. Oh, and be sure to stay for the hilarious post credits sequence."

I thought the twist for the villain worked well, could they have done something different with it?...of course, but you'll never make everyone happy.

","Another Superhero movie who is trying hard to catch top listing like the Batman, Spiderman, Hulk, Superman etc. But what prevents from it is the making. Though apart from the Nolan's series of Batman even the same masked Bruce Wayne is a superhero who performs unbelievable things (may be thats why they are superheros)<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, I just wonder if the script had enough depth in it. Characters like Pepper could have been done better. May be a bad choice of actor. The expectation on Mandarin is kept the movie going with the presence of a great actor. But it too went nothing when we saw Guy was the original brain behind it. <br/><br/>Now coming to the best part of the film, The graphics and stunts. It has been the best part like I said, because of the commitment of all the artist. But still once again another movie with a climax in a port and earth movers. <br/><br/>At the bottomline, Iron Man remains a Superhero. He will never become a legend like the Nolan's Batman."
"joechar4444","Null","1","7","28 April 2013"," Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains.
","Bringing comic book adaptations to life on screen seems to be a difficult balance for anyone that's not Marvel it would seem. Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels. There's the ""hit you over the head"" type humor and then there's the drier, sarcastic comedy that Robert Downey was born to deliver. Everything meshes here for one of the better film going experiences of the year."
"Nordved","7","1","7","28 April 2013"," Iron Man is back
","The third installment in the Iron Man franchise is an entertaining movie like the first two, however i think of it as being a little dull when compared to the first two. The storyline is great, and actually a bit more interesting than others among these marvel superhero movies. Yet, it's ability to draw excitement is a bit watered down by the lack of Iron Man actually using his skills and the constant precense of jokes. Don't get me wrong - the jokes are good, and the movie itself is very laughable. Nevertheless, its hard to take a movie that is meant to thrill you seriously when much of is taken a sort of ironic distance to. It's as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. But I must admit, that i did indeed like this movie and I can't help admiring every minute of Robert Downey Jr. playing this lovable asshole. Not to mention Guy Pearce's excellent acting as the total, yet tragic asshole. When it all comes down this movie is not the most thrilling experience, but it has good humour and some redeeming action scenes and actors. I would have given it a 7/10 but i am so much of an Iron Man fan that i can't help it but give this movie an 8/10. So if you're a marvel/superhero fan you will still love this movie despite it's flaws."
"martem6","8","1","7","27 April 2013"," Iron Man 3
","Compared to the previous other two Iron Man films, this third installment to the franchise truly lived up to the hype. The story begins with an obsessive Tony Stark constantly creating a variety of new amour's and being traumatized after the events of The Avengers. Stark also have to deal with a homicidal maniac who goes by the name The Mandarin. With great pacing and a straight-forward plot, this film had many aspects which supported it. Robert Downey Jr and Guy Pierce both displayed tremendous acting and brought the Iron Man story to a thrilling and meaningful conclusion. This film was arguably the longest within the saga as well as the darkest, by looking at other reviews from viewers, it highly lacked humor, however it was still capable of achieving the greatest Iron Man installment with it's cracking action and moderate humor."

","Honestly i was always kind of fan of iron man movies,and expected quite a lot than what i have seen today, movie was alright to be honest but the thing kinda ruin it a little is this that , its quite long and also if the main villain was Mandarin the old one then that would have been better i would say, but in the end they he made him to be appeared as just an actor which kinda stupid , in the trailers he looked really good, and the again the main actress she falls down in the climax but then again survives out of no where which is quite childishly joke seemed to me, still liked that movie would actually rate it 7 out of 10. then again lets go back to the bit where iron man as in tony stark calls up all his other robots or i would say his suits, them were more or less like abandoned after his house were completely destroyed by the madarin, they come out of no where as well out of blue. i don't know why but i do feel like would have been better if i went to watch evil dead.:/"
"jdkraus","9","1","8","5 May 2013"," A great start for the 2013 Blockbuster Season
","May is the starting month for summer blockbusters. ""Iron Man 3"" is the first one for this season and it does not let down. Rather than being a tie in to the other ""Iron Man"" films and ""The Avengers,"" this Iron Man stands out completely on its own in merit. To summarize the overall plot of the new Iron Man, it is basically about the champ down on his luck who needs a comeback. Tony Stark's new nemesis is a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin, played in an out-of-character role by Ben Kingsley. After obliterating Stark's home and crippling his iron suits, Stark is forced on his own to survive and try to figure out a way to thwart the enemy's plans. We expect Stark to win and we know he willhe's Iron Man after all. Nevertheless, we want to see how he will triumph over his foes. A frequently overused plot device, it still somehow works and makes an intriguing movie. <br/><br/>Things are often predictable (as in most superhero flicks), but there are also some nice surprises. I thank Shane Black for his contribution as both writer and director for the movie. Jon Favreau is still in the picture as producer and Stark's trusting bodyguard Happy Hogan. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow reprise their roles as Colonel Rhodes and Pepper Potts. Paltrow particularly breaks the norm from the typical damsel in distress and makes a stand with a fiery intensity. Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall step in as new characters, and both seem to be just having fun with their roles (perhaps too much in some scenes). <br/><br/>The film moves at a steady pace. The action and humor is abundant. The VFX is meticulously impressive. The characters are solid. There is nothing more I can ask for in the big budget Super hero flick. ""Iron Man 3"" kicks off the summer season so far with a smashing success. I hope that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" does as well later this month."
"jdesando","Null","1","8","5 May 2013"," Smart, sassy, and stylish.
","""I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, occasionally save the world. So why can't I sleep?"" <br/><br/>You can't sleep because writer/director Shane Black has made you this third time around the most interesting superhero since Superman flew onto the comic book scene. Played by the snarky, sardonic, witty, and conflicted Robert Downey Jr., billionaire Tony Stark, weapons maker and new-age hero, faces a terrorist menace named Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), whose likeness to Osama bin Laden is not a coincidence, and his accomplice, Aldrich Killian ( a memorably menacing Guy Pearce). In the end, however, the greatest antagonist for the insouciant hero is himself, who can't sleep so consumed is he by the contradictions of his heroic mission.<br/><br/>The thriller tropes are all there, but Black has decided to use his writing experience for Lethal Weapon and obvious familiarity with old film comedies to enhance the repartee among the principle players, including Stark's love and assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and War Machine rival, Colonel James Rhodes (Con Cheadle). Yet more memorable than these talented vets is Ty Simpkins playing Harley Keener, a bright little boy who helps Stark, not just with electronics but also dialogue smart and fast reminiscent of the vintage screwball comedies.<br/><br/>Although Stark is a fast-moving one line organ (As he suits up: ""You know, it's moments like these when I realize how much of a superhero I am.""), when he's with the above-mentioned characters, especially Harley, the humor is as fast as the ubiquitous missiles and subtly laden with thematic weight. The emphasis on witty dialogue made the difference for me between a good thriller and a great one.<br/><br/>Because by my count this is the fourth movie in a few months to center its action on endangering the president of the US (Olympus Has Fallen, GI Joe, and the upcoming White House Down are the other 3), I see a concern underneath our pop culture for the safety of our open society symbolized by the vulnerable president. While in general I am impatient with many film deaths and explosions, I am intrigued by how we can accept so much terrorism on screen, from 9/11 through Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Perhaps these escapist entertainments help purge our fears by showing everything landing right for the country, its leaders, and its audience. If that's too heavy for you, then see this film just to enjoy its state-of-the-art graphics, talented actors, and resolutions that will not leave you indifferent to the will of the American people to overcome their fears: ""The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself!""

","Big fan of the Marvel Film Franchise, they're doing excellent work and it seems like Phase 2 is all about "" Let's try something new"" and fresh out of the gate we have Ironman 3. The good thing I think everybody can agree on is this is a movie that can be taken seriously and is much more mature then the other Ironman films, in a good way. I've seen several spoiler filled reviews so people can talk about what they liked didn't like.<br/><br/>Here's how I'll put it. If you don't think you'll like it you won't simple as that. This will not be the movie that will change your mind, catch it on Redbox. This is the big deciding factor on if you will like this movie or not. Are you willing to unbiasedly watch a movie, putting away all previous expectations from trailers, earlier movies, and comic book lore, and enjoy it on it's own merit. If yes then this is a great Ironman movie. It's almost more of a Bourne / Tom Clancy movie then an Ironman movie. Which is great everybody complained about there not being enough tension or Avengers being a kids movie. Here you go, most tension I've felt in a superhero movie while still having fun and laughing.<br/><br/>But as I said, admittedly the marketing for this movie completely mis sold it and I cannot begrudge anybody for being disappointed.

"DubhDoo","7","1","8","2 May 2013"," Tony Stark returns in the best 'Iron Man' yet
","Following a film like 'The Avengers' for is no easy feat for even one of the most successful film franchises around today. After becoming the biggest box office smash of 2012 (taking over a billion in little more than a week) and garnering unanimously positive reviews, it was undeniable that 'The Avengers' successor would come with high expectations, as not only is 'Iron Man 3' following 'The Avengers', but it also marks the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase One and the beginning of the series' Phase Two. <br/><br/>After the disappointingly flat 'Iron Man 2', Jon Favreau left the chair (while keeping his acting role as Happy Hogan) and passed it on to 'Lethal Weapon' scribe Shane Black. Any doubts of Iron Man continuing on the poor quality of the first sequel swiftly exit the premises, because it is clear - that like Joss Whedon – Shane Black has expertly taken the source material in his hands and placed a big personal stamp all over it. Of course this means that we are treated to a cracking script that brims with sparkling one-liners that feature some great references to everything from Croydon to 'Downtown Abbey'), but there is also a real sense of human depth and development to the characters more than ever before. And being a Shane Black film, it is set at Christmas. <br/><br/>'Iron Man 3' finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) experiencing PTSD after the events in ""New York"" at the end of 'The Avengers'; he is paranoid, suffering from insomnia and anxiety attacks. However, when a Middle-Eastern terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) issues multiple assaults on the US, Tony vows that he will face him...<br/><br/>It's no great secret that Robert Downey Jr's ever-great turn as Tony Stark is one of the greatest assets in Marvel's arsenal, so it is unsurprising that many of this film's high points are when Stark is out of the suit. After having worked with Black on his directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', it is clear to see that he and Downey Jr. form a great team; Black's knack for sharp dialogue is perfectly suited to the actor and works to laugh-out-loud effect in some scenes. The other actors are also given more to do than in previous installments, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow's as Stark's beau Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes, who forms a double-act with Stark that's not entirely dissimilar to Riggs and Murtaugh.<br/><br/>While Black has written scripts for nearly thirty years (becoming Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter at one point), this is only his second film as director, so it's a pleasant surprise that the action sequences are so well-directed conceived and directed, comparatively better than any other in the trilogy so far. A stunning first-act assault on Stark's home and a near breathtaking plane set piece are real standouts. Unfortunately, the final reel's battle, while well-staged, falls somewhat flat.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'Iron Man 3' is – while not as good as last year's biggest hitter – arguably the best solo outing for Tony Stark. It's consistently funny and occasionally heartwarming (especially in the bond Stark forms with a young boy), with great action and strong performances that are aided by an excellent script. Also, without giving too much away, let's just saw that Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin is quite good, just not in that way you'd expect. Marvel's Phase Two has gotten off to a hugely enjoyable start.<br/><br/>Also, stay until the very end of the credits. It's a Marvel movie after all."

","I am not normally a fan of sequels, let alone the third one, unless of part of a continual story (ie Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings) so I approached Iron Man 3 with a much apprehension. There had been a deluge of Superhero films recently it seemed and I wasn't sure I really want to see another one. Yes the Avengers had been fun and I had enjoyed the first Iron Man, but not seen the second one which I had been told was disappointing.<br/><br/>I have said it before, every great movie starts as a great script, and here we have one. Tony Stark's one liners and put downs even in the company of a small boy are priceless and restrain the film from slipping into melodrama that we don't need. The plot here is pretty simple, the world is under threat from a villain and Stark / Ironman is going to stop him. There is an important message here, that not every terrorist is what he always seems. Robert Downey junior who seems unstoppable at the moment, is on top form again as the playboy genius and all the supporting cast are great as well with a star in pretty much every supporting role. Guy Pearce does a great turn as a disgruntled Scientist. I found the film very enjoyable, well paced and well directed by Shane Black, who I remember from the original Predator movie, and if memory serves me right he made his name in Hollywood by writing The Last Boy scout. It seems he was ready for the Directors Chair and does a great job with what I hope is the last Iron Man film for now. The film brings things nicely to full circle, yes, by all means let him appear in more Avengers films, but I think, and I am sure Downey would agree, that this is a more than satisfactory end to the story of Iron Man. Thoroughly entertaining!"

","Firstly, do not go into the theater with the comic book hangover. The movie is very different from the characters actually created for comics. It is similar to the 'Elseworlds' series created by DC. If you are a politically conscious adult like me, you will find similarities from real world. To cut it short...the movie has everything for everybody, child, teen or adult. Its not just about the action or the Iron Man suit..its about the people in them. The undercurrent of the movie is strong. The subtle message that whatever you watch on news media is not always the truth. You will be disappointed if you are expected full on Rambo style in-your- face action or if you are expecting a comic book copy of character. Its like the new Batman series movies which recreated the characters with whom we can relate to...not just super-villains with magical powers. To end it: Perfectly timed action, humor and comedy. Love the script and story."
"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","8","26 April 2013"," A great movie but, not as great as it could have been.
","Iron Man 3 continues with the story of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) who is now in a steady relationship with Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow). In the third installment we come across a more vulnerable & anxiety ridden Iron Man. After the life changing battle of New York(the battle takes place in The Avengers), Stark still has nightmares about the incident & suffers from insomnia. A new threat, who calls himself The Mandarin(Ben Kingsley), is a terrorist who's known everywhere. His next target is the USA & the president of the US, Sal Kennedy(William Sadler). In the course of the film, Iron Man also meets people he met long ago at a new year's eve party in Switzerland like, Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce) & Maya Hansen(Rebecca Hall). Now, it is up to Iron Man & James Rhodes/Iron Patriot(Don Cheadle) to protect America & the president from the brutal terrorist, Mandarin.<br/><br/>I would like to start by saying that, Iron Man 3 was a brilliant film! The special effects were mind blowing, the action sequences were insanely awesome & both Aldrich Killian & The Mandarin were terrifying villains. The 3D was spectacular, especially in all the action sequences. However, the film wasn't brilliant enough. After watching The Avengers, my expectations were sky high. Though this film was wonderful in many aspects, it didn't have as much Iron Man in it, as we would've liked to have. We have plenty of Tony Stark but, we hardly see Iron Man in action. Even in the sequences where he's in action as Iron Man, he's overshadowed by the Iron Patriot, his various Iron Man suits & even Pepper Potts who have more to do in the action packed scenes than Iron Man himself. Iron Man just stands around doing almost nothing. The performances are mind blowing. Robert Downey Jr. is irresistible as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After seeing him in four movies playing the same character, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the title role. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts. Guy Pearce is outstanding as baddie, Aldrich Killian. Ben Kingsley is terrifyingly brilliant as Iron Man's archenemy, The Mandarin. Don Cheadle is impressive as James Rhodes/Iron Patriot. Rebecca Hall is effective as Maya Hansen. Jon Favreau is hilarious as Happy Hogan. Paul Bettany is hysterical as the voice of Jarvis. William Sadler is great as US president, Sal Kennedy. James Badge Dale & Stephanie Szostak are impressive as supporting characters, Eric Savin & Ellen Brandt respectively. I would like to sign off by saying, Iron Man 3 is worth a watch, especially in 3D. An all-out entertainer!"
"ssunny-social","8","1","9","3 May 2013"," Iron Man 3: Clearly the best yet from Marvels
","Iron Man was more of a follow-up to ""The Avengers"" than Iron Man 2, not just by dates but also by creative expression. <br/><br/>It starts nicely with 1999 New Year's eve which becomes the back bone of the story that develops. It has a beautiful mixture in right proportions of drama, humour (very enjoyable and subtle ones) and of course the blasts, instead of just sticking to one tone of seriousness or coolness. Shane Black's taken a bold step by moving out of the clichés and creating something which has some very innovative moments of ""Superhero Rescue"", Iron Man(s) sky spectacle and a couple unpredictable twists. Everyone's played their part very well, though Sir Ben Kingsley clearly needs a special mention for his amazing portrayal of Mandarin. The character builds its image of unstoppable terror such wonderfully with Kingsley's unique oration style that one might start thinking that if he continues in the same way, he might even beat Joker. I find it surprising that it has submerged below 80% in Rotten Tomatoes and under 8 here in IMDb, since these are the same people who loved Avengers which if you have a brick by brick comparison doesn't match up to Iron Man 3's fun and enjoyable experience or even directorial beauty. A pure summer popcorn movie, thorough entertainment nevertheless!<br/><br/>(imeansuraj.blogspot.in)"

I'm not going to post lots of spoilers here because that usually 'spoils' the movie for people,but i am going to absolutely recommend it to everyone.The scenes are very well filmized,with the marvel of 'Marvel comics' coming through to full effect.Tony Stark was always great at whatever he did.This time though,he has achieved a level of greatness that is always expected of a super-hero.

","There are only 2 things I found disappointing in this movie.. The first is the fact that the suits brake extremely easy... I mean, in the first 2 movies we see Iron Man as an incredible and powerful suit of armor and now it gets destroyed every time it hits a metal pole or something.. Indeed it does give some WTF effect and it's little bit funny but it kinda became overused..<br/><br/>Another thing that I found a slight bit disappointing was the film's main ""antagonist"", the Mandarin, which on the end turned out to be just some simple actor...Now I didn't read the Iron Man comics but I did grow up watching the animated series and the Mandarin was an immensely powerful villain and Iron Man's nemesis, making the way he is pictured in the movie the complete opposite of what he really was..<br/><br/>Apart from these two things, the movie was great; the effects were amazing, the music was awesome and we had a beautiful performance from all the actors, making the movie the best way to start a summer..."
"obsoletelanky","8","1","9","28 April 2013"," Even Though Not reaching the heights of Iron Man 1 / Avengers , Still A solid start for Marvel's Phase 2
","I found the movie quite entertaining , there were some good performances by RDJ , Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kinsley although the script could have been a bit better but the editing was crisp and to me there was never a dull moment in the film. The Action was superb , even though not touching the heights of Avengers it was still quite good and innovative. I could not understand the motive of the villain properly and it felt quite generic to me , which is a big minus point for me . The ""twist"" was done in a funny and unexpected way and caught me by surprise . Talking about 3D , it was pretty non-existent and only a very handful amount of shots had depth . So, While it does not reach the height of Iron Man / Avengers , this Shane Black 's film is a definitive improvement over the dull Iron Man 2 , It has good amounts of comedy and one-liners but I think it was under the margin for me. I also expected it to expand the MCU and introduce or hint new characters and other films but it didn't happen . It is a very good, if not quite a brilliant start to Marvel's Phase 2."
"rumasuk","7","1","9","28 April 2013"," cool looking, not badly written, action packed (and fine, well thought action) a great film
","i really like the iron man series, even 2 (i loved Sam Rockwell). This movie took the funny tone of the previous film but it became something else, its a thriller with a journey for our main character. The story is not bad at all, it has some corny moments but for me it fitted perfectly.<br/><br/>what the movie does great is generating all the conditions (with a good fluid story) for the action set pieces, which were probably the best in marvel universe, maybe even challenging the avengers. The sequences are very well thought: there's a sequence in which tony has to fight the villains just by himself, no armor, and instead of being boring it was a great scene. The action is smart and freaking awesome, the last fight was incredible.<br/><br/>the actors are of course great, the story will probably bother some orthodox fans but if you take it easy and accept the cinematic continuity is different (i think there will be 3 fictional years between avengers 1 y 2, and they haven't lived together or do anything else than brawling for one afternoon in new york) you'll see this was truly a great film. And what a start for phase 2...<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!!!!: guy Pearce was the best freaking villain in the marvel universe so far!!! he didn't have the charisma, attitude or violence of Sam Rockwell, Jeff bridges or mickey Rourke, but he was way smarter, equally ruthless and just too damn bad ass!!! also he built his own superpowers and﻿ his plan was actually pretty good. Iron man has the best history of actors playing villains and Pearce nailed it as the villain, he was AWESOME, i actually think hes the only villain with a plan that makes sense."

The plot would focus on Tony not iron man so that spectator would understand the Tony's individual characteristics.<br/><br/>In the other hand, Peper showed impressive performance in this film. Peper played the key in the end of the movie. Without Peper, Tony maybe lose this time.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I was touched by Tony's real personality and Peper's sacrifice.

","Just saw it a couple days ago so i'll give you my thoughts about the movie, i am a comic book fan of Iron Man but i will try to give an unbiased, objective opinions on the movie . <br/><br/>And again don't worry NO Spoilers!!!! <br/><br/>So if u like me have been checking out early reviews of iron man 3 you would have noticed the reviews have largely been positive with some mixed ones, and that's how i think this movie will fair on the long run. Most people will love it & many might never accept it for what it is!! <br/><br/>I'll start by listing out the Pros & Cons. <br/><br/>PROS <br/><br/>>>Really cool action movie with unique & creative action sequences. every cent of 200 mil was well spent. <br/><br/>>>RDJ is awesome as ever, effortlessly carries the movie ! he charismatically plays a superhero suffering from what i thought was PTSD symptoms. <br/><br/>>>The movie smoothly handles a superhero questioning his life & life's work without taking itself way too seriously ** Cough...cough.... Dark Knight** <br/><br/>>>Wit & Humor is great tony stark is still the wise cracking billionaire everyone loves & many other funny moments. <br/><br/>>>Good all round supporting cast Ben Kingsley,Gwyn Paltrow,Guy Pearce ,Jon Favreau all do a good job although Guy Pearce stands out. <br/><br/>>>Shane Black Directing it was a good call. This one feels much different than the previous two movies and i mean that in a good way <br/><br/>CONS <br/><br/>>>""Mandarin"" soon to probably become the source of endless debates among fans !! <br/><br/>I remember reading an early review that said Mandarin is perhaps the most intelligent screen adaptation of a Villon since the joker!! this got me seriously pumped up for the movie & after seeing the movie i just don't know what to make of it! <br/><br/>This will divide the audience, that's for sure. General audience won't mind the direction they took. But fan reaction will range from Disappointment to all out Nerd Rage!!!! <br/><br/>BUT Mandarin is to Iron Man what Joker is to Batman..........Just Saying <br/><br/>>>""Maya Hansen"" starts out great, very interesting opening but everything just leads to a predictable & abrupt end. <br/><br/>>>""Extremis"" again an audience divider. regular audience will be cool with it, but fans will be screaming out loud ""No Way that's Extremis""<br/><br/>>>Has somewhat of a ""Dark Knight Rises"" feel to it!.....(PS not in a good way) seems really great at first but the more you think about it many things don't make sense <br/><br/>>>Doesn't really kick off Phase 2 in a way the first movie of phase 2 should ""No talking Raccoons here"" <br/><br/>Verdict <br/><br/>All that being said i still had a great time with it! as long as you don't compare it to Avengers and see the movie for what it is you should be able to enjoy the movie <br/><br/>8.5/10"

"zaidmnomani","7","0","1","23 April 2020"," An Underrated Sequel
","Iron Man 3 is one of those MCU films that many simply forget about. And it's easy to see why. In the grand scheme of things, this film does not add much to the universe. But that is precisely why this movie is so enjoyable. Not every single movie in the MCU has to be part of a bigger story. Some films should stand on their own, and this film does that exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Of course, this film does have its problems. This film came out during the time that Marvel had a major villain problem, and Adriach Killian is not a particularly fascinating character. Then there is the Mandarin, whom I think the movie handled rather cleverly. There are plot holes, which do make the experience less enjoyable.<br/><br/>The action scenes especially are really different and intense. Instead of most of the action being about two big robots shooting each other, it instead focuses on Tony Stark trying to get himself out of sticky situations without only his ingenuity. The action in this film is relatively sprinkled out, with just enough of it until the final battle, which is both visually impressive and exciting.<br/><br/>RDJ's performance as usual is pretty great, as is the humor. The script constantly pokes holes at some of the cliches that modern action films usually have, which are pretty funny. The film starts to really get good at the end of the first act, when Tony is forced to go on the run, but it's pretty consistent from there on.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that's deeply inter-connected in the MCU and is necessary for the overall universe, then this film is probably not for you. But if you simply want a stand-alone movie that focuses more on Tony Stark and his troubles that is pretty simple and small scale, then this is the film for you."

4. The House Party and Clean Slate protocols.<br/><br/>Things I don't like about Iron Man 3 :<br/><br/>1. The EXTREMIS storyline and the bad guys on fire ;
2. Guy Pearce's Killian being somewhat forgettable as a villain ;
3. Some annoying side characters (the gum-chewing bad guy and the television van guy, for example) ;
4. The twist. Or do I really? This is what frustrates me about this movie : there is so much stuff that I love about it that I don't know if my mind is making excuses for the Mandarin or not. The fact of the matter is this : Guy Pearce is as generic a villain as they get, and I would have rather had Ben Kingsley as the main antagonist. As a whole, the movie is undeniably flawed ; but I love Robert Downey Jr. in this role so much that this remains one of my most rewatched MCU movies."

A lot of German automobile commercials by showing audi or reflecting how great France is supposed to be but if you need beaches and stuff you can Florida or some other places.

","The movie was still good and very entertaining for the most part, but I like many, was still disappointed that we didn't get to see the 'real' Mandarin, even after three movies within the franchise. He is after all, Iron Man's greatest enemy. Somehow, Iron Man 3 still was okay and worked for what is to come afterwards. I was hoping there would be an Iron Man 4 with the villain being the 'actual' Mandarin who is one of the most popular villains in Marvel. It could've still worked believe it or not given the story in the last movie. Iron Man 3 though it was good, could've been even better. I think Iron Man 3, somehow, was still better than the first movie Iron Man. Both were fine movies. Iron Man 2 was the weakest one of the three though it was still okay. It's a good trilogy. It's a trilogy Marvel fans can be proud about. If only another superhero, Incredible Hulk, had another few movies to its name. That would've been a good trilogy too, and possibly had rivalled it. Iron Man is one of the more popular superheroes around. All due to these movies. There's an animated series of Iron Man as well. Here, you get to see Iron Man's greatest enemy in action!"

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","2","2 March 2020"," The narrative advances in the story of the title character, promoting changes that will certainly influence his participation in the next films
","Since the Chitauri attack on New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has struggled to sleep and, when he does, has terrible nightmares. He fears he will not be able to protect his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) from the various enemies he has come to have after wearing the Iron Man armor. One of them, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), decides to attack him with full force, destroying his mansion and putting Pepper's life at risk. To face him, Stark will need to rise from the bottom of the sea, where he was taken along with the wreckage of the mansion, and overcome his greatest fear: that of failure.<br/><br/>Black and Pearce wrote the script for this sequence based on the comic book arc ""Extremis"" written by Warren Ellis. Obviously, the adaptation is slightly inspired by the comics, maintaining only one basic idea and introducing a new technology: remote control of armor, without going deeper and showing in the film the real potential of this technology. One of the creators of the virus in the comics was Aldrich Killian, who does not have a major role in the comics, but who has changed his story in the film, being the main antagonist. Even a story of an unrequited love from the past is created to strengthen the bonds between Killian, Potts and Tony throughout the narrative of the film. Another difference is that in the comics, Mallen is the host of the Extremis virus and it is he who confronts Iron Man. Mallen's powers are basically the same as we saw in the film, super strength, that shape with red eyes, blasts of fire through the mouth, the only difference is that it doesn't explode. However, the fidelity of adapting the comics to theaters is no demerit, on the contrary, the end result is extremely satisfactory.<br/><br/>In this third film, the producers and screenwriters took the main character to another level, addressing some aspects in more depth. Not only does Iron Man stand out, but mainly Tony Stark gains several layers of depth. The first minutes of the film are the ones that make this clearer, when we see a more fragile, more humanized facet. Tony starts to deal with his worst fears and suffers consequences from facts from previous films, being just a ""man in a can"" and having to deal with aliens, other superheroes and the fear of not being able to protect the people he loves from even more real and powerful threats. Since the Chitauri attack in New York, Tony has been extremely emotionally shaken. He began to isolate himself in his laboratory and devote less time to Pepper, has recurring dreams about the battle of New York, has difficulty sleeping, even staying awake for days and doing what he knows best: working nonstop on new creations and technologies , thus developing constant anxiety attacks. Tony's vulnerability permeates the entire narrative.<br/><br/>The most political tone of the script is noteworthy, previously treated only as a background. Mandarin, through his speeches, points the finger in the face of the United States and points out the hatred that has led to attacks in recent years. It also speaks of the neglect of oil spills and shells aimed at favoring only a few groups or individuals, and how all this will lead the country to continue suffering at the hands of terrorists. Not to mention that the organization IMA (Advanced Mechanical Ideas) and the oil giant Roxxon, known to comic book fans, gain space on the screen, in addition to the appearance of cinematographic versions of several of the Iron Man armor loved by readers of the comic books. Interesting to the public also to see the first meeting between Tony and Yinsen, many years before the cave in Afghanistan, which had been mentioned in the first film.<br/><br/>Even with mistakes, in general, Shane Black proves to be a talented artist by mastering humor and action, from the conception of the script to behind the camera. The director wisely bets on the talent and ability of Robert Downey Jr, who shines again on the scene with his unmistakable sarcasm, writing numerous clever, fast and fun dialogues and making the action move forward in an intelligent and bold way. The scene of the destruction of the Malibu mansion is one of the best-directed and most creative sequences in recent years. It's really exciting and breathtaking and it was just the trigger for the rest of the action. In the course of the projection, we still see the Tennessee fight, the escape of Stark in Miami and especially the rescue of the Air Force One crew and obviously the megalomaniacal climax on an oil rig, in more action-packed sequences over the air and over the land, all packed with stunning visual effects, which get better with each film.<br/><br/>In fact, the effects are a show apart, as is the production designer of Bill Brzeski and photography by John Toll. Brian Tyler's soundtrack changes the tone of the first films and brings a greater variety of styles, but in the instrumental part it does not present anything so innovative, but still very efficient, action renas have gained a lot of emotion and urgency in the hands of the composer. The pair of editors Peter S. Elliot and Jeffrey Ford, on the other hand, deserve a lot of reverence, as they deliver a two-hour film that flies by. The film does not get to be irregular and has a very well defined pace.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is undoubtedly an exciting start to Marvel's second phase. Even with errors, the film entertains and delivers what the Iron Man fan has gotten used to and looks forward to. After the worldwide success of The Avengers, there was a great expectation for the following films and fortunately we were not disappointed. The sarcastic humor and the action used correctly and at key points in the story are very well balanced and exciting. The narrative advances in the story of the title character, promoting changes that will certainly influence his participation in the next films, in addition to entertaining an audience of all ages."

They just decided to put that to one side and tell a story that was just really messy and while the ending was cool with Tony jumping in-and-out of his different Iron Man suits when activating the House Party Protocol, it is completely ruined by him blowing up his suits for no reason just to make Pepper happy when she herself starts to understand why Tony has always been addicted to making Iron Man suits.<br/><br/>On the whole, this film may be enjoyable to the regular theatre-goer which I think is what director Shane Black was going for but for fans of the comics, Marvel animated shows and the occasional video game (by the way LEGO Marvel Superheroes came out in the same year and yet they did the Mandarin justice, got him spot-on and even gave him a boss battle), this is definitely worth skipping unless you're doing a marathon of the ENTIRE Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","Iron Man 3 is the worst of the Iron Man trilogy. The narrative has no flow to it making it move along slowly and jaggedly. It makes many attempts to get going but it never picks up speed. Stuttery pacing and underwhelming action bogs the movie down. Robert Downey Jr. does what he can but it isn't enough to make the movie worth seeing. The character arc he follows doesn't seem to work and is less satisfying than his arc in his first two movies and even in The Avengers. Stark is put up in conflict with a villain who fails to make an impact. Driven by bad visual effects, the villain is just another boring antagonist to move the story along. There's only two action sequences that are enjoyable. The rest of the action is just disjointed, and short spurted. At the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act there is a buddy cop aspect between Stark and Rhodey that works great. When that aspect is present the movie actually starts to find its groove, but that groove disintegrates before you know it. Overall, Iron Man 3 lack's that certain eccentric feel that the first two movies did, and the result is an underwhelming and clunky film that should have dedicated more of it's time to being a buddy cop adventure. So I give it a 5.4"

"jhudson-11704","8","0","1","28 July 2017"," Just a man in a can
","This was one divisive movie, and pretty much for only one reason: the Mandarin. In the promos, everyone thought that Ben Kingsley was playing the Mandarin. When the twist came along, it made a lot of people angry not only because he wasn't actually the Mandarin but that Aldrich Killian actually made the claim that he himself was. But I am going to defend this movie because I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>First off, RDJ. Him as Iron Man is always going to be great because he has finally found the role that he can perfect, besides Chaplin. A couple things I like about Stark in this movie is that he has PTSD from the Avengers, and he has to rely on his brains, not his suits. I know a lot of people have anger towards the PTSD and anxiety because Tony doesn't seem like the type of person to have it. However, people going off to war, and coming back with PTSD, don't seem like people who will get it before the depart. Think about what Tony went through in the Avengers. He had to accept that gods (Thor and Loki) and aliens (Chitauri) were real. He also had to take a nuclear missile into space to blow up a mother ship knowing full well it might lead to his death. While he did live, being in space and seeing this alien armada can surely traumatize someone who could never have thought of doing this. The PTSD angle in this movie is a smart thing to do and something for RDJ to really flex his acting muscles on. I also loved how he had to make quick, small items like taser gloves, exploding Christmas ornaments and other items in order to stay alive and be ready and dangerous. This movie solidified the fact that it isn't the suit that makes him a superhero, it's his genius. <br/><br/>Onto the biggest thing about this movie, the Mandarin switch. I loved the twist that Black did for this movie. When we see the Mandarin, we know that he is a bad guy. For comic book readers, it's just the fact that you know his backstory, but for the general audience it's because he physically looks like a bad guy. They play on the stereotypes so much that we already have the perception that he is evil. The fact that they turn this on us is brilliant because we never expect it. For Killian boasting that he is the Mandarin at the end of the movie, he is regenerating, has fire powers, and has near-death hubris. It is completely believable that he just claims to be the Mandarin based off of that. Other than that I kind of liked his character, sure he was another bad business guy like the last movie, but he didn't have a metal suit, but superpowers. He also brought a goofy, charm that worked well with the writing and tone in this movie. <br/><br/>The final battle scene with Tony's dozens of suits fighting off Extremis soldiers was thrilling as we get to see all of the designs that Tony thought of fight in different ways. We also got to see versions that have appeared in the comics like the Centurion and Igor (a possible precursor to Hulkbuster).<br/><br/>A few things that did bother me about the movie is Maya Hansen, the Iron Patriot and the fake out of Pepper's end. Maya Hansen didn't really have any development or point to the story other than being Tony's old flame and the discoverer of Extremis. Sure, the latter is important but she is offed unceremoniously. With the Iron Patriot, what was the point of that other than just being a nod to the character (originally Norman Osborn in the comics) and to make jokes about the change from War Machine, which I think is better. With the loss of Pepper in the end would have been good storytelling because it would break Tony and be much more interesting to deal with later in the movies and the entire time during the movie, he said that she was the one thing he couldn't live without. I believe that without Pepper he really would've thrown himself into his suits and be fully focused on the Avengers.<br/><br/>All in all, the writing was very good and what I was expecting from Shane Black. I actually watched other movie of his before watching this movie so that I could get a sense of Black. The humor was well done too as it felt natural. I also have to give major kudos to the kid playing Harley. He had incredible chemistry with Stark and I would love to see more of him<br/><br/>+ RDJ + Mandarin Twist + Final Battle + Writing, directing and humor + Stark and Harley - (Un)importance of Maya - Iron Patriot - Pepper lives<br/><br/>Final Score: 8.6/10"
"manayunkman83","4","0","1","30 May 2017"," Rating should be R, not for kids.

They also shoot each other left and right, and may as well be a Jason Borne movie the way they shoot each other in the head and blow each other up in this movie.

","Marking the commencement of the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe after the first one culminated with The Avengers, Iron Man 3 presents a definite improvement over its insufferably insipid predecessor but it still falls short of the magical experience that was the first Iron Man film. However, it does carry a new energy & has a refreshing vibe to it, thanks to the new director at helm.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 continues the story of Tony Stark who's recovering from post-traumatic stress caused by the events of The Avengers. Unable to sleep & genuinely afraid of losing what he loves, Stark's life is turned upside down after he issues a threat to a radical terrorist who retaliates by destroying his personal world, leaving him far more vulnerable than ever before & forcing him to rebuild from the scratch.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Shane Black, Iron Man 3 really benefits from a fresh perspective & is an enjoyable ride for the most part but is also marred by its attempt to try out way too many things at once, out of which only a few work out in a convincing manner. Technical aspects are finely executed for its Cinematography favours a slightly darker tone, Editing steadily paces its narrative while Brian Tyler's adds more vibrancy to its plot.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley & Rebecca Hall join the reprising cast & ably fill up their given roles while Robert Downey Jr. once again manages to impress the most. The best thing about this sequel is the position it puts Tony Stark in & Downey Jr. does a terrific job in bringing that vulnerability on the screen. Also, while I was a bit furious at what they did with Iron Man's arch-nemesis, I did later warm up to what their intent was here.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Iron Man 3 is a solid follow up to Iron Man & you don't even have to go through the crap that was Iron Man 2 to get to this one. The film's intent to cover the darker issues at hand while keeping itself light-hearted & plenty of fun is a combination that doesn't gel so well, is at friction on many occasions & is bound to divide its viewers, but its improvement over everything that was so wrong with its predecessor nevertheless makes it a welcome chapter, if not a worthy one."

"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","12 April 2017"," ""Iron Man 3""- A welcome return to form and a fine start to Phase Two of the ever-growing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe.""
","After the misstep of the divisive but well-meaning ""Iron Man 2"" and the phenomena that was ""The Avengers"", Marvel kick-started Phase Two of their ever-growing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" with the trilogy- capping ""Iron Man 3,"" now under control of the magnificent director and co- writer Shane Black of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" fame. While the film has suffered a slight bit of backlash due to some unconventional choices in the narrative, I personally felt the film was, if anything, a welcome return to form for the ""Iron Man"" saga. It reminded me of just why we fell in love with Tony Stark in the first place, and emerges as a generally stellar entry in that beloved franchise that Marvel has been building for the better part a decade now.<br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is at an interesting place in his life. After having thwarted evil on three occasions prior, he's finally finding some real purpose in life and making great strides in his development of newer and more complex armor... yet at the same time, he's also finally started to feel the repercussions of all he's been through, manifesting in the form of anxiety and panic- attacks. When his friend and colleague Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is critically injured in a terrorist attack orchestrated by a mysterious figure known as the ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley), Tony goes into a rage and directly issues a threat against this menacing presence. As a result, he is attacked and left for dead, stranded in rural Tennessee, where he will find inspiration in the most unlikely of places- a precocious young boy (Ty Simpkins)... At the same time, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) investigates a corporate rival from Tony's past (Guy Pearce) who may be connected to the devious goings-on that have left her boss and lover stranded and presumed dead...<br/><br/>In my mind, the greatest strengths of the film are the very same risks taken with the story and development of character that some others take issue with. Black has woven a tale that serves as a near-ideal continuation of the saga while also subverting virtually every single expectation we have as an audience. We came in to see ""Iron Man 3"", and yet the film places the great portion of its focus on Tony as a man first outside of the armor, with the action making up only a small portion of the screen time. We came in expecting a dark and treacherous tale, yet the film is filled with heart and humor and a sort-of unconventional surrogate father-and-son story. We have pre-conceived notions regarding who will be defined as hero and villain, and yet nothing is quite what it seems. The film is a giant gamble, seemingly pushing the audience's buttons at every turn... and I think it was a great success. You won't know what to expect at any time, and it's a thrilling and enthralling experience as a result.<br/><br/>At the heart of it all is the cast, each and every one of whom continue to shine in their roles. Downey Jr., Paltrow and other returning actors such as Don Cheadle and Favreau all give in the same top-notch performances as they always have. There's nothing more that can be said in their favor that hasn't already been echoed a thousand times before. Newcomers including Kingsley and Pearce are a welcome addition, who provide further levels of intrigue and development to the overall universe. And I was quite taken by Simpkins in his supporting role as a young child who forms a sort-of begrudging relationship with Stark. I was familiar with Simpkins from his turns in the bone-chilling ""Insidous"" franchise, and he continues to stretch his chops as one of the finest child-actors working today here. He's definitely one to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals and storytelling, the film is spellbinding and greatly builds off of what came before to magnificent results. While I did miss original director Jon Favreau's creative vision, Black is a fantastic replacement and very much incorporates what came before while giving it his own creative spin. With his quirky ""buddy cop"" sensibilities leading to some of the best banter of the series and his decidedly ""80's"" style giving the film a sort-of throwback feel at times, the film is definitely a great deal of fun and compliments the first two quite well. This feels like an ""Iron Man"" movie that had somehow gone back in time and was filmed in 1987, and I loved that about it. Even the musical score by Brian Tyler (who I'm honestly usually not a fan of) gets right into the mood Black established with some funky beats and amusingly kitschy themes that somehow work.<br/><br/>While the film might not be perfect with a few too many oddball moments and a slightly over-stretched narrative, it boggles my mind that anyone- let alone a healthy portion of people- dislike it. It's fast. Funny. Crazy. Old-school. And just a blast and a half. It's one of my favorite entries in the entire Marvel saga to watch and re-watch, and I think it's a darned good capping chapter to the ""Iron Man"" trilogy. I give it a very good 8 out of 10."

","I know, I'm a bit behind on my Marvel films, but to be honest, after Iron Man 2, I really wasn't looking forward to seeing another one. There's no doubt that Marvel films have gone from simple stories about superheroes to epic adventures with the best writers and actors in Hollywood, but the fact is Iron Man 2 was your typical disappointing sequel. In the third installment of the Iron Man adventure though, the franchise bounces back in a huge way, as we get a story that not only rivals the original, but in my opinion knocks it on it's ass! Iron Man 3 finally answers the question does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit, as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces his toughest enemy yet, the one with the greatest reach, that no one sees coming. With his team and gear in ruins, Stark is left to lamb it in the middle of nowhere, and in a sense start over and find himself all over again. After playing Tony Stark for so long and appearing in just about every film Marvel has made in the last decade, Robert Downey Jr. knows everything there is to know about the character, and it has never been more apparently than it is here. Writers utilize cannon from various comics, graphic novels, previous movies, and really delve deeply into the character like never before. I also like the fact that it wasn't just another film with Stark in his lab full of toys. This time he's stranded in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by new people, having to start from scratch, it gave the whole thing a much more realistic feel to it, and finally there's the villain. While I loved every second of the Avengers, the truth is that the bad guys are aliens and aren't all that realistic. The Mandarin is a really bad guy and he's as real as the rest of us, needless to say I loved it. If you're not the huge fan I am and you only decide to see one of the Iron Man films, I'd choose this one. Rarely do I ever suggest seeing anything but the original, where it all started, but in this case, the effects are better, Downey's knowledge of the character is better, the writing is much better, and it's not the same old tagline you tend to get with introductory films."

","Saw IRON MAN 3 last night and it was superb. It was the sequel IRON MAN 2 should have been but wasn't and the perfect extrapolation of life after AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The set pieces are suitably awesome and the acting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down to the tiniest bit part (there's a jewel of a cameo from a guard that upstages even Downey's comic timing). The script gets the balance between the epic and the personal just right and Sir Ben delivers two performance for the price of one and both are genius (can't say more - spoilers!). Mr Downey Jr also manages to show even more of the complexity of Tony Stark. Just when you think there's no more to be fracked out of that particular mine, he goes deeper. The writer set out to deliver a fun story and that's exactly what it is. It draws you in from the first moments and doesn't let go. What more could you possibly want?"

","I grew up on DC Comics, and my wife grew up on MARVEL Universe so there is a bit of tension in the house over what heroes to worship. <br/><br/>Iron Man was not really on my radar as a kid, Batman, Superman, Spiderman, these guys where who I was when I played at the park with my friends. So when ""Iron Man"" (2008) came out, I was not all too excited. I saw it and liked it but by the time Iron Man 2"" (2010) came along I was a full fan. Then of course you have all the other Marvel Superhero movies ""Captain America"", ""THOR"", and the countless of thousands of ""HULK"" movies. (Alright there is only one true Hulk; we all know who it is.) Which all lead up the ""The Avengers"". Now by this time I was drooling and waiting and peeing my pants after the end credits of every movie and so on and so on. Now we have ""Iron Man 3"" which continues where ""The Avengers"" left off. <br/><br/>The biggest complaint people are having about this movie is ""Where are the rest of the Avengers and why aren't they helping him?"" First off, it's not like they all don't live in LA and they didn't move in together and well you have to wait for all of their sequels coming out 2014, 2015 to see what they were doing while ""Iron Man 3"" was happening. Can you picture it? ""MTV's The Real World: Avengers"" I would actually watch that!<br/><br/>Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... I liked the movie. It was fast and well passed and the necessary slow parts where not painfully slow. There were some surprises and twists along the way that change your view on many things. I was OK with them, no big deal to me but remember I never read the comics so the movies can do whatever they want and I won't be blogging about how they destroyed my childhood by changing one key detail about Iron Man. <br/><br/>The one thing that bothered me was the villains. They were a bit weird to me. I couldn't really put my finger on agendas and plans. Yes of course the monologues they gave told you everything but the whole time I asked myself. ""Why, so what?"" They didn't really sit well and make me feel as if there was a real solid threat. You know I never spoil the fun for you so I will stop there. <br/><br/>Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says ""The Avengers"" was a very well made movie, but there was one piece of dialogue that bothered me. Captain America says to Tony Stark ""Big man in a suit of armor, take that away what are you?"" Tony's reply was awesome and funny and smart and witty but it cut him, it changed him, it affected him. Aside from his quick self-defense rant, we see what it did to him in ""Iron Man 3"" and we see how it changed him as a hero, a man, and an individual. We see what happens when you strip him of everything. ""Iron Man 3"" fixed everything and ended and began so many things all in one spin. <br/><br/>Jack ""The Parent"" says As a parent of five girls it can sometimes be difficult to get them interested in movies like ""Iron Man 3"" and this movie did fall of their radar, so it was a wife and me, date night mission. BUT I can say as a father of five girls that it is also very hard to find a movie that displays women's strength and women as more than just something to save or just another problem for the hero. And yes this movie did have a lot of that but Pepper Potts does kick some ass in this movie showing some skills and strength in her own right. I personally would not have a problem with my girls watching this movie at all; it's fun, adventurous, and creative. It ignites ideas of protecting the ones you love."

It's the MCU, they are working in Feature Films not TV, you can't really make an epic villain out of anyone you know has to be knocked off and will never come back all in under 3 hours.<br/><br/>So, why not warp him to fit the plot? 2) The people that want Iron Man and not Stark. From reading the bad reviews one gets the impression that people hate this because it isn't ALL IRON MAN ALL THE TIME.<br/><br/>Stark isn't constantly suited up, and in fact, he wears it probably less than in any other movie.<br/><br/>So the lack of CGI Iron Man action is going to garner a lot of distaste in some viewers.<br/><br/>3) The people that like a balance between Stark and Iron Man, the story over action crowd.<br/><br/>Not that this installment doesn't have action, but the action revolves around Stark and not Iron Man. It's good, but it's a total Stark story and one that develops his character nicely. What Iron Man 2 lacked in heart, Iron Man 3 made-up for.<br/><br/>How are you going to like the movie? Well, that depends on who you are and how much you want to weigh one thing against the other. For Shane Black fans though, it totally works."
"Tweekums","7","0","2","20 October 2016"," A solid addition to the Iron Man franchise
","Opening with a flashback to 1999 we see a pre-Iron Man Tony Stark meeting scientist Maya Hansen; she is developing an experimental process that if it works will ultimately help people recover from serious injuries. A test involving a plant is shown to have the possibility of explosive failure. The two of them are approached by Aldrich Killian, another scientist, who wants Tony to work with his company; an offer he rejects.<br/><br/>Cutting forward to the current day a terrorist known as 'The Mandarin' is targeting American interests around the world; the attacks have one strange thing in common; an explosion but no sign of a bomb. Tony is currently working on yet another Iron Man suit while still troubled by the 'events in New York'. He issues a threat to the Mandarin, including telling him where he lives. Soon afterwards Maya visits Tony at home but the building is destroyed by attack helicopters. She and Pepper Potts survive the attack while Tony is reported dead however he has managed to fly to Tennessee where he starts investigating an explosion that matches the pattern of the other attacks but wasn't connected. Here he is helped by a young boy and meets some people with a strange ability; they can raise their bodies to temperatures that can melt metal. Soon afterwards it becomes apparent that Killian is behind the Mandarin and inevitably he has further plans.<br/><br/>This is a solid third instalment In the Iron Man franchise although it follows on from 'The Avengers' with references to 'events in New York' there is no recap of what happened so if, like me, you haven't seen that film you may be a bit confused you just have to accept that something bad happened and now Tony Stark has PTSD or something similar. I've not read the original comics so can't comment on how this handled the characters compared to the source material but I thought they were pretty solid; I particularly liked Ben Kingsley's portrayal of 'The Mandarin' and really enjoyed the twist regarding his character. Guy Pearce was good as Killian although the character was a bit cliché as soon as Tony Stark rejected his approach in the prologue it was obvious that he'd return as the bad guy. Rebecca Hall was also good as Maya, one of the film's most 'normal' characters. The returning cast Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle are as good as one would expect. The story was solid and provided plenty of excuses for some spectacular action which feature top-notch special effects. Inevitably there are some weaker moments and I could have done without Tony getting help from a kid but overall I'd say this is a fun superhero movie that fans of the franchise are likely to enjoy."
"michael-3204","6","0","1","17 October 2016"," MCU Phase II begins well
","Marvel kicks off what it calls ""Phase II"" of its cinematic universe by going back to the character with which it launched the whole thing, which is a pretty good idea given Iron Man's primacy in the MCU and Robert Downey, Jr.'s primacy as the best actor it has playing one of its superheroes. It is risky only in the sense that ""Iron Man 2"" was a rare misstep for Marvel, one from which it recovers here. Shane Black is a great choice for director and co- writer, and not just because Marvel needed a movie set at Christmas time. This isn't exactly ""Die Hard in the MCU,"" but Black's sensibility is a welcome respite from the planet-is-in-peril stakes of ""The Avengers,"" which capped off ""Phase I."" His story and direction create enough excitement to make this good fun, give Iron Man a decent opponent, give Tony Stark some demons to wrestle with, and make very good use of the familiar supporting players in Iron Man/Stark's world.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is almost engaging enough to make me not miss Sam Rockwell, the best feature of ""Iron Man 2."" As Marvel villains go, Killian is nicely developed and reasonably compelling. He's no Loki, but he's big improvement on Mickey Rourke, and like Rockwell's, his evil plan is basically profit-driven. He doesn't want to destroy the planet, he just wants to get rich off the people who do. But his megalomania is nicely juxtaposed with Stark's, who is dealing with PTSD from the events of ""The Avengers."" Stark finally reaches out for help in a way that Killian can't, which makes a resonant dramatic point and also gives both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau a lot more to do than they've previously been afforded. Both rise to the occasion, as does Don Cheadle as War Machine. And the film does all this without Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury popping up -- he must still be in mourning for Clark Gregg.<br/><br/>I was not as convinced by the sub-plot involving a child and his relationship with Stark. This is an over-long film for what it tries to accomplish, with one or two too many plot twists and turns for its own good. There is no cross set-up here that doesn't turn out to be a double-cross, which never gets confusing but does get wearying. The plot involving the boy Stark befriends seems like the most superfluous in a film that could stand some trimming to be as tight as it should be. Nevertheless, this is a good return to form for Iron Man and a promising way to continue the franchise."
"tankace","8","0","1","22 September 2016"," MCU Christmas Special.
","From the title is obvious that the movie take place during the Christmas period. Anyway Iron Man 3 though not on par with the first film in the trilogy ,is still a quit entertaining yet overrated movie at the same time. So why is that?<br/><br/>Firstly up to today (2016 September) is the highest grossing solo superhero movie of all time making 1,215 billion $ and Robert won the People's Choice awards for the best Action Hero of the year and in general the movie won and get nominated on several awards. And yes the story is quit interesting, the effects are amazing and Ben Kingley was a mega troll move on the director part. Though not many liked this interpretation of the Mandarin this troll move was really funny to say the truth. Those are the pros of the flick.<br/><br/>Now to the cons: it has a strange pacing and at times it feels either too fast or too slow, and the second revelation about our lead villain was a bit dumb and didn't make a lot of sense to me at least. Now it is common knowledge that the MCU movies are lacking in making good villains with the exception of the fan-favorite Loki and her is the same story ,different melody. And now to the box office, I find it too much that the movie grossed more than the two previous Iron Man together and this is due to three things.<br/><br/>One the Iron Man Logo sells big, two it is a closing chapter to the first Marvel Cinematic Universe Avenger (not in the time- line of the series, but of the release of the movies) and three and final as a Christmas movie it is among my favorites along side Die Hard, It is a Wonderful Life and Homw Alone. <br/><br/>All in all the Iron Man trilogy isn't one of the best and with only the first movie being praised by everyone and the two sequel being OK and good closure respectively."

","The Three Acts:<br/><br/>The initial tableau: We open over a decade ago in Switzerland. Tony Stark participates wildly in end-of-the-year celebration parties. He meets Maya Hansen and Aldrich Killian, who try valiantly to convince him to be interested in technology developed by the think tank, AIM. Tony hardly listens, partly from buzz, partly from arrogance. He writes out a few equations which forward the effort considerably, gives them to Killian, and promises to meet Killian on the roof to develop the ideas further. But Tony breaks his promise.<br/><br/>In the present, after Tony participates in The Avengers action in New York City, there are multiple attacks by 'The Mandarin.' Tony is not all that involved until his friend Happy Hogan is nearly killed by one of the attacks. Tony declares war. The Mandarin is backed by individuals who have the Extremis treatments developed by AIM. They can melt Tony's suits from the heat of their bodies, regenerate severed limbs, and many other things. Tony has his work cut out for him.<br/><br/>Delineation of conflicts: 'The Mandarin' strikes first, destroying Tony's palatial estate on the California coast. Tony loses his armour, his labs, his base of operation, and soon enough, JARVIS and his suit. Or so it would seem. Tony has to figure out who the Mandarin really is, what AIM does, and how to counter the effects of Extremis, initially without his armour. Worst of all, the Extremis-enhanced folk capture Pepper, and start making her one of them. They kidnap War Machine (renamed Iron Patriot) and the President, whom they intend to replace using their own candidate. To make things even worse, Tony has recurrent PTSD from the action in New York.<br/><br/>Resolution: Will the Extremis transformation applied to Pepper be reversible? Will the President be recovered alive? Will Colonel Rhodes get free to fight alongside Tony?<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>I never cared for the Mandarin, so I do not care about the portrayal of the Mandarin in IM3. I despised the character in the comics, and later hated the character in the animated series to the point that I gave up following Iron Man for a time. Only the Tony Stark films with RDJ in the cockpit got me interested again. What made Iron Man 1 great was the portrayal of Tony Stark coming back, against all odds, to defeat enemies of his own country, and enemies of his individual person. Iron Man 3 was a return to form after the wretched Iron Man 2. The third film was about Tony Stark, about his friends, about his fans who helped him when he was down, about the power of enduring love, which is what saved Stark in the end."

","The original Iron Man is very good, but this third installment is simply one you have to see at least twice. Great performances by Paltrow and Downey Jr. As always, Downey Jr. has a lot of fun with his suits. Those suits are amazing, I am like Rhodes, ""I want a suit, suit me up."" Great comic moments, you laugh and laugh. Now let's get to the story, Tony Stark after New York, the Avengers, he is down, he cannot sleep, he has nightmares and he is a mess. Then he shows his bravado and incites the Mandarin to attack him in his house in Malibu beach and yes that is an amazing sequence. Then what I love about this film is that it goes way back to 2008, when Star needs his genius to survive Afghanistan and he does, with a help with a boy. There is a great sequence when 13 people are falling in the air after being thrown from a plane and it is crazy and great. Paltrow suits up and yes she looks nice, and then she is very important part of the film. Yes, Tony's boys come and help, that action part is the best of the film, hands down, all the suits, all the Armour in gear flying around and all the metal. Tony Stark is Iron Man and you know why because Stark made the suit."

"one9eighty","8","0","1","16 May 2016"," The sequel Iron Man should have had
","In the third instalment from the Iron Man films Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) finds his world torn apart and demons from his past come back to haunt him. In a time before the Iron Man tech Tony's ego forces him to stand-up some advancing, if not amateur, scientists who are making advances in their own fields, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Who would have thought that in years to come they would end up working together to try and bring Stark and the world to it's knees. Of course Tony doesn't know this until the later parts of the film, initially his attention is on bringing down the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a terrorist leader who is hell bent on destruction and revenge. Working with the Iron Patriot (the painted re-branded War machine) (Don Cheadle) he attempts to bring the Mandarin down and serve justice. While all this is going on Tony is fighting new demons and anxieties which are a result of the incidents of the Avengers movie, it seems going through a worm hole in space has left him changed slightly. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now running Stark industries and a reformed Killian (when he tried meeting Stark in the flashback at the start of the film, he was suffering a disability) meets with her to try and get Stark Industry backing for his Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) project ""Extremis"" which harnesses the brains power to alter DNA. Meanwhile Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in a blast, its up to Tony to investigate this, which is a good idea as the investigation will help to uncover Killian's plot and also who the Mandarin really is and what his intentions are. <br/><br/>This is a really good film, I prefer this over the second Iron Man. There is a good pace to the film and it isn't all about action but there is some mystery and suspense thrown in too. There are times when Stark has to rely on his own ability away from the Iron Man suit which is an interesting story because he has to overcome his demons at the same time. The action that is in the film crescendo's at the climax and is a beautiful spectacle, almost operatic as all the suits that Stark has been building all meet in one location. It's like a opera or classical score building and building till everything goes off at the end. The action is tasteful and the CGI isn't off-putting at all. The cast are all strong in this, they are believable throughout. If I were to single one weak link out it would be Kingsley as the Mandarin. His performance is good of course, but the Mandarin character isn't written well and is nothing like the maniacal mastermind of the comic's. While the character isn't done well here I have read various forums to suggest that the real Mandarin will be in future Iron Man films and this showing is a divertive introduction. <br/><br/>This is the sequel that Iron Man should have had, it's much better than the 2nd film and brings together all the chemistry that a great cast give and mixes it with a good story, actions, thrills, spills, mystery and suspense. This is a darker film than the second, and the first for that matter, with Stark having to deal with demons he thought were in the past which affect his current life and happiness. This works both as a standalone movie and also as part of the Iron Man series of films, it also adds more substance to the 2nd Avengers film. Billed as a summer blockbuster this film lived up to the hype and then some. 8 out of 10 from this reviewer."

","Released in 2013, ""Iron Man 3"" stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.<br/><br/>After the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) ""Iron Man 2"" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's ""more serious"" than ""Iron Man 2,"" it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of ""more seriousness"" is marginal.<br/><br/>People say ""Iron Man 3"" plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.<br/><br/>The movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"

","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.<br/><br/>Whereas the first two Iron Man films become better with repeated viewings, I think Iron Man 3 is far less re-watchable. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the handful of defenders for the film, but the third entry just doesn't have the same spark as the first two films do. Shane Black takes the film in a much darker direction. That's fine, especially considering what Stark went through during the events of Avengers, but I think there was something missing in Iron Man 3, and I think the tone has a lot to do with that.<br/><br/>Considering the film begins with the Eiffel 65 classic Blue (da ba dee), Iron Man 3 is a bit of a departure from the previous Iron Man films. Disappointingly, the film also doesn't contain any AC/DC songs or Ramin Djawadi's score. It does however, supply a memorable score from Brian Tyler. Besides that, all of the actors are back and the cast welcomes in Rebecca Hall, Guy Pearce, and Ben Kingsley in pivotal roles. Tony and Pepper are now living together *happily* with Happy and Rhodey not too far away.<br/><br/>I understand people wanted the film to take a different approach after the mixed response to Iron Man 2, but this film was missing Jon Favreau's touch. Not only did he not come back to direct the film, but Happy only gets a few scenes as he's hospitalized for the majority of the run time. Don Cheadle has more action, but Tony Stark in Tennessee for the entire second act, I felt like I needed more Rhodey as well. If anything else, the problem with Iron Man 3 is the writing. Downey and Paltrow still have magnetic chemistry, but everything else feels different from the previous entries.<br/><br/>That brings me to the infamous Mandarin reveal. I actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took Kingsley's character as everyone else does. With that said, I can't say I wasn't at least a little disappointed that there was no real presence of the ten rings or anything that felt all that threatening. I'm glad they decided to have a villain not in an Iron Man type suit to give Tony something different to fight, but as great as Guy Pearce is in other films, he just didn't do it for me as Aldrich Killian.<br/><br/>There is definitely something to the argument that this film needed more Iron Man. Ty Simpkins plays Stark's tech sidekick back in Tennessee, and he's good, but I would have liked to see a little bit more Iron Man screen time. But the counter argument to that would be that Tony Stark is just as entertaining as the metal head himself. And that the insomniac Stark they were going for, kind of makes sense. The central theme of 'demons' was an interesting take and probably the most necessary one at that particular stage in the universe. I can appreciate the gutsiness by the filmmakers to approach the character in this way, if only The Incredibles hadn't really done the exact same premise 9 years prior.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like Iron Man 3. It's a much different take on Tony Stark and it was the next logical step for the Marvel Universe. I just wish the writing had been more in the vein of the first two Iron Man's and not strayed too far away from what we love so much about this character.<br/><br/>+Insomniac Stark<br/><br/>+Fully functional Pepper & Tony<br/><br/>+Tyler's score<br/><br/>+Cheadle gets more action<br/><br/>-Different approach to the villains didn't pay off<br/><br/>-Needed a bit more humor<br/><br/>7.8/10"

There were even a few (spoilers) references to avengers assemble . And I was really hyped because of some of the battle scenes. So overall, another marvel movie worth watching, let's hope civil war and doctor strange are just as good, because all the other marvel movies since this, including guardians of the galaxy, Thor: the dark world, avengers: age of ultron, and of course ant-man were really good, so I've got high hopes for those movies in phase 3..."
"C22Man","6","0","1","24 November 2015"," Ends the trilogy with a bang!
","After two successful solo films, the onus was on Iron Man 3 to bring the trilogy to an effective conclusion while continuing to develop some much loved characters. Shane Black is mainly known for his sharp, dialogue driven scripts and in a way it made sense for him to direct given Downey Jr.'s hyper performance. There is certainly more comedy and drama here, and surprisingly they are both mixed together very effectively. Personally I think Iron Man 3 is something of a triumph, being very different in style to the previous two films while managing to craft a complex story and place the characters in interesting situations.<br/><br/>Story: Tony Stark's world begins to crumble when an international terrorist called the Mandarin targets him and destroys all of his equipment. Stark has to go out on his own to find the link between bombings in the US and discovers that an even greater force is backing the Mandarin. The storyline is played excellently throughout, offering interesting problems for Stark to overcome and some twists that are pleasantly surprising. The big twist itself is superbly done. The way it balances multiple aspects is impressive as Stark is made the centre of the film, the villains get enough time to develop personalities and even the supporting characters have a part to play in proceedings.<br/><br/>Hero: Robert Downey Jr. is excellent once again and gets even more to do this time around. He is still as sardonic and flippant as ever which allows for many laughs, yet he also gets to show Stark's struggle to deal with PTSD and he manages to get a lot of emotion across in those scenes. He balances both aspects perfectly and you do feel like he has gone through a journey by the films end.<br/><br/>Villains: Guy Pearce does a solid job as the crooked inventor Killian. He might be a touch one-dimensional at times, but Pearce injects the character with an easy to hate smugness and he does feel like a genuine threat. Ben Kingsley is simply fantastic here given his key role. He manages to make the Mandarin appear as a ruthless terrorist along with a funny voice, then show that the man behind him is simply a deadbeat and he is absolutely hilarious in those scenes.<br/><br/>Support: Gwyneth Paltrow has grown into her role as Pepper and does a good job here. Again the scenes between her and Downey Jr. sparkle thanks to their chemistry, while she even handles some action scenes convincingly. Don Cheadle is excellent again as Rhodes as he continues to convince as a man of action, gets some good laughs and he is involved in the plot more this time around. Rebecca Hall is decent enough in a small but important role and Ty Simpkins does a good job as a kid who helps Stark out.<br/><br/>Action: The action sequences are all flashy and exciting. The attack on Stark's home is shot very well and has a surprising amount of intensity to it, especially given what's at stake. There is a fantastic fight in an aeroplane and a mid-air rescue that is rather silly but still very entertaining. The climactic battle at a dock is overblown in the best sense of the word and seems to be continuously adding more obstacles to overcome, but it is extremely stylish and it does show our heroes having to dig as deep as possible.<br/><br/>Music: Brian Tyler's score is excellent. While the guitars don't return, it uses some very emotive melodies and pounding compositions to really drive home the atmosphere or tension in certain scenes. Many arrangements are very memorable and well crafted.<br/><br/>Production: Despite not being known for his directing skills, Shane Black does a fine job here. He directs the dialogue heavy scenes with a lot of vigour which lets the lines leap out and the action scenes are all appropriately stylish. The script is where the film truly shines. Black is at his best here. because the snappy and sharp dialogue that he is known for fits in seamlessly when provided by the likes of Downey Jr. as its pretty much a match made in heaven. Some might argue that it is a little too comedic in places, but I think it works to the films advantage. In fact the comedy is some of the best Marvel has provided, especially with the likes of Downey Jr.'s numerous witty lines and his scenes with Simpkins. Visually the film continues much of the ultra-modern look from the previous films and setting the majority of it at Christmas is actually a very smart move in giving the film a different edge. CGI is used a lot, especially during the climax, but it always blends in well and is only really used to add to the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 and would probably say it's the best of the trilogy. The film has no major weak points and I think all the differing elements come together successfully to form a very fun as well as interesting film. I always cared about the characters and how their story arcs were played out, whilst the story twisted in some ways that I really wasn't expecting which lead to some nice surprises. Downey Jr. was just wonderful once again, the villains were different to the norm, the support was great and the action was gripping throughout. Black's direction and writing were exceptional, all of it resulting in a superhero film with an abundance of wit and excitement."

","The movie is about super hero, Iron man/Tony Stark against the enemy , with his Iron man suit.<br/><br/>I particularly like the movie. My favorite character is Tony, he is so strong, flexible, clever to use his suit. I want the directors to produce more movie about Iron man. For example, Iron man 4 or Amazing Iron man, etc... All the scenes are great such as fighting scene, love scene between Pepper and Tony, and the scene when he finding out the true that cause the problem. I watch this movie for about 4-5 times already.<br/><br/>I really dislike the scene in the end of the movie when he throws his power into the sea.

","Iron Man 3 is an amazing movie, it has the two main components that makes a great action movie, fast-paced actions and tons of explosions. The first and the second one was good but this latest one was incredibly amazing, it has far more excitement and way more suits. Even though his techs were far more advanced than last time, the movie showed that Tony Stark could manage on his own instead of relying on his techs all the time which i think was a great turn of events. I especially loved the part where his million dollar house got blown up with missiles, fired from helicopters flown by terrorists. This is purely my opinion of the movie and I loved it."
"BakiBillah","10","0","1","6 November 2015"," This movie is really enjoyable.
","This movie is really enjoyable. Osam Movie.. There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.<br/><br/>The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.<br/><br/>Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.<br/><br/>As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start."

","Lets just say that this is as action packed, if not more then its predecessors, it is great fun and very entertaining, it does however become a bit of a mess, a lot of things happen and the clever remarks and witty comments gets left behind, they do however make room for a hell of a fight that blows it all out at the end.<br/><br/>I think Shane Black does a good job, but Jon Favreau had something else in his two interpretations of Iron Man. This is good directing, but becomes somewhat of a mess, maybe even a blur of a lot of things.<br/><br/>For the action and with the boys this is okay, but for anything more it doesn't really cut it, it is purely an action movie."

","Iron man is taking over a global terrorist, who wants to kill him. After the disappointing second movie, I found Iron Man 3 quite enjoyable. Clever and more introvert, explores Iron Man's aca Tony Sparks deeper personality and fears. His relationship with Peper is the key point for everything, as is his past. The villains are more complex and more interesting, as the story unfolds slowly without letting the viewer guess things easily from the beginning. Great graphics and special effects and nice performances help the film improve itself from the low quality of its second film. One thing that bothered me was the fact that you had to have watched avengers in order to get Tony's obsession and panic attacks. Plus the ending was a little weak. So 6 out of 10 for Iron Man 3."

","****SPOILERS****<br/><br/>I LOVED this movie.<br/><br/>EPIC action sequences - Action sequences were the BOMB. I loved it. It had decent, well choreographed action where many things were happening simultaneously and still made sense. It was great.<br/><br/>It had strong character development - He was influenced from the events of the Avengers. That's why he had PTSD. It was a whole and complete movie, and that and Cap2 are the movies in the MCU that I can feel happy watching over and over again, because they don't leave loose ends, have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting.﻿<br/><br/>I have a few thoughts on the villain. Filmmakers often think that a villain who can sympathize with the audiences is the best. Most do that too. But Iron Man 3 was bold. It's decision to go with a hate- able villain and actually pulling it off is a feat onto itself.<br/><br/>I mean, his motivations were simple itself. Sell Extremis and gain money. The way he pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable. He created a fake persona, the Mandarin, and enabled him to create war and terror. This in turn would create widespread panic among this US, and coupled with the killing of the US president and literally controlling USA when it's vice president came to power, would cause the nation to crumble and allow him to gain a profit.<br/><br/>Killian was counting on the media to stare at the Mandarin's face value, and blowing it out of proportion, when he was charge the whole time.<br/><br/>This was a very clever jab by Shane Black to the current hype created by the media by over blowing every threat, and turning every attack into a frenzy. <br/><br/>Not to mention that it was a clever way of bringing back the post industrialist complex of Iron Man 1 and 2. The whole trilogy literally has a common and consistent theme. The post industrialist complex of evil businessmen and CEO's who could threaten the world, largely due to their immeasurable greed for money and power.<br/><br/>The message may not have been as clear as, say, the TDK trilogy, but it still stands, and its very popular in the contemporary world.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was amazing. I loved it. Best of the trilogy, and I hope that Iron Man returns.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","No one will doubt the fact that since 2008, the superhero movie genre has just simply exploded into a big-budget Hollywood money-making machine. I still remember the days when just this time 20 years ago, superhero movies were still a burgeoning - if not seriously overlooked (by the mainstream) - film genre, and Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman,"" or the first two ""Superman"" movies starring the late Christopher Reeve, were relegated as the best the genre had to offer.<br/><br/>Not anymore.<br/><br/>Superhero movies are a dime a dozen now, it would seem. While this was unheard-of in 1994, 20 years later, they're everywhere. It seems that on average, Hollywood is releasing at least two big-budget superhero films a year. This is good for comic book superhero fans who are finally seeing their (modern-day) versions of the ancient Greek gods get the big-screen treatments they deserve. And therein, for this viewer, lies the biggest problem with the latest crop of superhero movies.<br/><br/>In past reviews, I've made no attempt to hide the deep love and respect I have for comic books and superheroes. 10 years ago, I got the opportunity to see what I still consider to be the greatest superhero film of all time - ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) - in the theater. Of course, at that time, the superhero movie genre was still gaining wider prominence and acceptance in Hollywood (and by extension, the rest of the mainstream as a whole), and was not the commercial fad that it is now.<br/><br/>My problem with the latest crop of superhero movies - meaning most of the films made since 2008 - is that the genre has become formulaic and commercialized. The earlier films made in the second wave of superhero films 10 years ago, and even the films made earlier than that, whether good or bad, were clearly driven by passionate filmmakers who understood the medium and at least tried to give their films some deeper meaning or dramatic/thematic complexity; Donner, Burton, Proyas, Raimi, Singer, and others knew what they were doing back then. I don't really see this type of cinematic artistry, and craft, much anymore; most films are just big, empty, glossy-looking blockbuster spectacles with no greater depth to them than any other major Hollywood film.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that Hollywood has effectively hijacked what was once the most novel and original of film genres and turned it into formula. There have been occasional flashes of brilliance or originality - ""Chronicle"" (2012) has so far been the biggest ""original"" (meaning not based on pre-existing material) movie made during this time, and I'm sure we were all over-joyed with James Gunn's smart-alecky ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" earlier this year.<br/><br/>But I got way off-track here, and I must go back to what we were talking about originally, which is 2013's ""Iron Man 3."" ""Iron Man 3"" is perhaps the darkest ""Iron Man"" to come out yet. One of the biggest regrets I've ever had of this particular Marvel Comics cinematic franchise, is that Marvel's Man of Iron, Tony Stark, has had some of the most harrowing and dramatic personal battles of any superhero since Peter Parker/Spider-Man. While Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired, pitch-perfect casting as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the films have regretfully avoided the deeper dramatic possibilities that made the original comic book character so fascinating: of course, Tony Stark is arguably the most famous superhero to have ever struggled with the perils of drug addiction (alcoholism).<br/><br/>While a great inventor and superhero in his own right, underneath the armor, Stark was still a normal human being, and he was vulnerable to the same personal afflictions that could affect any one of us. That was what drew readers to his adventures, both personal and societal, and it was always this dynamic that made it interesting in seeing how he overcame it all. The ""Iron Man"" films have largely taken the ""safer"" (commercial) route.<br/><br/>In this third cinematic outing, set just before the Christmas holidays, Stark is still his big old arrogant self, though for some reason he's suffering the effects of PTSD as a result of the events of ""The Avengers"" (2012). This time out, he's battling a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who may or may not also be connected to yet another corporate rival named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). In the meantime, Stark must also try to rebuild his crumbling relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and maintain his friendship with Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who also moonlights as War Machine (who has since been renamed as the more politically-correct ""Iron Patriot"" by his government sponsors); regretfully, Cheadle's War Machine is pretty much nothing more than a cameo here.<br/><br/>The first two ""Iron Man"" pictures were directed by Jon Favreau (who also returns as Happy Hogan, though he's also been pretty much reduced to nothing more than a cameo here), while this latest effort is co-written and directed by ""Lethal Weapon"" scribe Shane Black. Anyone who remembers Black knows that he was pretty much the screen-writing master behind several witty dialogue-driven action blockbusters - think ""The Last Boy Scout"" (1991) - back in the '80s and early '90s (before the arrival of Quentin Tarantino), so it's no surprise that virtually every bit of dialogue written here is a one-liner with an exclamation point at the end.<br/><br/>I already stated my ambivalence toward this film series, but I can take pleasure in the fact that this might be the last, and that at least Iron Man seems to fare better when paired up with other superheroes. Robert Downey, Jr. is his usual appealing self, but the movie itself is also a disappointment, if not a completely enjoyable disappointment.<br/><br/>7/10"
"TheAvenger95","7","0","2","11 August 2014"," A movie that could have been better executed, yet still succeeds in what it wanted to do.
","'Iron Man 3' takes off where 'Marvel's The Avengers' ended. After an invasion by an alien horde, led by the Asgardian Loki, the world is adjusting to the idea of aliens and monsters and gods inhabiting the universe; and our hero, Tony Stark, is left with mental scars and panic attacks after the battle of New York. Not only that, but he now has a few ghosts from his past to take care of as well: a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (who was responsible for Tony's kidnapping and multiple other evil-doings throughout the movies), and Aldrich Killian – a scientist gone mad after an event revolving around Tony Stark and broken promises.<br/><br/>This is by far the best character driven movie of all the Marvel movies thus far - which is a nice change of pace. In terms of story, there is quite a few things left to be desired, but if you're not going to nit- pick or analyze it too harshly, you'll enjoy the overall narrative. The pacing was quite brisk, which was fantastic. The previous Iron Man movies had a much steadier pace (and a fairly underwhelming third act), but this beast was the exact opposite: you never know where it's going next and it doesn't ever stop to catch a breath.<br/><br/>The main characters were all very well fleshed out. Robert Downey Jr. took his performance to a whole new level. We see such a different side of the character we've grown used to over the past few years, and it worked extremely well... If anything, the end of the movie really makes you wonder where things will go next. Because of that, this movie will ""reignite"" many people's interest in this character (other movie franchises such as the Pirates of the Caribbean could learn a thing or two from this). Don Cheadle (Rhodey) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) had much more important roles this time round, which was great. I don't feel like I have more respect or admiration for the characters after seeing the movie, but it was nice that they were given something to work with besides ""best friend"" and ""love interest"". Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of The Mandarin character will be a love/hate thing with most, but whichever way you feel, there's no denying it: his actual performance was good. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) kind of played the token ""evil scientist"" role. Even his motivations for doing what he does comes across as a cliché, but for the most part, he's an enjoyable character... despite being a little forgettable. The ""kid-helper"", Harley Keener, was something I was very nervous about, and the inclusion of such a character could very well have ruined the movie, but oddly, it worked! I'm not a fan of child actors, but this kid didn't come across as the usual ""Oh golly! I'm a little kid helping a superhero!""-type character. It actually felt very real and the chemistry between him and RDJ was great. The other characters weren't given much to do unfortunately... so there isn't really anything worth pointing out on that front.<br/><br/>As far as the action and VFX goes, it was insane. Visually, this is a very different movie than any of the other Marvel movies - and I can't stress that enough... DIFFERENT. In a way, it almost felt a little too far out there at times (especially with the ways in which Stark now ""suits up""), but when you have Norse gods and green rage monsters in the same ""world"", I think it's a given that people should provide a little leeway if they want to enjoy the ride. Some if the CGI shots seemed overly fake (again, mainly the way in which Stark gets in and out of his suits), but there are plenty of brilliant shots that'll make you forget about those. In terms of spectacle and scale, don't let the early reactions fool you: this isn't as big as The Avengers, or as funny - but it is the closest we might get in a while. For me, the action wasn't as memorable as The Avengers' either. For instance, in The Avengers we had iconic superhero fights and moments, whereas in this one, I couldn't really find any iconic ""poses"" or ""moves"".<br/><br/>Other aspects of the film: The score was great. It's not as memorable as Ramin Djawadi's score for the first movie, but this one will most definitely go down as one of the more memorable scores in superhero-movie-history. The 3D was surprisingly exceptional. There aren't many pop-out effects, and that's exactly what makes it work so well! It adds depth and makes you feel closer to the characters. In fact, some of the best 3D moments in this movie were during the intimate, dialogue driven scenes. The post credit scene was fun. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it was super fun. That scene at the end really ties the movie up in a nice little bow.<br/><br/>One's enjoyment of the movie really depends on where one's loyalties lie. If you're just a casual movie fan, looking for a good time, you'll love this movie. However, if you're a comic book die-hard or a cinephile, I think there might very well be a few things that'll annoy you, and distract you from enjoying the film to its fullest. My advice would be to go into the theater with an open mind, and your expectations dialed down a bit. Also, don't try and compare it to The Avengers (which is what I tried to do) - if you can do that, you'll have a fantastic time.<br/><br/>In summation, I'd like to reiterate that this is a wonderful, character- driven film, and extremely different from any of MCU's other films. The director's vision is something that was also apparent throughout. It makes me excited to see what Marvels Studios has in store for us next..."

","What a super fantastic super hero movie this is! THE best of the Iron Man Trilogy (assuming that this is the last Iron Man).<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley could not have done a better job with his role as Trevor Slattery. He was hilarious. <br/><br/>The film itself had many clichés and we can hardly pretend that we didn't know what was going to happen, it's a super hero movie after all. So what makes this different from any other comic book brought to life on the silver screen? <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. <br/><br/>He is the best choice for a role that I've come across in years. I truly cannot see anyone else filling his shoes as Tony Stark. Tony Stark is an arrogant rich bastard who you will want to hate, but can't. He is the kind of man you want to punch in the face punch again and then kiss it better. Or if you're a straight man, reach out your hand to help him up and pad him on the shoulder. His sarcasm is perfectly timed and executed and Robert Downey Jr. seems to just naturally have that. One of the key ingredients that makes this such a MARVELous film.<br/><br/>Pepper Pots never came across as a helpless, defenceless woman, but in this film she really gets to show how spicy she can be, throwing all kinds of emotions at you in a single scene towards the end.<br/><br/>There were several moments which were suggestive teasers for the upcoming Avengers movie; Age Of Ultron. I truly cannot wait!"

The perennial teenager has trouble dealing like an adult. Downey really shows his chops as an actor, probably drawing on his own troubled past as source material -- he's got a lot and he needs it for this role. Paltrow really steps up for this one. We have seen her as the tough business woman, now we see her as the survivor. The writing isn't great. The effects are overdone. It might have been better if it was just 5 minutes shorter. Still, you really can't miss it, it's part of the saga and you will enjoy seeing Downey at his acting best"

","There are many negative reviews about the movie, many of them with good points. But there are two issues I don't agree with the rest of the audience. <br/><br/>The first one is the terrorist character issue. I think there is a message under this narrative, connecting the mandarin with bin laden. Producers unsuccessfully tries to show public how easily opinions can be manipulated and how easily false enemies forged. A noble try to add story line a purpose but they fail big time and this effects the movie badly. <br/><br/>The second issue is the time characters spent outside of the armor. This is also a good try to give the stark character a trait of a hero thinking he is just a guy with tech. But this is a mundane effort since he does have traits, and pretty good ones I say.

"Maziun","4","0","3","9 April 2014"," Why I didn't like Iron man 3""
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS 1. A dark and gritty movie about Iron man ? I was skeptical before I saw the movie and sadly my fears were confirmed. What works for grim heroes like Batman , Daredevil and Punisher doesn't work for light and colorful character like Tony Stark. All those deep themes like ""You betrayed your beliefs"" or ""Terrorism is bad"" were just unconvincing and annoying.<br/><br/>2. The 9/11 references worked well in ""The Dark knight trilogy"" , but here they feel completely forced and unnecessary.<br/><br/>3. The love story between Tony and Pepper is TOO melodramatic.<br/><br/>4. The whole Tony suffers insomnia and panic attacks after the events of ""Avengers"" on paper seems like a good idea , but it was very heavy handed here. Not to mention that all those panic attacks ""magically"" disappear after the kid gives Tony advice ""You're a mechanic. Build something"". Despite all the bad things happening later , Tony doesn't show any sign of panic attacks to the end of movie.<br/><br/>5. The idea of showing that Tony is a hero without the suit is good , but was badly done. I mean when Tony fights with the mutant woman or defeats the guards in Miami it's simply unrealistic. When and where he did learn to do that ? Bruce Wayne had martial arts training , but Tony Stark didn't. Yet , he defeated the guards and woman without any problem in style of Jason Bourne. For further insult near the end of the movie Tony shows that he can't shoot at all.<br/><br/>6. Tony announces his home address ON TV FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW. I understand he was mad at Mandarin at that time , but this was simply STUPID. He endangered himself not only Mandarin , but also to journalists , fans and other people. He wouldn't have any kind of privacy after that.<br/><br/>7. Tony's mansion is well equipped with wonderful gadgets and technology , yet it doesn't have any kind of security. No alarms , no force field , no nothing .<br/><br/>8. When somebody attacks your home you have to fight with him wearing a prototype suit that will almost certainly fail you at the most unwanted moment.<br/><br/>9. I find it totally unbelievable that Tony and Maya survived the missile attack. Pepper had the suit , so it's not strange that she survived , but the others should turn into pieces of meat.<br/><br/>10. Quaillan motivations for revenge on Tony Stark seems to be based on the fact that Stark wasn't nice to him. I'm sorry , but that's just lame.<br/><br/>11. The twist with Mandarin was rather predictable. Mostly , because Ben Kingsley wasn't one bit convincing in that part. Sure , when the ""secret"" was out he was good as the drunk actor , but not as Mandarin.<br/><br/>12. Quaillan as the main villain isn't really interesting , despite good performance by Guy Pearce. It would be much better if Mandarin really was the main villain and a faithful one to the comics.<br/><br/>13. I'm sick of another Hollywood movie when the president of USA is basically saint.<br/><br/>14. Gwyneth Paltrow in black bikini and with superpowers defeating the main villain ? PATHETIC.<br/><br/>15. Don Cheadle just like in ""Iron man 2"" proves here that he doesn't fit the part of Rhodes/War Machine at all. Terrence Howard was MUCH better.<br/><br/>16. Tony had AN ARMY OF IRON MAN'S all this time , yet like a lost idiot he called them at the very end ! Why ?! He could called them from the moment the kid repaired Jarvis . At least one of them . It would certainly made things easier for him , but NOOOOOOO.<br/><br/>17. Tony had to wear electromagnet in last two ""Iron man"" movies to survive because there was no other way for him to live. Here , ""magically"" , without no explanation he simply removes them thanks to an operation. HOW ?! I thought it was impossible to do ?!<br/><br/>The special effects are good , the humor is nice and the acting is solid , but otherwise this is a completely disappointing sequel. The story is dumb , the action scenes lack excitement and the movie takes itself way too seriously. I give it 4/10."

","After one year following the events of ""The Avengers"", Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is trying to live a quiet life with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). But a series of panic attacks and escalating threats from a maniac called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) threaten to tip him over the edge.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau is not directing the third entry of the ""Iron Man"" movies, and instead has passed the mantle to Shane Black. Though it's not as good as the original ""Iron Man"", the third entry of the series is still funny, and character driven on Tony Stark.<br/><br/>In this film, Tony Stark loses his flash car and big house. He is also, for a sizeable stretch of the movie, deprived of his super-suits. This is a new, vulnerable side to the playboy-philanthropist: he's on the run, in the corner, pausing between quips to suffer breathless anxiety attacks. And I like that because know we get to see Tony Stark mostly outside the suit; moreover, it shows that he can get around without the suit. <br/><br/>However, there are problems with the film. Even though I did like the first movie, I will admit that all three movies have a common problem: the villains aren't interesting. So far, Iron Man has faced a bald Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke and a cockatoo. While The Mandarin was an improvement from the second films' villain, it's still the film's weak point. In this film, Stark goes up against a squad of mutants that can mutate and regenerate at will. And while that's all cool, it's still unmotivated, murky, and unconvincing. Suffice to say that people will be talking about Ben Kingsley's performance for ages to come — it's a tricky, delicate role, handled beautifully.<br/><br/>It's a good comic book movie with lots of action, funny lines, and great interaction of characters. However, some of the characters seem to be a little off-key in this movie and are a bit bland. However, it's still a fun movie to watch. And if this does turn out to be Downey Jr.'s final solo outing, it's a very strong exit."

Cheadle is a very good actor but is not right for Iron Man. Howard was better and its to the detriment of the franchise that Marvel chose to replace him.<br/><br/>The film follows on from Iron Man 2 and makes the same mistakes. My car has more security to prevent someone stealing and driving it than your Iron Man suit. The ease in which you are able to modify and fly the Iron Man suit is quite unbelievable considering the difficulties Obadiah Stane had to go through to construct his own suit in Iron Man 1.<br/><br/>What they done with some of the film characters divergence away from their comic equivalent was very disappointing.<br/><br/>Worse of all in the movie was the spectacular ending, which was a case unbelievable spectacular nonsense.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of action, good moments between Downey Jr and Paltrow but very little sense. One of those movies that is best to leave your brain at home. You will watch once but wont want to watch again."

","First off, I throughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It had great action, acting, special effects, humour and other things I could be missing. But what kills this movie for me was its writing and the Mandarin.<br/><br/>First off let me begin with the Mandarin. What the heck did they do with that character?? I have no disrespect for Ben Kingsley as he brought life to his role but they turned that character into some cheap clown that could be used in a comedy show. In the movie trailer they made it look like the Mandarin was going to be a killer enemy for Tony Stark and I was very excited. But the end result out of it? An utter disappointment and a misleading way to get my money.<br/><br/>The second was the writing. The quality of the writing felt bland, and in some parts predictable.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was still pretty good but it is considered as the weakest Ironman film for me."
"WheelzFourReelz","7","0","2","2 March 2014"," Iron Man 3 is an enjoyable, albeit disappointing, conclusion to the Iron Man trilogy
","If there was any movie that I was really excited for at the beginning of the year, it was Iron Man 3. The trailers of that movie looked awesome! Recently, I went to go see the movie with my entire middle school. Was it as good as I thought it was going to be? Not quite. In this movie, Tony Stark is having a moral crisis. He's having nightmares and he's gotten crazy with creating suites. Meanwhile, a new villain named The Mandarin comes in and threatens America. Tony must find out the secret behind the Mandarin and discover himself as well. Okay, now onto the review. The story of Tony Stark is good. It shows more of an intense, serious side of Tony, which is nice to see. But it is ruined by the plot behind The Mandarin. It's really dorky and cheesy. It tries to be funny, but it comes off stupid with one of the most unnecessary plot twists ever. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but it's disappointing. It's too bad, because the first half of the movie was doing great! When the plot twist happened, it got ruined. Another problem I have with the movie is the humor. I know they're trying to be funny and quirky, but some of the jokes come out forced and unnecessary. I was kind of hoping it would be more serious, dark, and intense. Nope. The jokes are still funny and definitely chuckle worthy, but some of them weren't needed. What also bugged me was that Iron Man 3 didn't have enough Iron Man in it. Yes, Tony Stark made a lot of suites, and yes, he fights in them, but that's about it. This is more about Tony Stark as a person, and not as much as him as Iron Man. They could've called this movie ""Tony Stark- The Movie"" and be just fine. You may think I hate this movie from the looks of it, but the movie is actually pretty good. It had a lot of good elements, like the acting. The acting is good and believable. Sometimes you can see the stress in people. I may have complained that there isn't enough ""Iron Man"" in the movie, but it's also pretty good. It makes Tony a really believable and relatable character. I like how he acts less of a playboy and more of a man with his own weaknesses and more vulnerability. This is nice! I like this! The best part of this movie is the special effects. They are amazing. (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT): My jaw literally dropped when Stark's tower collapsed. (SPOILER OVER) They looked so realistic and cool! Very flashy! The fight scenes are very flashy as well. It's pretty intense and exciting. It's probably the most brutal Iron Man movie yet! Overall, the movie was good, but disappointing. It had a lot of good elements, like the story behind Iron Man, the acting, the believability of Tony Stark, the special effects, and the fight scenes. What really hurt the movie was the Mandarin plot. It's a good movie, but it's not as good as Iron Man 1 or 2. It's still definitely worth a watch. Just don't expect A+ quality material."

"The_paranoid_android","9","0","2","8 February 2014"," Iron Man 3 proves its mettle...
","Iron Man 3 is the seemingly 'finale' to the Iron Man trilogy with this particular tale focused on Tony Stark's most personal battle yet. A sequel to both Iron Man 2 and The Avengers simultaneously, the movie deals with Tony Stark, developing a crippling case of an anxiety disorder who obsesses over creating more and more Iron Man suits to be prepared for any possible attack. After dealing with Gods, aliens, and living legends, Tony has realized that he and his loved ones are more vulnerable to attack than he originally thought. This couldn't come at a worse time as a new terrorist bogeyman, The Mandarin, has begun a campaign of fear with an almost mythical sense of anonymity. After one particular attack that hits close to home, Stark publicly challenges The Mandarin, leading to a retaliation where Stark is on the run relying on his wits, rather than his armor, to save the day.<br/><br/>What gets me boiled is that people get the wrong impression about this film. There is one particular revelation which is a big ""gotcha"" moment that was absolutely brilliant. The film's thematic content lies in the idea of identity, status, and keeping up an image - something that Tony Stark and nearly every character in the film deals with, including the humble Happy Hogan who finally gets more of an opportunity to shine than in the previous iterations of the franchise. The narrative gives way to a political-espionage/detective story of Tony piecing together the mystery of The Mandarin, the source of his attacks, and how he fits in the puzzle. A great mystery yarn is peppered with terrific action scenes (including an air-rescue scene and a big-finale fight that will go down as some of the best in the superhero genre) alongside a fairly damning portrayal of the current military industrial complex and the rather absurd concept of the American government's idea of ""keeping the peace."" Robert Downey Jr. is awesome as Tony Stark, but that almost doesn't require mentioning. Gweneyth Paltrow is really able to come out into her own in this film as Pepper, who was usually treated as the stability anchor for Tony, gets to be the voice of reason and gets plenty bad-ass moments of her own. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is an absolute treat; a charismatic industrial leader who's spurn by Tony gives him unforeseen motivations. Rebecca Hall plays Maya Hansen, and while she's fine in the role, there isn't terribly too much for her to do outside of provide some key plot elements and give some pretty good banter coming back as one of Tony's old flames.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley plays The Mandarin, and he turns it up to 11. I won't reveal too much of his character, as discovering who he is remains one of the highlights of the movie, but let me just say that Kingsley's Mandarin had me thinking about his performances weeks after the movie was over. Although some fans might not like his interpretation of The Mandarin (but given that the original source material essentially had him as the ""fu-manchu"" Asian stereotype that is as offensive to the Chinese as ""Uncle Tom"" is to black-Americans), it's a terrific turn in terms of storytelling that not only connects deeply with the themes portrayed in the film, but offers a terrific surprise that I guarantee you no one will be able to guess. To paraphrase The Mandarin, ""you'll never see him coming."" <br/><br/>Give this film a chance, embrace the story, and I PROMISE you, you'll walk away from Iron Man 3 with a burning desire to turn right around and see it again!<br/><br/>..."

So his house gets attacked and he's on the hunt to figure out what is going on with mysterious explosions. Eventually we find out there is new technology that allows people to build up heat and they can shoot fireballs and melt things. Tony finally tracks down the Mandarian, and it turns out he is more of a joke.

","Guess it was going to be inevitable but after two great solo movies and then the also excellent Avengers film, 'Iron Man' was bound to hit a rut. Sadly, that's this film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is ever watchable as always: witty, sharp and devilishly charming. However, the story lends little to help him and I just could not find much to enjoy in it. Maybe there were too many characters this time, plus what was the point of the addition of the wee boy sidekick? It's a faux pas alongside the little guy in Temple of Doom.<br/><br/>Guy Pearce is a fine actor but didn't seem to have much real airtime as the villain and then little developed. The story wasn't helping, it was uninteresting, and actually seemed to be little Iron Man but too much Tony Stark. That isn't necessarily bad, but the writers seemed to not know what to do with Tony Stark.<br/><br/>Okay, the effects are on par with the previous films and the action is good, but by the time it all kicked off for the finale, I just wasn't into it by this point. I don't want to give much away, but some of it was too clichéd.<br/><br/>Disappointed with this but I know Iron Man will be back on track in some time, and I hope it's the next Avengers movie, plus I hope Downey Jr does reprise his role for more sole Iron Man movies. Despite this film, he has more than proved that he deserves that honour."

","I had to write, there are so many terrible reviews of this film - but most seem to be written by Marvel fans devoted to the character ""The Mandarin"".<br/><br/>If you know who this character is going in, you may well be disappointed. I didn't. So I wasn't.<br/><br/>Instead, what I got what a film that sees Tony Stark laid low and spending most of the film out of his iron suit and trying to rebuild from a tool shed with the help of a young boy. It's Tony Stark's ""Rocky 3"" if you like and for that reason, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes but they are relatively minor ones. They could easily have been explained by a couple of clunky lines of exposition which the screenwriters wisely decided not to bother with - you can fill in the blanks yourself if you like. I think the real reason for the virulent backlash to this film are the fact that it doesn't fit with the characters as previously defined in the comics.<br/><br/>But if you don't give a hoot about ""canon"" and ""mythos"" and the ""Marvel Universe"" and all that, then you'll be fine."
"BrianNIL25","7","0","1","28 December 2013"," Seduced by Tony Starks
","Now here's a cool movie. Driven by the personality of the character Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.'s iconic role), Writer-director Shane Black along with Writer Drew Pearce have churned out a film that charms us in spite of ourselves, similar to the way a young, unattached Starks might lure a young woman under his sheets. And like those conquests, we allow ourselves to be duped even though we see it coming.<br/><br/>Even if we haven't watched another Iron Man film, we know this character—cocky/funny, so cool that sometimes he impresses his own self, but with a heart of gold, if not a chest arc reactor, underneath it all. It's the role that defines Robert Downey Jr. as an actor. Whether the man was this character before he took on the role or Tony Starks consumed him is a matter of the chicken and the egg, but to the fans of late night talk shows, the difference between the real man's personality and that of his character is zilch. It makes you wonder if he's doing any acting.<br/><br/>The film opens in the standard fashion of the third movie of a trilogy, if I'm to believe the words of a self-aware character in the third ""Scream"" installment—it takes us back into the past and develops a story-line that was lurking all along. Starks tells us as much as he narrates the introduction scene. So we know this is going somewhere—somebody is going to get slighted and hatch some diabolical plan. Starks lures a beautiful botanist (the lovely Rebecca Hall) into bed while raising the hopes of a fledgling scientist (Guy Pearce, in a bland role) desperate to speak with him. If he happens to disappoint either one of them, that's just Starks being Starks, plus he can always fall back on the old standby that he was drunk.<br/><br/>We fast forward to the present and find Starks taking a break from the superhero game, dealing with anxiety stemming from the aftermath of his last adventure, and tinkering around with building new Iron Men. Yes, for those uninitiated, He Is Iron Man. And the innovations to his new prototype suit will be utilized later in the film in any creative way imaginable, as well as the numerous older models. In fact, the artificial intelligence Starks has installed into his suits surpasses the intelligence and wit of most humans, and it in itself could be considered superhero material. Alas, Tony's tinkering days seem numbered as a new threat appears on the national stage, a menacing terrorist known as the Mandarin. When we see the Mandarin played by the distinguished Ben Kingsley, we know something's up. This is going to be a juicy role, and when his true nature is revealed, we are far from disappointed. For now, the character confuses us. He says some wise things about human nature amidst Native American imagery, and seems to even brandish a Native American accent, but he also appears to be your stereotypical Middle-Eastern terrorist. What exactly are his motives and aims, to take over the world or what? This part of the movie was not well developed to me, and becomes murkier when more Bad Guys pile up. <br/><br/>As Tony Starks investigates this new threat, supporting characters go a long way in playing off of Starks' personality. It leads to a lot of wisecracks and clever lines—a lot of comedy—which all manage to set Starks up for the one-liner to trump them all. I was especially impressed by a young boy who kind of serves as a young Tony Starks, played skillfully by Ty Simpkins. Starks and the script don't infantilize the boy, but respect the character by providing him with just the right amount of intelligence and maturity. Yes, little boys can be strong characters post Star Wars Episode I, featuring a mop-topped little Annie contractually obligated to yell, ""Yippee!"" in every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The makers of this film have keyed into Starks so much that he doesn't even need to wear the Iron Man suit for much of the movie. Maybe because I generally don't like superhero movies or tedious action, I didn't hate them for it, and since his character has been developed over three movies previous to this one, every other character can just riff and react to him. Starks drags us and his suit along and it doesn't really matter who wants to take over the world and why. At times the character so coolly goes about his business that I wish the role carried some extra gravitas, but I do get a sense of that later on when Iron Man must deal with an incident on a plane. This is one moment when we're reminded that Iron Man is a superhero in a sequence that you just may find exhilarating if you remembered to check that disbelief. Still, I never got the sense that the stakes were that high or Iron Man was in any real peril. And the closing action sequence for a movie like this always seems to take place in some dreary abandoned warehouse or its equivalent, and this is film is no exception.<br/><br/>The film has more than one surprise, which goes a long way to offset its standard comic book clichés. The Iron Man suit does everything we imagine it can potentially do and more, in ways that both pleasantly surprise us and cheat us. Seeing Jon Favreau in the film in what basically amounts to a cameo, although a character vital to running the plot, took me out of the movie. It made me think, oh, that's the guy who directed the first Iron Man; did he direct this one too? Directors, in this case former directors, need to avoid putting themselves in movies. Especially if their name is M. Night Shayamalan . And the movie's longer than you want it to be. But it's entertaining and exceeded my expectations."
"mgruebel","6","0","1","25 December 2013"," Not bad for a third installment
","Superhero movies go through a cycle: In the first, we learn about the formation of the hero; this one is usually my favorite (Darkman or Unbreakable come to mind, both better films because they knew to ""stop when you're on top""). The second installment usually descends into mindless action, with no character development to speak of. Then in the third, the hero is beginning to have self-doubts, making it more interesting again.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is no exception to this loose rule, better than 2, not as good as 1. It pits our cynical and flippant hero against a cynical and flippant evil mastermind, who uses an Osama-bin-laden look-alike actor as his face to the world to rev up business for human fighting machines he has created.<br/><br/>The film is filled with plot holes (for example, an Iron Man costume with unidentified occupant is allowed onto Air Force One without a check, hello), and physically impossible action (Iron Man catches a dozen people falling from a plane, and the two hanging on from him, from whose hands hang six more each, don't lose their grip under a > 1000 pound force as Iron Man brakes just before they hit the ground). The surrealism is about at the level of another fairly successful action movie from summer '13, Olympus is Down. In neither movie does it matter, it's about the action. In both films the main actor manages enough charisma to move things along despite glaring script inadequacies.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is surprisingly introspective, with plenty of action but also quieter passages between Tony and Pepper, Tony and a kid who helps him out, Tony dealing with anxiety attacks from his Avenger stint, even Tony and the Osama-bin-laden stand-in. It gets a plus for that. It gets a minus for being so self-conscious about its one-liners that it has to comment on them! Might as well face it: nobody beats Bond or Arnold at that game.<br/><br/>The movie is certainly worth the while for Marvel fans, and everyone else, see #1, skip #2 and go straight to #3. You'll be better entertained that way."

","Before I start this review I must say I am not a fan of the marvel films. I thought that Avengers Assemble was a disappointment, Thor was Extremely boring and Captain America: The First Avenger was one of the worst films of 2011. I also will admit that I think the previous 2 Iron Man films were OK. So lets get started with this review.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was recommended by my brother who went to watch it in the cinema and said it was brilliant so I was expecting god things but boy was I wrong. The humour is weak, there is hardly any action and Robert Downey Jr's acting is terrible. However the worst thing is the Mandarin who only appears in the film for 10 minutes who is then revealed as a con artist and the real villain is Guy Pearce. This film is half an hour too long and Gwyneth isn't used enough.<br/><br/>Altogether this is one of the worst films of the year and I would not recommend this. This is one to avoid at all costs."
"rahmannoodles22","6","0","1","19 December 2013"," Iron Man 3 - Noodles Review
","8 out of 10 as a movie; 5 out of 10 as an Iron Man movie<br/><br/>You might've noticed my scoring of the movie and that's because it's a very awesome summer movie. But if you're a fan of comics and superheros (which I hugely am), you might feel a little different about it. If you're a die hard Iron Man fan, you'll probably be disappointed. I'm not saying it's a bad movie because it DEFINITELY is not. However, there are some points in the movie that could alter the enjoyment of the film. Iron Man 3 was my 4th most anticipated movie of 2013 (after Man of Steel, The Hobbit 2, and Elysium) and I wouldn't blame anyone for really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were insanely incredible. While the movie doesn't pull through as well as the trailers, it's still somewhat of a treat.<br/><br/>The premise of Iron Man 3 is actually quite interesting. It ties back to The Avengers in which Iron Man practically saved the whole world in the end. He gets anxiety and can't sleep at night because of his post-traumatic stress. The stuff really affected him big time. Then, The Mandarin has to come about and just bring him even more hell. I really liked the idea and where they were going with it. Tony Stark sort of has to use his wits and go on without the Iron Man suit for a bit. I liked that idea but it was a bit drawn out at times. However, the dialogue is quite on point (from the writer of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon so I would imagine so). Sometimes I felt the humor was a little overdone but, oh well, it's a summer movie, I'll deal with it. The humor does kind of have a purpose though. That's who Tony Stark is. He's a narcissist who throws in one liners whenever he wants. Robert Downey Jr. obviously owns the role; he was born to play Tony Stark. Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and he pretty much owns his role but we'll talk about his character a little later. Don Cheadle was great and I was happy to see how much more developed his character was in this movie. However, I didn't really care about Pepper Potts in this movie as much as I did in previous movies, even though the movie tries to make you care about her. One character the movie did good at making you care about early on was The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley pretty much owns the role and I was expecting him to be awesome. If you don't get the gist of The Mandarin; he's the archnemesis of Iron Man, his most important villain. Joker to Batman, Lex Luthor to Superman, Green Goblin to Spiderman, Mandarin to Iron Man. You gotta do him well. However something happens that just completely splits the decision of whether or not you can enjoy the rest of the film. But I won't say it since this is a spoiler-free review; I'll only do a spoiler filled review if enough of you guys ask for it. Anyways, it's a pretty pivotal sequence in the movie. When you watch the movie, I guarantee you'll know what I'm talking about. It was a great move as a film. But as an Iron Man film, it just wasn't the way it should've been done.<br/><br/>A lot of what I didn't like about the movie are spoilers, so I can't really elaborate big on them in detail. I'll say this: a lot of what happened was really cheesy and cartoony, while other things were cliché. That's the most I can say without spoiling anything. Additionally, there were some flaws in the conveyance of emotion, where I sort of felt for the characters but then something would happen that would completely change that. But still, the action is pretty sweet in this movie. Whenever the suit just latches itself onto Tony Stark, I feel like I've seen some of the coolest things in the world. And the final battle is awesome! And that's something we didn't get with the first two Iron Man movies. It was really entertaining and I was totally amazed until the end of it... another totally cliché scene occurred. However, I rolled with it and watched the rest of the movie, which ended up being a lot of important scenes, going through unnoticeably in about a minute or two.<br/><br/>All in all, Iron Man 3 is definitely better than Iron Man 2 but can't quite get up to the level that the first Iron Man did. I'd say it's the most entertaining of the series for casual movie goers though. It has some awesome action and insanely cool special effects. There's subtle humor pretty much everywhere in the movie and Tony Stark is still a very lovable character. However, it does get kinda drawn out at some points, and cartoony at other times. As a regular movie, I give it 8 out of 10 Noodles. But, I can't deny my own feelings of the directions taken in this movie that really detracted from the experience for me, big time. It really doesn't compare to the level of emotion and amazement of the first movie, or the level of epicness that The Avengers reached. If adding the disappointing aspects of the movie as an Iron Man film, it's 5 out of 10 Noodles. I guess that averages it out at a 6.5, but in spite of that, I wouldn't really have a problem watching it again"
"tieman64","Null","0","1","5 December 2013"," Zero Complex
","Directed by Shane Black, ""Iron Man 3"" sees actor Robert Downey Jr returning as Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons contractor, playboy and superhero.<br/><br/>Whilst wholly routine, the film goes off in some new directions. Here Stark is undergoing an existential crisis, the poor guy fearful of death, personal limitations and apprehensive about using his Iron Man suit. In short, Stark has both a hero complex and an inferiority complex. The film is thus packed with several symbolic moments, Stark fighting in semi-exposed suits, remotely from a distance (using automated drones) and acutely aware of his frail human body. Elsewhere the film questions the fascism of the genre, by having its chief ""villain"" be an Osama Bin Laden proxy created by the US Government to stoke fears. This Bin Laden proxy is played by Ben Kingsley, who manages yet another totally ridiculous, racially dubious role.<br/><br/>When ""Iron Man 2"" was released, many believed that the only way the franchise could get more mad-cap was to hire Shane Black, throw in an R rating and have the film model Black and Downey's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". ""Iron Man 3"" doesn't have a R rating, but it was written/directed by Black. Strangely, this results in a film that is less zany than its predecessors. And whilst ""Kiss Kiss"" was a postmodern smörgåsbord, gleefully proud of its irreverence and irrelevance, Black's ""Iron Man 3"" is a staid, turgid thing. Maybe it's the Marvel Effect. The recent ""Avengers"" killed all of Joss Whedon's gleeful excesses too, drowning imagination in dull money.<br/><br/>Unlike most superheroes, Iron Man has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, public figure, playboy, comedian, rich kid, toy-maker, invincible muscle man, billionaire industrialist and one man military industrial complex. Whilst most superheroes function as power fantasies, Iron Man goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.<br/><br/>7.5/10 - Worth one viewing."
"saheel-177","2","0","3","5 December 2013"," Just really stupid
","I would start off that the Dark Knight was a more realistic take on batman where it deviated a lot from the comic books. For Iron Man 3, I think Shane Black just used the large amount comic book material he had of the Mandarin, who btw is Ironman's arch nemesis, and just use to wipe his ass.<br/><br/>Firstly, I would say that I somewhat enjoyed how they made Tony Stark scared about the prospect of aliens and another world because of his avengers wormhole incident. I also enjoyed that Ben Kingsley, a really well-known and credited actor, was playing the Mandarin. The set up for the Mandarin as just excellent. I liked how they made him really evil and just all round horrible man, with no care for humans.<br/><br/>However, my compliments end there because we find out that the 'Mandarin' is just some dumbass named Trevor. I mean seriously? You needed Gandhi for that? And btw if they wanted to go that direction of misleading the audience, then they should've done the same thing from batman begins. Replace one Mandarin with another Mandarin like replace one Ra's Al Ghul with the real Ra's Al Ghul. And many people would argue that Guy Pearce's character said he was the Mandarin. I wouldn't take it as if he meant that he was the Mandarin from the comics with the ten rings and all. I would take it as if he meant that he was responsible for all the threats and attacks not the useless Trevor. Another complaint I have is that Tony Stark wasn't smart in this movie as he is normally is. We are told in the film that he is smart but he made so many stupid decisions like: 1. Giving his address to the enemy 2. Not knowing that there is a missile flying towards his mansion until he sees it on the news. 3. Not using his 42 Iron man suits against those helicopters shooting at his house 4. And only using his 42 Iron man suits on an oil tanker (yeah that's safe) 5. Making Iron man suits that crumple like tin foil but apparently can withstand Thor's Hammer? (Technically inconsistency in the storyline) 6. The president not using the Iron Patriot suit to fly to safety when he is hung(technically the president's idiocy) or not having JARVIS remotely fly the suit to safety. <br/><br/>To be honest, the only point to this film is that Iron Man is a major source of income to Disney Marvel and they need a way to continue from the avengers. So those who want to watch this film....don't watch it. Just don't watch it."

","Shane Black's hilarious comic book movie spoof!<br/><br/>Ostensibly a Diznee franchise sequel, the latest entry in megalomaniac capitalist Tony Stark's cybernetic journal is nothing more than a parody of what has come before, a special effects-stuffed turkey whose stale, cold leftovers would not even satisfy a porky Comic Con fan boy.<br/><br/>The cowards at Marvel, afraid to unleash a truly righteous villain against Stark's falsely patriotic robot alter ego, dump the bin Laden-like Mandarin character halfway through this loud, prolonged video game masquerading as cinema in favor of a fey, bare-chested Richard Branson knockoff intent on destroying the world and bedding Gwyneth Paltrow, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>The Mandarin is a phony, as fake as RDJ's waxen-faced performance, with the early scenes of revolutionary fervor and violent reaction to continued colonial oppression merely feints in a convoluted plot to – well, to get us to the end of the hopelessly overlong CGI spectacle. Capitalism rules the narrative, as it does the real world, so a tween boy's happiness spelled out in toys bought with Stark blood money is as close to a cheerful ending as this shameful cartoon can get. <br/><br/>Shane Black, who promised us his last action hero a couple of decades ago, is resurrected from Hollywood no man's land to fumble his way through the pixelated panels of this comic book disaster, tying it all together in a pretty digital package with much explosion and mayhem, his 1980's modus operandi.

This is no more evident in the fact that he allows his hot blond girlfriend to be turned into a genetically altered monster, then casually ""saves her life"" off screen, while in the coda he gets his heart repaired by the best surgeon money can buy: himself. This is a movie filled with such offhand adolescent irrelevancies. Adults could not care a whit about any of it.<br/><br/>If the bottom line overlords at Dizzy had allowed it, Iron Man should have gone metal boot to combat boot with the ""terrorist"" Mandarin, and then we'd see the real fallout of Stark's first insidious armorer's holiday to the Middle East (can you say Jericho missile, anyone). As Gandalf might say, ""dealing out death and judgment"" is not so easy. It certainly shouldn't be left to some smart ass arms company CEO.<br/><br/>Like the faux patriotism and plastic industrial America the movie's makers obviously worship, the CGI-blasted mayhem of the movie's climax is nothing but fake sighs and moans. All that matters is Stark gets his mojo back – and never has to face off against displaced people's anger. The Mandarin might be a ""terrorist,"" but as depicted in the first half of the movie he is certainly righteously angry - and very funny. Stark, Diznee, Marvel and all corporate goons deserve retribution at the hands of the people's chaos, but instead they sit around the board table chuckling at this prolonged SNL spoof they have concocted for the fan boys, and the millions r(e)aped in profits as yet another company boss wins the day."

","Ah yes. Iron Man 3. This movie could have been great, but it was a disappointment to me. RDJ and Paltraw are great as Stark and Pepper as usual, and Cheadle delivers another great performance, this time as Iron Patriot. And Ben Kingsley gave one of the best acting performances I have ever seen as The Mandarin/Trevor Slattery. I enjoyed seeing all the different suits, as well as the final fight scene. However, there definitely was NOT enough of Stark in the suit. This is an Iron Man movie. I WANT TO SEE IRON MAN!!! <br/><br/>Speaking of the Mandarin, that is what really brought this film down for me. I am a huge fan of the comic Mandarin, and to be teased about an Iron Man-Mandarin final showdown had me drooling. The reveal left me incredibly disappointed. And to make matters worse, they turned Guy Pearce into the Mandarin. Pearce gave one of the worst acting performances I have ever seen in this movie. I cringed at every scene he was in. And the story felt like it wasn't focused, just like Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun movie, but also a massive disappointment.<br/><br/>7/10"
"callanvass","7","0","1","19 November 2013"," It has issues, but the action definitely entertains you. It's a big step up from Iron Man II
","I really enjoyed the first one, but couldn't stand the second movie. In all honesty I wasn't looking forward to this one very much. Tony Stark is an abrasive hero, and I can either take him or leave him. This movie was a bit overlong, but I did enjoy it to a certain extent. I really liked how they made Tony Stark's character so vulnerable in this movie. He had so much to lose, and they went a bit of a different route. Tony isn't always arrogant in this movie. He has a lot of feelings, and many fears. They explore Tony's anxiety issues in this sequel, and I thought that was pretty ballsy. I was able to get behind the character more this time around because of it. I felt there were too many villains in this movie. It goes down the road of Superman 3 a little bit with how many villains it has, and ironically enough. I enjoyed Iron Man 3 as much as I enjoyed Superman III. It just felt like they were trying to stack the insurmountable odds for Tony Stark in this one. The women are especially underdeveloped. Why was Rebecca Hall here again? She looked great, but doesn't have much of a part. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the charming, damsel in distress for most of the movie before her character gets an admittedly cool twist in the finale. I'll just say it was a lot of fun. She even gets to be Iron Man succinctly in the beginning. How cool is that? It's just too bad I didn't feel much emotion from Downey & Paltrow when it came to their respective characters for their romance. Guy Pearce makes for a decent villain. Ben Kingsley feels wasted. Don Cheadle's patriotic Iron Man suit impressed me, but that's about it. The action is where this movie is at. It has many great action scenes, scattered throughout, but the finale is often breathtaking. It's filled with big stunts, explosions, and some amazing stuff. I definitely wasn't disappointed in the abundance of action<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This is a big step in the right direction. It's very flawed, but it has enough going for it to be an entertaining blockbuster. I'd be down for a part 4, as long as it's quality<br/><br/>7/10"

Iron Man has gone down to Earth, experiencing symptoms similar to PTSD, and is suddenly thrust into his job again by forces beyond his control. <br/><br/>There is a twist involving the true villain, and this actually works in the film's favor. The villain is usually who we least expect. Tony is crushed spiritually by his burdens, and this villain is smart enough to exploit that.

Now he's up against an evil techno genius played by Guy Pearce who's created an army of exploding warriors he plans to use to take over the world.<br/><br/>Written by Drew Pearce and director Shane Black, the plot isn't all that compelling this time around, but as usual, it is Robert Downey, Jr. who keeps the super hero relatable and life-sized amidst the crassness of the movie's multi-million dollar production values and special effects. Downey's greatest achievement is that he manages to be wisecracky and smart-alecky without becoming cynical. This is enhanced by the chemistry between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as his erstwhile ladylove and company CEO Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>The special effects are predictably spectacular - with a jumping-out-of-an-airplane scene an eye-popping, heart-stopping standout - but, as with the earlier films in the series, it's the humanity of the title character that makes it all work."
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","4 November 2013"," And the franchise continues
","Well, they have finished the Avengers so it seems that they are intending on continuing the franchise with Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America 2, before releasing the Avengers 3. So, what does Robert Downy Junior do in this movie – basically what he does in real life – minus the suit of course. I guess he suits the role of a billionaire playboy because he is a bit of a playboy, minus the billion dollars or course (I'm not sure if there are many billionaire actors out there, but then again, actors have never been known to be financial whizzes, since the Hollywood depiction of them are people with lots of money and no idea how to actually use it).<br/><br/>Okay, Downy does less of the billionaire playboy stuff here are more to the PTSD stricken superhero (which is not surprising since the only thing that makes him a superhero is his suit, and that electro-magnetic thing stuck in his chest that stops the metal shards from going into his heart). So, because a normal guy (or a normal human, at least, if we don't count the billion dollars to his name) thrown up against aliens, gods, and collapsing wormholes, then I guess it is somewhat realistic that he is going to have a bout of PTSD (as if flying around in an Iron suit isn't realistic – come on, we see that happen every day, don't we?).<br/><br/>I must say the bad guy was pretty cool in this film, or at least his name – 'The Mandarin'. Yeah, that's actually a pretty cool name for a bad guy. There is much more to it, and I will probably get punched in the face (metaphorically speaking of course since nobody actually knows where I live – okay, they know I live in Melbourne, but try finding me in a city of three million people).<br/><br/>Hey, Downy does that in this movie, except he gives out his address (as if they didn't know where he lived because he's a billionaire playboy, and one of the people with being a billionaire playboy is that, unfortunately, people happen to know where you live). They do pay him a visit, but as can be expected, keep their distance (it's amazing what a few rockets can do to a super heroes' hide out). Mind you, he's never been one for subtlety, especially how at the end of the movie there is one thing that we discover, he simply cannot keep a secret."

"TxMike","Null","0","2","20 October 2013"," Goes overboard in ""destruction"" but kept my attention the whole way.
","Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors that I just like to see in movies. No matter what the role I find him entertaining with his mix of serious and funny. To me he is what makes this a good movie. <br/><br/>Here he is back as Tony Stark, the wealthy inventor who made the first Iron Man suit while imprisoned in Afghanistan. (The movie does a very brief review of that.) He lives in a futuristic looking house that almost resembles a space ship, on a high bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This is an important fact, since one scene features the very graphic destruction of his house after he challenges the bad guys and gives out his address. But that gets a bit ahead of the story.<br/><br/>There is a new terrorist and he is bent on destroying the USA and its President. We see him in videos patched into regular TV programming feeds. He says he can't be stopped, he will always be ahead of his pursuers. Of course Iron Man Stark vows to find him and kill him. And that is what sparked his perhaps rash decision to give his exact address, although I don't think it would have been hard to find anyway. But it makes for a story element.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his love interest Pepper Potts, and Don Cheadle is back as Colonel James Rhodes who also uses one of the iron suits to fight crime.<br/><br/>The bad guy, no pun intended, turns out to be Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, someone who knew Stark back in 1999, and in the years since, along with his partner in crime, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, had developed a technology that was imperfect, sometimes it caused the person to explode, and that is why they could not find bomb or explosive fragments at the terrorist bombing sites.<br/><br/>So the story comes down to a contest between Stark and Killian, both capable fighters, to see if Iron Man can save the world yet again.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The man they saw on TV as the terrorist was Ben Kingsley, who played an actor named Trevor Slattery, hired by Killian and dressed in beard and Eastern garb, to disguise the fact that the real terrorists were scientists. With even more battles and destruction Stark finally gets rid of Killian, it seems, although maybe they were setting the stage for a sequel. Just entertaining fluff, lots of action. I never expected to see William Sadler as a President, but there he was as President Ellis."

"fachrial-ilham","7","0","1","10 October 2013"," Epic yet Dissatisfying
","It's epic. <br/><br/>But only for the action sequences for the story is lacking. Like the Dark Knight Trilogy that gives you an ending that lowers the bar for the previous two installments, this one does exactly that. Although the plot is greatly expanded - it's the aftermath of The Avengers - and digs deep into Stark's brilliant mind and into his psychological state after the event, it is shallow. <br/><br/>The improvement the movie did is they put Paltrow in a suit - which is a great nod to the comic book reference of Pepper Potts being another suited-hero named ""Rescue"" -, but then they took Happy - the ever funny and interesting sidekick/driver of Stark - out of the picture by blowing him half to hell in the beginning of the movie. Though that was probably Favreau's personal request to not to be included in the movie further than that, but still, this movie needs a character like him.<br/><br/>The thing that really put this movie off for me is probably the magical reference that the terrorist used. It's a scientific breakthrough made for medical purposes to regenerates one's cells rapidly(or whatever it was), it enabling them to grow cut off limbs in a second - this is probably Spongebob Squarepant's reference - emitting heat from the inside of their bodies, exploding like a nuclear even, and breath out fire which I found really ridiculous.<br/><br/>And the downfall was when they revealed the truth that the master villain introduced in the trailers - The Mandarin - is not really a villain at all. He is just a puppet used by Aldrich Killian, a long and agitated acquaintance of Stark with vengeance towards him, which obsessed in ruling the world and getting Pepper. Although a nice twist it was, I just did not feel the kick to it.<br/><br/>Plus sides, the casts are devastatingly amazing. Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of a traumatized man from his encounter with aliens is awesome as ever, Paltrow did a fair one, Ben Kingsley was amazing and the rest of them - including the horde of unmanned iron-man suits at the end of the movie - are incredible. Like I said in the beginning, the action sequence was EPIC with capital. You get to see various technological advance created by Stark and stunning action scenes with humor on top.<br/><br/>It's a great movie and I would watch it again, be it in cinemas or DVD but it won't change the fact that the story is lacking depth. They tried though and the outcome is a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Watch it."
"kgprophet","6","0","1","9 October 2013"," Dumb Michael Bay Moments Undermine Gravitas
","One thing the original Ironman established before anything was gravitas, putting our characters in a real world situation. With the attack on a convoy in Afghanistan, Tony Stark was fallible and susceptible to the lethal weapons like everyone else. Proving resourceful, he creates machines from odd parts while imprisoned. For the 3rd outing, there is some of this return to gravitas as Stark is stranded without his suit in the 2nd act. However, now with every other superhero franchise jumping in on the act, it feels like a lot of repetition. You get the the same back-to-basics like ""Skyfall"". You get the same setup of ""you can only save your girlfriend or the Mayor/President not both"" like ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>What won the audience over was Robert Downey Jr.'s smart aleck approach to Tony Stark, which is befitting of him. I guess it made sense on paper to bring in the king of wisecracks Shane Black, but there were moments of serious peril or sadness that were undermined by an inappropriate joke. This movie suffers from a Jekyll/Hyde almost as if directed by two different people. Particularly the story as a whole, matched with well choreographed action scenes, deliver a larger than life spectacle we've come to expect from summer blockbusters. But then there are those dumb moments where anybody who has sat through a Michael Bay film will recognise. The characters will stop the momentum of the movie to stand around and do very bad banter. Particularly grating are scenes between Stark and a Kid who can't stop nagging him. Happy the driver (now security guard) suffers from the same rubbery mouth. Nothing is accomplished while he repeats something stupid, because, you know, repeating something stupid makes it funny.<br/><br/>""Show your badge"" ""Where's my Tuna Sandwich"" ""Iron Patriot sounds cool"". Black does a great job setting up a situation where you feel Stark's vulnerability without his suit, but then destroys it with a bad one-liner that takes you out of the moment. Worse, the attempt at throwing as many yuck yuck lines out there as possible diminishes the moments when a good zinger can have a stronger effect. Ultimately, you would rather have those zingers in there, and celebrate the gems while trying to ignore the groaners. But then comes a serious mistake:<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead <br/><br/>The sobering and violent setup of the Mandarin villain, killing and maiming people with terrorist acts, is then played for yucks as a plot twist. I think it is in poor taste. Reflecting on the serious tone of the deaths and suffering by hamming it up as a drunken English bloke channeling ""Arthur"" is almost an insult to the audience. We've invested our emotions into these scenes, and now are asked to lighten the mood as we confront the bad guy - it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Spoilers Finished <br/><br/>Downey made Stark witty but also smart. It certainly takes a talented hand to keep that balance, and I frankly had little trust in Shane Black in handling it correctly. I mean, the guy wrote ""The Last Boy Scout"". He even became a parody of himself with ""Last Action Hero"". In the end, I applaud the character arcs that carried our main characters through the trilogy, so ultimately I forgive the pettiness of the humour. It's hard to keep things new and interesting in this day and age, and the clever variations on the GPS guided flying suit parts are utilised to great entertainment value. I enjoyed Gwyeneth Paltrow's growth as a character, and Guy Pearce was capable of being creepy. I feel the success of this sequel relies mostly with Downey Jr., he is allowed to deliver too many wisecracks, but can get away with it after carefully honing his character's personality throughout the years."

","Iron Man 3 is the final instalment of the Iron Man trilogy and in general, a decently crafted film, from a non-marvel fan perspective but proved itself at the box office and became the most popular film out of the series: making over 1 billion dollars. After watching both Iron man and the sequel, I didn't know what to expect from the third and what more they could add to it, non the less the idea of a third film got me very excited. It features all of the actors playing main characters from the previous films such as Robert Downey Jr as 'Tony Stark', Gwenyth Paltrow as 'Pepper Pots' e.c.t. In general, it was a film of high expectations to the world and all marvel fans particularly. It took a different approach to the other Iron Man films, taking to the idea of a thought to be huge terrorist threat, acted by Ben Kingsley to in fact a drunken, idiotic actor just as the distraction, which replaced the typical huge marvel villain of the film. Personally, I thought it was enjoyable, thrilling but also funny which from the presence of Robert Downey Jr, humour was beforehand expected in the film. I wasn't very impressed with the idea of the villain as I felt the Mandarin in the film had little meaning and took the traditional 'marvel story' out of the equation. Moving on to the action side of the film, as you would expect in a Marvel production the action scenes were both explosive and high paced, edging you further and further off of your seat the longer it went on. Next, the main character which makes the film what it is, Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr, once again his role as Iron Man brings the edge of humour and brings another outstanding performance, his classy one liners never fail to impress however throughout the film, he is never really in the Iron Man suit, which in my eyes is a big disappointment as the action in the Iron Man suit is what I look forward too. Some of the audience would agree with me when I see you pay to see the suit. Another issue I had with the film is the fact that a majority of the characters just vanish at certain moments in the film, for example the kid that name no one actually remembers is introduced towards the middle of the film, 15 minutes later he doesn't appear again until right at the end. This also outlines the Disney side of the film involving a child that actually saves Tony's life at one point, but that isn't very important. Besides these small problems, I thought it was funny, action packed and a very enjoyable film. In conclusion I felt this film was extremely good, a tad confusing because of the story line, but in as a whole, a really enjoyable production. Unless you are a die-hard Marvel fan this film should be to your expectations of an action film. I fully recommend this film to anyone who liked either the first or second, or any of Marvels films for that matter."

","Considering I have not seen the first two films, I did enjoy watching this one, even if the story was not clear to me. It might only be because there is quite a lot of humour within it but it was still good. The film is basically Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) on his mission to stop the Mandarin. The genres of this film our; action, adventure and Sci-Fi, but mainly action. The budget was estimated to be about $200,000,000 ; which is the same as the first two, and made over $1 Billion so it was clearly more successful than them.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed that the face of the Mandarin wasn't who he said he was, he turned out to be someone completely different and just a decoy. Although this is disappointing, his character added even more humour to the film. The actual Mandarin was someone completely different to who we thought it was and was a big plot twist, which some of the audience wasn't happy about.<br/><br/>I am also disappointed that Stark wasn't in his suit for most of the film which is completely opposite to the title and defeats the point. There were many things that needed to be in the film more. For example Pepper Potts, who showed up at the last minute to save the day and represents girl power to the female audience and the small boy, which clearly shows the Disney influence. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this film and would have probably enjoyed it a lot more if I had watched the first two."

","Iron Man 3 follows Tony Stark on his mission to stop the Destructive terrorist 'Mandarin'or more so , Aldrich Killian. Iron Man 3 is the third instalment in the Iron Man trilogy but was not directed by the same director as Iron Man and Iron Man 2, which were directed by Jon Favreau ( who plays a cameo as Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's former bodyguard) Iron Man 3 was directed by Shane Black. Iron man 3 had a $200 million budget and made over $1,000,000,000.<br/><br/>One thing I can say about this movie is the lack of 'Iron Man' since Tony Stark was not in the suit for most of the movie which in a way takes the Iron Man essence away from the whole movie. As much as I did enjoy Robert Downey Jr's performance, I felt it was more about him than 'Iron Man'. Much of the time, it isn't Tony Stark/Iron Man fighting the enemies, and even the ending shows Pepper saving the day, which can be seen as quite a positive thing and may please the female audience for the girl power element. <br/><br/>The addition of Harley, the child character is definitely a clear sign of Disney's influence, and I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing, but this film was far from dark and we see this with the amount of humour that included. Don't get me wrong, I love the humour as it was clever and definitely gave me a laugh but I would have preferred it to be darker, much like The Dark Knight Rises. The film had brilliant editing and I especially loved the intro with the addition of Eiffel 65, which definitely was a blast from the past! I enjoyed the opening scene and it was a relevant and clever introduction to the storyline. The plot twist with The Mandarin was interesting and at first, I didn't like it too much, purely because the storyline with The Mandarin as an evil, twisted terrorist seemed so much more threatening so I felt a little let down but it was quite a comical twist on the storyline and didn't work out too badly. <br/><br/>I would recommend it but I wouldn't expect too much from it as you may be disappointed."

","No spoilers here, but I loved Ben Kingsley in this. How cool would it be if he turned up at your house on Christmas Day and just sat about drinking beer and telling entertaining yarns about Croydon and Ray Winstone... I actually had a long think about this as various iron men outfits fought bad fire people near a boat for about 30 minutes. Finally, I saw a credit and realised it was time to start paying attention - as I had to find the remote and turn the TV off.<br/><br/>No I don't read comics so I enjoyed the big thing involving Kingsley. With hindsight (after reading other people's reviews) it seems like a really dumb ass thing to do if you're trying to make a superhero franchise popular. However, Kingsley is still AWESOME in this movie. Don't blame him.<br/><br/>So many plot holes here which leave a sour taste. Gwyneth Paltrow is reliably awful and totally miscast as expected - but I get the impression she couldn't really be bothered to try and act in this film - and why should she? The bit with the kid was funny, then the director realised how funny it was and - like so many other bits of this movie - he went overboard and it just got a bit annoying.<br/><br/>One thing really annoys me - how come Tony Stark still drives an Audi A8 with an internal combustion engine? As an engineer himself surely he would be aware of it's meagre 11% power efficiency and would have built an Iron Man drive to power it. Maybe he did? If so why didn't he solve a larger world issue and just start making more fuel efficient cars for everyone? He could have based his HQ in Detroit, thus aiding the redevelopment and regeneration of an impoverished area of the country. Hmmm.<br/><br/>Little things like this got on my nerves throughout the film, but overall it entertained me until the predictably loud, fighty and explody end which sent it into a final nosedive.<br/><br/>In a nutshell - started promisingly, took a gamble, lost direction and veered out of control to become a other pointless waste of moviegoer's time.<br/><br/>Watch it ONLY for Ben Kingsley."

","After two iterations of the series and the Avengers collective effort, most of us who have paid attention thus far more or less knew what to expect from Iron Man 3. Namely, outstanding special effects coupled with heavy doses of Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic one-liners and playful interactions with his supporting cast. Here, Iron Man 3 does not disappoint. However, after so many examples of Tony Stark and his exploits to draw from, this particular batch seems stale in comparison.<br/><br/>I cannot find fault in the plot, despite my lack of comic-book knowledge and the incredible amount of animosity that crowd has towards the inconsistencies and utter lack of translation taking place between particular characters and events. Things unfold at a rapid pace, and even though you have a good feeling regarding how things will all turn out favoring Stark, there are moments where the film remembers (as the original Iron Man did) to remind the audience of his humanity. The standard cast of supporting actors returns, but Ben Kingsley adds some truly unexpected...things...to the film. No spoilers here, I assure you, but his presence is appreciated by this viewer.<br/><br/>So, what's to blame for the disappointment? Simple comparison, of course, and its unavoidable after four films based solely (or largely) on Stark/Iron Man. It entertains, but it also leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The closing line of the credits, ""Tony Stark Will Return"", is about a 50/50 proposition; we all know the Avengers 2 is coming, but Iron Man 4? Something tells me this is as far as they can (or should) take the series. Something also tells me they won't stop, and continuing to cast the light on Iron Man may end up making the entire franchise (which has been mostly stellar, in my opinion) poorer for it."

","Genius and billionaire Tony Stark – aka Iron man- (Robert Downey, Jr) has his world turned upside down when arch enemy the Mandarin (looks like Osama you-know-who) blows his house up and he vows revenge. <br/><br/>Apparently, candles don't work. I asked in Iron Man 2 review that we light a candle to insure there would be no Iron Man 3. And, here we are. Pity.<br/><br/>I have concluded that the only reason to watch any Iron Man movie is to see the CGIs and they are spectacular. No doubt about it. The story? Forgetaboutit. Really sad.<br/><br/>Where to begin, where to begin? Hmmm.. Again, a lot of the dialogues appear to be dubbed in and you can tell that right off. The music is lame for such a big-time action movie. Tony Stark is out of the suit most of the movie trying to be a human action hero. Hey, we go to the Iron Man movie to see Iron Man and that involves him in the suit fighting injustice. We see his Iron Man suits (yes, suits plural) break into a million pieces like cheap china. We see Tony Stark having panic attacks. Say what ? The bad guy, Killian (Guy Pierce), gives Tony's girlfriend, Pepper (Gweneth Paltrow), super powers for a short time while Tony Stark watches in amazement. Say what? Tony Stark befriends a 12-year old boy and these scenes didn't make any sense. Attempts at humor fall flat. <br/><br/>To be fair Guy Pierce as Killian and Ben Kingsley as Trevor did good. Downey also does good but then there's everything else within the movie that doesn't work. We watch a real mess. <br/><br/>Again, go to the Iron Man movies only to see the CGIs. They are truly exceptional. Want to buy some candles? (4/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","When Iron Man flew onto the big screen in 2008 it was a breath of fresh air that star tracked Marvel to live it's dream of the eventual Avengers and also showed that they were more than mere spiders and mutants. Iron Man did so well thanks to it's unique take on the superhero genre and a flare that gave it life thanks to Downey Jr's great come back role and director Jon Favreau's touch behind the camera. Since that big screen outing we have witnessed Tony Stark cameo's, the lacking and forgettable Iron Man 2, the scene chewing yet still amazing The Avengers and now this (and seemingly final) Iron Man outing. And what a forgettable one it is.<br/><br/>Making huge amounts of money worldwide undoubtedly thanks to the love from The Avengers, Iron Man 3 is a film that shows you in all clarity that there can be to much of a good thing. What once seemed fresh and inspired here is nothing more than a riff and play of what has come before mixed in with a story that can only be described as uninteresting. A big flaw in the film is the use of Tony Stark himself, whilst interesting to see the never far from wisecracking billionaire deal with personal and more threating demons it just feels like we have learnt all there is to know about the American hero and have gone over his relationship with Pepper Potts enough now. Perhaps this would have been less noticeable if the films villains and central plot was more appealing.<br/><br/>Did director Black (again having references to the Xmas period) learn nothing from the over complicated Spider-Man 3 that more is definitely less. Iron Man 3 has dealings with Rhodes and his freshly named Iron Patriot, Guy Pearce's slimy villain Aldrich, James Badge Dale as his fiery henchman Savin, Rebecca Hall as old love interest Maya Hansen, Sir Ben Kingsley (wow talk about over acting) as Mandarin and for some reason Favreau as the reappearing Happy. All these characters are just in the film not a part of it. Not once did I feel like I liked or loathed any of these characters enough to care which in the case of Iron Man and The Avengers was never an issue.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is a film that will more than likely be appreciated by fanboys and ""boys"". It's clear that on the current track record Marvel are free to virtually make any film and live off the love from previous more respectable entries. The film offers up no real action that hasn't been done before or interplay between the characters to recommend it. One hopes that like Stark himself Marvel look for fresh possibilities and hang up the suit for a little while if not forever, unless of cause the Avengers are needed.<br/><br/>2 wisecracks out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinion check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","Without a doubt this was the least favorite of the three for me. I can't go into detail without spoilers, suffice it to say you are better off watching The Avengers repeatedly, it was a big let down for me as I have been collecting comics for over 40 years. The character of Ironman has gone in a direction which made no sense, the bad guy was a total let down on many levels, you will know what I mean when you see it, because I know you will lol. I there are so many story lines and bad guys to choose from and they came up with this plot. Sadly I will have to wait for the next Thor or Captain America movie to get my fix.

"JPfanatic93","6","0","2","23 September 2013"," Marvel's Phase 2 can only get better from here on out
","Most disappointing of the Marvel Studios movies so far. Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) took over the director's chair from Jon Favreau who did the first two installments. Maybe it's Black's tendency to go over the top a bit too far, maybe the writers and producers just got terribly lazy in the creative process after the success of the predecessors, but Iron Man 3 proves a dud. Tony Stark finally has found a decent equilibrium between his eccentric playboy life and his public role as the armored superhero Iron Man, but soon his world is turned upside down after he deliberately picks a fight with the vicious terrorist leader Mandarin (""played by Sir Ben Kingsley"") who wounded his former bodyguard Happy (still performed by Favreau himself at least). The Mandarin comes down hard on Tony, destroying his mansion and seemingly obliterating his various armors. With only his wit, his engineering skills, his insufferable character flaws – he was never more irritating than he is here – and the aid of some kid in a shack, he soon turns the tables and confronts his new nemesis and his silly army of exploding people, only to find out the situation is not what it appeared to be, as the Mandarin is just a fraud (way to ruin a classic bad guy, Marvel!). Another adversary, A.I.M. leader Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) is behind it all, out to revenge himself on Stark, literally for making him cry ten years earlier (now that's what I call a solid motivation for aiming to conquer the world!). During the film's climactic showdown, Tony can fortunately count on his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to save his ass, plus he had another 40 armors inexplicably hidden up his sleeve. Iron Man 3 pretentiously delves into semi-philosophical territory when it keeps asking whether the suit makes the man or vice versa, but the fact is we simply don't care. All we knew was that Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man and now sloppy writing has allowed him to be unmade, for which Downey reportedly received the sum of 50 million (!) dollars, probably for looking the other way as it happened. At least Stark is basically still the same after four films, as it was clear what audiences wanted and expected from the get-go. The same can't be said for the Mandarin, whose presence was alluded to in the previous two Iron Man films, but all of a sudden proves to be someone else entirely halfway through the film. Don't trust the trailers for this film that insinuated that we were in for a major epic villain played by Kingsley, since that's all a lie and you'll end up disappointed. Blame it on the Chinese involvement, as Iron Man 3 was co-produced with Chinese studios to cut costs (Downey's salary had to come from somewhere after all). And in such a case, you simply can't afford to have a Chinese villain claiming to be after the destruction of western civilization. Interestingly enough, the Chinese market received a slightly different cut of the film including scenes not seen in the regular version, to make it even more attractive for Chinese audiences. Iron Man 3 bodes ill for the rest of Marvel's Phase 2, but there's gotta be better upcoming movies to make up for this huge letdown. Ant-Man maybe?"

It's a ""scary movie"" type of thing with just Iron Man on focus. Previously I thought that ""Alien 3"" is the worst sequel to any franchise but now my opinion is changed. ""Iron Man 3"" is the worst ever. At the end I would say just one thing, ""Don't believe in the trailer. You will have a totally different experience in the movie"""
"pgFiSheYe","6","0","2","8 September 2013"," It's a good regular movie, it's a bad Iron Man movie
","If this was any other movie but Iron Man themed, it would definitely have a very high rank in my books as well as the books of most viewers. It has everything: drama, action, comedy, good plot, good effects and so on. It would probably be a solid 8 out of 10. The thing is, this is an Iron Man movie and somehow it looks like Shane Black forgot that.<br/><br/>While one must respect Black's job, he missed his mark on this one and he did by a long shot. He wasn't even close and that's reason enough to make fans mad. The first problem with this film is: too much Martin Riggs Stark and not enough Iron Man. I mean, why is Tony running around outsmarting bad guys and doing fist fights, as if this was an 80s flick ala Lethal Weapon, Hard to kill or Die Hard?<br/><br/>Then you have Ben Kingsley. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with Aldrich Killian; in fact Guy Pearce absolutely nailed the part and he's brilliant as always. However, how can you waste Ben Kingsley on this? I have no idea. What is the problem with handling two bad guys? Christopher Nolan did a good job in Batman Begins. Tim Burton also did a good job in Batman Returns (in fact there were three villains on that one). So why couldn't Shane Black manage two bad guys? Beats me. Instead, turns out Miguel Ferrer is the other villain, for what like two minutes?<br/><br/>Then the small little details: like the ACDC or Black Sabbath music. Where did it go? It never runs old on an Iron Man film, but now we have rap and trance instead? No, no, no. A superhero movie balances the time of the character and the alter ego. This film lost that balance.<br/><br/>Still I can't rate this under a 5, because like I said before, if this was a non-Iron Man movie, it's a great effort. It had all the potential to be the best Iron Man movie."

","There's a reason Robert Downey Jr. is a star. He's fun to watch. So is the supporting cast. Without him, or them, this flick would've been pretty bad. Whomever writes the script outlines and decided on the FX (which are well rendered for what they are) should be fired. <br/><br/>The movie meanders, trying hard to please everyone, and winds up proving the old adage. I call it script writing by demographics--you have to throw in a scene to appeal to every category of movie-goer, no matter how little sense it makes or how it affects the flow. It also seems they promise a certain amount of screen time to every actor/actress to get them to sign.<br/><br/>The FX are conceptually over the top, especially in the climactic scene. It seems that in FX-driven movies, there's an arms race to see who can create the most ridiculous, outlandish material. Only a ten-year old would be impressed. It's getting so obvious that the FX are becoming a distraction rather than an enhancement.<br/><br/>Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the movie--for the most part. As I said, there were interesting characterizations and quite a few fun bits. But I found the ending trite, unsatisfying, and hypocritical."
"venuti-ben","7","0","1","3 September 2013"," Not Marvel's best work, but still necessary!
","Being a die-hard Marvel fan and having read a lot of the reviews for this installment of Iron Man, I have to agree with most fans that this was definitely not one of the best bits of movie magic that we've seen from Marvel Studios. The producers of this film used way too much creative license in veering off from true Marvel mythology and also attempted to give the film a different feel to the previous two installments, which obviously didn't work in their favor. The apparent lack of AC/DC in the soundtrack was a particular downer for me.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I do believe that this film was necessary in it's structure to pave the way for the next ""phase"" (to quote Marvel themselves) of the Iron Man/Avengers story. To put it on the big screen the way it has been presented in the comic book universe would have taken far too much story telling. Granted it could have been done in a better way, but this is what was needed to break the link Tony had to the Iron Man suits and mature him as it were to the character we're expecting to see in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"". <br/><br/>While this is no real consolation for the let down after months of anticipation waiting for Iron Man 3 to be released, we can (hopefully) look forward to ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" being what we expect from Marvel."

I tried to understand the guy's that get piping hot for no reason and the fact that Gwenyth Paltrow does nothing but defeat the villain... but I really lost interest when the main villain breathed fire and then all of Stark's suits started getting destroyed by people with 'hot hands'. I understand that you have to 'up the ante' so that things get tougher and tougher with each sequel but this really was awful. I rate it a 3 because RDJ was great and they also convinced Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce to sign on... Thus... the money they spent deserves a '3' rating."
"lesserdeamon","3","0","3","3 September 2013"," A lot of wasted time and potential. Worth watching just to appreciate that Joss Whedon is doing the Avengers.
","==++++SPOILERS++++==<br/><br/>Nothing can compare to the sheer anger I felt after Stark came face to face with the Mandarin for the first time. I mean, up until then the movie wasn't bad, although it did feel as though the pacing was a bit rushed at times and there were too many quick jokes for my liking. But then it really started to feel like the director hadn't actually watched the other films, nor read an Iron Man comic in his life. I could deal with pretty much every little plot hole or poorly written bit of dialogue up until they decided to turn Tony Stark's greatest and most powerful enemy into a drunk British actor called 'Trevor'. I just kept sitting there thinking 'oh, I see, the Mandarin's obviously added a decoy to throw people off, that totally makes sense' and even enjoyed the comic relief that character brought, but if a movie has to explain why, suddenly, the Mandarin isn't the main villain 3 TIMES over the course of the film, making up about 20 minutes of total screen time too, none the less, then something has gone incredibly wrong. <br/><br/>Not only did the Mandarin get destroyed beyond repair, but the rest of the film after that made little to no sense at all either. I watched the trailer expecting a big showdown with Mandarin, or even just to know he's made an appearance then faded into the background to pull the strings, Sherlock Holmes 'Moriarty' style but no. Instead I get treated to a wonderful 40 minutes or so of build up for a lazy, and incredibly poor joke that gives me a headache just thinking about it. After Black was done with screwing over one of the most feared characters Stark has ever met (He has ten alien rings of power and an alien DRAGON to help him out at times. Seriously, look up 'Fin Fang Foom' ) he transformed what should have been a great film into, essentially, Lethal Weapon all over again. From the handgun firefights through to the actual Villain being one dimensional and incredibly boring, the whole film felt like it could have been added as extra scenes into 'The Last Action Hero' from the 90s. <br/><br/>Also, this is a lot more than simple comic book 'herpyderp, they mucked up my favorite character!' that fuels of lot of nerd rage, but is more to do with the trailer too. I honestly felt I've been mislead by watching that. In the trailer, it shows the mandarin to be the huge bad guy that's been playing behind the scenes, and shows him to be just what he is - a powerful, scary individual who is easily a match for Stark in every way shape and form. Its one thing to have a plot twist and change the antagonist halfway through the story, but to advertise and market the WHOLE film about him, not to mention connecting both other films to him too (eg. - the 'Ten Rings' organization in the first film), build him up to be exactly what he's supposed to be and then replace him with a simple one dimensional 'villain with a grudge' is by far the worst thing they could have done. <br/><br/>I'm offended not just as a marvel fan, but as a general moviegoer too. This could have been so much better, and words can't really describe how disappointed I am after watching this."

","Yes, I'm a little late to the Iron Man 3 party, but better late than never. I've had the chance to read a lot of other reviews to this title and I honestly find a lot of the criticism brought to it unfair.<br/><br/>Yes, it is somewhat childish and not altogether compelling. They tried going for a slightly more mature feel, but it didn't really work. At least not in the way I imagine they had hoped it would.<br/><br/>We get to see a lot more of Tony Stark out of the Iron Man suite, and we get to see more of Tony Stark period. His fears and insecurities in this -post New York invasion- world. RDJ plays brilliantly, as always, managing to add complexity to his beloved character.<br/><br/>The plot, this is where it gets messy. Initially I enjoyed the idea of a villain who isn't evil just for the sake of it and who is somewhat integrated in the political struggles of our time. And then there's the plot twist. Which if you have seen more than, lets say, two movies in your lifetime you will be able to predict from early on. And from there on the movie doesn't expand properly, it doesn't give the appropriate amount of details or background to is characters.<br/><br/>The visual effects are good, nothing breathtaking, but passable. I enjoyed the tech and watching the characters use it, even if isn't even remotely rooted in anything realistic.<br/><br/>But most importantly, the movie is fun. RDJ makes you laugh at every turn and the truth is you enjoy watching Iron Man win over his enemies and get out of sticky situations, even if after a time his escapes become rather simplistic."

","Hooray for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for bringing us great movies such as The Incredible Hulk, Tha Avengers and the Iron Man movies. However, the third installment of Iron Man is not on par...<br/><br/>The movie has a convoluted plot involving a Fire Zombie Virus, that is spread among war veterans by a guy who had been stood up by Tony Stark in the nineties and now wants to take over the world or something. Also, Tony Stark is suffering from PTSS because being an Avenger scared him so much. This is an issue that will not get resolved in a proper manner, it just ends with the movie. For some reason, War Machine could not be called War Machine anymore. Plus, Tony Stark has a gazillion suits that function independent from him. And Pepper dies but she doesn't die. And then there's the Mandarin, who isn't the Mandarin. The ending is particularly weird. Tony Stark stops being Iron Man - destroys all of his suits, has his impossible to remove shrapnel removed from his heart, and tells in voice-over that he IS Iron Man.<br/><br/>Does this make any sense to you? Well, it is Iron Man 3 in a nutshell. A lot of stuff that is either too far-fetched or too ridiculous to keep the suspension of disbelief up. Robert Downey Junior is okay in this movie, as is Gwyneth Paltrow. But the rest of the cast is fairly not up for the job or their parts are redundant. One exception on this is Sir Ben Kingsley. His performance is really what is saving the movie, both before and after the infamous 'twist'.<br/><br/>Kingsley's acting plus the fact that it's still an Iron Man movie is what makes the movie somewhat digestible - but the fans deserve better."

","This is a good movie...!!! :-)<br/><br/>As the latest model from an assembly line that has produced two blockbuster franchises, ""Iron Man 3"" is bulletproof. So it's pointless for a critic to complain in general terms about sequelitis and superhero overkill. But judged solely in comparison to its corporate cousins, ""Iron Man 3"" is a defective model. It's lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is. At the helm again is Robert Downey Jr. as playboy inventor Tony Stark, whose arrogant schtick grew so tiresome in ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"" that he wisely tries to spoof it here. It's a welcome change of pace, but eventually there are so many broken-gadget pratfalls and moments of deflated egotism that they lose their effectiveness.<br/><br/>Still the jokes are better than the sad attempts to give Stark a heart. In the very dull first half-hour of the movie, he is aching about the events in ""The Avengers"" — you know, that finale when all of Manhattan was reduced to rubble by the superheroes and their adversaries. The widespread human cost of that cataclysm is barely even mentioned, except for how it left Stark feeling vulnerable.<br/><br/>Boo freakin' hoo.<br/><br/>The focus of his fears is girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has taken over the gizmo manufacturer Stark Industries. When a former research geek named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) visits the company with a hunky new image and a technology for supercharging human DNA, Pepper politely declines his invitation to invest. So Killian takes the technology to a television terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who uses it to turn humans into time bombs. Unlike Pearce, Kingsley is a memorable villain, particularly when he channels his inner Russell Brand. But except for a crew's freefall from the besieged Air Force One, the overblown 3-D action sequences are forgettable variations on the rallying cry ""Iron suits assemble!"" And director/co-writer Shane Black (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") tarnishes the entire franchise with a sticky subplot in which Iron Man crashes in a Tennessee town and adopts a little-kid sidekick (Ty Simpkins). ""Iron Man 3"" is the creakiest comic-book movie in Marvel's recent history. But hey, if your idea of a good time is dodging exploded logic, scattershot wisecracks and war-on-terror scare tactics, knock yourself out."

","This is my very first review on IMDb and i'm gonna be brief about ""Ironman 3"" because to be honest with you this movie doesn't deserve even a bad review.<br/><br/>First things first, i went to the cinema to watch this joke and it was just a bad investment. I saw the two-minute trailer and it was EPIC! I saw a broken hero and an evil nemesis in an effort to erase him from the map, i listened epic lines such as ""I'm gonna offer the choice: do you want an empty life, or a meaningful death?"" and ""Lesson number one: Heroes, there is no such thing."" and i was thrilled about this movie because it seemed to me a nice ending to the series, so i was like ""Oh boy, oh boy, a hero in a HUGE moment of crisis, possibly it's gonna be like Batman in The Dark Knight Rises, i have to go to the cinema for this movie."" <br/><br/>So i dragged two friends of mine the second day of May and as i said in the beginning we went to the cinema. Well there's just one word to describe my impression about this movie ""ULTIMATE FAILURE"", yes i know it was two words but C'MON! The movie itself didn't respond to the spectators as it promised in the trailer. Instead of the superhero Ironman i saw a wanna-be James Bond or Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt Tony Stark in an attempt to prove to the world that he does not need the suit to be Ironman and he can hold on his shoulders a two-hour film with the name ""Ironman"" doing spy-stuff and simultaneously telling bad jokes and doing goofs in scenes which they supposed to be epic. The amazing ""Ironman-to-the-rescue"" flight scene ended with the hero's armor crashed by a truck because Tony Stark is such a poor fellow and he can't afford to put a radar in his suit. And instead of epic lines like those i mentioned i took epic cut-lines. And of course in the final as-they-want-to-believe ""EPIC"" battle they wanted to fill the gaps of Iroman's absence putting twenty goofy-like Iroman armors in the battle. Yes! Good job to the writers, they managed to fill the gaps.<br/><br/>Some critics said that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Ironman 3"" were similar but they are wrong. I saw greatness in Nolan's TDKR and an epic closure to the series. In I3 a saw disappointment and it was waste of time and money together. 5 out of 10 and i believe that i was lenient."

","While I understand that a movie storyline often take a dramatically different path than say a book, due to cramming a story into a short timespan, shooting time and budgets, the fact that the Iron Man films have such a diverse wealth of story lines they can draw from, would only make anyone familiar with them watch this film with greater and greater despair until the final ending.<br/><br/>It's a horrible concoction of a few Iron Man story lines, mashed together and altered to make no sense at all. What is worse is that simply one of these story lines, would have made a great film in itself. Despite some great acting throughout the film, I found it harder and harder to suspend my disbelief, by the end I was literally grinding my teeth and willing the film to end well before it actually did.<br/><br/>Now this part is a bit of a spoiler, so please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet. The original extremis project was a brilliant storyline, a super-solider experiment that falls into the hands of a twisted individual, making him super strong, super fast, and armed with multiple lethal abilities. Tony Stark as Iron Man is nearly fatally wounded in trying to stop this man going on a killing rampage, coming to the realisation that as he has improved the Iron Man suits, they have become stronger, but also slower and more unwieldy he decides on a new approach.<br/><br/>To save his life, the original scientist behind the development of Extremis, reprograms it to heal Tony, but Tony also makes some alterations to the program with his own ends in mind. Emerging from the Extremis cocoon far earlier than planned, the scientist finds that Tony has not only greatly speeded up his healing, he has also made significant changes to his body and how it works.<br/><br/>He is now able to control the Iron Man suites mentally, he has merged nano technology within him and parts of the suit are now contained in his bones, deployed through his skin to encase him in the first layers of the armour, cutting down on the weight of outer armour which can now fly to him as separate parts. His reaction times have been increased, his merging with the suit is now total as it is part of him, along with physical strength increases his mind can now tap into multiple sources of data at once.<br/><br/>While some of this is touched on in Iron Man 3, it is so confused and watered down that it bears little resemblance to the original storyline. Don't even mention the Mandarin, because that is even worse. What you get is a film that starts off fine, but becomes more and more vague, until at the end you wonder why they bothered.<br/><br/>If you aren't familiar with Iron Man, than you could always waste some time watching this, if only for the special effects, but otherwise id give it a miss."
"callumhough97","7","0","1","30 July 2013"," Different, but it worked.
","Before watching this movie, I had heard that it was the worst one out of all of them. However, I liked it. It was always going to be different with Shane Black coming in for Jon Favreau but I thought it worked quite well. I thought the balance between the ingenious wit and at times seriousness of Tony Stark was spot on. Although some may disagree, I loved what they did with the Mandarin. It's something different, something that you don't expect. That sums up Iron Man in general. You don't see many films doing that sort of thing. Completely tearing up the comic lore and going with something completely different. I liked it and I respect them for doing that. OK, there were areas where I thought could've been better. I expected Pepper to have a more prominent role in the film as I thought that would've worked well, following on from the Avengers. It would've also been nice to see Aldrich Killian's background been explored more as this would've added to what is already a great film. It was never going to be a 'one of the best of all time' films but I really enjoyed it and felt that although it was different, it kind of worked."

","1966 was a very good year.<br/><br/>A certain, extremely talented, writer was born. England won the World Cup.<br/><br/>Star Trek aired.<br/><br/>I've grown up with Star Trek. The likes of Star Trek, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica and so many others helped me visit strange, new worlds and boldly go (or baldly in the case of Jean-Luc) where I had no chance of actually going in real life.<br/><br/>Gene Roddenberry was a genius to my young mind, and a visionary to my older one. Creating a western in space, along the lines of Wagon Train - except with space ships and aliens rather than wagons, horses and Indians, of course.<br/><br/>Okay, so Star Trek, the actual original pilot, starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike instead of William Shatner as Captain James Tiberius Kirk, aired in 1965, but Star Trek as we know it exploded on our television sets a year later, the year of my birth (I'm that talented writer I mentioned, if you hadn't guessed).<br/><br/>As we were born in the same year, I didn't get to see the programme until I was older on one of its many re-runs. It didn't matter to me. At the time, I didn't know what a repeat was. I didn't get the chance, as a child, to watch it that regularly. The main programmes I was able to see each week were The Muppets and Doctor Who - both still favourites to this day. But I watched Star Trek whenever I could. It was brilliant. I wanted to be Spock. I wanted to see what was in the scanner thing he always looked into. I wanted POINTY EARS! And then there were the spin offs. The Next Generation. Voyager. Deep Space 9. Enterprise. All good (and occasionally bad) in their own way. I loved TNG. Ryker was a bit too much in places with his puffed out chest and stance and bravado. Wesley grated. But Jean Luc, Seven of Nine and most especially Data were brilliant. I enjoyed Voyager, though I have yet to watch the final episodes. Deep Space 9 was OK. Not bad, but it didn't grab me, and Enterprise, I wanted to like, and for the most part did, but it was let down by not enough drive from the producers.<br/><br/>Either way, there was plenty to fill my Trekking time. Also, we had the films.<br/><br/>Star Trek: The Motion Picture was amazing. I so loved that film. I was elated when they made an actual movie of the series. I enjoyed all the original movies, to be honest, with The Voyage Home being, probably, my favourite. But then, horror upon horrors, they made a PREQUEL! I don't know if I was ready. I think I figured they were going to be sort of cashing in on the name. It wouldn't be that good. I could hope, but I think I expected to not really like it.<br/><br/>That shows what I know.<br/><br/>I'd been a fan of Zachary Quinto from his Heroes days, and love him in American Horror Story (both seasons). I wondered how he'd fit into the role of my favourite Vulcan. Extremely well, as it happens. The first of the new Star Trek films was excellent, as far as I'm concerned. Exciting, well plotted and full of life. I wasn't sure of the hot-headed young Kirk at first, but I quickly warmed to him. As for the also young Sulu and Chekov, they're very well written and cast. Chekov is hilarious! So, it worked. A big thumbs up.<br/><br/>Then, oh my gosh! They were bringing out a sequel with none other than Benedict Cumberbatch! I honestly couldn't wait. I am desperate for the return of Sherlock, which was my first introduction to Mr. Cumberbatch. His portrayal of the seminal detective grabbed me by the bits and didn't let go. The way the show was done all together was sooo good. If you haven't seen either of the two series, it's a definite must see. Moriarty was brilliant and Martin Freeman as Watson was a delight. I quite like Elementary, but Sherlock is something else! So, Benedict Cumberbatch as the bad guy? Bring it on! And what a bad guy? Khan, no less! Star Trek: Into Darkness is great. Really, a fab film. It brings the Star Trek franchise quite firmly up to date. Plenty of meat and a bit of gristle thrown in for good measure. There's excitement, pathos, humour (you've got to love the ever fine Simon Pegg as Scotty) and lot's more.<br/><br/>I saw the 2D version of the film, but I'm told the 3D effects were excellent. If you're going to make a movie in 3D, give us something to make us glad we sat there with silly glasses on. I was so disappointed with Wrath of the Titans (for many reasons but...) when, at the climactic explosion at the end, it cut to the base camp. Where were the bits of god thrown in our faces, hmmm? I didn't see, so I don't know, but it appears the 3D was used to good effect. That's what we want. Make us duck out of the way. Make us want to reach out. Don't just give it a bit of depth, as wearing those glasses detracts from the colour and essence of the film - we need something to compensate.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Into Darkness is a definite hit. If you're not a Star Trek fan, don't let that put you off. There's a great deal more to this film than the name.<br/><br/>Oh, one thing. I so wanted Kirk - or better yet, Spock - to, when wondering where they'd go for the start of their 5 year journey, say: ""First star on the right, and straight on till morning.""<br/><br/>Live longer and prosper, people."
"r-r591","5","0","2","13 July 2013"," A must see... for merchandising students of all trades.
","First things first: if you're going to make anything even remotely set in Rose Hill, Tennessee, you've just got to include a lot more corn-fed beauties than this movie does. Hey, even twelve-year-old toy consumers and Comcast die-hards will agree with me on this.<br/><br/>So, what do you get when screenwriters, producers, directors and actors have an all out battle-royal against the studio execs and merchandising hired hands for every minute of Iron Man's third installment? You get a big bag full of broken parts and pieces. Admittedly, someone's tried very hard to crazy-glue it up in time for the premier, my respects to that someone.<br/><br/>The plot is delivered in predictable and well timed Lester Dentesque quotas of predicament that lead up to a predictable climax, which is in turn predictably resolved in time for the predictable happy-reap-the-crops-of-wisdom ending. What the kind people who made the movie tried to do in an attempt to distract us from the ""no surprise here"" build up, is to mark-up the zeros on the CGI department checks—and distract us they do. Seamless virtual puppeteering amidst great explosions, visual delights do not disappoint as your eyes try not to blink and take it all in, but even this was expected, was it not? So you come around to the boilerplate characters doing boilerplate things, side kick bratty-nevertheless-lovable kid included. A point of interest may be to try and figure out why these kids get older lady hairdos, which in my modest opinion, should be CGI'd out of the final copy, they're just plain distracting (which just happened to me here). <br/><br/>Getting back to our boilerplate characters we find Iron Man 3's greatest failure, which is the portrayal of The Mandarin and how the execs, screenwriters and all those involved, tried to figure out a way around offending the massive Chinese Monies. On the one hand you have Tony's traditional—and therefore unavoidable Comcast-dollars—evil nemesis, who happens to be called the Mandarin which is as Chinese a name as you can come up with and on the other you have the mentioned Chinese Monies; all in a postmodern world scenario where the commies are no longer the bad guys, terrorists are, and we know where they come from right? So they took a few gigantic liberties and succeeded in sinking their ship as they shot their foot and looked the other way once the damage was done. They did not pull it off, Iron Man fans were right in taking offense, and once again you wonder how it feels to splurge in CGI only to completely fail at basic story writing. Maybe producers don't realize that they're get-the-money-geniuses, not story tellers, I don't know. <br/><br/>In regard to the merchandising department, they won; it took real brains and board room brawn to fill up so few minutes with so many potential toy ideas, kudos to them but there is a big twist, because it seems Mr. Downey Jr. got fed up of getting stuck in the sardine can and demanded something beyond his facial muscles got a chance to act, so they decided to turn him into a Jason Bourne meets MyGyver combo, with moderate success I may say. (Merch Special Black Ops Team figured a brilliant way to circumvent this prima donna demand and still make us lust for their goods). <br/><br/>Finally, all the good-guys involved, maybe even Mr. Stan Lee himself, seek to make amends to loyal Iron Man fans everywhere when a character casually tells us, ""the rocket performed perfectly, it just landed on the wrong planet""."

","I have always been a fan of Iron Man. Loved 1 and 2. But i was disappointed with Iron Man 3. Had too much expectation from this movie. The trailers seemed awesome. But the movie had very less to offer. I guess they just wanted to wrap up the series. <br/><br/>Now what is expected of a superhero movie?? Hero has a tough time with villains, super powers, awesome tech etc. Here the hero did have a tough time but with the side villains and his internal fears rather than the main villain who made an entry towards the end of the movie and disappeared as quickly. And when we talk about iron man, we talk about his suit. This was a movie about Tony Stark. Many things are left unanswered. They made a story with bits and pieces of smaller stories. The ending was horrible. <br/><br/>Only good part in the movie was his backup call and i sat excited that something's gonna happen. And i hated it when he makes a Christmas gift out of the his suits.<br/><br/>Its a one-time-watch movie with nothing going on at all."

","The movie lacks a strong Foe for our hero. Even though the plot to mask the real villain was good, the fact that the actual villain had so little screen presence as against the fake one (the Mandarin) killed the excitement of the final clash and movie built up. It seems like the writers and directors also felt the actual villain was inadequate and gave him dragon like ability to breathe fire as an afterthought ""Why just give him the power to throw fire and not his henchmen!!"". The fact that Iron man makes hundreds of robots and they face off with army of villains at the climax takes the charm off the usual ""Hero fighting and defeating all enemy himself"" feeling. Also, giving pepper potts the iron man suit and then regeneration power of the villain in the end makes me feel that they wanted greater involvement from leading lady ,making the entire portrayal feel forced just to get a ending with her in frame. In all the Movie failed to keep me glued to the seat and I felt the previous parts were better in terms of balance, action, acting and finish."
"p-stepien","6","0","1","15 June 2013"," Funny man
","Rash, egocentric and devoid of lack of self-esteem Tony Stark (his usual briskly ironic Robert Downey Jr) is the ultimate playboy superhero donning the super-powered armour, which makes him Iron Man. Picking up from where ""The Avengers"" left off, Stark suffers from abrupt anxiety attacks resulting from his near death fall from the trans-dimensional void with the increasingly self-assured Pepper Potts his main comfort, source of solace and - to an extent - his fixation. When a series of terrorist explosions start occurring through-out the globe, coordinated by the mysterious Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), Tony Stark fails however to take a less front-row seat and actively engages with his newest foe - inviting him to attack him at his seaside mansion (if he dares)...<br/><br/>Giving over the helm to the comedic talents of Shane Black has in many ways invigorated Iron Man after the forgettable and drab sequel, which misused all the charm of the original movie. Downey Jr is therefore utilised to his fullest with a tidy sarcastic performance the highlight of proceedings and reaffirming his undoubted position as the best comic superhero performance by a mile. However the jokey side of the new Iron Man seems to overwhelm proceedings, making the action or super-side of the story seem somewhat secondary to Downey delivering a wicked punch-line. The iconic Marvel super-villain Mandarin and key foe of Tony Stark is effectively reduced to a short-legged gag, which may have seemed great during script formation, but effectively dissolves any sense of epic, despite an onslaught of Iron Men Mark 1-26 in the grand finale (including a classical tidbit appearance by Igor), as the replacement villain lacks the credible kapow to enhance the kaboom.<br/><br/>The replacement baddie Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) is by no means poor, but once the automated army of super-armours enter the fray, the spectacle just lacks sparkle. The scope of destruction is pretty nice, but the impact level just isn't enough to resonate given the misplaced power level of his foe (compared, for example, to the Avengers). Despite the ongoing phase of comic book movies aspiring to be darker, complex and more realistic, the essential strength behind the whole phenomenon is the want of superheroes battling super-foes. Twists and turns can be welcome, but without a foe worthy of a movie the overall effort just ends up bland. All in all this submarine fails to really surface, instead serving as a vessel for Downey Jr.'s charm and remarkable timing. Actually Downey Jr. rarely even gets to don the Iron Man armour, mostly relying on his whimsical self to liven proceedings. Satisfactory popcorn treat, just somewhat self-defeating by shunning away from the heroesque qualities that should have dominated proceedings."
"poet512","7","0","2","13 June 2013"," Iron Man was like a romance classic - too much dialogue
","There is no denying that the Iron Man franchise have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Thanks to Robert Downey's wit and humor, he has portrayed his character so well that anyone wants to be his on screen cast. In his latest installment, Iron Man 3, the movie had too much dialogue I almost wanted to sleep thinking I was watching a romance classic. But thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow's smoking body, great visual effects and effortless humor it can make up to it. As usual sci fi/fantasy films usually bank on on computer graphics hence they have succeeded. But despite their cinematic bonanza it was not suitable for 3 dimensional experience. 2 Dimensional viewing will suffice. And wait for the credits to end, they have something you'll look forward to."
"Mr_Sensitive","7","0","2","10 June 2013"," Good fun, but add absolutely nothing new to the franchise
","This felt more like a new episode of the Iron Man franchise because what you see here is what have already seen before (only with different villain). But none the less it is still is fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>This time around Stark dealt with his personal health, his love for a girl, his obsession with the suit while trying to save the world. Like I said, this has been told since the first Iron Man. So what was the different between this and its predecessor: almost none (maybe a little darker and more serious – and that's good)<br/><br/>The main reason why I went to see this was for the fact that they casted Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce, I love both of them. They did a nice job as a villain, only wish they have a cooler role and not Mandarin. This character is a little too comical. <br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is they able to maintain good sense of humor/ more screen time for Gwyneth Paltrow/ very stylish / and more or less nonstop action scenes. Plus the scene where Tony stuck in a small town with a little kid who help him pick himself up add a little different to the series<br/><br/>Anyway I do recommend this movie (especially for dull Saturday evening with your kids). It is still is fun movie to watch despite the story get a little stale. <br/><br/>Rating: 6 /10"
"JamesK-Johnston3","8","0","2","6 June 2013"," It was good, except the villain.
","First off, I felt that what they did to the Mandarin was terrible. The entire concept of The Mandarin is that he is Asian. So when I first saw the trailer and saw Ben Kingsly, I was worried. But then I realized that He was a perfect face for the villain. Then they messed him all up with making him the scientist who was the head of AIM. The leader of AIM wasn't even that special in the fact that everyone in his organization had the same power as him.<br/><br/>Then came the Extremis power that everyone had. If the power were controlled by that little spot in the brain that they explained about in the movie then, theoretically, if you destroyed that spot in their brain then that spot would not be able to tell the rest of the body to repair itself, right? That in itself was a fail in my opinion.<br/><br/>That was it for what I really didn't like about the movie, other than a few other instances of the same sort that I won't ramble on about.<br/><br/>Now on to the positives. The movie was very well made and the acting, as always, was superb. Just seeing John Favreau with a mullet and some crazy '90's facial hair was worth it. I like how they had Tony Stark suffer from PTSD; I just wish that they would have elaborated more on that.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10 because I didn't like that Mandarin. But everything else in it was excellent. If your a hard core Comic fan you will hate it as well, but it has a good balance of action and story line.<br/><br/>I hope that this review was satisfactory, it was my first time so I do apologize if I make no sense sometimes."

One of the main things in this that is not explained well is Maya Hansen's serum, and how exactly it works. Because in some cases a person who has accepted the serum will not die if bombed, or whatever, but then sometimes they do. That just does not make sense.

","Following on the heels of one of the greatest superhero films (The Avengers) ever, Iron Man 3 had the daunting task of being the first film to initiate Phase 2 of the next set of Marvel films. Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3). Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance. By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.<br/><br/>Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects. At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications. Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related? The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy. A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.<br/><br/>Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role. Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin. Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.<br/><br/>Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy. He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience. It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot. At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing. <br/><br/>There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists. The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly. What's a superhero to do? The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs. Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections. Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.<br/><br/>Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1. There's a certain finality in the way it ends which makes one wonder how will they do another Iron Man film. This is Downey's last contractual Iron Man for now and it would be a shame to deny fans another go at a fascinating character especially with The Avengers 2 in the not too distant horizon. And yes, do stay through the lengthy credits for a brief but amusing scene and cameo."

"Rob_Taylor","7","0","1","25 May 2013"," Iron Man? Iron out the wrinkles, more like!
","There is a tendency with all sequels for bigger, better, more flashy. A need to have a bigger menace, more capable foes, more, more, more.<br/><br/>In the case of Iron Man 3 they crossed the threshold and went too far. I've always liked Iron Man (as opposed to the other super hero movies) because it seems to be more realistic and achievable. In other words, science fiction, rather than crazy hokum dreamed up by someone on crack. Iron Man had a basis in reality far stronger than the rest, and that is why I liked it more.<br/><br/>Sadly, with its drug-induced lava humans who can melt anything but suffer no damage, it went beyond the boundary of what I think was acceptable for this franchise.<br/><br/>Add in the fact that the whole movie plays out (for most of the film) like a Bond movie with nary a sight of Iron Man in action, and you can't help but wonder when the action will begin.<br/><br/>The biggest failing was in the needless visual gags, usually centred around Tony Stark putting on his armour (which seems to have become a swarm-like entity in its own right) and which involve slapstick-like comedy not seen since the days of the Three Stooges. Once or twice this might have been humorous. But it happens time after time, as if they couldn't think of anything else to do with it.<br/><br/>There are good things in the movie, such as Stark's character's journey from neurosis back to hero, and the fact that they finally gave Gwynneth Paltrow something to do other than stare into Robert Downey's eyes longingly. But the good parts are outweighed by the stupidity in trying to do too much and ""push the limits"" of what the character can do.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Overblown and overdone. Comedy from your grandad's era. Utter nonsense passed off as science, but without the decency to call it homeopathy. Easily the weakest of the three Iron Man films to date."
"jumbotaxifoxtrot","6","0","1","25 May 2013"," Entertaining, but no substance
","Iron Man 3 picks up the pace right from the opening scene and never slows down for even one instant. While it is chalk full of jokes and jibes, the lack of any real character development or plot is a serious negative for Tony Stark's third solo adventure. The special effects are quite spectacular, and the on screen fireworks are very entertaining. The script tries to improve on the pretty clueless Iron Man 2, and perhaps succeeds only a little in that this installment fares slightly better in the villain department. Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley and of course Robert Downey Jr. put in solid performances. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but the lack of a proper story makes Iron Man 3 a pretty forgettable film."
"RolloTomasi","6","0","1","24 May 2013"," Why Not Just Call it Tony Stark: The Motion Picture?
","Given the intense run-up to this film, I was far too aware of studio machinations behind it. I could almost smell the ink on the contract Downey Jr. signed to the franchise that certainly guaranteed him a minimum amount of face time. It's ludicrous how much time he spends as just plain old Tony Stark, running around with a gun or with self-made gadgets or wearing only part of the Iron Man armor (careful to keep his face exposed). The character seems to have gone far beyond anything the comic envisioned. The movie version of Stark is more complex and that's great. Except, the armor has become no more than a metaphor for the theoretical armor Stark hides behind. They come up with many imaginative ways 42 suits of armor (all built by Stark alone because he can't help it), but in the end they just seem like more excuses to get Downey Jr's face in front of the camera and STILL have scenes with armor so it can be an Iron Man movie. I would reckon that the armor spends very little time on screen, if anyone were to sit down and calculate it. <br/><br/>One other issue I noticed: Disney bought Marvel. Disney's animated movies move along at a bullet pace. They seem to be pushing for that same style with these comic book movies now. The way IM3 is cut, there's no time to even consider what you just saw, no time for emotion whatsoever. I wanted to raise my hand and shout, 'whoa just take it easy! Slow down!' For instance, the movie's best action sequence, where Iron Man rescues the passengers of Air Force One, starts and ends before you can even soakin what just happened. <br/><br/>Oh and I didn't see it in 3D or IMAX but I can't imagine why anyone would want to."
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","24 May 2013"," The Summer Blockbusters begin...here's the lowdown
","Before I go into the nitty gritty of Iron Man 3 let me just try and quell the angry fans that will jump all over me and say that it was a good movie!! It is a well deserving summer Blockbuster with brilliant special effects, a decent story, and a worthy sequel to not only the Iron Man franchise but also the Avengers as well. I enjoyed watching it. However...the big but...I completely understand where some of the fans who are ravaging it with bad reviews are coming from. I believe the incredible, first rate special effects, and the excellent performances warrant at least an 8 but the film has some major flaws too. First of all, this has now become less Iron Man and more The Robert Downey Jr. show. It has always struggled with that balance because Downey is so charismatic and a brilliant actor and to shove him in a metal suit and hide him seems pointless but...that is Iron Man. However, unfortunately the film has evolved into Iron Man suits that control themselves, Downey's Stark that is more James Bond out of the suit, a lot of gun fights like a spy flick and missed opportunities as a superhero movie. It felt like the whole schtick with the Iron Man suit was that none of his suits worked. If this were a drinking game you'd take a shot every time a suit malfunctions and you'd be drunk before the movie was over. He easily spends more time out of the suit than in it. I knew when I saw the trailer with the ""back-up"" of a bunch of different ""Iron Man"" robots that I wouldn't like that angle and I didn't. It was silly and pointless. Do I want to watch a dozen Batmans, Supermans, Iron Mans, Superhero clones? Nope. I came to see one! The other big flaw was that of The Mandarin. I will not give away the twist here because it is a substantial twist but the one thing I was perhaps most excited for from the trailers was the performance of Sir Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. He appeared larger than life, viscous, an incredible superhero villain...well to say he was underwhelming is the understatement of the year. He was mis-used, horribly written and a complete and utter disappointment.<br/><br/>The cast returns in full form. Robert Downey Jr. is electric as Stark. He is the perfect fulfilment of that cocky, dark, genius playboy. This time around he is dealing with some dark emotions following the events of The Avengers and its a good turn for his character. Replacing him when it comes time won't be easy as he is to Iron Man what Connery was to Bond. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau all return to their familiar roles. They are good but somehow all three of them are just a tad underused except Paltrow. She is as good as she has always been and her and Downey have good chemistry, boring great chemistry. I wasn't a fan of some of the plot twists to her character...felt like she wore a suit and donned more powers than Downey did in the movie. Cheadle is severely underused and spends most of his time out of his ""War Machine"" suit too. I'm not sure why the makers of this third instalment thought Cheadle and Downey should stay out of their uniforms and act as their alter egos. I basically said all I can say about the legendary Ben Kingsley. I thought he was going to be one of the best villains to come out of a Superhero film and instead they ruined it. Its not his fault but rather the script because he could have been simply outstanding. Guy Pearce is decent as the villain who does things by channelling a Lex Luthor type character. He's a solid actor and does well but his character was only okay. Rebecca Hall also joins the cast as a Scientist from Stark's past. She is good as well though I'm not sure entirely necessary to the story.<br/><br/>I definitely feel sorry for Shane Black as director. He had a HUGE OMINOUS job ahead of him. Disney and Marvel have built an action franchise worth countless Billions and every outing has to be EPIC and bigger and badder than each predecessor. Iron Man 3 certainly feels epic...there is no doubt. The very first action scene in Tony's home is brilliant and edge of your seat riveting. No matter what they are going to disappoint some fans because the expectations are so high. I still think no matter what they made a grievous error with the villains in the film which is such an important factor in a superhero film. Many fans are blaming Disney for such details as the kid sidekick that makes an appearance but that didn't bother me. There was a redemptive quality in the relationship between Stark and the kid. I was also surprised at the level of violence in the film especially considering how many innocent people are either blown up or just shot. Even bad guys are shot...a lot...just with a plain old gun. I could probably spend days nit picking my way through the film but I won't do that. It was a good movie, lots of fun, a great start to the summer Blockbusters and certainly it still holds its own in the superior Marvel franchise of movies. See it for yourself and try to go in with proper expectations. 8/10"

The Mandarin won't be an easy opponent.""<br/><br/>How The Mandarin speaks, how he terrorize the minds of the people, it was amazing.<br/><br/>Until they spoiled it up, and f'd it up. *if you know what i mean*<br/><br/>The Marvel fan guys will know what i mean.<br/><br/>The reason why i gave this movie a solid 8/10 is because the special effects and the action itself. The Iron Man series are never really disappointing. Yeah i admit I got a little disappointed with The Mandarin stuff, but the movie keeps cheering me up with the actions and effects they made. The ending battle were also amazing.<br/><br/>A little advice, next time, if you wanna make a serious action movie, then make one. Don't push it with mediocre comedy and cheesy dialogs throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If you are an action or sci fi movie lover, then you should see this movie.<br/><br/>But if you are a marvel universe lover, then don't get your hopes too high."

","The plot interweaves a host of American anxieties: freelance terrorists, the radical global mass murder organization, the oil spills and the political system that defends them, the dread empowerment of women, the infiltration of federal government by self-serving traitors, fatherless children who turn to weapons and charismatic leaders, and the apparently unstoppable seduction of innocence and idealism by which every technological advance breeds a new weaponry. In the face of all this, this Iron Man is still the super-powerful -- both in intellect and wealth -- force but here debilitated by self-doubt, even anxiety attacks. He's so insecure that his security head Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), promoted from bodyguard, after a few scenes of efficiency spends the rest of the film in a coma. As Hogan is played by the director of the earlier Iron Man films, Stark is left unprotected by not just his guard but his earlier maker. For more see www.yacowar.blogpost.com."
"Aaron1375","8","0","2","20 May 2013"," Good film, but still left the nasty taste of iron in my mouth
","I kept hearing how this film was better than Iron Man 2, which I actually enjoyed so my expectations were a bit high. However, I tempered them a bit as I could see what was going to disappoint me a lot when I was watching the trailers. So I went to the film, and I enjoyed it for the most part...I liked it a bit better than two. Mainly due to the longer action scene at the end, but the disappointment was there too. What disappointed me so, you ask? The villain of the piece, of course. Being a fan of comics in general it was just a tough pill to swallow. Still, the film still managed to be very entertaining all the same.<br/><br/>The story, has Tony Stark recounting a trip he had in Switzerland back in 1999, where he had a fling and kind of was a jerk to a man insistent on seeing him. Flash years later and a terrorist known as the Mandarin has been planting bombs and is at war with the U.S. The U.S. responds by sending Col. James Rhodes and war machine, now dubbed The Iron Patriot after him. Well Tony is going through some trouble, frequently having panic attacks, most likely brought upon by the attack upon New York seen in the Avengers film. Tony is brought into the hunt for the Mandarin when his friend and former body guard Happy is severely injured in the Mandarin's latest attack. Tony dares the Mandarin to come get him and the Mandarin does just that sending attack helicopters that decimate Tony's home and leave him stranded in Tennessee where Tony is able to piece together the full story and finds that there is something going on and it has nothing to do with a terrorist detonating bombs.<br/><br/>The story played out pretty good, but the whole Mandarin thing was a disappointment. I had been waiting to see Iron Man's main nemesis since movie one. I am still waiting as what I expected to happen did. The Mandarin was just a fraud and the real villain is very easily figured out. I was happy that the real villain did have powers, but it was kind of like Molten Man's power. The villains heat up to a high temperature and can melt through even the Iron Man armor. People try to say they were doing something different, but I think that is only a small portion of it. For one, the director had stated he did not really want to do the Mandarin. Why get a director that has issues with a character? It is like forcing Venom on Sam Rami who hated the character or putting Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich in charge of Godzilla when they hate Godzilla. It doesn't make sense. Another reason, and the main one is that I am guessing they had already decided to put as many Iron Man suits on display as possible. This takes time and money. Well the Mandarin uses ten rings in the comics each with a specific power which translates in Hollywood to ten costly special effects that they were to cheap and lazy to do. Much easier to do the same effect for the villains over and over. So no Mandarin in his true form and thanks to the introduction of him in this film, no Mandarin ever unless they reboot the series.<br/><br/>Once again, the film was still good. I enjoyed it, I just would have enjoyed it more with the real Mandarin. The action was done very well, it had a lot of funny moments and it was cool how they referenced the Avengers film. So a lot of good to be found. Just the nerd in me that is severely disappointed. It would be like if they made a Batman film and had Batman fighting a villain and they crash into a birthday party. A clown at the party sprays Batman with a flower and Batman pushes him angrily saying, ""Out of the way, 'joker'"" and this is what counts as the Joker in the movie. Sure, it was funny, but also highly disappointing. It is also disappointing that Robert Downey Jr. will no longer do any stand alone Iron Man films as they do make for a good super hero film. So was it better than two? Yes, but not by all that much in my opinion."
"Zombefan","8","0","1","19 May 2013"," A good kick-ass time with Mr. Stark
","I am a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. and his work in all three of the Iron Man films. Robert's witty banter and comedic timing is spot on and makes him the perfect Tony Stark in my book. I will start by saying this review comes from a not so religious comic book fan. So you will get a complete outsiders perspective. <br/><br/>Good: Visual effects are pretty outstanding. I don't think people realize the time and effort goes into making just single still frame of one of these movies.<br/><br/>Tony looses his house, girlfriend and his gadgets and has to come up with some ghetto rigged gadgets, I like that idea.<br/><br/>Acting was never an issue here, The Mandarin character stole the stage at some points In the film, nice to see some new humor to break up the action.<br/><br/>The villains were pretty decently scary and entertaining<br/><br/>Tony has made it to where he doesn't need to be in his suit to use them. Great idea and added some edge to the film to mess with the audience.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but I have to be UN-biased and get to the bad parts.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>Tony is a genius but yet he has no home defense?<br/><br/>Tony makes his suit only compatible to himself yet, he throws it on Pepper and the main villain?<br/><br/>Tony now gets panic attacks? <br/><br/>I guess they ruined The Mandarin character for the comic book fans.<br/><br/>Tony gives up the Iron Man life at the end, or so it seems...<br/><br/>Kinda ruins the plot, (unless Marvel has some up their sleeve) for the Avengers 2.<br/><br/>The plot elements for Tony' Iron Man armor is weak. It can take beatings from Thor and Aliens, but a few messily solders can tear them apart?<br/><br/>So I mean the film isn't perfect, but what movies are. There will always be a negative Nacy to tear down a film. Like I always say ""Don't knock it before you try it"", filmmaking is hard work and I highly doubt a lot of the negative viewers could make a better film if they tried. Yes I agree a comic book adaptation should be keep very similar to the comic. I am a huge Resident Evil fan and look what they did to my films :/ so I know how you feel. Just keep in mind that they probably wrote the script for viewers like me who had no prior knowledge of the comic book history. It was a great film and I will be recommending this highly. Good luck, and Goodnight"

"jmoney-2","8","0","2","18 May 2013"," The logical conclusion of the Tony Stark Transformation
","The ""Iron Man"" trilogy has always been, at its core, a story of redemption: Tony Stark, the billionaire weapons dealer who earns a fortune by exploiting armed conflict, takes up arms himself to end conflict. (It turns out Tony has a heart of gold, or rather, palladium.) ""Iron Man 3"" completes the story by seeing Stark fully redeemed, while at the same time delving further into the nature and consequences of man's inhumanity to man. Oh, and it's also a rocking ton of popcorn-munching fun.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s main character began as a man who made weapons of mass destruction for profit while ignoring the human costs. Now, three films later, with his rocket-powered Iron Man suits honed to perfection, he's a weapon of mass destruction himself – one who experiences the human toll of combat first-hand. The film begins sometime after the events of last year's ""The Avengers,"" which saw Stark teaming up with several other super heroes to fight alien invaders. It turns out the experience has left Tony with a bout of post-traumatic stress disorder.<br/><br/>In this troubled state, he finds himself compelled to take on a sadistic terrorist threat known as The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. But The Mandarin is not all that he seems. There's a twist involving the villain that is as audacious as it is entertaining – one that forces us to question what we think we know about terrorist bogeymen. At the same time, people from Tony's past (namely a scientist with dubious motives played by Guy Pearce) emerge to cause him personal trouble – just as his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) hits a rocky patch. Inevitably, all these internal and external battles converge to create Stark's biggest challenge to date.<br/><br/>The ""Iron Man"" movies work because we like and care about Tony Stark -- because a great actor brings him to life. The best scenes in the Iron Man films have always involved Downey out of the suit -- watching a CGI robotic suit fly around can only be entertaining for so long. His witty one-liners and his improvised banter with Paltrow have made for some of the trilogy's best scenes. The filmmakers seem to have picked up on this fact – since the latest installment finds Tony forced to make due without the suit more than ever before. This movie resembles more of a James Bond flick – with a dash of buddy cop camaraderie thrown in for good measure (thanks to Tony's sidekick, Don Cheadle, as Iron Patriot a.k.a War Machine). New director Shane Black keeps the improvisational feel of the first two movies and doesn't allow the Academy honored cast members to get lost among all the explosions and effects. Most viewers won't notice much of a difference in tone. Maybe that's because the former director, Jon Favreau, was still on set, reprising his role as Tony's loyal employee, Happy Hogan. The most notable and unfortunate omission: AC/DC blaring on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Beneath the top-notch action set pieces and comic dialog, the movie does explore some serious themes. Tony's aforementioned PTSD isn't the only side effect of war that the movie delves into. The epidemic of suicides among war veterans is strongly hinted at in a subplot that sees returning soldiers literally turned into ticking time bombs. Another subplot also seems to examine the slippery slope of drone technology. This time around, Tony uses several remote controlled versions of his suit to defeat his enemies. This is not a movie that challenges us to stop and ponder complex issues, but if you do take the time to do so, the symbolism of unmanned killer flying robots shows what could happen if our advanced modern weaponry fell into the wrong hands. There are also references to the Deep Water Horizon disaster and the downside of our consumption of fossil fuels. However, these thought-provoking topics are merely hidden nutrients that sit below the surface of what is explicitly fun, feel-good summer entertainment.<br/><br/>In the last act, Tony's transformation from war profiteer to war/super hero is brought to its logical conclusion. The ending certainly closes the loop and leaves us wondering if we'll ever see Downey's Iron Man in another stand-alone movie. If we don't, he'll be sorely missed – but we can say he went out on top."

","These low ratings to the movie makes me really mad. I mean, why hate the movie because you had expected something else in the plot. Most of these hates comes from this part (SPOILER ALERT!) when we get to know that the Mandarin actually is fake. I thought that was brilliant! It makes the movie even more thrilling when you still have to think about the real truth, even though it was kinda obvious that someone else was the real bad guy (without spoiling who).Ohh, and hating a movie just because it takes place in Christmas, is just a shame.

","Here we have another superhero trilogy find its end. After seeing The Dark Knight Rises last year it left some impressions on me. In my opinion that was the best batman movie out of the latest ones and it being the third one I expected the same out of Iron Man 3. I'm not saying its a bad movie but it missed out on some key factors that would make it a great movie. The writing was decent with the exception that the outcome of most battles were determined by a conveniently placed object, weapon, etc. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting was pretty good but a couple of the minor roles were off. Maya Hansen didn't do as good of a job as I had hoped and Gwyneth Paltrow overdid it a bit in the end. The movie did have some good points though. For example some of the story didn't exactly follow DC's original comic version-such as the Mandarin and Iron Patriot - but it was written into the plot well enough to make die hard DC fans love it. Despite the bad things said about the movie I did enjoy watching it. I highly recommend any fan of comic books, superheroes or movies in general to go see it."

","Tony Stark has come a long way since his early days as a B-lister superhero. Ten years ago any comic book fan or film producer would have laughed at the notion of such a lesser known hero developing not one, not two, but three box office hits. That said, and here we are in 2013 with Iron Man's fourth outing and third solo picture where his popularity has never been higher. While Iron Man 2 was no doubt a stumble, the character still bounced back stronger than ever in The Avengers.

","I like the Iron Man franchise as from these movies I got introduced to this exceptional actor, Robert Downey Jr. I always look forward to his movies. He has a personality so unique and it perfectly suits the character Tony Scott. The panic attacks, the humor, every detailing of his character in this movie has been well executed by him.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 was fun to watch summer superhero flick. This is the first movie I am watching which is directed by Shane Black. The screenplay is fast. The story for me is average with fewer laughs and not better than the first 2 movies of the franchise. The only thing which saved this movie for me was Robert Downey Jr.'s charm and the amazing climax which was a treat to watch. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts looks very fit & pretty. She gives a nice performance as her character gets more detailed and has a friction with boyfriend Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley is an unexpected surprise package to watch out for, but is it likable or not, thats for you to decide. Guy Pearce is smart and gives a good performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography and action & VFX sequences are very cool and do entertain you to an extent. Especially the climax action and the scene where Tony & Pepper reunite. Tony's brief camaraderie with the little kid was sweet but not memorable. The direction of Shane Black was good but not without flaws. I liked the dark humor but at times it border lined Iron Man as a superhero ridiculing himself to the brink! I liked the advances of the technology that Tony is been shown integrating in his new Iron Man suits, but showing them being shattered into pieces every now and then depletes the Superhero quality in Tony for which he is looked up by the audience. Tony Stark is a genius and by the 3rd movie he should be so brilliant at making suits, that the suit can't end up being a piece of joke which really irked me. Secondly though the thought of Mandarin was a very good one as an antagonist, it wasn't executed in a deadly way. The villains of the first 2 movies were far more effective.<br/><br/>Overall if you are fan of Iron Man, you will like Iron Man 3 withstanding its shortcomings. Otherwise its a onetime watch. Robert Downey Jr.deserves one more outing for sure in the Iron Man suit, as I applause his performance and wait for the next sequel, hopefully!"

"wiserender","7","0","2","12 May 2013"," Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2
","On May 3ed Iron Man 3 rocketed into theaters fueled by the smash hit The Avengers, which came out one year earlier on May 4th 2012. From the beginning I had doubts about this third installment because it was not written or directed by Jon Favreau as with Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, famed screenwriter of Lethal Weapon.<br/><br/>Given that, this movie exceeded my expectations. The action and effects were spectacular. The plot was cohesive and they definitely added some new and interesting elements to the Iron Man franchise. Without spoiling anything I will say that Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts gets to be more involved in this third film, she is not relegated to the sidelines. And lets face it guys, we like to see a woman of action. Ever since Alien made it a mainstream archetype, we have been drawn to attractive, strong, independent woman that is not just a girl to be saved. I kept this in mind when I wrote the character of Gessica, the female lead in my movie Cam-Girl (AKA Web-Cam).<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 also had a few surprises along the way, how the characters developed and what the villains weapon really turns out to be. These moments of the movie were refreshing, spontaneous and realistic for the given situations.<br/><br/>The one minor complaint I had was that a few parts of the story were written in a contrived way to reach an end result. This was done to force Tony Stark into his low point and it was also present during the big finale of the film. It turns out a lot went into making that final scene. In a Entertainment Weekly interview Robert Downey Jr. laments that he injured an ankle performing a stunt which caused a six week shut down during production.<br/><br/>This third Iron Man film provided great closure for the character and the storyline. As of now this is the last time Robert Downey Jr. is obligated to suit up as Iron Man. Part of me wishes this is the last Iron Man movie they make because it ended strongly. I'm sure they will make more Iron Man films because of there success. The question remains if it will be Downey Jr. as the character, it would be hard for me to imagine any other actor filling those iron shoes. I recommend Iron Man 3."
"bluesman-20","Null","0","2","12 May 2013"," I Am Tony stark and I am also Iron Man. The man makes the suit.
","I saw Iron Man 3 last night I took my wife to see it because she is a huge RDJ fan. I consider this film the best of the series simply because it takes risks. Yes there are changes notable changes. That differ largely from the comics version. The Fact is the changes made in this film only serve to make it better. There were major changes in The Avengers film and Captain America and Thor. Yet those changes only served to make the film better. The story this time around is After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is falling apart. He can't sleep and suffers panic attacks. The Events of the battle of New York and his trip into the alien dimension and the fact that he died. All of these things weigh heavily on him. Tony spends his time making more Iron Man Armor. Pepper is still CEO of Stark industries and Tony's best friend and one time body guard Happy Hogan is now head of security. Happy is paranoid of every new face, When Aldrich Killian meets with Pepper to show off his company's new break through a virus he calls Extremis. Extremis can map the brain and fill in the gaps and improve on them. One of the ways Extremis works is it can take the body's healing process and magnify it by a hundred times making the body heal itself at a rapid pace. More then that there are other ways Extermis can make itself useful. The film after the introduction of Extremis and Killian goes into overdrive It has twists and turns and spectacular stunts. But most of all it has a story . One that leaves you guessing. Sure it's Not the comic book. But where does it say that it has to reproduce the comic book down to the last detail. The Character of the Mandarin is the biggest dividing factor here. At one point I could see why true fans are upset. and on the other side I was thinking what a original take on the character. Iron Man 3 won't win any Oscars. but in the entertainment side of things it does that wonderfully. the one thing that surprised me and made me enjoy it more was more Tony Stark and less Iron Man. This film puts Tony Stark into a James Bond type of adventure. Shane Black breathes new life into the Golden Avenger. And while I loved Faverou's take on Iron Man. I didn't miss his touch on this one at all. that doesn't mean I didn't like Faverou that's far from the truth I loved his Faverou's take on Iron Man very much. Iron Man 3 has a different tone and a different feel to it making it the best in the series. And that's not bad. It makes me want to see how Iron Man 4 and Avengers II are going to turn out."

","Let me start off by saying I am a comic book fan and I understand why some people had issues with the portrayal of the Mandarin. Personally I thought it was a welcoming twist.<br/><br/>I found that the movie really showed what kind of person Tony Stark is and ties really well into past events. In the movie Tony experiences post-traumatic stress disorder from events in The Avengers, and I thought his issues were tackled brilliantly! I thought the supporting cast of the movies was excellent! The quips between Robert Downey Jr. and Don Cheadle were fantastic! I just wish Cheadle had gotten more screen time.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent movie. But if you go in expecting The Avengers you won't get it; Iron Man 3 was much more grounded. Keep up the good work Marvel!!!"
"azureblueflame","8","0","1","12 May 2013"," Even Without His Armor, Tony Stark Is The Iron Man.....
","A wise man once said: we make our own demons. These first lines from the beginning of the movie were the ones which really impressed me. I had obviously gone with lots of hopes and expectations to watch the film, and unlike many people here who have reviewed this film quite badly, I actually enjoyed myself not just because it was good, but because finally, we got to know Tony Stark more than Iron Man. I believe the word, ""action"" and ""armor"" has been recently connected whenever ""Iron Man"" is mentioned, I mean, yes, obviously Iron Man is all about action and power, but one mustn't forget is that there should be some meaning too in the movie or just plain action destroys it, I believe this is the case for most of the people who were disappointed due to the less presence of the Iron Man as we saw Tony Stark more often! But I take this in a positive light, for as the comics always played more emphasis on Tony than it ever did to his counterpart and here, this whole movie is all about showing that Tony Stark can live without his super-armor and that he can still do wonders. I must compliment the director on his direction as this movie is full of twists and surprises, bringing in the most powerful villain in the Iron Man series and then declaring that the guy was an all time phony required quite much boldness. Also, the best part of the movie was that every five minutes, you could hear laughter erupting from every side, such is the charm and wittiness of the scenes. Now if the talk comes to the cast, well, I cannot say anything much. Robert Downey Jr. again shows why he and only he could ever be born to do such a role which he does to the utmost perfection. The co-cast of Ben Kingsley, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce do a fine task of keeping up the movie along with the others. Perhaps the one scene which I won't be forgetting soon about the movie is when the Iron Man finally breaks down and Tony is left alone to walk in the snowy night, then the encounter with the teenage kid and all that followed were just fantastic. The music was pretty good and suited well with the scenes. Finally, all I can say is that the movie was quite different than what everyone expected, of course, it could have been better but the ending was perhaps far more unreal than anyone would expect of an Iron Man movie and it actually does the job pretty well. My final verdict, a good film with its own amazing comedic moments, great acting, a rather diverse script, a good enough music to go along with it. A must watch still for every ""movie"" fan out there for it still is a good movie in its own regard. Perhaps the best thing about this film was that there was a big meaning in it through which we finally get the answer to Captain America's question In the Avengers and that is, no matter what you take away from him or what you do to him, even if he has no super- powered suits to speak of, Tony Stark is always the Iron Man."
"drew_atreides","7","0","1","11 May 2013"," Uneven entry, but more good then bad
","I should start this review by saying I continue to be surprised by just how positively the IRON MAN series has been received. I guess it's a tribute to the charisma of Robert Downey Jr. I felt the first film was GOOD, but not spectacular, yet Downey's performance seemed to be the key to making the movie accessible to the masses. I'm cool with that, as he's an incredible talent.<br/><br/>The 2nd film in the series was pretty darned forgettable. I still have only watched it once and doubt i will ever watch it again. All i recall about it was the climactic fight was really a letdown.<br/><br/>A lot of the stuff in 3 seemed pretty ham-fisted and unnecessary (squeezing a cutesy kid in for no real good reason, the Tony Stark anxiety attacks), and i'm not sure what to make of the end where they leave Stark's character. And all the Pepper stuff.... <br/><br/>However the action sequences are top-notch, especially the Air Force One sequence and the finale. And the buddy-cop style scenes between Downey and Cheadle are ridiculously entertaining. It's a shame Cheadle is featured so little in the film until the final quarter. He was really strong. And finally Guy Pearce as the villain. I must say, it's a pretty poorly written character, but Pearce plays it with gusto. This guy should be bigger then he is. He's a wonderful actor who isn't afraid to take a chance.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge reader of the IRON MAN comics, so i must say i can't get upset about the Mandarin stuff. Ben Kingsley has always been among my favourite actors, so it's always a plus when he shows up. I felt he did well with what he had. <br/><br/>Overall I think it's a better entry then #2, but not quite up to the standard set by #1. It is a solid popcorn flick with some great action and a few decent one-liners."

"fredrikdunge","7","0","1","11 May 2013"," All in all an entertaining movie
","First of I will say that I review this as a movie goer I have never read the iron man comics or never been much into comics at all, especially not Marvell.<br/><br/>That said I enjoyed the movie, several other have down rated it because it wasn't faithful to the comic, well I don't see the issue, if you want the comic read the comics this is a movie and its purpose is to sell itself. So no magician as villain? Well that's because there is no magic in the marvel movie universe, even Thor isn't actually a 'god' but just a sufficiently advanced alien. The plot was good although I will agree with others in that it was perhaps a little to easy to knock mister stark out of his suit, but I can see why they did this. The writers have obviously understood that we (the regular movie goer, not the comic book fan)like Tony Stark a lot more than we like iron man, sure the suit is cool but its the wit of RDJ, and the excellent soundtrack that makes the Ironman movies what they are. this movie certainly gives us the former, we have RDj runnign around without the suit most of the movie. I don't mind, the boring villains (the extremis guys, the corporate evil guy is actually somewhat enjoyable) are a far worse thing if you ask me. There's lots of action lots of explosions and lots of Tony acting somewhat like Tony. However, the movie have looked far to much on batman, especially in the beginning. Its far to dark with bombs going of and terrorists making statements on TV. Also the save the president storyline hasn't been cool since airforce-1 with Harrison ford. But my biggest gripe with the movie is the soundtrack. instead of Thunderstruck with ac/dc or even better ironman with black sabbath we're treated to something that sound remarkably like the batman theme. Yeah Ironman and Batman are similar in many ways, and yes Nolans batman trilogy probably got higher ratings than the iron man movies but when it comes down to it they were never really competing. Iron man was about kicking ass and chewing bubblegum (or rather drink scotch and sleeping around) more than a broody guy fighting darkness. and instead of playing its strengths it tried to be something else. Sure it gave us more Tony but it missed why we like Tony. Never the less a enjoyable movie but in retrospect considering the theme of the villains you should've gone for House of fire with Alice Cooper for soundtrack (or something similar). And then built in the direction that took you. It's a good action flick, with 7/10 better than the 6/10 i gave the second movie but far worse than the 9/10 I gave the first one."

"Irie212","8","0","2","11 May 2013"," The skillful evolution of Iron Man
","To judge by many of the reviews here, it's possible that fans of the Marvel comic may be too close to the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man to be objective, because I didn't read many cogent criticisms of this as a stand-alone film. There's a lot of lamenting about how it should or could have been done. But Iron Man 3 does stand alone, and it stands tall.<br/><br/>The movie is a cleverly constructed stride forward in this franchise, which is the most entertaining of any comic-to-screen work. It's popularity and success is largely due to Robert Downey Jr's unique charisma, of course. However, considering John Favreau's wonderful comic turn as Happy Hogan, I can't help but conclude that a lot of the success is due to his approach to the material. <br/><br/>Most impressive for me was the way Tony Stark and Iron Man are examined in relation to each other. The film begins with Stark having tirelessly (sleeplessly, in fact) constructed more than 40 iron suits (including one each for Pepper and Rhodey), the new models being generously articulated-- hundreds if not thousands of components whizz toward and assemble on him on command. That deconstruction of the suit becomes a plot device, allowing Stark to go through the various fight scenes in various degrees of armor-- fully encased, partially, or entirely without the suit. We're watching him evolve. <br/><br/>The suit is also a skin, and a weapon. When Pepper wears part of hers, she gets insight into Tony that she could never otherwise have had: I understand how attached you are to it now, she says (I paraphrase). And in the end, Tony commands the suits into whizzing action: first as an army, and then in a spectacular display in which he reclaims himself as a vulnerable human man.<br/><br/>This is a well-conceived film that moves Iron Man forward more as man than machine. The only disappointment for me was the pointless 3-D technology. It didn't hurt; it just wasn't necessary. I would write more, but I need to see the film at least once more before I can fully explore all the talent that went into it. The post- credit sequence with Downey and Mark Ruffalo is not only fun but useful, for making the audience appreciate all the names the roll past, and all their roles. Among them: Mark Stoeckinger (Star Trek 2009, Prometheus, Unstoppable, etc., etc., including multiple episodes of Miami Vice), whose sound editing in this film is as good as it gets-- no small praise for this genre of movie."

I tend to not like Marvel films however I did think Iron Man 3 was a spectacular film in many ways. People may not like it but it was action- packed and a good film to see. The story-line to the film was very good and the story 'inter-linked' in a good way. Robert Downey. Jr. was probably the best person to play Iron Man / Tony Stark as it fitted in with his role of Acting. The story was, however, a modern day, 'Man saves the world kind-of story'. On the other hand-it was not that good because we see this kind of story in 'Spider-Man', 'Captain America' and other films."

","This film is the best Iron Man film because it's unpredictable, it's funnier than the others, and Ben Kingsley is in it. He plays the 'villain' in the film but is hilarious, giving an excellent performance. Robert Downey Jnr is, as usual, the quick-witted, sarcastic Iron Man but this film focuses on his weaknesses: his relationship with Pepper is declining as he's spending more and more time in his work; his house is not as safe as you would imagine the country's hero to be; and old ghosts return from the past.<br/><br/>This is a great film with a lot of laughs and explosive action, definitely a film the Iron Man fans won't be disappointed with."
"spacemohsin","9","0","4","11 May 2013"," Iron Man: The suit vs The man
","The new Mark 42 suit is designed by Tony and that means all new features and all new problems. In most part of the movies the suit is depicted as a faulty prototype, but even Tony has some issues. Tony has his nightmares and anxiety attacks from The Avengers hole travel (which might cause problems for any Avenger superhero if they ever want to go to the other Worlds, but anyways). Though both the man and the suit has its own problems they have never been stronger. Tony has never been more smarter with extreme intelligence shown through out; and of course the suits new powers which I will let you see for yourself! So who was the hero in the movie? The suits which gave backup and were present where Tony could not reach (which includes his absence in his romantic life) Or Tony Stark the genius who needs no support from me. <br/><br/>The answer is one cannot live without the other! Tony says it in the end that ""I will always be Iron Man"" he says that's the one thing no one can steal. I have heard enough reviews that say this movie is more focused on Tony than Iron Man! Iron man is Tony and vice versa. Has anyone differentiated Bruce Banner and the Hulk? No. (except Bruce who wants to get rid of it on many occasions) Does anyone say that The Incredible Hulk movie was more focused on Bruce than Hulk? No. So why do that for Iron Man? Give it a thought!"

","I don't know what the Oscar best picture allotment number is now-a-days but a film this good SHOULD be given serious consideration for the Best Picture Oscar. Yes, it's past time for a mere ""comic book movie"" to be taken seriously. I know it's May but the Academy has to recognize this remarkable movie. If LOTR: Return of the King can win, so can this film. The action/fantasy bigotry from the Academy may be at an end.<br/><br/>Honestly, Iron Man 3 is ten times a better all around film than something like District 9 or Life of Pi. When Roger Ebert called for Spider-Man 2 to be nominated for best picture no one listened. Well, times are a changing. Iron Man 3 is the kind of movie that delivers both quality and entertainment. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see Robert Downey Jr. nominated again this time for Tony Stark. He deserved the honor back in 2008. Great performances by some of Oscar's old guard (RDJr, Gwenyth, Cheadle, Kingsley) plus an intelligent and thrilling movie with a mix of complex character strife equals gold in my book and most people's book. Hopefully, Oscar gold as well."

","First, a confession; I'm not a fan of the Marvel superhero universe in comics or films. There, I've said it! If anything, I would say that I'm more of a DC/Vertigo, Image and Dynamite Comics kinda guy really and still not much into the superhero side of things either, and so 'Iron Man 3' wasn't originally on my movie watchlist for 2013. Yes, I'd seen and enjoyed the first 'Iron Man', didn't bother with the second, and wasn't overly fussed about 'The Avengers', although did catch it on blu later, so I wasn't too bothered about watching Shane Black's take on 'Iron Man'. That was until I'd seen the trailers.<br/><br/>For once, the trailers did their job on enticing me to want to see a film I had no plans to see, which makes a change! Hollywood suits knowing how to promote a movie? Whatever next! And as always, I try to stay clear of any clips and spoilers before going in, I like to watch a movie with knowing as little as possible beforehand - a difficult feat these days with a multitude of websites scrambling to get snippets of news and spoilers out.<br/><br/>What I saw was a Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), suffering from an inferiority complex, after battling a God and aliens in his exploits in 'The Avengers', and coping with that by building new suits at the cost of his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as well as the rise of a new villain, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), to deal with. And after Stark seemingly losing everything that mattered to him in one go and being stranded, it's up to him to find himself again and to save the day!<br/><br/>I watched it in dazzling 2D, and the film is a well rounded feature and is what you would maybe expect from Marvel these days. It zips along at a good pace, but I did feel it kind of sagged in the middle, which coincided with the annoying kid sidekick for me, after Stark is stranded in a small town. The film does pick up again towards the end though with the climactic confrontation and the suits all joining up to battle at the end, as seen in the trailers.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's performance stole the show for me, totally not what I expected. And the rest of the cast played their parts well too, as you would expect. Especially RDJ portraying the fall of Stark from cocky braggart to finding his human side again, and an awesome Gwyneth Paltrow as the love of his life.<br/><br/>As always, go in with an open mind, and if you enjoyed Marvel's Phase One superhero films and were one of those that squee'd yourself at 'The Avengers', then you'll definitely get a kick out of this movie and the first of the post Avengers Phase Two Marvel movies. Don't forget to stay after the end credits too!"
"Staffenburgen","6","0","1","10 May 2013"," A Bit Better Than I Expected, Yet Still Disappointing
","Let me begin by saying that I'm not much of a comic book fan and don't really know much about the background of the villains portrayed in the film. I say that because many people are absolutely shredding this film for how it utilizes one of the villains in the film. So, if you're like me, that's not likely to bother you very much and you'll probably enjoy the movie much more than comic book fans are. After all, Iron Man 3 is actually a decent third movie in what could be the last movie of a trilogy. <br/><br/>In many ways, Iron Man 3 is a typical third movie. Stark is faced with his most challenging foes yet, and comes dangerously close to losing absolutely everything. This makes the film slightly darker than the previous instalments, though the constant jokes keep the mood still very light. However, it should be said that the dialogue feels a long way off from the first movie; the one-liners in this film seem quite forced and they are decidedly less funny for one reason or another. This brings me to my major gripe with the film: the writing. The ""story"" here is nothing short of a disaster, with misguided motivations, twists and turns that don't really make sense, and enough plot holes to make your head spin. However, despite all that, the movie is saved by Downey Jr., who breathes life into the Iron Man character. <br/><br/>Aside from Downey Jr., the supporting cast does an alright job. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and does as good a job as she could've with what she was given. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley are introduced as the two central villains of the movie, and both really suffer from the writing here. Pearce, who was incredible in Christopher Nolan's Memento, is stuck with a two dimensional role surrounded by ridiculous special effects, and is never really given a chance to do anything special here. Kingsley's role is tough to describe without giving anything away, but his performance is very good given the garbage he was expected to bring to life. In addition, Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau return as War Machine and Happy Hogan, and both do well with their minor roles. <br/><br/>One thing you can't knock about the film are the special effects. The CGI sequences are stunning (as expected) and the 3D option certainly enhanced the visuals. The score is decent here as well, although it doesn't really stand out like some of the other superhero movies (like The Dark Knight). <br/><br/>All in all, it's an entertaining movie. After the disaster that was the second movie, I expected this to be awful. I may have been right about the story, but the film does a good job of holding your attention and will keep you entertained for a few hours (although you will forget it as soon as you leave the theater). It's a shame that this film couldn't restore the series to the excellence of the first film, but hopefully the next movie (it it's even made) can accomplish that. <br/><br/>RATING: 6/10"
"agmoldham","6","0","2","9 May 2013"," Ticks all the boxes
","There aren't any great surprises in Iron Man 3. If you enjoyed the first couple of Iron man movies the chances are you'll like this one as well.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously at it's best when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is showboating. As with the first couple of instalments there are plenty of scenes where this happens. The character isn't really fleshed out any further though. The villain of the film would also have benefited from a couple of extra scenes to flesh out their character. The film isn't a masterpiece, but it's a pretty pleasant couple of hours of mindless fun.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3d, but don't really think that helped or hindered my enjoyment of the movie. Save yourself a couple of bucks and watch the film in 2d!"
"duloth","7","0","4","9 May 2013"," Acceptable, well-executed, poorly scripted.
","Fun to watch for the most part; standard Iron Man formula; powerful business exec with a history with Tony relies on the tech of others to pose a threat.<br/><br/>The plot seems to wander aimlessly, not really fleshing out the main villain aside from simply that he wants revenge, giving Rhodes little to do other than be a target, inserting feel-good bit child characters; this is a badly done plot that hopes to redeem itself by its flashy and impressive action scenes, which themselves fall short of the other three iron man films. <br/><br/>Overall; go ahead and watch it if you liked the second film. At this point, you'll still be fine just watching the first one, and then watching Avengers.<br/><br/>***Spoilers below*** Three business executives with chips on their shoulders. Three threats using both Tony's and someone else's tech. Three iron man movies.<br/><br/>This one has the worst villain; the one that is the least fleshed out, and having the only redeeming value of a sense of theatrics. <br/><br/>The iron man suits have been rebuilt out of paper mache; and have a disturbing habit of completely (temporarily)shutting down if you apply heat to them.<br/><br/>The villains supposedly have two abilities; regeneration and heat generation that must stay well below 3000 degrees or it risks causing them to explode. These, supposedly, explain how they are able to tear apart an iron man suit with their bare hands. (For the more scientifically minded, in order to get the alloyed iron man suit to break apart that quickly, you'd need to be using a material that was itself at or above the boiling point of the metal, otherwise the absolute best you could manage would be to slowly push your hand through it; something fatal against a suit that is in fact superhumanly strong and equipped with weapons that can kill you in one hit; and we've established that getting that hot is fatal to these people)<br/><br/>They have no ranged weapons capable of damaging an iron man suit, and yet do surprisingly well against the legion of Iron Men; each of which is able to destroy them in a single shot to the head or torso.<br/><br/>In the end, there is only one conclusion; the enemies were in fact magic-users that could generate more heat than they were capable of surviving, able to generate temperatures at which their own nervous systems would be so much vapor and their supposed limits would cause them to explode without hindrance. In addition, all of that assumed, the Iron Man suits that were destroyed so easily were programmed with some sort of secretive Lemming protocol, given the command to ensure plenty died so long as enough were around to do the job.<br/><br/>Why did Tony build the legion of iron men? Obviously in the event of another alien invasion; that squad of 40 flying suits could likely last for days against the sort of invasion that happened in new york; considering how well a single suit did, they might be able to deal with the whole thing on their own, especially with the interesting upgrades some of them had. The movie implies that before the opening sequence, Tony was smart, and dealt with his nightmares by preparing for them as best he could. And then at the end? All that preparation, tools that might well save the human race? If I were an alien watching from orbit, I'd invade the day after Iron Man crushed the fire mages. Maybe just a few minutes."
"ayoreinf","9","0","4","8 May 2013"," It's the acting stupid
","I Liked all the Iron Man movies so far. This one is the best of the three. And no, it's not the special effects, not the fire works, not even the plot twists. They're all in, but they were there beforehand, the special bit about this third Iron Man movie is the combination of a very well written character whose weakness in a manner of speaking is also his strength. Who shows more humanity with all its frailness, as he faces his greatest adversary. It's not exactly the Mandarin we're familiar with from the Marvel comic, but Iron Man himself is not exactly the comic book Iron Man, so it makes sense. But it all works, as I said because the well written character is met with a tour de force of acting by a certain Robert Downey Jr.who's simply superb. It's one of the best performances I've seen from an actor in a long while. And it makes this super hero movie just this extra little bit better than most. It makes it real, even if you're not a fun of the genre, which I have to admit, I am. I think this one will move even some comic skeptics, if they give it a try."

","Iron Man 3 Review Iron Man 1 was a brilliant origin story of one of the most lovable characters in the world. It was fun, entertaining and had different way storytelling. We saw him fight terrorist, making an iron man suit with bunch of scraps in a cave. The second was not as attractive as the first one. It wasn't the director's or the writer's fault. The studio demanded a lot from them in such a little time. But this movie was made intelligently. Even in dark moments it found comedy. The performances were great. Everyone was having fun with their roles. Robert Downey Jr was as usual being himself you know perfect. This was the best use Pepper Potts. Ben Kingsley was awesome but a little underused. Guy Pearce and Rebecca Halls character were a little overused and under develop. Now this movie wasn't made for everyone, specially some fans would be a little disappointed. The action, dialogues, thriller, comedy fitted perfectly. Now this is a very different superhero movie. Just like The Dark Knight Rises, It has more Tony Stark than Iron Man and needs to be enjoyed as an individual movie. Over all Iron Man 3 is a great movie and deserves 7.5/10."

","Overall it is a must watch, highly entertaining (a) Decent amount of surprises in the plot (b) Sensitive side of Tony Stark (c) Intelligent use of Armor.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 tried to play the same humor shown in avengers, at some point it sounded cliché, though it has some fine moments. Starks ego is toned down compared to other prequels, but surprises with glimpses of his sensitive side. Use of weaponry/gadgets is more intelligent, less flashy, plot has some humorous side to it, villain seemed powerful but powers were loosely defined. <br/><br/>Like other iron man movies, plot is so-so, but the movie has frequent good-to-very-good moments, that makes the movie highly entertaining."
"angelbell","7","0","5","5 May 2013"," Brilliantly delivered, BUT..
","WOW, too many emotions, wow— first of all, this is the first time I watch one of the IM movies in the movie theater. I've watched the previous ones in DVD, so the experience wasn't as much enthusiastic and exciting as watching it on the big screen! And in 3D! It was SO fun! The movie looks and sounds so 2013! I mean the high level of visual and sound effects + the 3D animation is so impressive and let's say that this is what the movie is all about! Those effects are the core essence of the movie! Modern technology at its best peak, and the movie industry have never been prouder! Kudos for all the hard work bringing this movie, technically speaking, to life (in terms of Professional editing and all the perfection that came with it). You can clearly tell that in 5 years (since the first movie came out) the franchise has been progressing(concerning the Special Effects crew and all the magic of the Green Screen). It is truly remarkable. And brilliant. So once you put on those 3D glasses you let yourself go! You're inside, and just having the best time of your life!<br/><br/>Now, to some more important stuff, let's talk about the main villain! (or shall I say 'one of the two main villains'). But before that, let's say that Marvel has successively and cleverly presented the waiting viewers with a well-edited trailer! A one in which it truly made you believe in one chain of events, one enemy, and one plot. And then you think that you had it all figured out. Nope, at some point halfway through the movie, you hear yourself screaming (WHAT???!! Are you KIDDING ME??). That wasn't what I expected at all. I'm insinuating, here, the real identity of 'The Mandarin'. What was shown in the trailer as all that raged ' you'll never see me coming' man of terror, supposedly being Tony's main antagonistic opponent, all that is apparently nothing but a play starring the so called actor 'Trevor', hired by Killian (the *coughs* real enemy, this time) in order to hide his satanic, evil plans from the world, camouflaging his identity from being exposed. Such a loss to find out that all of what Sir Ben Kingsley showed in his half-evil character during the first half of the movie, turned out to be a part of his very same character being a simple actor pretending to be evil. Personally, I would've loved to see (if we want to turn away a little bit from the comic-books plot restriction)- I would've loved to continue to see The Mandarin in his evil self during the whole movie, and to be Tony's only enemy, so as to be eventually destroyed by Iron Man (this is a classic, superhero, stereotype interpretation of how the movie would normally end). But maybe the shift in the events was already the point in the very first place, maybe this was the director's aim (and the screenwriter's as well), to make us expect the unexpected. But this wasn't the way it used be to with Jon Favreau's Iron Man 1 & 2. Mr Favreau's directing is so fascinating simply because it goes like 'this is exactly how it's going to be, no surprises, no unexpected shift of events. Just pure entertaining smooth plot'. Now I'm not, in any way saying that Shane Black's directing lacks something, no. It also has a special kind of its own. But, this is what makes the difference. Now you can clearly feel the huge amount of differences when you make the comparison between Mr Black and Mr Favreau's perspectives.<br/><br/>Another (somehow) evident thing; the big amount of sci-fi violence and the rather disturbing (for some) graphic nature of this 3rd part, (concerning all the fights and 'stuff-breaking' moments). The 'Soldiers from Hell' - as I like to call them - were, yes, very, very, disturbing (and watching them hurt Tony, was actually one of the hardest thing I could ever watch) I also thought, the graphic nature in this part of the franchise wasn't really kids-friendly. If a lot of adults found themselves rather uncomfortable watching some of the scenes, how about children and teens, then? (this angle-view is subject to discussion and open to different interpretations, of course.)<br/><br/>Finishing on the lighter side, concerning the movie in general. Iron Man 3 is really funny. And a real fun to watch too. One of the things you'll enjoy, is RDJ's sense of humor in this movie. It is the one aspect that added to the humorous side of the movie.<br/><br/>Another two thumbs up for the music this time as well. Whoever set eyes on Brian Tyler as the main composer of the Score, has definitely chosen wisely. Superhero Music has never been more Epic and it is perfectly fitting the movie's mood. Such music that would send shivers down your spine while you're gazing at the beauty of the image, thus the movie is simply a Treasure of never-ending pleasure!<br/><br/>AND! the Science Bros at the post-credit scene? Brilliant. Just brilliant!<br/><br/>The movie is undoubtedly and completely different from its two predecessors in terms of directing and the technical stuff, and also in terms of the general view. You'll certainly feel that this isn't like before. This is a new touch, a new taste, a new look and a new perspective of the Armored Avenger's life. Only the glorious, gorgeous people carrying the main lovable characters are the same, amazing us all the more. I really loved and enjoyed the movie. (except for some things, of course.)<br/><br/>But I would definitely want to watch it more than just once and can't wait to get the DVD. This one should be kept in everyone's movie collection."
"mdgeist3","7","0","1","5 May 2013"," Was a little disappointed, but over all it was good.
","Lot of you might hate me for writing this review. But I have been a reader of Iron Man comics since I was in kindergarten (almost 30 years). So in a sense there would probably no bigger Iron Man fan-boy than me. I wondered if it bothered anyone else that the president looked like a chubby Mitt Romney? Does this mean that the makers of Iron Man 3 (or Disney) was making a political statement that they think Mitt should have won? Then again this is a make believe fantasy world and the resemblance could have been coincidental. I kind of groaned after the falling out of Air Force One scene. Honestly they would have splattered on impact of the water or the people at the top should have had their arms rip out of their sockets or at least severely dislocated. At the very least they should have had massive internal injuries and internal bleeding from the impact with the water because they did not slow down that much. Then again this is comic book physics which does not really apply to the real world physics. My next biggest complaint Rhodie should have had more Iron Patriot fight scenes. I'm not going to bother explaining that the Iron Patriot in the comics was actually Norman Osborn in the comics during the Civil War story line. I don't think he even fired that big gun on his shoulder. They kind of nerfed Rhodie as a character. They kind of turned him into the token black character that is just there. Would have been nice if they had some back story on how Tony and Rhodie became friends. If I remember right he only had like 5 or 10 lines of dialog. My final complaint they turned the Mandarin who is probably Iron Man's greatest enemy into a goofy more pathetic version of Shredder from the later seasons of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the 90s. That was almost unforgivable, but.... I see what they were trying to do. The whole 10 alien power rings might not have been in the budget. I was really hoping that the ring that the guy from the 10 rings was wearing in the first Iron Man was one of the Mandarin's and he was influencing him through it. I think they were trying to do a gamble and do something different. Something no one was expecting. Honestly they could have casted Russell Brand for the part of the Mandarin and it would have produced the same results only I think that he would have matched that character a little better.<br/><br/>Now this being said they did a lot of things right. I like how they introduced AIM into the Marvel movie world. Does this mean they are going to have MODOK in a future movie? The introduction for the Extremis is excellent. Does this mean in the next movie we will have Iron Man's Extremis armor? I think they did do a better job in this movie showing Tony's more human side when he met the kid that kind of reminded him of himself a bit. However it was a little corny.<br/><br/>Like Dark Knight Rises, I will probably not buy this one on Blu-ray when it comes out. I might just wait until someone gives it to me for my birthday or Christmas. So I am not in a huge rush to watch this one again which is a little sad. This is the first minor disappointment from the Marvel movies after Daredevil and Electra. Electra was actually a huge disappointment. I'm also being very forgiving to The Incredible Hulk which I thought was alright. Perhaps I just need a second watching to appreciate Iron Man 3."

","was watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and suddenly an Iron Man movie broke out. I'm sorry. That was rude. Okay, let me be clear. I love Iron Man. I love Robert Downey Jr.. I love Shane Black. And I've admitted many times that RDJ could spew out Black's dialogue in a film about recycling Coke bottles and I'd watch. It's just that Iron Man 3 does everything it can to test that loyalty. Is it as good as Avengers? Of course not. Is it the best film of the trilogy? Not in my opinion. Is it better than Iron Man 2? I'm not so sure I can say that. To be honest, Iron Man 3 is a different genre than Iron Man 2 and even Iron Man 1. And that is where my hesitance to tout it comes from. When I first heard that Shane Black was doing part 3, I was psyched. The man has made a living of making great action comedies for years. Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, and Long Kiss Goodnight, to name a few. However, the things I loved about those films is that despite the humor and comedic interactions, you could suddenly find yourself in a gritty, bloody, hardcore shootout. Humorous scenes suddenly turned on their ear by a visceral murder. A suicidal breakdown. Revenge at any cost. And Black could weave these things effortlessly. Even though those films had the help of an R rating, I had faith that Black could still come close to delivering a little taste of this in Iron Man 3. Especially with the threat of Tony Stark's biggest comic book nemesis, The Mandarin, looming over the storyline. The tone from the commercials also seemed to hint at the darkest plot we'd seen for the character. However, Iron Man 3 turns away from Martin Riggs, Charly Baltimore, and Joe Hallenbeck and leans more toward Gay Perry and Harry Lockhart. In other words, Iron Man 3 is not an action comedy. It is a comedy with action in it.<br/><br/>Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of my favorite films. However, the tone wouldn't be the first I'd use to fit this superhero film. Take for instance the handling of the film's villain. Director Shane Black does something with The Mandarin, that I won't spoil, which comic book fans will either love or absolutely despise. This...um...how should I put this...'reinvention' fits the tone of a Kiss Kiss Bang Bang but not any Marvel film we've seen thus far. Now, don't get me wrong. The jokes in Iron Man 3 are very funny. But they far outnumber any action you will see in it. I, for one, thought the balance of this action comedy franchise was preparing to shift. I was just misled as to which direction it was shifting. A direction I thought was reserved for Edgar Wright's Ant-Man or James Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy.<br/><br/>The performances by the returning cast are solid once again. They are the one constant of the franchise. As I've said before, Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. He captures the essence of that character better than any actor has any comic book character ever. Though, this is the lightest lifting Downey Jr. has had to do performance wise. They touch on Tony's post traumatic stress disorder brought on from his experiences in The Avengers. Unfortunately, it is not fully explored and eventually brushed away through jokes way faster than Stark's self destructive tendencies were in Iron Man 2. This film is probably the funniest Tony Stark has ever been. However, the best performance Robert Downey Jr. has given as the character is still, ironically, in Avengers. Even though Paltrow is disliked in her public persona, she is adored as Pepper Potts. Keeping serve opposite an actor such as Downey Jr., in four films now, is something she deserves enormous credit for. Cheadle, though almost an afterthought in this film, also has proved that he can hold his own against Downey Jr. in a scene. More so than Terrence Howard did in Iron Man 1. I just wish these two could get more screen time together. Because when they do interact, the relationship of Tony and Rhodey just sings.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Kingsley as The Mandarin. Sexy Beast proved to me how much of a badass he can be. However, Black's risky reinvention of his character limited what Kingsley was allowed to do. Speaking of missed opportunities, Guy Pearce's abilities were also minimally tapped in this. His flippancy, though amusing, didn't really seem to present a viable danger to our hero. Even through the climax. Love or hate Iron Man 2, there was no question as to the danger and threat that Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko gave Tony. The villains in Iron Man 3 don't scare you as much as Vanko, Stane, or even Hammer did.<br/><br/>After all that, you'd think I hated the film. I don't. Iron Man 3 is not a step backwards for the franchise or for Marvel. It, to me, is just a risky step sideways. A step in a different direction. A direction, as the Mandarin warned, I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>For more reviews check out simplisticreviews.blogspot.com"
"tcsimmon","7","0","1","5 May 2013"," Disappointing, but still entertaining.
","A quick way to sum up this movie is this: a disappointing final act of a groundbreaking trilogy that is still entertaining enough to warrant multiple viewings. Shane Black's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a fun and exciting ride that never really builds up to the promises it makes. However, it does do a good job in using the rest of the MCU, especially The Avengers, in creating the emotional storyline that Tony Stark follows throughout the film.<br/><br/>The story that writers Drew Pearce and Shane Black go with is interesting one that weaves the Extremis storyline with the angle of Tony's emotional breakdown after the events in The Avengers. Having that essential Tony Stark humor and wit is part of the saving grace of this film. Anyways, the central story ranges from Tony's anxiety to the true concept of terrorism and finally, scientific ethics (started becoming a bit preachy) and it works pretty well. Another problem with it comes from actual Iron Man screen time. Tony spends most of the time out of the suit or controlling it remotely. This is what many critics will relate with The Dark Knight Rises syndrome, with the title hero not being in costume a lot. Although, like TDKR, this was much more of a emotional journey for our hero. But the main thing that holds the storytelling back, and the thing that will annoy anyone who is familiar with the Iron Man lore, is the big reveal about the Mandarin, which I will get to later. Overall, besides that last part, the story is a good one in relation to other comic book movies with what I thought was a great final battle scene.<br/><br/>Shane Black introduces his unique direction style into this movie and for the most part it works (see Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang). Like his other movies, this one is best suited when it's movie at a quick pace, from scene to scene and not drawing out one joke for a punchline 10 minutes later. One setback Black lets happen in the movie is the dehumanizing moments in the final battle that would have made for great scenes if he had just let the stop and let the moment sink in. Instead, right back to fighting they go. Opposite of scenes earlier in the movie, where the action was much more invested in the emotional aspects of the characters.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>The usual band of brothers in these movies are back and as good as ever. Robert Downey, Jr. is once again the epitome of what Tony Stark should be. Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely fantastic as Pepper Potts in a much more involved and riveting role. Don Cheadle as Rhodey is another excellent performance as the right hand man to Tony who Tony actually starts to trust more. Iron Man and Iron Man 2 director Jon Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan and also has more to do and is integral to the story. Newcomers Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall give very good performances as Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen respectively. Both who play their characters' turns and twists quite beautifully and were wonderfully cast. Now comes to my issue with the film, Sir Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. As the movie began I was very excited about Iron Man's greatest villain, but as the movie went along, I began to notice something was...off. Then comes the reveal that the Mandarin that we were introduced to was nothing more than an actor playing a role. Give credit to Kingsley though, who portrays both the terrorist and coked up actor splendidly, but sadly was not what anyone was expecting. Instead, the writers chose to morph the characters of Killian and Mandarin together, much to the dismay of many in the theater I was in, including me. The build up through the marketing was that we were finally going to see Tony Stark square off with his biggest enemy. But, we were robbed of what otherwise would have been a fantastic battle between the two, like the comics the story was taken from. Other than that, the Extremis soldiers were actually a refreshing and different take in the Iron Man movies, having villains actually fight Tony in another without being in another suit of Tony's design.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the movie were average to good in their own ways. The editing and sound were on par with the previous Marvel Studios film in that they were effective in making the film look and sound like the previous films. The cinematography and visual effects were outstanding in this one though. The practical effects blended in with the CGI beautifully, especially in the suiting up and Air Force One rescue scenes. Visually, this was a beautiful work of art with great effects and fantastic locations.<br/><br/>This definitely isn't best product to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a definite improvement over the second installment. But I give credit to Marvel and Shane Black to trying to go a different direction than its predecessors, and put out an effective follow-up to The Avengers. In the end, Iron Man 3 is an exciting and fun ride that doesn't quite live up to the hype of an worthy trilogy finale, but still shines through an interesting story and fantastic performances. One thing is for sure after this movie, Robert Downey, Jr. is and always will be, Iron Man.<br/><br/>Story: 7/10 Direction: 8/10 Performances: 9/10 Characters: 6/10 Editing: 7/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Sound: 8/10 FX: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Effectiveness: 8/10<br/><br/>Total Score: 77/100 or 7.7/10"
"atmictaco","6","0","2","5 May 2013"," A sequel that was not predictable but for my teenager guest mixed results
","Went to see Iron Man 3 last night with my 16 year old son and nephew. Between the 3 of us, I liked the movie, my son was looking for more action and did not like the flow of the movie. My nephew said the movie was good but did not rave about it. Also, we did not walk out of the movie with any remember able one liners from the movie. What I liked the most about this movie is that for a sequel they did not just return to the same plot lines from the previous two movies. Made the movie less predictable and kept me engaged in the movie. <br/><br/>Different moral messages were sprinkled throughout the movie. One being how Tony Stark treated people in the past turned out to be the ones that wanted to destroy him. Political messages were sprinkled throughout the movie which I can do without but were necessary for the character of the Mandarin. This movie reminded me of the 2nd Pirates of the Caribbean where a whole bunch of new characters were introduced and the film spent a lot of time developing these characters vs. action packed scenes. Much of the trailer scenes we saw were about all the action scenes of the film. <br/><br/>We saw the Real 3D version which did not add a whole lot to the movie. <br/><br/>The end of the film left me with two thoughts. Either this is the end of Iron Man because the actors that play Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are tired of the series or this is a twist that will be used in the plot for Avengers 2."

","So now it comes to this. Iron Man started off beating the snot out of terrorists and confronting the Iron Monger, all while trying to right the various wrongs of his life. Then he was challenged by Whiplash, and made to face a number of personal challenges. Lastly, he helped save Earth from an otherworldly invasion, and he personally passed through a wormhole to deliver a nuke to the Chitauri mothership. Where does Tony Stark stand after all this?<br/><br/>The third Iron Man film pits Tony Stark against more challenges, which elevates the stakes to a more personal level. He has his home taken away, before his friends and loved ones are thrown into peril, and he's forced to find answers on his own. It all culminates in a final gambit that involves an attack on the entire nation, and the emergence of a powerful new race of people. The endgame is a chaotic sequence in which multiple Iron Man suits wreak havoc on a freighter loaded with Extremis terrorists, and it is quite the explosive setpiece.<br/><br/>There is definitely a ton of action and quality special effects to behold here, but unfortunately, the pacing tends to sag between the action scenes. Aside from some sporadic action and comedy, very little of the film stands out, especially when compared to the last two films. In fact, the film's tone, atmosphere, and style never seems to mesh well with Jon Favreau's work, and as a result, the film is overshadowed. The story that Iron Man 3 tells is full of high stakes, and it is notable how it rounds off Tony Stark's progression through the whole saga, providing some satisfactory closure. However, the film explicitly states that he's a changed man, but it's hard to really see such change; he remains his same old self throughout the whole runtime. He is a character so full of color and personality that he's entertaining to watch, but he ultimately delivers more of the same. The villains he confronts lack such personality, and elicit no sympathy; there is a twist behind the Mandarin's character that has upset countless film fans, and other characters never really stand out.<br/><br/>This film is competently-made with good photography and editing. Acting is as great as ever; Robert Downey Jr. is still apt as the title character, Gweneth Paltrow is still great, and so is Don Cheadle (although his role is rather limited). Ben Kingsley is rather cheesy, albeit on purpose, and I found him amusing that way. Guy Pearce is superb, even if his character is less memorable. The writing is generally good. This production has plenty of fine-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 has its moments, and it feels like it tries to be bigger and more relevant than its predecessors. Unfortunately, it's not as memorable, not as fun, and the substance isn't quite as deep. It will satisfy some and disappoint others, so I'd only recommend it as a rental to fans.<br/><br/>3/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Mixed | Film: Pretty Good)"
"FilmFanatic03","6","0","1","5 May 2013"," I wanted to love it, I really did, but....
","Iron Man 3 has a lot to live up to after the huge success of last years Avengers Assemble, so a lot was expected for this film to take Marvel Phase 2 to a whole new level. Sadly, in my honest opinion and not stating this as a fact, I was not won over by Mr. Stark...To me, Iron Man 3 was going down the right path until it took a complete U turn and plummeted after a huge plot twist. I also felt like Rebecca Hall's character was not satisfyingly fleshed out as her character had a lot of potential to carry parts of the film, sadly this was not the case. Those were two major criticisms of Iron Man 3. <br/><br/>I would like to comment on Tony's dealings with the experience of 'The Battle of New York', I completely understand why they chose to stretch out Starks character development by showing a bit of humanity and emotional depth, however, due to the numerous references to Avengers Assemble, sadly the billion dollar summer blockbuster casted a huge shadow over this kick off to Marvel Phase 2...yet again, I understand what they were trying to achieve with focusing on how Stark is coping after 'The Battle of New York' but for some reason, I just couldn't connect with his character within this film. However, I would like to strongly emphasise that I don't hate this film, it's just that it didn't connect with me and sadly I wasn't swept away by Marvel's recent outing. <br/><br/>The positives of the film are the characters. Partlow's character definitely stepped up from her previous outings, she definitely played a vital part within this film. I loved the scenes with Stark and a young boy he encounters, it's like he sees a younger self within this boy and learns a lot about himself through this encounter. <br/><br/>Great visuals and an amazing ""battle"" scene at the end of the film. Overall, a decent outing that sadly did not allow myself to immerse myself with this adventure of a blockbuster."
"narctx","6","0","1","5 May 2013"," Actually I'm confused here!
","I was so excited when I knew that Iron Man 3 will be shown in theaters and went to see it in the very early show, but at the end of the movie I was confused about what I felt about it. From the trailers, I pictured ""The Mandarin"" as an archenemy and I believed that he could be one of the greatest movie villains of all time, may be even head to head with Nolan's Joker, but I was disappointed by how they ended it; I didn't want to see a useless decoy with only a beer can in the hand. Maybe they wanted to add a twist, but with a character like ""The Mandarin"" and how ""Ben Kingsley"" played it at the beginning of the movie, maybe that wasn't the best twist to think about and just burying a character like ""The Mandarin"" that actually I don't know how Marvel approved this script, as it took Marvel's Mandarin and used it in the worst way possible. Needless to say how they tried to add some ""supposedly funny"" situations like when ""Mark 42"" suit get tripped by some ruins then it's ripped into shreds, which raised a question in my mind about how could a suit like that really protect Tony in combat? I rated it 6/10 for the great sound effects and CGI which was really entertaining and kind of buffered my huge disappointment."
"DTKinetic","6","0","1","5 May 2013"," The Mood and New Direction of Iron Man 3
","First off, I'm going to clarify that I don't identify with the comic books, so I'm not an avid/biased fan apart from what I've seen with the previous Iron Man movies--so my entire review will be based on that, the first two movies and what most other critics here DIDN'T address. <br/><br/>Overall, I did get enjoyment out of this film...but not as much as I should have. <br/><br/>What I DIDN'T enjoy: Thanks to director Jon Favreau, first 2 installments of Iron Man had an optimistic/vibrant mood and soundtrack you can cheer with (ex. AC/DC), complemented with unique and exotic locations, on top of charming and well-placed humor.<br/><br/>Thanks to the new director Shane Black, the mood of this movie almost takes a 180, is dark and heavy a large portion of the movie, which does not transition well into the humor. Which the humor is shallow, overabundant, and placed at the wrong times. Following that, the locations are mostly bland and uninteresting (ex. small-town Tennessee). Even when you see Tony Stark's amazing mansion, it doesn't look as beautifully lit and set as you remember. Even the editing of some scenes (ex. Mandarin's broadcasts) don't fit in smoothly, they just abruptly appear, and the enhanced realism, and politics in this movie feel out of place.<br/><br/>*Mild Spoilers* Nobody even mentioned the horror sub-genre in this movie (thanks to the inclusion of AIM and the unstable Extremis drug). It's bearable and even thrilling, but it's unexpected, way more violent and imitates movies like Ghost Rider or Resident Evil. And some themes of the movie don't even capitalize, from Mandarin's whole character to the fact that it's supposed to be Christmas in this movie but you barely feel it apart from the occasional Christmas Carols.<br/><br/>Sigh...but apart from that here's what I DID enjoy: All the actors deliver, putting great amount of effort into their character's personality as always, and you get to see Rhodes and Pepper more involved and convincing than ever. The lengthy Action Sequences are impressive and memorable, and will have you on the edge of your seat. The movie features a lot of twists which will throw you off, which can be viewed as groundbreaking, new territory for the franchise. One of which includes Tony being reckoned to deal with his enemies by fighting without his suit. Plus, the movie makes some real thoughtful messages upon reaching the conclusion.<br/><br/>Standalone, I moderately would've liked it with no further questions asked. But comparing it to the first two Iron Man movies, it feels like a letdown in a way. If you see it, adjust your expectations as far as the mood and direction go."
"paq5528","6","0","1","5 May 2013"," Less Iron, more Panic
","One of the most anticipated films of the year has done what few expected -- surprised many people. Not because of the amazing fight scenes or the evil dimensions of the bad guys, but because instead of focusing on the suits, this movie focuses on the man. Who saw that coming?! This film focused far more on Tony Stark than Iron Man, but it did not focus on the character extremely well developed over the last 2 movies, and in The Avengers. Somehow, Tony went from a confident swagger to an anxiety-ridden non-performer. Think of first love, the first fumbling, non-rhythmic, earnest but wrongfully directed energy of 1st sex, and that is what pops up here (no pun intended). Tony is his own worst enemy. Unable to coordinate moves, attacks, defenses... He is reduced to the figurative cave where he started where he has, not only himself, but mostly only himself to rely on. This being Tony, you know he can MacGyver a new suit out of a hardware store supply center and leftovers from Ikea, and it's that ingenuity that makes Tony the genius you want to see get physical. And he does! Only without the suit.<br/><br/>Wait, you ask, where did Iron Man go? And why am I watching a Bourne Identity rip-off? A James Bond impersonation filled with Q's brain children? And here is where you see the film peel apart the layers of what makes up Tony, and what makes up Iron Man. Unlike the Congressional testimony of films past where Tony states that you can't have ""IT"", referring to the suit, this film delves into the line, ""I am the suit, the suit is me"". Would Tony be as awesome with or without the suit? So at this point, you have to ask yourself, is this what you came to the movie theater to watch? Or did you want the Iron Suit replete with Tony's narcissism and genius? Luckily, the film never forgets to add humor throughout. Although Stark is at times paralyzed by anxiety, the witty banter portions of his brain do not seem to be affected. There are a serious number of one-liners that zing through the air like diamond-tipped arrows, and while your lungs are pumping out a good guffaw, your brain is shouting Shut Up, I'm going to miss the next line! Pepper Potts -- or is it Pepper Stark now? Pepper Potts-Stark? -- plays an integral role in this movie, for several reasons. But I thought she also lacked the confidence of old. Instead of the playful repartee of old, Tony and she are shackled by their love of one another. OK, so love is not a bad thing, the fact that they want to coo and apologize to one another is not a bad thing, but the sexually tense edge between them is gone.<br/><br/>Now back to the action. The 1st three-quarters of the movie having been the anxiety-driven and comedy-filled demoralization and deconstruction of Tony's world, it's time to build it back up. Yes, it tuns out Tony is James Bond's alter ego, yes it turns out that he has a back-up plan and more than a few suits in waiting to confront the evil that caused the destruction of his world. And both Tony and Rhoadie come back with a vengeance. The sequence is exciting, eventful, and reminded me of those comic sequences where you see a row of doors on either side of a hallway and characters run left and right going in and coming out of the doors variously chasing one another or running from one another for various reasons. The suits appear left and right in front of Tony, to be worn, destroyed, discarded... We have come full circle where the suit is just a suit, but Tony Stark is Iron Man! I cannot say that I liked the finale, which I won't describe here. And I never mentioned the ""twist"" because it is too important a plot point to describe. If you've not heard about the plot twist, do yourself a favor and do NOT read any more reviews about the movie until you see it. As in the movie ""Crying Game"", if you know the twist, it renders much of the movie pointless. So dazzling special effects at the end, a great fight sequence... I can't say I found the ending believable, or even gripping -- no where near as much as I liked IM or IM2's finales. Certain plot points were overlooked or sent to hyperbole, others were wrapped up way too fast, but I do recommend the movie. I'll just be watching IM 1&2 more."
"troll100500","8","0","5","5 May 2013"," All in all, good
","Just like everybody else I was excited about this movie, but I think I never expected it to be as good as the first one. The only thing I was praying for was for the creators to give me a better experience than the one I had with Iron Man 2. And it did.<br/><br/>So, the story involves Tony Stark's confrontation with Mandarin. Not to give anything away, there's a twist connected with the main villain, but any average movie-goer will call it about 40 minutes in. There's also a story going on with Tony's growing paranoia about his and his partner's safety. This is actually my biggest problem with the movie: the writers don't go deep enough into Tony's personal story and development. All his issues seem to be resolved off screen or during one of endless array of fight scenes. With that said, I do believe that Tony's obsession with the suit could make for a great story, which could be told so much better, should the writers skip a few action scenes and devote more time to character development. Aside from that, the story doesn't offer many surprises, but is compelling enough to keep you from being bored, with some genuinely funny jokes and a few really good action scenes. <br/><br/>All in all, a good addition to the franchise, definitely better than Iron Man 2. Totally worth seeing just for Robert Downey Jr.'s great (as always) performance and some high-quality action sequences in the frames of a decent story."

","There are a ton of spoilers in this so don't read if you don't like knowing what happens!!!!! I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 only because even though I'm a huge fan of the comics and the characters themselves i looked at it also from a non fan point of view. The bad reviews i can only say were right about a couple things but we'll get to that.<br/><br/>Pros: Loved the visuals and the grittier side of the series.<br/><br/>Thought that the suits were awesome and played a very proper roll in the end.<br/><br/>It showed how Tony Stark comes back after losing everything and made him very vulnerable.<br/><br/>I liked that his suit kept breaking and he had issues with it through out the movie because it showed he had weaknesses and showed really how much his mental state from the avengers crisis messed with his mind in every aspect.<br/><br/>Pepper Potts gets a bit of iconic action and does it very well.<br/><br/>Overall it just was a good movie from a non fan point of view.<br/><br/>Cons: Now the biggest thing i think everyone knows by now was The Mandarin not being well.. the Mandarin..... He was just a knock off actor that had his face and was British or something.It would have worked in my opinion if it wasn't such a huge nemesis of Iron Man and such a huge villain. I have disagree it was a clever idea for them to pull a quick one on every one. It pretty much was a slap in the face to all fans.Its just something you don't do and hard to watch such a great villain go down the drain. The Mandarin would have been a much bigger bash than having a character who pretty much a nobody in the comics and wasn't created until like 8 years ago in the comics..... awful. The Mandarin and the Ten Rings is much more interesting.<br/><br/>The second most confusing part was the ending..... why is he putting up his suits and calling it a day??? He has to big of an ego to quit and it just doesn't seem right especially if he is going to be in the Avengers 2 movie.<br/><br/>Iron Patriot is not even suppose to be Rhodes..... all i have to say about that And the after credit seemed very pointless considering there is not Incredible Hulk 2 movie in the works and you would have thought they would use it to hype of the next movie or another chain of events to the Avengers 2......<br/><br/>I feel like the only way i could ever give this movie a higher score than 7 is if in the Avengers 2 they used the REAL Mandarin and it shows some kind of connecting plot of how he comes about to be a/or one of the villains in Avengers 2 O and by the way tooooo any Lethal Weapon similarities, Black... Think outside the box."
"caseydeans2","7","0","1","4 May 2013"," It's Not the 80s Anymore
","We all enjoy the movies from the 1980s. But the world has changed since then. Many of the reviews talk about 9/11 and how ""Iron Man 3"" is not appropriately addressing the cultural impact or reflecting the unhealed culture or other 9/11 related things. I agree with the fact that this film's story seems dated. <br/><br/>Shane Black isn't an action filmmaker he is a comedy filmmaker. This film has some laughs but can we really go back to laughing at our superheroes? Didn't the Dark Knight trilogy teach us the deeper resonance of these mythic characters? Superheroes are ""supergods"" or mythic gods (see Grant Morrison's book: Supergods) They aren't just wise-crackin', one-liner spoutin', cops with issues (or ""one week 'till retirement) anymore. The 80s are over and so are the excuses for plot hole ridden stories acting as skeletons for set-pieces and FX work.<br/><br/>When was the last time you saw a film that you didn't say: ""At least the FX were good."" Good, spectacular even, FX are the standard now, they can't carry films anymore.<br/><br/>Don't say, ""It's just a comic-book movie"", unless you have actually read a comic book (Sunday funnies don't count, it has to be a graphic novel, or at least a complete story arc from a single issue series). Anyone who has read comics, even bad comics, knows that the kind of plot-holes like those in ""Iron Man 3"" would never survive in comics.<br/><br/>""Iron Man 3"" would have been great 20-30 years ago, but that ship has sailed. Along with having your character chit-chat with their gun-toting buddy while they shoot nameless henchmen. (yeah, that's in ""Iron Man 3"" AND ""Lethal Weapon"" AND a thousand other films that WERE good)."
"sedativchunk","7","0","1","4 May 2013"," Good Marvel film but has a few shortcomings
","Many years ago I was hardly a fan of any of ""The Avenger"" movies. I'm a younger guy in my 20's but I always thought of them as kids movies until my friends took me to see ""The Avengers"". I was instantly hooked and watched all the previous Avenger films afterwards. With that being said, I was extremely stoked for the new Iron Man 3 movie and went to see it in the theaters on the day of the release. Without further ado, here is my review. Tony Stark is back as Iron Man. IM3 takes place shortly after the events of ""The Avengers"". The story mostly revolves around Tony Stark's mental well-being. After the events of the Avengers, Stark is dealing with severe anxiety and mental breakdowns that interfere with his work and role as Iron Man. Any mention of the events in New York City and Tony completely loses his cool. Meanwhile, a new villain arises known as ""The Mandarin"" who, in a nutshell, is out to overthrow the worlds governments and seek out world domination.<br/><br/>First of all, this has all the ingredients of a great Marvel film. State of the art CGI with lots of fun action and adventure in between. The acting by everyone was excellent as usual with some new, welcoming, cast members including Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. As usual there was also the classic Stan Lee cameo as well as a cameo by Linden Ashy as a military commander (Mortal Kombat/Resident Evil fans, anyone?). Lastly as with any Iron Man film, this has plenty of raunchy, comical moments with Tony Stark and his typical adult humor. Overall the typical ingredients of this film were great. But for all the good this film has, there were just a number of shortcomings that prevented this film from being a classic. Now for the downside. In IM3, the storyline is just bad. It's filled with too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and overall the movie just didn't work that well. For most of the film, Tony is coping with his mental issues. Too much of the movie seems to go on with ""Tony Stark"" personal problems and not ""Iron Man"" goodness. He spent about 90% of the movie out of his suit. Also the story all happens around Christmas time which is fine except it just felt a bit... strange, almost like this was made to be a holiday themed Marvel movie. The villain, as menacing as he was, just doesn't quiet hold up to all the other villains of the Avenger universe. And even though the CGI was good, there was ""budget"" areas of it as well. There is a scene where a water tower gets destroyed and you could tell it was a mini model of a town getting dumped on with water. There also seemed to be a lot less CGI scenes in this one like they were trying to save money on it.<br/><br/>Beyond the rather ""clunky"" story telling, one of the biggest let downs of this film was the ending parts of the film. I'm not going to spoil the ending here but I personally didn't like it. As with any Marvel movie, after the ending credits role there is a brief scene of (usually) what is to come in the next Avengers film. Without spoiling it the scene after the credits I can safely say isn't very revealing and not worth staying through the credits for. Overall a good Marvel/Avenger film but just doesn't quiet hold up the predecessor films. The original Iron Man to me is still the best. The original film is one of those films that I would tell anyone to watch whether they liked the Marvel films or not. IM3 is not one of those films. If you don't know Tony Stark's backstory and your not that interested in the films, you might actually want to pass on this one. <br/><br/>Good Marvel movie, not for everyone. And I'm sad to say it but it feels like they are running out of ideas of Iron Man. This felt more like a film milking the ""Iron Man"" franchise for big box office money rather than something that was a real story teller. And it shocks me that any parts of it felt budget-y considering how big of money makers these movies are. Overall 7/10 average film, just not quiet what the other movies were. I would still recommend it though, if you remotely like the Avenger films it's still a great, fun movie to watch. Just not quiet where the originals were."
"damonous","8","0","4","4 May 2013"," Uneven, Surprising, sometimes disappointing, but ultimately quite intriguing
","For 3 films now, Marvel has taken a character which most people were not privy to and turned him into an A-list action vehicle. And they've done this with Iron Man by incorporating the best of the Classic IM comics (Gold/Silver age) and the modern 2000's IM comics. And in so doing, they've been challenging and surprising us consistently along the way. What Iron Man fan would've ever expected the speech that Tony Stark gives at the end of Iron Man 1 to go the way it did...in the FIRST film? Who would've thought that they'd actually find a way to realistically depict the 'suitcase suit' as they did in IM2? Or incorporate SHIELD so seamlessly (including its otherwise preposterous carrier, as in Avengers)? So, you have to really go into these Iron Man movies with an open mind, because you never know what to expect...and maybe never more so than Iron Man 3. Make no mistake: there is at least 1 character that is so drastically changed from its comic origins that it will likely upset a lot of fans. And it took me out of the movie for a few minutes while I tried to reconcile it with my own preconceived expectations. Ultimately, I'm OK with it, for the reason that I hope people think of the real world for a moment, and the parallel veiled political statement it makes.<br/><br/>And this movie is filled with a lot of wry statements like that. It is even more of a 'thinking man's Iron Man' than the first movie. If you're a Golden Age IM comic reader, you really need to challenge yourself about what Iron Man always was: one of the deepest, 'thinking man's' comic books. Fantastic Four was crazy fun, Spider-Man was wisecracking action, Avengers all-out battle. So, on this note, I think Iron Man 3, for all it's ups and downs, actually delivers brilliantly.<br/><br/>This is not a wall-to-wall action fest, but rather a character-driven dramatic ride that gives Downey, Paltrow, & Cheadle plenty of screen time to explore their characters. It's nice to see Rhodey get some real heroic moments this time, and Cheadle has now clearly taken ownership of the role, making us completely forget that 'other actor' who played the part the first time.<br/><br/>There are laughs, there is suspense, drama, and yes some slow parts. But, Iron Man 3 certainly bakes its cake and knows how to pull it out of the oven at the right time for a rousing finale spectacle. And, this time, the inventive villains (which 2000's-era comic fans will know & enjoy) are a refreshing change-of-pace from the ""metal vs metal"" of the previous two films."

","The Mandarin seemed exciting to me when I first saw the trailer. However, I was disappointed to learn that Ben Kingsley's character was nothing more but a drunk British actor acting as a decoy to the real bad guy, the Guy Pearce character. Guy's character didn't even have a lot of depth, he's just as pathetic as the way Hayden Christensen performed Darth Vader in the Star Wars prequels. Seriously, man?! I mean isn't the Mandarin's twist sort of a ripoff of Batman Begins with the way Ras Al Ghoul is depicted? Both the Mandarin and Ras Al Ghoul are terrorist leaders, that's obvious, and both use decoys to punk the hero. When the live Justice League movie comes out, I guess folks are gonna argue which one ripped off the other, the Justice League or the Avengers?"

","I know this is a fictitious movie, but I mostly had a problem with the realism in Iron Man 3. I really didn't like how his pieces of armor could fly onto Tony Stark, or that he could just jump into a suit in two seconds. I suspended my disbelief with the Iron Man movies when Tony Stark comes to a sudden stop while in his armor without getting a concussion or something, but that's as much as I can handle. These movies were pretty good at staying believable and realistic for the most part, but it's not getting better.<br/><br/>Also, Jon Favreau hamming it up at the end was painful. Besides that, RDJ did a great job as Tony Stark as always and I enjoyed a good portion of this movie. I hate to only talk about the things I didn't like, but I don't want to give anything away. It was fairly solid like the rest of the Iron Man movies have been, it just got a little cheesy is all."

","So after seeing all the trailers and all the hype for this movie I was very excited to watch this movie. Hearing the Mandarin was going to be the villain made it that much more intriguing for me.<br/><br/>I finally went to see Iron Man 3 and let me start off by saying that I'm not that impressed. Don't get me wrong. Robert Downey's portrayal of Tony Stark has become iconic. He clearly owns this character. The direction that was taken as far as Tony having PTSD is also not a bad idea. Although I thought the comedy was a little too heavy, there is definitely a good balance with the action.<br/><br/>The story line is where I have the problem. As I said, I think the Mandarin is Iron Man's best villains but in this film he is ruined. There is no mention of the rings of power. The Mandarin turns out to just be a decoy for another villain.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a good movie to watch but I can't recommend this movie to anyone who is a true die hard comic fan. To the average person who is not familiar with the comics then it will be a great movie to watch."

","MY first review!<br/><br/>After watching the first two films i was really excited about Iron man 3. I just watched it, and i really don't know what to say.<br/><br/>Let me first get the good new out of the way; Robert Downey Jr. is still a perfect actor for Tony Stark. In fact, i think all the actors and actresses did their part really well. There were many funny parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Now time to go over bad news; I've heard so much about Mandarin and his powers from the ten rings, I expected something flashy. Instead, what the movie got me was.....SPOILER ALERT! the old dude wasn't Mandarin. All the threading poses were just a show. The real Mandarin did not even use the ten rings. I guess not being original with the actual supervillan is common now days(Dark Kinght Rises). After that point the movie was just your typical superhero movie. Tony tries to save Pepper from falling, she does, but she comes back. As for the War Machine, I honestly thought there would be more of him. There weren't nearly as much fighting scenes as the second film did.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it is a nice addition to the Marvel movies, but does not leave as much impact as first two Iron Man movies did"
"baqken","6","0","5","3 May 2013"," I thought it was alright
","I guess I should start off with the things I didn't like then wrap it up with the things I did.<br/><br/>I can't say that I liked the first 30 minutes/hour of the movie. It took a while to build some momentum and get off the ground not to mention that it was extremely 'kiddie' at some parts; some of the lines in particular felt extremely corny to the point of being cringe worthy. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon because of some of Stark's humor and I can't say that I liked the whole 'nerdy guy gets back and becomes a villain' clichÃ©, especially out of something as small as getting stood up by Stark on the roof. However despite this you'll have to accept that these movies are specifically geared toward a younger demographic and not the aging comic book fanbase. Another downside I felt was that it was a little too much like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang at parts specifically with the narration and the whole Christmas theme was a little forced.<br/><br/>I was also pretty disappointed that there was NO AC/DC or Black Sabbath in the movie and got replaced by a generic superhero orchestra. I actually liked the Mandarin because it wasn't going to try to take a sensationalized anti-Eastern creation from a silver age of comics and try to apply it in a contemporary context. It was also a good way to have some sort of commentary as far as figureheads go, be it in the form of myths and/or symbols to perpetuate the initiatives of the state. I thought this was probably the most 'elevated' form of a villain I've seen in a comic book movie to date if anything.<br/><br/>And even though the beginning of the film severely lacked it more than made up for it toward the last part with the action sequences. My jaw was literally dropped wide open at the scale and sheer artistry of the choreography. It made me glad that Shane Black took this movie up. This was the kind of action that made the movies of the 80s and 90s action films so memorable kids.<br/><br/>If this was a concluding movie I think it capped off the story perfectly and I likened it over TDKR and its hamfisted Christ allegory."

","WOW! IM3 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. Thank you Shane Black! It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn.<br/><br/>Most jaded critics dislike big Hollywood stuff that's hyped so much and will look for any reason to hate on a big film. Any negative Iron Man 3 reviews stem mostly from that fact and Avenger blow-back. No worries, it's a great film. Those jaded critics should stick to their little films about art-house global warming crusaders or Iranian kids and leave the truly great films to real movie fans."
"douche-wellington","7","0","1","3 May 2013"," Watchable if you don't read the comics, laughable if you do. **SPOILERS**
","I was actually happy with the film during the beginning half of it. It did a good job of tying into The Avengers and blending the Extremis arc with The Mandarin. There were some details I didn't enjoy, like how they turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (who is Norman Osbourne in the comics), or Aldrich Killian being alive (who is dead and has a smaller role in the comics). However, these were details I felt were minor enough to forgive because the story was initially progressing in a good direction. However, once they revealed The Mandarin's secret, everything took a turn for the worse. <br/><br/>How do you manage to take the main super-villain to Iron Man, fill his role with one of the most revered actors in Hollywood, and still manage to completely ruin the character that bad? This version of The Mandarin is just laughable, and it's really frustrating because Shane Black completely missed an opportunity to have one of the most bad-ass movie super-villains ever. And it seemed like everything began to just spiral out of control from that point. Aldrich Killian turns out to actually be The Mandarin, Pepper gets injected with the extremis virus and kills Aldrich, and just a bunch of other nonsense plot devices. They just strayed so far off from the comics that it became too hard to forgive all those minor details.<br/><br/>I will say this for the movie though: If you ignore the comic-book mythos, then Iron Man 3 is actually a good movie. All the actors played their parts really well, the CGI looked great, and the action was solid. However, as a fan of the comics, this movie left a very sour taste in my mouth. If this is what MCU has in store for us, then I'm not excited at all."
"swiftblaqness","6","0","1","2 May 2013"," Not The Sequel I Wanted
","*** WARNING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I feel there were 3 main problems with this film that left me feeling quite aggravated, I would have to say my biggest gripe was with the lack of *iron man*. It seemed like the movie was 95% Tony Stark and 5% Iron man. Not to mention what you did see of Iron man was pretty underwhelming, showing him controlling the suit while hes not actually in it or him being in it for seconds before being defeated or immobilized by some nameless enemy. I mean in Avengers Iron mans suits are seem withstand constant fire and attacks from the chitauri but in this his suits that are seemingly newer and more technically advanced fall apart from a hit or 2.<br/><br/>Second would have to be the butchering of a fan favorite villain. The Mandarin is in this film is a joke, Aldrich Killian makes up the character to give his failed experiments and terrorist attacks a patsy. Now i'm in no way the biggest iron man comic fanboy nor have I ever read them but from what i've heard the Mandarin is not a villain to be taken lightly and has the strength to rival the avengers himself. So why he was made out to be a clown or an alias is beyond me.<br/><br/>Third would have to be the overuse of comedy in the film. They gave up many serious scenes just to get a quick laugh. The problem is it got old fast most of the jokes or puns were your typical one liners but some actually impacted the story. Like when Jarvius autopilots Tony to Tennessee with no way of getting home and its just laughed off as it was nothing. Many of the scenes didn't progress as quickly as they should have because of this as well and made me wonder what the targeted age for the film was. <br/><br/>All in all the movie was Good it had great acting, music and it looked brilliant. It wasn't exactly what I wanted nor do I think it is a good way to start off the 2nd phase of the Avengers but still was an OK watch and definitely could have been worse."

","This may turn out to be one of the summer's better blockbusters: a stylish superhero thriller in which the special effects don't quite swamp the story and the acting. With the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Rebecca Hall in the 'Bond girl' roles, we are clearly in a different ballpark from SPARTACUS on TV (not that I don't get a kick out of SPARTACUS!)<br/><br/>The film starts a bit slowly and, as seems to be the case in all superhero stories nowadays, Iron Man is going through a 'long dark night of the soul'. Once we get past this guff and the mayhem begins, this third episode delivers the goods that teenage viewers have paid to see (in 3D).

However, the first 2 films weren't all that great in my eyes anyway. Director Shane Black takes the franchise in a slightly different direction. Focusing on the Tony Stark character instead of all the gadgetry (there is still a fair amount here, not to worry). It's slightly darker than the previous 2 films and actually has a proper plot this time round.<br/><br/>Robert Downey JR does his part again, it's almost as if he was made for this role. The character that I loved most was the Mandarin though. Ben Kingsley steals every scene that he appears in as the terrorist threat to Iron Man. The others sort of trundle along, letting the special effects do the talking.<br/><br/>There were too many unexplainable events in the film to rate it seriously, and it's expected being a popcorn Hollywood flick but it's fun, it's one of the blockbusters out now.

","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 3 is a best comic adaptation worthy to follow the greatness known as The Avengers. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. The sequel advanced the character of Tony Stark while setting up Avengers quite nicely. Iron Man 3 goes beyond even that and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity, drama and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 3 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle's Rhodey was certainly an upgrade over his role in the second film. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner featuring the great dialogue that we all now expect from Marvel films. It's witty and uses the perfect use of humor yet again although this is by far the darkest film in the trilogy. The plot features advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style scenes and slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best number three movie ever made. Yes, better than Return of the King. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike."
"mistertoyou99","7","0","3","30 April 2013"," Tony Stark is pushed to the limits and is asked questions about who he is
","WARNING! – !!!THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS !!!<br/><br/>NOTE - This film was viewed in 3D. The review will be based solely on the movie itself. How well or not the 3D effects were, will play no part in judging this film. <br/><br/>Phase two of the Marvel film franchise now begins just as phase one did, with Iron Man.<br/><br/>In this instalment Tony Stark is pushed to the limits and is asked questions about who is Tony Stark and how strong is he without Iron Man. Iron Man 3 is set following the aftermath of The Avengers and shows how Stark is coping with what happened in New York.<br/><br/>IRON MAN 3 AKA TONY STARK RISES<br/><br/>The film suffers from the Nolan 'Dark Knight' syndrome that a lot of directors are following of late. Iron Man 3 should really be called Tony Stark Rises, as with 'The Dark Knight Rises' the screen time is mainly devoted to Stark than Iron Man. While also like 'The Dark Kinght Rises' the story does ask questions of Tony Stark the man while Iron Man takes a back seat. The problem with this is the action from Tony Stark can never match that of when he's Iron Man and for that it suffers a little. The overall feel of the film has also changed from the previous titles. This is down to a change in the director this time round, with Jon Favreau sitting this one out to concentrate on playing his character. Shane Black does a decent job and brings much more humour and bigger action to the series.<br/><br/>DOWNEY JR. UPSTAGED<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is once again outstanding as Tony Stark. This should come as no surprise as he showed this by the end of the first Iron Man. He has made this character his own and as through each instalment has just cemented the fact more so. However what will surprise you is that Downey Jr. is upstaged by another this time round. I am talking of Sir Ben Kingsley who plays the villain The Mandarin. Downey's performance is solid with more humour than ever but Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin takes the award. The praise is not for the character of The Mandarin but his other character. Trevor Slattery. Kingsley's performance as Trevor Slattery will not only surprise you but steals the lime light from Downey Jr. For which never returns back.<br/><br/>OPERATION CLEAN SLATE<br/><br/>As the end of the film progresses you get the feeling of closure and ends on an anti-climax that leaves you asking what now? With the next Iron Man film with or without Downey Jr. a new chapter will begin. The events of The Avengers and Iron Man 3 has changed Stark and things will never be the same again. Stark has matured and his goals have changed, this is all evident as the film plays and becomes fact in the closing scenes when Stark commands to J.A.R.V.I.S to start operation 'Clean Slate'. <br/><br/>DOWNEY JR. OUTGROWS IRON MAN SUIT<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is almost going back to the roots of the first film. Stark must search inside himself and grow in order to fulfil what is required of him. The story is good and the action scenes bigger and better to be more on par with The Avengers. Starks' dialogue is witty and fun only to be out done by Ben Kingsley. In the way the movie wraps up you can't help but think that the next Iron Man films will maybe a reboot to the series. This would mean that Downey Jr. may only play Tony Stark one more time in the upcoming Avenger's Sequel. If that is the case then it will be a shame as Downey Jr. really has set a high benchmark for this character and it won't be easy to replace him. But in the way Iron Man 3 finishes it seems like Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark story has come to an end. At 130 minutes it's the longest film in the series but doesn't feel too long. It's an enjoyable experience only tripped up by little things plot wise and the main disappointment of how little screen time for Iron Man. But with that being said it's still the best film in the series. Be sure to watch after the credits to see a post credit scene as with all the Marvel films. <br/><br/>3D<br/><br/>The 3D effects in this film do it justice in the way that it's not overused and works okay when it needs to. Like some other action films of late where you can see the extra effort put in to show off the 3D effects or a scene shot just for 3D. This is apparent here too with one of the big action scenes where Stark's Malibu home is attacked. But for me the best use of 3D is the scene set at night with the aftermath of an explosion. The falling debris, ash, flames and dust all look great in 3D. Overall the 3D doesn't really add or take anything away."

","This movie has amazing visuals, cool armours, fantastic 3D and a good enough plot. You see Robert Downey Jr in a familiar role being the wise ass Tony Stark. After the events of Avengers, Tony has developed a sort of paranoia along with insomnia. This leads him to go over board with ""Hobby"". Add to this a new treat that is possibly the biggest that he has faced alone. The armour is in the next stage of evolution and its quite cool seeing it come together. Its not only Tony but all the major characters here that get considerably meatier story arch. Although the tone of the movie is same as those movies that preceded it - light. There is a twist midway through that very few will see it coming. I would think it was a Joss Whedon touch. The end fight is huge and spectacular in scale and effects. In the end of it all, tony has grown, matured up and realizes the important things in life. Though this character movement is not shown in a very sensible way and not very convincing. All of a sudden, he is more mature and he has moved on. Oh and there is an Easter Egg scene here at the end of credits though you really won't miss much if you don't wait for it. Final verdict: Better than iron man 2 but not as good as the first part."

","Iron Man 3 is the over-hyped side-sequel to The Avengers, a movie a lot of people really like, and the spiritual successor to Iron Man 2, a movie a lot of people DIDN'T like. I don't think I'm the only who saw Iron Man as the one who stole the show in The Avengers. Sure Hulk had his moments, but Iron Man really just took everyone by surprise. And that's really the main reason I was looking so much forward to Iron Man 3. I like the two first movies, but I think they're a little bit overrated (at least the first one).<br/><br/>In this movie, the United States is threatened by a viral terrorist called the Mandarin. So Iron Man and War Machine (who has now been renamed Iron Patriot) go on a quest to find out who this Mandarin guy really is. That's all I'm gonna say.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the story in this movie a lot more than I did with the other films. The Mandarin, who at first just seems like a clone of Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, actually develops into a very different kind of villain. It's actually pretty original. I also found myself more engrossed in Tony Stark's character.<br/><br/>I wish the story would focus more on the teamwork between Iron Man and Iron Patriot. If there's one thing that make superhero movies great but aren't fully realized in movies, it's teamwork. Movies like Spider-Man 3 and The Avengers utilize teamwork greatly, but those are just two movies. Iron Man and Iron Patriot are mostly separated throughout the movie, communicating wirelessly.<br/><br/>The action scenes are terrific. Especially the last one, which is a lot of fun to watch and very well thought out.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie is disappointing, though, is because as a follow-up to The Avengers, it fails miserably. Of course, it's not really meant to be, but we all know it's part of the Avengers saga, and that makes it kind of underwhelming in comparison. I don't think any movie will able to top The Avengers until the true sequel comes out in 2015.<br/><br/>Overall Iron Man 3 is a bit disappointing, but in the end I didn't really expect it to be as good as The Avengers. It's not the best Iron Man movie, but it is the best superhero movie released since The Amazing Spider-Man (which is not really saying much when you think about it)."

","Spoiler! somewhat... <br/><br/>What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said, it was an enthralling movie viewing experience from the very beginning of the movie. Only thing that didn't make too much sense plot wise was why didn't he call his avenger friends such as Captain America for help? Nick Fury? I can see that Iron Man contacting Thor, Hulk, could prove to be unwieldy since Thor lives in space, whilst Hulk is furtively sojourning in third world countries. I say this because this movie felt like a sequel to Avengers 2 rather than Iron Man 2. In Iron man 3, Iron man suffers from insomnia as well as anxiety attacks due to his endeavoring of saving Earth with his Avenger buddies in New York,it traumatized him, and this mental disposition is an integral part of his character make up in this movie, if not for this I would not have been compelled to make the connections, but since his mentally precarious state was conspicuously apparent from the very beginning of the movie I thought Avenger superhero would invariably make a cameo appearance and leave an indelible impression on viewers by assisting Iron Man, this just seemed very unrealistic, at any rate, it is certainly the most entertaining movie I have seen thus far this year."
"FNDNreview","6","0","4","28 April 2013"," Downey Jr. does his best without The Avengers
","Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III. The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers? The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time. It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time. So, how do you follow that kind of success? The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success – at least for any other comic book film, that is. We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it? The answer to that question is: momentum. Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine. Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film – well, we have that answer for you.<br/><br/>Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks. Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States. One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire – which quickly gains Stark's attention. At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an ""explosive"" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis. Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr. Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress. The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions. Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley – who is nothing short of treat in this film. They couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character). Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark – just because he's smarter than everyone else. Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting character addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>Now – here's the good, the bad, and the ugly. First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight. If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption. The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers. If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Pine, or Chris Hemsworth – you'll be very disappointed. Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance. And, the ugly has to start with an apology. Sorry, kids – there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy (unless Shane Black decides to add another scene after the fact, like Joss Whedon in The Avengers). This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be. Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of the Empire Strikes Back. He gets an ass kicking in this film that just keeps on giving. However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films. For the average movie-goer, Iron Man is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy. Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning – in the grand scheme of things – Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers. Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) – yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013."

","Iron Man 3 is a totally unexpected, intriguing, beguiling and ironic film.<br/><br/>It is a very good flick. However, it is not a very good Iron Man movie. <br/><br/>It succeeds as a movie. It has heart, very interesting heroes, great love interest, sadistic and compelling bad guys, great action sequences, and interesting misdirection.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as an Iron Man movie, it fails. Iron Man, as the name denotes, is a man inside an iron suite. Unfortunately in this movie, the man is mostly out of the suit and he is simply remote controlling them, in which case, they should have renamed this movie as Remote Man. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, remote controlled suit is an interesting innovation but they are used far too much of it, that it became boring. I could and might accept that a remote suit greeted Piper in the first part of the movie, but I don't get why the airplane save was not done by Iron Man himself. <br/><br/>As for the suits, they are not that great or interesting. I totally hated the fact that they disintegrate very easily, unlike the suits in the other movies. Which led me to believe that the actual Mandarin is not the Mandarin or Aldrich Killian but the suits themselves, as in they are cheap Chinese knock-offs. <br/><br/>Shane Black is a great director, I am a fan, and still am, but I really do believe that he should have stayed clear from this movie. It is apparent that he is not an Iron Man fan. One reason The Avengers was greatly appreciated by countless of fans is because Joss Whedon is not only a great director/writer, he also appreciated the source material itself, which apparently Shane Black didn't.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 7/10."
"maneckk-414-209658","8","0","4","27 April 2013"," Iron Man 3  The Man in the Can confronts his demons & more importantly his emotions
","Iron Man 3 as the name suggests thought is the third Iron Man movie, we've already seen him in 3 movies before including Avengers. The movie starts with Tony Stark in the flashback remembering how he created some personal demons due to his egoistic and brash personality, without realizing it at that particular moment. Of course the build-up is quite obvious, leading us to the present day where Iron Man is back from his encounter with the Aliens in New York (the movie The Avengers) and as usual spending most of his time in his laboratory at his Malibu mansion playing with his toys, the Iron man suits. Enter the Mandarin leader of an international terrorist organization called Ten Rings, hell-bent on teaching the United States of America a lesson, nothing original about that, controlled by a suave scientist Aldrich Killian, who can manipulate the brain cells and use it as a deadly weapon literally turning a person into a bomb.<br/><br/>But behind this plot this movie is different from all the earlier ones. It is about Tony Stark's emotional ride experiencing friendship, love, anger, fear and most importantly anxiety. There is in fact a scene in the movie when a kid asks him a question and he feels weak. Jarvis (the voice behind the suit) tells him that he is perfectly fine besides just feeling anxiety and his reaction is of complete disbelief. Seeing his world being destroyed in front of his eyes, the cool Tony Stark succumbs to the emotion of vendetta and sets out to seek the Mandarin. Robert Downey Jr. was meant to be Tony Stark, period. The skill with which has interwoven the complexities and eccentricities of Stark along with the responsibility of Iron Man is a treat to watch. As a man he has no superhuman powers or strength, just his intelligence and money and this side of him has been exploited to the hilt in this outing of his. In the previous 2 movies he was building Iron Man, but this one is more about the development of both Stark and his Iron Man Suit. As he rightly remarks, at the end of it ""I am just a Man in the Can"". Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts has transformed into a strong personality and like all husbands/ boyfriends, even the Iron Man listens to her and pays attention. The chemistry between them forms the underlying basis of the movie and for me the whole plot is interwoven around relationship of Tony Stark and Pepper Potts.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Tony's bodyguard and now security manager of Stark Industries is awkwardly brilliant and funny, albeit in a small role. Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, the brilliant scientist using his intelligence for devious means, is menacing as well as good looking. The woman would love the shirtless scenes of the man and his suave style. With her assistant Maya Hansen played by Rebecca Hall the form a formidable team of villains. Ben Kingsley (our very own Mahatma Gandhi) is a great actor and shows it in his performance as the Mandarin, especially when his secret is revealed. Don Cheadle as Col. James Rhodes and the Iron Patriot (a blue and red Iron Man which was seriously cheesy) lends complete support in the fight against the band of villains.<br/><br/>The surprise package in this one though is the young actor Ty Simpkins playing Harley, a young kid in a small town with a knack for technology bordering on the lines of a whiz kid. His chemistry and the scenes with Tony Stark are the best in the movie (more like a badly behaved dad and a mature son) and we see a promising actor in the making. Maybe Iron Man might have a protégé in the future.<br/><br/>Shane Black's direction is surreal and the screenplay adds a lot of wit and humour to an action movie. The Airforce One crash scene and when Tony's mansion is attacked are one of the best action sequences I have witnessed using technology. You do come out humming the background music out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Iron Man 3 is full of one liner's, puns, emotions and some wild twisted humour besides over the top action. Tony Stark has detached himself from the suit and at the same time emphatically stated that no one can take away the fact that ""He is Iron Man"". This movie is a must watch for all Tony Stark lovers and of course the Iron Man fans."
"terminadoru","7","0","5","27 April 2013"," Better than the previous two, but you're in for a great disappointment
","This was a movie that I really enjoyed. It had action, drama, comedy, mystery and a more serious tone than the previous two.<br/><br/>One of my problems is with the way they kind of hurried the storyline. The first movie showed us how the suit is assembled: lots of technology, experiments, trial and error. The second showed us a more compact version, a newer version, but overall just some improvements in the suits. Avengers showed us the Mark 8 that chases him and connects on him while falling. But here we have technology that should have been from Iron Man 7. The leap is too great in progress, and because of that the dozens of suits that he made between movies seem cheap, hurried.<br/><br/>But that's not why I don't give this movie a 10. The real reason is the 10 year old me that exists in the more mature me, that was very disappointed with the Mandarin. He was my favorite Iron Man villain in the comics and the animation, and in this movie they wiped the floor with him. They made him a fake, an actor playing a role. It's like going to The Dark Knight to see Joker, only to find out Joker is not real, someone else did his actions. Because of this choice, Mandarin (the one we wanted) will never have a place in the Marvel Universe. What suddenly another terrorist with the name Mandarin , that by chance has 10 rings, shows up? Big mistake Marvel, big mistake.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very good, and that's the reason I don't give it 5 stars. The action was solid, special effects were amazing, RDJ fantastic as always and the storyline delivers."
"Kia00","Null","0","3","26 April 2013"," Unique, Interesting and Entertaining to the MAX
","I really love this movie because it's so unique. The ""cool"" factor is still there but there's a twist and depth I didn't see coming. How Tony deals with his form of post-traumatic stress after the events of Avengers is actually dealing with it in a way you've never seen from a superhero. Tony is motivated to do better when he realizes that he's not a god; just a genius in a suit, trying to up his game. He has always thought of himself as top dog and knew he was a narcissist. Now, the notion that he has encountered beings and situations that make him feel small plays big as the movie starts. He has been to space/another dimension, nearly gotten killed by crazed aliens, met a god that can throw lightning bolts and smash him across the forest with a hammer, has encountered a legend that his father used to talk about that lives up to the legend. His confidence is shaken and has diminished. He knows true fear and he feels like, unless he can build the perfect man through armor and technology, he's going to be outdone and overwhelmed. Fury perfectly pointed it out in Avengers when he said, ""We are hilariously, hopelessly outgunned."" This is where the movie gets really interesting. There's a reason why he's building armor and why he's much more comfortable when he's in the suit. Those suits are taken away from him. He's just a man and he can't possibly compete at the level the world and events in this movie now demand. That is the impetus for the entire story. Strip down the character, rip everything off him and leave him ""naked"" against these incredible forces. Without the armor, The Avengers or his resources, the man must find the strength from within himself, especially within his mind. A lot of this exceptional journey is Tony learning to become Tony Stark again outside the armor. It's an amazing and refreshing direction they choose to take. His emotional response is believable and is appropriate. Sure the action is as good as it gets but that character depth and grounded behavior is the heart of this film."
"tezhiro_emje","6","0","5","25 April 2013"," This is how it should be..
","Since my childhood, I was a big fans of IronMan.. And just watching this movie last night..Not too bad.. not too good.. Didn't surprised me a lot.. I think TDKR had better emotional playing on it.. But I guess it's okay, I guess Marvel's franchise didn't take too much emotionally played compare to DC's.. Focusely to Nolan's Lil bit disappointed about ""Mandarin"".. As I know on my childhood, Mandarin was always Iron Man's big nemesis.. but, things got different here.. But I guess, Iron Man 3 is still very very worthy to watch.. I love the storyline better than IronMan 2.. I love Tony's character better here..<br/><br/>For guys who disappointed by IM2, you will be quite satisfied with IM3.. <br/><br/>So I give 7 out of 10... A quite worthy to watch movie this month.."

","In superhero movie franchises there is the famous rule that the second movie is, usually, the best one with the third being the worst. Ever since the flawed Iron Man 2 came out, it was pretty obvious the Iron Man franchise wouldn't follow this rule. After that set back, on the other hand, it was rather unclear what to expect from the third one. Will it be, nevertheless, the worst one? Or will it completely negate the superhero franchises' rule and triumph as the best one? The answer to these questions is: Iron Man 3 is neither the best nor the worst Iron Man movie. However, it is the strangest. You may ask, what do I mean by strange. Well, first of all, unbelievable as it may sound, Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie. Of course, there are some superhero movie elements here and there, but in its core Iron Man 3 is an action/comedy/thriller. To put in the words of director/co-writer Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau in the director's chair) - it's kind of a Tom Clancy style thriller. Because of that, Iron Man 3 is much more similar to another Robert Downey Jr. movie - also directed by Shane Black - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. While I applaud the idea of experimenting with different genres, the ending result was not satisfying. Before I continue, I'll just say I have not seen the movie in 3D so I don't know how it holds in that aspect.<br/><br/>The movie follows Tony Stark, as usual,who apparently got PTSD from the events that took place in the Avengers movie. He has trouble sleeping and has panic attacks from time to time. As if that weren't enough, his luxurious Malibu mansion gets destroyed by a terrorist called the Mandarin. Now he has to deal with the Mandarin and other potential threats in the form of old acquaintances. Thematically, Iron Man 3 is similar to The Dark Knight Rises - destroy the hero, put him on his knees so he can rise once again. That being said, Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark rather than about, you know, Iron Man. The similarities with The Dark Knight Rises don't stop here. Both movies have overly complicated stories. Not complicated in the intellectual way, mind you, but in a way that there are just too many intertwined subplots in the movie. Since this is the case, Iron Man 3 is prone to have some plot holes. I, myself, didn't notice many of them nor did I let them diminish my viewing experience, but I'm sure other people will notice them and they'll get frustrated. Anyway, the question remains - why all the TDKR similarities? And it's not only me, I've already seen people on the internet jokingly call this movie Iron Man Rises. To answer this question, we'll need to go back in 2012 when the Avengers exploded at the box office. Iron Man 3 was the first Marvel movie to be released after the Avengers and the stakes were pretty high. No doubt everyone involved wanted this sequel to continue the Avenger's financial success. When everyone realised they can't possibly re-create that success, they turned their heads to another last year superhero box office juggernaut, and copied it instead. And that's how the Iron Man franchise also jumped on the whole Dark Knight Trilogy bandwagon. I find this to be ironic since DC is trying to copy Marvel's Avengers by creating a Justice League movie. However, all of this is strictly my opinion.<br/><br/>There's another famous rule in cinema, affecting especially superhero movies, which says that the movie is as good as its villain. And so we come to the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, in spite of how hard the trailers wanted to convince you, is not the main antagonist of the movie. Which is a damn shame, since he may be Iron Man's most famous villain. Instead of being the main bad guy, he plays this disappointingly strange role which I can't explain thoroughly without spoiling the movie. So yes, the movie is as good as its villain - Iron Man 3 is disappointingly strange. It puzzles me why he wasn't given the role he deserves. The reason for that can't be the 'realism', since the real main villain's powers aren't convincing as well, which contradicts Shane Black's statement that Iron Man will be fighting real world-type villains. I'll just say that regarding the villain, there's a definitive Dark Knight Trilogy vibe.<br/><br/>Now that I got the two main things in superhero movie, the story and the villain out of the way, I must say I fairly enjoyed everything else - especially the humour. The acting is decent (Ben Kingsley being the best actor), the action is superb and the several Iron Man suits that show up in the movie are also nice. All in all, it seems that Iron Man 3 works best as a dumb popcorn flick. Unfortunately, it has no real re-watch value.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"elmeeksio","7","0","12","25 April 2013"," Not what i was expecting, but still pretty good!
","Let it first be said that I am a huge fan of the Marvel movies, everything from Marvel: phase one leading to the Avengers was by far some of the best blockbusters I've ever watched. So to say my expectations for Iron Man 3 (Marvels first movie of phase2) were high is somewhat an understatement.<br/><br/>This movie starts at what I'm guessing is a few months after the events in New York in 'Avengers Assemble' although they never actually address how much time has passed. Tony Stark (RDJ) is still tinkering away in his basement creating new suits and tech to add to his armour and doing anything to avoid sleeping (Stark still suffers horrible nightmares from the events in Avengers) He is still as loved and famous as before and protecting the world as Iron Man. Although, in the East a terrorist by the name of The Mandarin has taken claim to many bombings around the globe and vowed America will be next and will 'never see me coming'. Curious as to how these bombings were committed and left no trace of a weapon, cue some investigative work from Stark and a welcome introduction to the new Iron Patriot (War Machine from IM2 with a paint job) and the movie finally gets going. <br/><br/>Some of the story is shown through many flashbacks, and we are introduced to both Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and the origins of something called the 'Extremis virus', which develops into the main focus of this movie. <br/><br/>What is very different about this film compared to the previous outings is that this instalment takes Tony Stark and completely strips him of the Iron Man image for much of the film. After his house (and many suits) are destroyed Stark must rely of his wits and intelligence to find out what exactly is the Extremis Virus and who is The Mandarin. While RDJ is a fine actor and easily holds the screen, I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed that there wasn't more in- suit action. I also wasn't overly keen on the relationship banter between Stark and Pepper (Paltrow) I think I preferred the boss-employee relationship from the previous movies. There was always sexual tension and an inkling that Tony loved her, but now its all out in the open it seems dull and Pepper comes across as a nagging wife for much of the film!<br/><br/>The performances in this film are all solid. RDJ is as good as ever, both Hall and Paltrow do a fine job as female leads and Kingsley as The Mandarin is a shocking performance in more ways than one! I was not expecting what he did with the character at all! The standout for me though was Guy Pearce as Killian. I thought he was great, and gave a smooth performance as the head of AIM, and aggressive in the action scenes. This is the first time as a viewer that I believed the 'villain' was a true match both intellectually and physically for Stark.<br/><br/>All in all, Iron Man 3 is a fun, if sometimes dark outing for the armoured avenger. There were a few plot holes, and some of the edits at times looked a little messy but with good performances from the cast, and some great VFX it made up for it. I would've liked to have seen a few more action scenes and the villains could have been given more back-story. but otherwise a nice start to Phase 2"
