"Tresy","10","182","207","28 March 2000"," A truly subversive movie
","I was not a fan of South Park before I saw BL&U, nor was I a fan of movie musicals. Well, I'm still not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of *this* musical, and am grateful to Parker and Stone for demonstrating that it's still possible to make a great movie on one's own terms.<br/><br/>For this movie, unlike the usual feature-length adaptation of a pop culture phenomenon, not only lives up to its pedigree, it wildly exceeds it. Yes, the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes, but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world. If you aren't familiar with that world (as I wasn't before seeing the movie), the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.<br/><br/>Subtle? Yes, many of the gags are. Indeed, one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie, in slo-mo if necessary, and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through.  (And if you have the DVD, you can add subtitles to catch many of the songs' often elusive lyrics.)<br/><br/>Then there's the music. What is it about movie musicals that attracts great satiric minds? Not since Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"" has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park. From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque ""Up There,"" to the Les Miserables spoof, ""La Resistance,"" South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.<br/><br/>One last thing: this movie is not cynical. Beneath the scatological humor, the cartoon violence, the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al, and the backdrop of adult xenophobia, sexual repression and political opportunism, is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism, if also of id-like impulse and frequent selfishness. In this they share space on the shelf of great satires with ""Candide,"" ""Gulliver's Travels,"" ""Tom Sawyer"" and especially ""Huckleberry Finn""--classics that, like BL&U, also exposed the hypocrisies of the adult world ""through the eyes of a child.""<br/><br/>Elvis Costello once sang, ""I want to bite the hand that feeds me/I want to bite that hand so badly/I want to make them wish they'd never met me."" That BLU was shut out at the Academy Awards (having only garnered a nomination for the relatively tame ""Blame Canada"", which lost, appropriately enough, to the execrable Phil Collins) only vindicates the film's take-no-prisoners send-up of nearly everything that annoys in this suffociatingly focus-group-tested, PC-policed, cynically sentimental, violence-ridden, love-starved modern world. See this movie, and see the persistence of hope and possibility sparkling like a diamond amid the pop culture detritus of a quiet little red-necked, white-trash, strait-laced, mesuggeneh, US mountain town."
"bob the moo","Null","87","97","2 November 2002"," Must see for fans  but funny and clever enough for a wider audience
","In the quiet little town of South Park Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny bride a tramp to sneak them into an R screening of the new Terrance & Phillip movie. They emerge foul mouthed and with attitude as a result of the movie and, while repeating a stunt in the film, Kenny is killed and sent to Hell. Kyle's mother leads a movement against the Canadian comedians that results in their arrest and sentencing to death.  Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and his lover Saddam Hussain prepare for the killing of Terrance & Phillip  the sign of the coming of the new time where Satan will rise again to rule the earth.  Can Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny save the comedians, stop the censorship movement that blames society for bad behaviour and prevent Satan and Saddam from destroying the world?<br/><br/>I suspect those that hate this movie are generally those who hate the TV show, where those who liked it may not be those who watch the show.  I'm a fan of the show but I not such a fan that I blind to the lack of consistency at times in the show  some episodes are dumb and lack wit, trading on swear words and forced jokes.  However I fell in love with this movie from my first time seeing it.  The film is funny in the same sort of silly juvenile way that the series is.  It has the same strange sense of humour  witness Conan O'Brien having a `Judas' moment and throwing himself to his death!<br/><br/>However on top on this it is imaginative.  How many other crude films would do it as a musical.  I'm not saying that this makes it more worthy than gross out comedies like American Pie etc, but it is cleverer.  The musical element adds to the film and helps it's stretched running time.  The songs are all catchy and are better than some of Lloyd-Webber's stuff!  They are choreographed well and just feel funnier due to the situation and the lyrics!  For example Satan's song `Up there' is excellent but hilarious because of who's singing it and the sentiments he's expressing!<br/><br/>The irony of the film is not lost.  The accusations levelled at the South Park Movie are those that the mothers in the film level at Terrance & Phillip.  The story actually answers it's own critics while telling the story!  It's not perfect and it does go a bit over the top and maybe begins to think that it is cleverer than it actually is.<br/><br/>The voice work is as excellent as always and Parker and Stone carry this the whole way home.  Guest stars add some interest but really all I need is Cartman et al and I'm set!<br/><br/>Overall I am a South park fan and I really enjoyed this.  Not just because of the elements of the show that are reproduced here but also how clever it feels (even if it isn't always as smart as it wants to be).  This isn't a cheap TV spin off into a movie this is a film that is imaginative and funny. Haters of the show will hate this but this may win you over if you thought the TV show was juvenile and a waste of time."
"baumer","7","172","202","2 July 1999"," A hell of a funny film, but with a message.
","When you have the reputation that Parker and Stone do, it is hard to get rid of the sterotypes that have been drawn around you.  You are forever stuck in the mold that has been bestowed upon you.  But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.  As long as they disguise that statement(s) with all that made them popular in the first place, they can get away with it.  So now, if I said that beyond the non-stop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains, is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation, would you believe me?  Would you care?<br/><br/>First off, this is the most profanity laced film I have ever seen in my life, and that includes early Eddie Murphy efforts.  But the profanity in this film had me in stitches.  Honestly, that was almost not just a figure of speech either.  I laughed so hard that I almost banged my head on the on the person in front of me.  Remember how absorbed you were at the horror of war at the beginning of Private Ryan?  Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour, that is a safe comparison.  This film is so ******* funny and I really enjoyed it on that level.  I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space.  The profanity goes a bit overboard at times but I think that was on purpose.  Some of the humour is a bit gross ( seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time ) but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more, and hey, I was very entertained.<br/><br/>But on the political side, there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.  Censorship for one.  It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.  But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.<br/><br/>The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood, many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.<br/><br/>Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us, it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.  That was cool.<br/><br/>It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour.  To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.  This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.  Enjoy the film, but listen to what it has to say.  That is, besides the F and S word, listen to what it wants to say.<br/><br/>**** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.  When they asked for South Park, the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.  The lady reassured her that it was fine.  Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat.  That is responsible parenting.  Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do.  And I applaud that parent for doing so.  She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time.  Maybe if more people were like that, there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all, they are just words."
"EdRooney","Null","95","110","29 June 1999"," Funnier, Faster, and Delicious
","When ""South Park"" first appeared on the scene, I dismissed it without ever really watching it. I wasn't too interested in watching little kids yell and curse at each other. When ""Baseketball"" opened last July, it was there and then that I began to understand the humor and musical styling of ""Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Last year also saw the release of the duo's ""Orgazmo"" and ""Cannibal : The Musical"", both made prior to the ""South Park"" phenomena. I became a fan. With ""South Park : Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"", the television show makes the giant leap to the big screen with a completely over the top feature that will probably end up as the one summer film that gives the audience the most pop for it's coin. To synopsize the film would be too painful (and boring).  It's so packed with plot and characters that a one sentence generalization would do the film no justice.  I'll put it this way : If you don't know, get, or find ""South Park"" funny, DON'T GO SEE THE FILM.  There might be droves of walkouts as soon as the opening sequence ends by people who thought that a cartoon could never be ""that bad"".  The R rating and the ""Uncut"" of the title are there for a reason.  Heed the signs. Paced like a bat out of hell, ""South Park"" is the funniest film to come around in some time.  While most of the jokes might seem stale to real ""Park"" devotees, Director Parker knows exactly how to keep the film flowing, and in the process, show us new sides and characters that used to be unattainable on Comedy Central.  The movie is vulgar and offensive, that's the idea. But Parker and Stone never once get meanspirited about things, always making sure everybody get a slice of the laughingstock pie. The dreaded ""bleeping"" of the curse words is finally gone, leaving Parker and Stone their first chance to show the world just how far they can take this concept.  After hostilities with the ratings board over the NC-17 given to ""Orgazmo""(which was harmless fun), this new film( which is far more raunchy than ""Orgazmo"") can be easily viewed as one big middle finger to the ratings board.  It's the first film I have ever seen that purposely goes unbelievably far just to see what they can actually get away with.  It's very interesting to compare this film, which made it out with a R rating, to others that were slapped with the NC-17.  I believe that this is what Parker and Stone had in mind. Watching the antics of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny on the silver screen does have it's advantages.  The film is decidedly cinematic, often jumping to show-stopping musical numbers that I love Parker for.  Working with Marc Shaiman, Parker brings us a whole new load of songs that are equal parts silly, and yet retain some musical respect.  A just world would find evil Canadians Terrence and Phillip's ""Uncle Fu**a"" at the number one spot on the charts.  Like ""Cannibal"", the songs stay in the head. They move beyond their comic foundation and feel like real songs, Parker has a musical gift and this ""South Park"" feature really showcases it. But don't fret fans, the film is jammed packed with comedy that represents what ""South Park"" is all about.  Canadians, African-Americans, Jews, Catholics, the poor, the wealthy, gay, straight, bi, men with voiceboxes, men with puppets on their hands... Everyone is made fun of here.  And every moment of this 80 minute film is comedic gold.  Like the ""Beavis And Butthead"" film, this movie comes out just as people are beginning to write off the TV series.  And similar to ""Butthead"", this film has made a true fan out of me.  No other flick this year will have the stamina, the audacity, and the sheer momentum to please like this little ""South Park"" film.  I give Parker and Stone endless credit for crafting a film that nobody will expect, and that every fan will relish.--------- 9"
"Shayde9","10","140","165","22 July 1999"," Vulgarity at it's finest!!!!!!!!
","What can I say but OH MY GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had heard rumors about this movie's extremities (no pun intended) and that it was much more...ahem...wild than the t.v. show.  Now, I've only seen a handful of the television shows, and they're pretty racy and raunchy, but I've always liked what I've seen.  It's definitely not a show (or movie!) for kids.  Or the faint of heart, or the easily offended.  But then again, if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! <br/><br/>
I loved this movie.  Granted, I have to admit that I was shocked and surprised through 95% of it.  But it was great nonetheless. It was funny and vulgar and said pretty much everything in a manner that was NOT politically correct.  But then again, aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?<br/><br/>I think one of the things that gets most of us, (at least myself) is that when we were kids that age, we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did.  Or, if we did, we did our best not to get caught!  Of course, I was only ever threatened with getting my mouth washed out with soap...not my mother starting a war with a foreign country! <br/><br/>
The musical numbers were great!  They were very upbeat and will stick in the minds of viewers for years to come.  In the future, when we're all sitting behind our desks (or whatever jobs we may have), we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is, we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the ""civilized"" world.  The scene I think the best for musical numbers was where several of the different songs were going on at one time.  It was very ""Les Miserables"" like (I saw the musical so I know what I'm talking about) in a very sick and twisted sort of way. It was simply funny and light hearted.<br/><br/>This movie poked fun at just about everything in the book.  Nothing was spared.  Not Christianity, not different racial stereotypes, and certainly not the gay community.  But none of it was handled in a fashion to be hateful or humiliating.  In my opinion, all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated, they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism. Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes, then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie.  <br/><br/>As for the political statement: it's true, you know.  This country (as are many others) is always looking for something or someone else to blame for all the ""troubles.""  We as a nation are hypersensitive to every little thing and just about everything is taboo.  From swearing to being able to purchase certain adult oriented ""toys,"" a person can't do anything in this country without being censored or ""forbidden"" to.  It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like.  And this is what this movie was trying to point out. I agree with the person who is his review of this movie wrote, ""They're just words"" about the swearing in the movie.  And that's all they are. <br/><br/>
I give this movie a 10 for its humor, its musical numbers and its obvious statements.  I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie."
"Danwellsmith","10","88","102","26 May 2005"," eloquent profanity
","Nothing can prepare you for this film. It's a one off. Undoubtedly the best film I have ever seen. I truly laughed until I cried in the cinema showing, bought the video and the soundtrack - which I never do - and have watched it several times over. The political undertones are frighteningly poignant. The idea is brilliant. It's the antidisney. It's a fart in the face of those who wage war in the name of decency. It's a bunch of foul mouthed kids spewing profanity. It's better than good versus evil; it challenges us to asses the criteria upon which we judge good and evil. It pokes fun at everyone, white, black, Jewish, Christian - but particularly the stupid and the bigoted. by ridiculing the fuss that is made against profanity, the writers have safeguarded themselves against adverse publicity from complaints. It's what the film is about in the first place. My only complaint is that this film is so brilliant that it made Team America seem tame."
"Quinoa1984","10","87","102","13 January 2000"," The Best Animated Comedy I've Ever Seen
","South Park: Bigger, Longer and Un-cut is a great movie.  Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.  And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers, but that they could be truly freedom fighters by show-casing this film.<br/><br/>The story is about the four boys of South Park (Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman) and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick, they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use.  Since the film is Canadian, a war breaks out between Canada and America.  Kenny dies (thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode) and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers.  Both plot sides are very hilarious (depending on if you watch the show) and it's very satirical (if you don't believe me, just look at Bill Gates getting shot in the movie).<br/><br/>The Movie seems quite content in it's dirty foul-ness and funny comedy musical type way to make us laugh (not that thats a bad thing), but I think that Matt and Trey are tying to tell us something with this film.  It is a wakeup call to America that if censorship doesn't change soon, we might actually go to war with a country over something as arbitrary as censorship and freedom.  Or... it's just a good old fashioned comedy with fart jokes, sex humor, and a Winona Ryder playing ping-pong in her private area.  Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.  Never-the-less, this film is one of the best of the year.  A++"

","If you're not a fan of non-stop swearing, crude humor, musicals, satire, violence, or just South Park in general then don't watch this. Trey Parker and Matt Stone hold nothing back during this movie. Everything they can't get away with on television they do so with Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Weather anyone believes it or not BLU is a musical in every respect. From the intro song(Small Mountain Town) to the money number(Uncle F*cker, which you will find yourself singing in the shower), this is a musical top to bottom. The movie kicks off with the kids going to see the Terrance and Phillip movie where they hear so many bad words they become corrupted and begin to use them in their every day lives. Kyle's mom is so outraged by this film that she, along with the rest of South Park, manage to get the United States to go to war with Canada for sending the Terrance and Phillip movie to America. Stan, Kyle, and Cartmen form a resistance group to fight their parents and the war, and Kenny goes to Hell where Satan and Saddam (who are gay lovers in the movie) plan on taking over Earth by using the war. This movie is so great it's hard not to love it, especially since it made the Book of World Records for 399 swear words and 128 offensive gestures. Parker and Stone out-did themselves with this movie. You'll laugh until you hurt."

","First of all, let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of South Park the TV show.  While I find the TV show amusing, I do not watch it more than once every few months.  So I had doubts about the movie, but my brother insisted I watch it.  So I did and ended up purchasing the DVD the next day.<br/><br/>All comedy aside, this is one of the most masterfully written movies I have ever seen.  The songs are hilariously funny and the way that they incorporate all the individual songs into one masterpiece is sheer genius. Probably one of the best musicals I have seen.<br/><br/>As for the humor, don't watch this if you are easily offended, because you will be offended.<br/><br/>Funny, funny, funny.   10 stars."

After all, it makes fun of black people, Jews, women , Canada, homosexuality, homeless people, fat people and of course Barbara Streisand...miss anything out!!?! yet if you like it you can't help but admit that the movie is comedy genius. The opening 10 minutes had me rolling in the aisles ""how would you like to suck my b#lls, Mr garrison?"" and the song ""its easy mmmmkay"" being some of the highlights. the jokes while repetitive (based on swearing or insulting someone) never get old and the genius of ideas such as ""operation get behind the darkies"" while being offensive are undeniably funny. the only people who would rate this movie any less than at least 7 are the pathetic types who'll say ""oh its to vulgar and rude and offensive"". thats the point! so if you're someone who can laugh at yourself (which we should all be able to in an un-serious movie such as this) and want to witness some amazing moments of comedy genius than this is for you. special shout out to the creators of south park for the character Eric cartman, the real star of this movie who would be up there on par with homer simpson for all time greatest comedy character if not for his foul mouth and habit of insulting well..everyone! 10/10 from me for all the nights this ones cheered me up with out fail."

","South Park is one of my favorite TV shows, so I decided I had to see the movie. Once the movie started I was into it very quickly. (This part contains Spoilers) In the beginning, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie that is made by their idols, Terrence and Philip. The film is a little bit more than just a lot of foul language. After the kids see it, they start swearing all the time and tell their friends about it. Soon, a lot of kids in the country see it and also start swearing. The parents become very concerned about this. One day Kenny does something similar to what happens in the movie and ends up getting killed. The kid's Moms decide to start a war against Canada and execute Terrence and Philip. If I told you the rest, it would ruin the fun of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a musical with some very clever and hilarious musical numbers, one of which was nominated for an academy award. The storyline is very clever, looking at how much came out of such a simple idea. At the same time this movie does have some good points that were brought up, such as how people think media makes kids to do things, and about freedom of speech. This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it is definitely a clever movie with some huge laughs and good messages."
"RanmaInuyashafan","10","11","12","1 January 2005"," Best Movie Ever!
","I, personally loved this movie! The rudeness, vagueness, and profanity just makes it better than expected! If every movie was like this, not only would the world be a much better place, but I would be going to the movie theater every day, instead of spending all my money at Best Buy! Kids shouldn't watch this at all. That's the only downside. They can't see how funny this movie really is! The good thing about Bigger, Longer, & Uncut, is that they can make fun of everyone and anyone they want, and the people will be too busy enjoying this movie to do anything about it! So, this movie is about when two Canadians, Terrance and Phillip, make a movie. The profanity angers Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny's mothers (but mostly Kyle's) after they see it, and they tell them never to see it again. They disobey, (as usual) and it leads to Kenny trying to attempt one of the stunts, (catching your ""fart"" on fire)leading to his death when a Doctor replaces his heart with a baked potato. This angers the mothers' even more, ultimately leading to a war against Canada, and the execution of Terrance and Phillip. To stop the execution, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle launch ""Le Resitance"" to stop the war, stop the execution of Terrance and Phillip, and stop their blood from reaching the ground or Sadaam Hussein and Satin from taking over the world!"
"cofemug","10","56","77","30 June 1999"," Great movie, not for everyone. esp. kids
","I saw this movie and laughed and laughed and laughed.  I was shocked and offended.  It was one of the bravest movies of the year, nevertheless decade, or history.  It was definitely bigger and longer.  It certainly seemed uncut, even though it wasn't.  See June 29 studio brief.  It was hilarious.<br/><br/>Plot: The movie had a great plot.  I won't give it all away, but it is definitely big.  It starts with Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and Kyle's little brother sneaking into the Terrance Phillip movie, ""A**es of Fire,"" which has been rated R.  They learn all kinds of swear words and use them at all times.  The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie.  They form a group against the movie.  It goes out from there.  There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell, and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love.  Saddam is a hornball.  And Satan regrets the whole relationship.<br/><br/>Crudity:  Definitely for adults only.  It probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year.  It has cartoon nudity.  It has breasts and wriggling penises.  All cartoon, of course.  It has violence galore by the end.  Do not take your kids to see this, or be prepared to feel uncomfortable.  All theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. However, if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred, do not see this.  It also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.<br/><br/>As a whole:  The funniest movie so far of 1999.  I laughed so hard.  I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie ""Pink Flamingos.""  I cannot recommend this movie to everyone.  I can recommend it to those who are not offended easily.  This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived ""There's Something About Mary.""  Parents will not like this movie unless they are completely open-minded, and I recommend not seeing it with your children.  However, it is wonderful.  I loved the musical format that they chose.  Everywhere there is a song. Also stay past the credits, there is an after-scene.  It is trying to be a ""Pink Flamingos."" I love it but can only recommend it to the group from 17-30, male.----------------------------10"

The story itself does not have much sense, but who cares?

","South Park is ultimate social criticism through art. The drawings look intentionally amateurish, so that the viewer can both focus on the dialogs and also realize that non-Hollywood ethics are applied throughout the show.<br/><br/>In South Park nothing is sacred; there is no political correctness - the purest form of fascism and hypocrisy. In fact everything that is ""right"" in modern society is ridiculed, to the point of exhaustion. The ideal comedy.<br/><br/>There is another aspect of South Park that is almost always overlooked. The characters are emotionally charged. The creators care about their characters and they always take the time to explore the aspects of their personality in depth. No one is bad here, it's just that everyone functions in their own way.<br/><br/>I was relieved to read the comments of the alarmed American parents, who warn everyone not to let their kids watch the show. It's the same people who protest against Internet pornography and show their paranoid concern about how it can corrupt our children.

","Trey Parker and Matt Stone really are sick guys. Making Sidam Hussein Satan's gay lover...where did they think that up? It doesn't matter because this movie was phenomenal.<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut has taken the American people on a joy ride through heaven, hell, and Colorado. The boys we have come to know and love on Comedy Central find a new home on the big screen. Stan Marsh, Kyle Broslofski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick are bigger, better, and uncensored in this movie...and it's wonderful. Four fourth graders singing, dancing, and swearing like there is no tomorrow make one hell of a cast.<br/><br/>The story starts off with the release of the new Terrance and Phillip movie, Asses of Fire. This creates such a shock-wave that Kyle's mother gets the two Canadian superstars arrested and put in the electric chair during a USO show. It is so similar to what parents go through whenever they find something offensive and think their children are in danger.<br/><br/>Once Satan finds out that the US and Canada are at war, he and his lover Sidam Hussein...that's right...decide it is the perfect time to unleash hell on earth. Kenny finds out because he is dead and sent to hell. Surprised he is dead? Didn't think so. It's his job to warn his friends of the incoming danger. What results from all this chaos is non stop hilarity.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so amazing is that it isn't just a South Park movie...it's basically a South Park Musical! Trey and Matt have written an entire movie's worth of songs. Each one funnier than the next. The Academy Award nominated song, ""Blame Canada"", performed by Robin Williams at the Oscars and by Kyle's mother in the movie, is incredible.<br/><br/>The madness doesn't stop with the singing and the dancing, the censorship on TV is no more and the kids like the F-bombs fly...and more...and worse. Hearing fourth graders cuss like that is too much and makes the movie very enjoyable.<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger Better & Uncut is one of the best guilty pleasures around and everyone should take part in it at least some time in their lifetime. It is a timeless epic film done in animation. Although Phil Collins beat South Park out for the Oscar with his song from Disney's Tarzan, this movie is a winner."
"Scissorhands007","10","9","10","14 April 2004"," Viva La Resistance!
","SPOILER ALERT! This is one of the finest satiric cartoons ever made. I am convinced that South Park is the best show on TV (and the only excuse to turn on that disgusting Comedy Central [AKA The Beer and Sex Channel,]) but some people wonder if the movie is as good as the show. Take my word for it, it isn't. It's ten times better. In the movie, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny see an R-rated film starring their favorite Canadian actors, Terrance and Philip. The movie is entitled Asses of Fire, and if I may quote Arthur Taussig, the title is the least offensive thing about it. In the opening scene of Asses of Fire, we discover why it was rated R. I won't give away one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I'll just say that I didn't know you could use that many obscenities in only three minutes. When the movie ends, the boys leave the theatre repeating all the words they've heard in the film. Not knowing what the words mean, they continue this behavior the next day at school. Their teacher sends them to the guidance counselor who subsequently calls their mothers. As those who watch the show may have guessed, Sheila Brosfloski, Kyle's mother, is outraged and begins a campaign to have the film banned.<br/><br/>It's general pop-culture knowledge that Kenny McCormick is killed in nearly EVERY episode of South Park. One can naturally assume that his death in the movie would be the Kenny-death-to-end-all-Kenny-deaths. It is, but unlike his frequent deaths in the show, his death in the movie is a huge contributing factor to the plot. This may be a slight spoiler (if you can call the way in which Kenny dies a spoiler.) The boys end up seeing the movie again, and Kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review. He is banished to Hell for skipping church to see the film, and we discover that Satan and Saddam Hussein are in a homosexual love affair. In this relationship, Satan is surprisingly warm and caring and wants to communicate with Saddam, but Saddam just wants sex. The conversations between these two characters throughout the film are hilarious. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Sheila Brosfloski's movement to have Terrance and Philip banned has spun out of control. Canada is blamed for all of the problems of America's youth, America is preparing to literally wage war against Canada, all Canadian-American citizens are sent to death-camps, and Terrance and Philip are scheduled to be executed. Back in Hell, Kenny listens to a conversation between Satan and Saddam. Bible readers know the seven signs of the end of the world. The fall of an empire, the coming of a comet, etc. We discover that when the blood of Terrance and Philip touches American soil, Satan and Saddam Hussein will ascend from Hell and rule the earth. It is now up to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every Christian's worst nightmare, and his boyfriend, George W. Bush's worst nightmare. This film is more than hilarious. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest individuals in America. This film is an animated musical, but parents beware, it doesn't bare the Disney family-friendly stamp of approval. The best songs in the film are ""Up There,"" ""I'm Super,"" ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?,"" and the infamous ""Blame Canada,"" which was nominated for an Oscar. The best voice jobs by the creators were Saddam Hussein (Matt Stone,) and Satan (Trey Parker.) I could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it. Caution: while this film is animated, it is certainly not for the kiddies. It is filled with vulgar language, but it is not gratuitous. The language used is the purpose of the film. The moral of the film is that no matter what words your children learn from a film, it is not the filmmaker's job to raise your child. It's an anti-censorship film. It is the up to the parent to put it into context and punish accordingly. I would recommend this film to everyone who is not easily offended or an extreme Christian, YOU WILL BE OFFENDED. If you're into satirical cartoons, or just want to see Canadians drop bombs on Alec Baldwin, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a must-see."
"jeffzi","10","9","10","22 December 2003"," Good transition to a movie -- great songs!
","I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened.  I was a little concerned when hearing that it was done as a musical, as all the voices are pretty unique and wasn't sure how they would convert over to singing, but was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are very well done, and the 'singing' voices of the characters are all actually pretty good!<br/><br/>I was definitely excited to also see what they would do without needing to be censored for TV.  The comedy of the TV show shines through, and you can easily see how ""different"" the authors are when they're not required to keep some things out for TV viewing.<br/><br/>As the show continues to do well and keeps coming back for more, they should definitely make another one!"

","South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is unique, as it is likely the only movie adaptation of a television show that was popular with both critics and audiences.  It is also one of the funniest animated films ever made.  The film takes satiric aim at American culture, through the premise of a war between the US and Canada started by an ""obscene"" Canadian film.  Like MASH, South Park contrasts the perceived obscenity of language and sexuality with the true obscenity of war and violence.  The film has become even more poignant in these dark times of wars fought under false pretenses. <br/><br/>The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman.  Highlights include the ""Blame Canada"" song and a Stanley Kubrick/Anthony Burgess tribute involving the V-chip. It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features.   10/10"

Naturally it's offensive and abuses the human ears, but that's the South Park charm.  Highlights include Cartman's song about Kyle's mum and Mr. Mackey's song about cuss word alternatives.

"brankoburcksen","10","8","9","19 January 2003"," One of the greatest animated movies ever seen by the human eye.
","The South Park movie has many great themes as to why it is so good; one reason is that it has succeeded in telling a story that could have failed in more than a 1,000 ways, and the movie has been made in such a way that no live action movie could possibly do it better. I'm a person  who watches ""South Park"" regularly (on T.V.), and  I can say that the movie is viewer friendly to people who never watch the TV series, is different from the TV series, and it stays true to the TV series. The opening of the movie intentionally makes fun of the opening sequence to ""Beauty and the Beast."" Although the TV show sometimes does songs, the movie purposely does several songs to keep the movie lively, and turns it into a musical. The first song of the movie is probably the most important because it introduces the main characters. Many people believe that South Park is mindless cursing and swearing, and that maybe true, but the first swearing word in the movie is actually forshadowing of what will happen to Kenny (one of the lead characters) when he dies. The song that has the most  swearing in it is the Terance & Philip song. The song consists of the most swearing words I've ever heard in a single minute. What makes this song so great is that it symbolizes how many times a child hears a swearing word before they actually start using it. What people might hate most about this movie is how offensive it is (especially towards Canadians, but I've heard before that anyone who finds South Park offensive is probably not thinking. I personly have relatives who are Canadian. Beyond the story of the movie there are other things that make the movie interesting; such as the bad animation. But this is actually another high point of the movie. Nowadays people have become so familiar with the stunning, breathtaking, life like animation that South Park takes the audience back to when the first animators experimented with stop motion animaition. To date ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" has recieved an Acadamy Award nomination for the song ""Blame Canada"", has made it into the ""Guinness Book of World Records"" for having the most swearing (399 times of swearing) and is on IMDb's  list of the best animated films. I have made a top ten list of the best animated films, and South Park had made it to number one. Ranking higher than ""Prince Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away."" This is the kind of movie that people should let their kids see, but only if the parents can teach their children the terrible meaning and usage of the words. Beyond that there is no reason why a person shouldn't find this movie entertaining."

It shows what real life situations are like, while showing it in a stomach churning way. The movie deserves what I gave it, 10/10 stars.

"TheNorthernMonkee","9","4","4","12 April 2005"," gross, extreme and hilarious film version of brilliant series
","SPOILERS In 1997 Matt Stone and Trey Parker, two friends from Colorado University, released the first episode of a long running television show. That show, ""South Park"", is an extreme animated show containing some of the sickest jokes on television in a long time. The series was such a success that two years later and a film was released. Seventy-eight minutes long and as hilarious as the series, ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" is a joy to watch and is always good for a laugh.<br/><br/>South Park, Colorado, a small redneck town full of some of the most obscure people you are ever likely to meet. Two boys, Stan Marsh (Parker) and best friend Kyle Broslofski (Stone) spend their time trying to live a simple, quiet life and make it through school. With fellow friend, and regular corpse, Kenny McCormick (also Stone), the boys experience outlandish adventure after outlandish adventure. All whilst trying to get rid of fat, offencive, evil Eric Cartman (also Parker). In the film though, when heroes Terrence and Phillip are blamed for the boys using offencive language, they find themselves involved in the ultimate battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Just like the series, the film adaptation of ""South Park"" is as extreme as is physically possible. Ridiculing the Canadians, Hollywood, Political correctness, Bill Gates, and countless others, 'Bigger Longer and Uncut' is hilarious from start to finish.<br/><br/>Compared with the series in fact, 'Bigger Longer and Uncut' is actually better. Just like in later film ""Team America: World Police"", Parker and Stone have showed a skill at writing some of the daftest songs your ever likely to hear. Songs like 'Uncle F***a' which spoofs musical ""Oklahoma"" and the superior 'Resistance' which pokes fun at ""Les Miserables"". In fact, Parker and Stone are so brilliant at writing songs that major soundtrack 'Blame Canada' even received an Oscar nomination for best song. It is songs like these three, which help to make ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" one of the funniest cartoon films of all-time.<br/><br/>Some might complain that the offencive and extreme behaviour of ""South Park"" is extreme and shouldn't be allowed. Ironically it is people like this that the film ridicules at great lengths. In fact, there are few it doesn't insult and ultimately, that's a good thing. Just like the series 'Bigger Longer and Uncut' is rude, crude and absolutely wonderful."

The only people who don't love this movie either are nerdy or believe that the south park content is vulgar which at times i admit can be harsh but still think is one of the better comedies of all time. It touches all the things going on in the world at that time such as Saddam Housein and the love of War.

"Jojomartin","9","4","4","19 July 2004"," Only stupid people won't get this movie.
","I have heard comments saying that this movie is nothing but bathroom humor, but unlike certain movies (i.e. White Chicks, Soul Plane, etc.) this movie has some of the smartest comedy from the year it was in theaters. The issue Trey Parker and Matt Stone take on is the evils of censorship and how parents should be watching their kids about what they see on television or a movie theater. Trey Parker and Matt Stone also put in lots of low-brow humor, but unlike most movies attempting this kind of humor, they are actually very successful. This movie pulls absolutely no punches whatsoever on one of the most serious issues in our country. People might complain that it will eventually be dated, but censorship has actually gotten a lot worse than it was back in 1999 and sees no sign of dying. What impressed me about the movie the most was that it was also a damn good musical, in fact, better than almost any musical from the decade this movie was released. If censorship does die eventually, it could possibly be used for historical purposes, just like what Looney Tunes did for World War II. All in all, this movie is a brilliant combination of witty and low-brow comedy, with some heavy issues that this country has right now. If you are into satirical, smart, sharply written comedy, you will absolutely love this movie."
"Huang_Gai","10","4","4","3 August 2001"," A great, vulgar movie
","The movie/musical begins with the four boys (Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman) going to the local theatre to see a foreign film by Terrance and Phillip (a Canadian duo famous for their ""hilarious"" fart jokes). Only to find out that they're not allowed entrance as it is rated R. Being the resourceful little chaps that they are, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman hire a bum and have him pose as their parent. They get into the movie, hear a whole slew of fowl language, Kenny dies from imitating the movie, Kyle's mom starts a war on Canada, and Satan and Saddahm Hussein are preparing to rule the world. Weird, huh? The movie is probably the most perfect thing I've ever seen, ranging from it's satirical humor to it's mindless knockoffs of song cues from the likes of Disney, to it's cast of characters and voice acting. This is one of the greats. As with all of the South Park episodes, this movie has a moral hidden deep down inside for parents and children alike. Mom and dad, if your son or daughter is doing drugs, hanging around with the wrong people, joining cults, or imitating violence seen off of video games and t.v., watch this movie, and find out the REAL cause for all of your troubles with your children."

"alice liddell","9","4","4","7 September 1999"," Swearing makes the world go round.
","Whether it's something to be worried about or not, I don't know, but American live-action films rarely emulate the wit, invention and versatility of their animated counterparts.  Even so-called lesser efforts like HERCULES are magesterial compared to bloated Hollywood extravaganzas and enervating indies.  The best of the modern live-action films, such as RUSHMORE, owe much to the freewheeling ethic of cartoons such as THE SIMPSONS.<br/><br/>All of which is to say that SOUTH PARK is easily one of the best films of the year.  Again, I don't know whether this is a good thing.  One truth is self-evident: it shows up the bow-legged unfunniness of most 'comedies'.  I was a bit worried going in because the second series of the TV show showed signs of desperation and flagging ideas, but this was a hoot.  I nearly choked on my sweets, and twice spat my drank on the person in front.<br/><br/>Its pleasures are many, but most satisfying of all is its consistent adaptation of a young boy's world-view.  The satire of THE SIMPSONS would be way over Bart's head, but everything here is exactly how a Cartman would see the world.  Everything is flat and two-dimensional; noise and immediate sensation predominate; cartoon (!) violence and swearing are joyous pleasures; the efflatus of modern life is only half-gasped (homosexuality, oncoming puberty, Sadaam Hussein is the devil's lackey etc.); and, most importantly, mothers are the cause of all the trouble in the world, their domestic tyranny transposed to a global scale.  And yet this focus does not limit the film's blistering, savage satire, anymore that Lemuel's point-of-view softens Gulliver's Travels.<br/><br/>The moral of the film is perversely reassuring.  Swearing makes the world go round.  This isn't just a facile rubbing of conservative noses (although the thought of this is very pleasing) - the idea that the socialisation of children only leads to emotional damage and social chaos is one with a long and noble history.  The annoying thing about this film is its pompous arrogance - if you agree with the film-makers, cool; if you don't, you're a reactionary lunatic.  The great thing about the film is that it belongs to no-one.  Everyone is offended, crucially: though censorship is ridiculed, viewers are shown to be influenced by what they watch; though army racism is attacked, one of the black characters still talks like an extra from GONE WITH THE WIND.  No-one is ever allowed to feel comfortable - conservatism and political correctness are shown to be cosy bedfellows.<br/><br/>And yet, the truth is that, despite exposure to 'offensive' material, and potentially traumatic experience, the children remain blissfully innocent. The film's achievement is to show that a set of signifiers (e.g. swearing, obscure female body parts) are of little effect unless they are accompanied by the knowledge to use them practically.  Cartman and co. get fun from swearing because they know it annoys their elders, not because they're offering conscious transgression.<br/><br/>Formally, the film is much more graceful than you might expect.  The big screen is perfect - the prodigious detail of SOUTH PARK  is often lost on TV.  The colours and 'simplistic' animation are a constant delight, both comically and aesthetically.  The musical numbers are hilarious and clever in themselves, but also brilliantly choreographed - this is the best Hollywood musical since CABARET.  There is a stunningly conceived and very frightening vision of hell (beware Hitler!  George Burns!  Gandhi!  Jar Jar Binks!), which is immediately sent up.  The climactic battle is a model of crowd composition and meaningful imagery.  The pace, while it never matches the stunning opening and Terrence and Phillip film sequence, rarely flags.<br/><br/>What SOUTH PARK will be remembered for, though, is its sidesplitting, offensive, how-the-hell-did-they-get-away-with-that sequences of genius (and it's really tiresome hearing blase bores saying 'What's shocking about it?' Name one film in your local multiplex one tenth as daring): Terrence and Phillip's sublime 'Uncle' song; the Satan and Sadaam relationship; Kyle on the Net; Cartman's V-chip; Mr. Mackay's rehab group; Big Gay Al's show for the boys - they just keep on coming, we can't stop laughing.  One quibble - for all its gratuitous swearing, there is one epithet that even Parker and Stone can't seem to handle.  I wonder why."

","There's one problem with television: You can't say &#*%, or $@&%, or #^&@%$. So what did Trey Parker and Matt Stone -- the creators of the hit mature animated series ""South Park"" -- turn? The movies, where anything goes (just about). Although the idea for a ""South Park"" movie probably came about before the idea to exploit the MPAA's more flexible ratings system for the TV show's impeccable satire, it's no less the perfect choice to bring the little Colorado mountain town and its foul-mouthed children to the big screen in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.""<br/><br/>Using the movies, Parker and Stone immediately come out singing (yes, this is a movie musical) that the movies are responsible for society's cultural education. The third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all go to see the new Terrence & Philip movie, based on the show's fictional hit Canadian TV show about two farting roommates, mirroring the experience of the likely underaged crowd going to see the ""South Park"" movie, and there you have the brilliance of ""South Park"" and this film.<br/><br/>The Terrence & Philip movie introduces the kids to a whole world of swears and insults they never knew before (because they couldn't use them on TV) and they start using it in talking back to teachers and their parents. As usual, the parents of South Park take things too seriously and point the finger for their children's bad behavior at well, Canada, who else? Single-handedly, Parker and Stone introduce the Canada joke to Americans.<br/><br/>The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.<br/><br/>Parker and Stone should take their act to Broadway with the quality of the music in this movie, from the Oscar-nominated ""Blame Canada"" to ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" They do enlist the help of the talented Tony winner Marc Shaiman, but the show has always been known for its musical prowess. The songs are memorable, fun and break up the film well considering its structured like a long television special.<br/><br/>Fans of the show get exactly what they'd expect from ""South Park"" including some extra goodies and appearances from all the most liked characters. The language of course is off the charts, but the childish ignorance of adult content (Stan seeks the clitoris after Chef tells him that's how you keep a girl around) is there too. By film's end it's not the sharpest satire that the show has ever delivered, but it was obviously the perfect plot choice for making ""South Park"" into a movie, not just picking some random story line, but maximizing the satire potential of the new medium. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
"johnnyboyz","8","3","3","2 September 2009"," Scathing attack of a movie observing how one nation's work infiltrates another's quiet, innocent existence with issues of censorship and spectatorship at the forefront.
","It's somewhat peculiar that the feelings and notions linked to the build up to initially watching South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut many years ago would go so far as to actually contribute to the themes and ideas that the film itself is looking at. Here is a film that everybody it was meant for, as well as those that it wasn't, just had to see at some point in their lives. For those that couldn't, we had to wait until it was released in the latter days of the video cassette and hope to have it bought for us; either that or have a school-mate, whose ill-informed-on-the-matter parents had been easily fooled by the cover's cartoonish qualities and central positioning of four young and smiling children complete with all Hell breaking loose in the background, lend it to us.<br/><br/>The cartoon series hadn't been around long, but it'd been around long enough to garner the sort of attention its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, would have both wanted and expected. Of course, I found the film hilarious the first time I saw it; it was the sort of humour anyone my age would have done, but as the years have gone by and I've watched it ever-so often since; the screenplay and the various situations that play out are still as funny, as the greater study that the film observes unfolds around it, all the time under a huge umbrella of self-awareness and send ups. There must be people other than myself that still evoke a chuckle at scenes such as the one in which a character's mother's televised debate with an angry Canadian individual gets rather heated, as well as a U.S. general's debriefing before a coming together with Microsoft's Bill Gates as they talk of how frustrating it is to work with Windows '98.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely shameless in its opening: a crude and somewhat tame looking establishing shot of something that in any other film, particularly animated, would fill us with awe; that being a mountain range. We zoom out of this badly drawn and uninspiring looking peak to the town of South Park in Colorado, U.S.A. and Stan, one of many characters voiced by Trey Parker, partaking in a spoof-rendition of the opening of 1991's Beauty and the Beast as he observes his home town. It's a poignant start to a film which is, essentially, all about this young boy and his observations of the world and, ultimately, the art around him. If everything established is perfect in this Utopian setting, then it is only by way of an outside agent that anything can interfere. One such line from Stan's opening song sees him remark on the one negative aspect of his town; that ""you see homeless people, but you just don't care"". The important thing here is that by the end of the film, indeed the journey, Stan will still observe, but will come to care about the things that make something less than perfect, and he will learn to have opinions on the observations he makes.<br/><br/>The film predominantly revolves around censorship, in particular the want to censorship an art form of some-kind. In South Park's case, a patched together Canadian comedy film about two individuals called Terrance and Phillip indulging in nothing but a series of low-brow gags. Naturally, the new 'event' movie sees the four kids of South Park; named Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman; go along to see the latest release from yonder-border â€“ with horrific results. The film opens up all sorts of problems for the boys and shortly after the cinema visit, they're swearing and cursing like nobody's business. The mothers' reaction sees a campaign for a banning order followed by an actual war with Canada when they apprehend Terrance and Phillip.<br/><br/>Amongst all the chaos and the jokes, it's difficult to loose sight of what the film actually does; that being a coming of age tale which explores the importance of spectatorship and viewer awareness when it comes to film. The real life connotations linked to the fact a number of people under the age of who it's for wanted 'in' on the Soth Park film unearths an eerie sense of art echoing life. The sneaking in and the observing of the film causes a war between two nations, whereas one character attempts to re-create what he's seen characters do on screen only for him to orrifically perish as a result, in what is a clear demonisation of this notion. Later on, Cartman will go off into a song number in which he will churn out a number of offensive and racist jibes, much in the vein of the Terrance and Phillip movie, in what is a further demonisation when it transpires he then has some sort of anti-swear hardware installed into him.<br/><br/>But the boys mean good overall, they're just caught in a wave with the rest of the herd. They each share the same idol; an American figure skater named Brian Boitano, an athlete of sorts, whom to them embodies all the necessary positive characteristics of dedication and enthusiasm to win through in the end. Additionally, as an overall study, the film is in support of standing up for what you believe in and promotes individualism in regards to specific subject matter. In this regard, the character of Stan is used for such a message. But its outgoing statement on censorship as a bad thing, and that art is to be viewed as it should be, I have no problems with. The film explores these notions by way of presenting the parents of these children as ill-informed and unaware of what their children are watching, just as they allow them to roam the streets in what was already established by one mother as a would-be ludicrously safe-haven in which nothing can go wrong. Two words: Wake Up. Observe the text yourself before you pass onto others."
"jamhorner","8","3","3","27 July 2007"," Profanity at It's Finest and Humor and It's Brilliance
","I'm not one for vulgarity or profanity but this film truly made me laugh my ass off. The profanity and the almost constant swearing really make this movie worth a lot of laughs and amusement. The storyline follows the four friends as they see a vile Canadian film (Terrance & Phillip: Asses of Fire) and they start using various swears and insults that were used in the film. It comes to a boiling point were they push Kyle's mom to the point of raging war, literally, on Canada.<br/><br/>There are several things that make this work. First, the obvious, classic style in which the cartoon is presented, only this time bigger, longer and uncut. Second, they turned the profanity into a show stopping musical. Who but Trey and Matt could take the counselor's catch phrase *m'kay * into a musical number, or even the *Viva Le Revolution* song. The swearing and the insults are so overdone and completely unnecessary it's funny, just funny, the whole ""raging war on Canada,"" something that is completely random but not too distant. There are points within the movie were, if it weren't for the cartoon feel, it could have been a serious drama or horror.<br/><br/>Also, they took the old cut-out felt and reworked it into more detailed backgrounds and the use of computer generated backgrounds and creaters. The fact that Americans consider anything that happens to celebrities a National Tragedy such as, in the movie, Canada bombs the Baldwin Brothers and the Nation is in shock. The relationships that the characters have with each other are priceless. The homosexual relation that Satan and Saddam have is hysterical and the ""kid-next-door-love"" that Stan has for Wendy is something we can all relate to. The songs, I can't stop bragging about, are very intoxicating. For example: ""Blame Canada,"" ""Mountain Town,"" ""Hell Isn't Good,"" ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" and ""La Resistance."" <br/><br/>The satire is priceless. That is pretty much the whole movie, satire piled on satire, but what also makes this movie is that, like every other South Park episode, there is a theme that everyone can learn from. It teaches real-life lessons that kids and adults can learn from, however, the kids can learn it from someplace else. I recommend this movie to those who seek brilliant humor and potty humor, but those who are too uptight for this movie, stay way from it. I enjoyed it immensity and I don't usually go for movies like this."
"dbdumonteil","8","3","3","7 July 2006"," so gross, so extravagant, so enjoyable
","For the ones who have never heard about the cult series ""South Park"" and if you don't know what you're going to watch, don't expect a product from the Disney firm! On the other hand, if you're familiar with this series which was extremely popular at the dusk of the nineties in the USA but also in France, then you're going to be rejoiced by its contents. I must admit that before watching this black diamond, I had watched some installments of ""South Park"" and was both deeply amused and shocked.<br/><br/>So, in the wake of the triumph of the series, its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone could only produce its movie and one thing is sure: they must have had a tremendous time penning it and the amount is highly exhilarating. Just have a look at the wacky and a little join-the-dots story (the second epithet is not meant pejoratively). Cartman, Stan, Kyle and the ill-fated Kenny managed to go to the movies to watch a film rated ""R"" because it's filled with filthy language and coarse actions. This screening had a big influence on them and reproduce this language to their pals. As it was expected, their parents and especially their mothers are scandalized. An organization of meetings, discussions could lead to the death sentence of Terrence and Philip but also to a world war. It's all the more serious as the devil flanked by his egoistic lover Saddam Hussein contemplates to conquer and dominate the whole world.<br/><br/>This summary of the story is incomplete. It would take a few more paragraphs to assess its contents. But it's nearly a mainspring for the authors of the series to deliver a scathing critic of the puritan, right-thinking America ready to behave in a reactionary way when their values, customs are challenged. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone have more than one string to their bows. Why not letting the faults, sickening aspects of America show through? And the targets are numerous, either it is for instance the army or the American families, institutions. It's partly on these points that ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" draws a devastating strength. But it would be nearly a crime to pass over in silence what makes this animation film both so gross and so enjoyable: filthy language galore, black humor as one could wish (""Kenny we have replaced your heart with a potato!""), a story which becomes more and more extravagant and I wonder whether the sequence when a doctor announces he has found a treatment to stop children to tell swearwords and experiences it on poor Cartman isn't a spoof of ""a Clockwork Orange"" (1971)...<br/><br/>The authors' intentions were perfectly fulfilled with this film. Here willing intentions gave a highly rumbustious, exquisitely offending gem which won't cater for all tastes. The viewers who hate being shocked, you'd better turn away from it and I wouldn't recommend the film to children at all or otherwise as Parker and Stone said: ""parents have to decide themselves whether their children are mature enough to watch the film""."

I was constantly distracted trying to get him to keep quiet and also continually returning to the candy stand for him.

I wasn't a big fan of the show, I watched it occasionally, but this was a little better.<br/><br/>I think that it is amazing at how Parker and Stone do the voices of the many, many, characters.

"quixoboy","Null","3","3","4 September 2003"," A masterwork of obscene satire and musical animation
","First of all, let me just get something out of the way here, and set it absolutely straight before I begin: Ever since mid-August of 1997 (and probably until around early 2000), I was an unnervingly obsessed fan of the phenomenal TV milestone that was Comedy Central's animated series, ""South Park"". As it premiered in that actual month (August '97), you could say I was with that show from virtually the beginning. Since I had never seen anything like it before, what with its weird construction-paper-cutout animation and unconventional dark humour, I felt I had found the perfect new cartoon to help cope with the fallout from my equally short-lived ""Beavis & Butt-head"" phase just a few months prior.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to around December of 1998 - the time I became aware of a fact that, at the time, seemed FAR too good to be true: There was going to be a ""South Park"" MOVIE!!! You have no idea how wonderful this was to me...and after I downloaded the few teaser trailers (the ones that solemnly started off with scenes of high-tech computer animation before shifting to Cartman's likeness), the taste of anticipation was rising furiously. I can say with 100% assurance that I have never, EVER, at any moment in my life before (or since) anticipated a movie more than I was anticipating ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"". It seemed appropriate enough that the film would be released in the summer of 1999 - the exact period when my obsession with ""South Park"" was at its highest peak! Of course, nothing could ever top that historical moment (at least from my experience) of walking into the theatre with my dad on opening night (naturally!) and finally watching those lights dim to prepare us for a sick, twisted, epic journey unlike anything we would ever see!<br/><br/>At first, like most other hardcore fans, I was shocked initially when news broke that the ""South Park"" movie was going to be done in the style of - ""gasp"" - a MUSICAL! As a matter of fact, for a brief moment I was actually doubting the success of this ambitious project...It certainly had the potential to accentuate the show's sudden leap onto the big-screen format. Still, the question was: Would good ol' Trey and Matt pull it off? I wasn't really surprised when I immediately bought the soundtrack upon its release a while before the film's release; by the time I heard the first track's lilting opening Disney-esque score I had forgotten for a second that I was about to listen to something that could be considered about as ANTI-Disney as one can get! Nevertheless, one couldn't deny the impressive fervor with which the composers/orchestra lampooned such generic animated musical stylings. It obviously made me look forward to the film even more...and boy, did the wait ever pay off! I can't say I've had a more memorable, exciting, and just plain good ol' time at the movies! Even my dad (whom I don't think knew much about the show) was chuckling every so often, making me think he was rather enjoying the offensive chaos - although by its end, and our exit from the theatre, there was actually not a word that was exchanged between us until we got to the car. (I guess he didn't enjoy it as much as I thought) The fact of the matter was, however, that I had finally seen something I had considered to be a golden entry into the annals of film history! Even better was the unexpected critical acclaim that was being showered all over this film, praising it for its refreshingly shocking humour, razor-sharp wit, and merciless satire of everything from Canadians to Conan O'Brien! I was very pleased to see that others shared my strong opinion that this film was - in its own unique, special way - a true masterpiece. Filled with showstopping larger-than-life musical numbers, beautifully ""evolved"" animation (by comparison to the show at the time - I was shocked, SHOCKED, to actually see the children's feet moving when they walked!!), and of course, a record-breaking number of profanities/offensive images, ""South Park: BLU"" is one for the ages. Call my taste questionable if you must, but I am (and always will be) an unabashed admirer of such an outrageously fun show, that I never thought could ever follow up to such cinematic success (it didn't). ""South Park"", as a show and ESPECIALLY as a movie adaptation, has done wonders with influencing my sense of humour, as well as some of my own views of the world and celebrity culture (whether that's for better or for worse is left open for interpretation). It's one of my favourite films of all time, and that will never change.<br/><br/>VIVA ""LA RESISTANCE""!!!"

The movie, on the other hand, is very well executed.  For obvious reasons, the media lumps South Park in with all the so-called ""gross out"" comedies, but there is a detail to craftsmanship here that is easy to overlook . . . things like good comic timing, good parody (I'm thinking primarily of the songs here), a whole range of funny bit players, all well-realized, etc.  And, while the movie can be quite offensive, it is never mean-spirited (rule #1: if you're going to offend somebody, best offend everybody).  While it may be tempting to read too much into the social commentary of the film (on that level, the movie is shallow & banal), the commentary nevertheless provides a framework for Parker & Stone to riff on.  While this isn't Duck Soup or Dr Strangelove, it still is a cut above ""gross out"" movie status (especially Something About Mary, a movie I deplore).<br/><br/>Interesting side note: I saw this movie the week it opened.  There had already been a substantial amount of publicity surrounding the obscenity, coupled with the national crackdown on ids for R-rated movies.  I was carded when I bought the tickets, which was a little strange, considering I'm 38 years old, and the person checking my id was maybe 16.  I look a little young for my age, but not even close to 17.  The woman who went to the movie with me neglected to bring her id (she's 29; she didn't figure she'd need it).  The ticket taker wasn't going to allow her into the theater until I volunteered that I was her legal guardian.  The manager was called; she said ""it was highly unlikely"" that I was this woman's legal guardian.  I very politely pointed out that it was as likely as the woman being under 17 in the first place.  The manager finally decided to let us both in, making clear that she was risking her job to do so.  That was the first time I had been carded for a movie in 17 years . . . ."

It's not long before all parents discover the effects and start a war between America and Canada. This film has a record of 399 profane words, but that isn't important, it is one of the most hilarious comedy musicals I have ever seen. With guest voices of George Clooney, Eric Idle and King of the Hill creator Mike Judge. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Blame Canada"". It was number 5 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and along with the TV series, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very, very good!"

","Come on, people who thought this movie was bad are taking it too seriously. This movie is so funny ! it shows the fact that swearing is funny, well its only funny if south park does it. awesome movie. it had a classic offensive plot and this time making fun of Canadians as potty heads. ahem, Terrance and Phillip... so basically, the 4 boys watch the Terrance and Phillip movie which is very rude yet hilarious, so after they watch it they become vulgar mouths and the south park parents are very angry and rages a war against Canada for making children become potty mouths. and the great factor is that the plot was used so well and the climax is just jaw dropping. the musical is very fun and lots of fun to sing with it. And the very impressive event is that they explore the characters really well in the movie. Like Satan, Saddam Hussein. Warning this film is highly racist,vulgar, adult and graphic. Come on Matt and trey make a second one !!!"
"Tweekums","9","2","2","31 July 2009"," Very funny... Very crude
","First off I must warn anybody thinking of watching this film, it contains quite a lot of material that many people would find offensive... that said if you aren't offended you will probably be in hysterics as it is very funny. If you are familiar with the television series you will be familiar with the crude style of the animation, although if you have only seen the later episodes this may seem cruder.<br/><br/>The film starts with the four boys going to the cinema to watch the ""Terrance and Philip"" movie, an R-rated film from Canada. Unlike their television programme their film is full of swearing and when the boys come out they are all swearing like troopers. Soon all the children in South Park seem to have seen it and are swearing in class. When their mother's are told Kyle's mother decides that something must be done and that something is to arrest Terrance and Philip and begin hostilities against Canada. While this is going on Kenny has more serious problems; after copying a stunt from the film he dies and ends up in Hell where he learns that if the US goes ahead with its plans to execute Terrance and Philip Satan and his gay lover, Saddam Hussein, will take over the world.<br/><br/>Unlike the television series this film is a musical; the songs are actually rather good, not just the comedy lyrics, they have good tunes too. The comedy isn't only crude it is also a fairly biting satire about censorship in the US where a few naughty words are considered more offensive than acts of violence. <br/><br/>I'd recommend this film to any adult who isn't easily offended and likes a good laugh, just don't assume that because it is animated it must be suitable for children; Disney this is not."
"DarthVoorhees","9","2","2","26 April 2009"," ""Now Now,You can still see fart jokes on Nickelodeon""
","South Park is both morbidly sick and full of toilet humor but this is to the film's credit and not to its fault, the film is actually very intelligent and hilarious. You can call South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone sick but you can't say they are stupid. South Park is a commentary piece beneath everything about censorship and freedom of speech. It's no secret that Parker and Stone have had trouble with the M.P.A.A passing their projects for R ratings. In a lot of ways the characters of Terrence and Philip represent themselves, two comedians who love fart humor being persecuted for their product. The funny thing is that Terrence and Philip is so outlandishly stupid on purpose, the entire movie, Asses of Fire, consists of the characters in front of a couch cracking fart jokes at the other's expense. The parents in South Park would rather rally around a cause with media attention than have a one to one with their boys. In the end that is what our protagonist Kyle really wants. The argument here is well done. What Parker and Stone are doing is putting a mirror on the hypocrisies of America's conception of the media. The Canadian Ambassador of the Arts loudly exclaims. ""The United States has graphic violence on television all the time. We can't believe that a movie with some foul language would pi$$ you off so much."" Parker and Stone make a point of this by staging a horribly grim cartoon battle between the Canadians and the United States. It's funny to see these poorly animated construction paper characters engaged in so much carnage. If Parker and Stone attempted to do their battle in a live action film there would be enough blood and gore to make your stomach churn. The film's satire can be summed up with Shelia's address to the US troops. ""Just remember what the MPAA says: ""Horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words."" That is what this war is all about!""<br/><br/>South Park has another very high strength, its music. The picture is a musical-comedy in every sense of the world. South Park creator Trey Parker majored in music and is an experienced musician and he knows how to stage a musical utilizing these cartoon characters. The film was even recognized with an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Parker doesn't have to stage his musicals like the traditional one but he does so to both pay tribute to them and butcher them in a parody. My particular favorite number of the picture is ""Up There"" affectionately sung by Satan who reminisces about finding acceptance on the Earth above. This number could easily be placed in any Walt Disney film both in its lyrics and its animation. The brilliance of the number though is that we have Satan, who is by all means a villain, singing a blatant rip off of a number from ""The Little Mermaid"". Parker stages his numbers brilliantly each time and each of them displays the eccentricities of the overly loud musical productions. We have the montage, animated over the top set pieces, dance numbers in the background with dozens of characters. The climax of their musical parody is when the uplifting grand finale ends with an Orca whale jumping over a rainbow. Yeah it's silly but it parodies the fact that so many musicals ask us to suspend our disbelief. The parody is a loving one though. None of these numbers are parodied or showcased just to make them look silly or stupid or the sake of doing so. The songs are clever and have a bite to them as well as make you laugh. I also appreciated the fact that each song represents the character singing it. A problem I have noticed with the musicals is that the songs are more articulate than the character singing them. South Park doesn't make this mistake. The foul mouthed little spoiled brat Cartman has a grand number summing up the kid's frustration, ""Kyle's Mom is a B***h"".<br/><br/>In the end I liked the film, maybe even loved it, but it isn't without its flaws. Trey Parker and Matt Stone expose their audience to a lot of filth. They are walking on a thin wire making a picture centered on such obscene jokes. I was able to appreciate them because I have followed their work and consider myself to be a huge fan but South Park isn't for every audience. Trey and Matt acknowledge that in the film and ask their critiques to rate them on content and not toilet humor. Well sometimes the toilet humor and content are so intertwined this becomes impossible. The character of Saddam Hussein is a prime example of this. I understand what they were going for but instead of being edgy in a good way it just becomes way over the top. The character does have a few laughs but I imagine anyone who wasn't a South Park fan cringed at some of his jokes, I'm a huge South Park fan and even I did.<br/><br/>Overall though, I would recommend South Park to those who can appreciate the humor. It requires an acquired taste but it provides a lot of laughs if you sit through it. If you can understand South Park for what it is, you will see a very funny film ripe with intelligent satire."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","2","2","8 October 2008"," Absolutely hilarious, one of the few big-screen TV adaptations which do the original series justice
","One of precious few truly great adaptations of television series for the big screen, ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is an inspired theatrical translation of the glorious satirical television show created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Given the freedom of a feature film the writers create something which justifies a theatrical release based on its scale and storyline, but which also avoids (until the last ten minutes, at least) the sort of bloat and/or dumbing-down which is usually the result of a theatrical film version of a TV show, see ""The X Files"" or ""The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse"".<br/><br/>""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is a strikingly, uproariously hilarious satirical take on the MPAA rating system, parents' media watchdog groups, Canadian-American relations (okay, so this part isn't so much a satirical take as a bunch of well-written Canada jokes which, as a Canadian, are absolutely hysterical), ""Les Miserables"", the controversial nature of ""South Park"" as a television series, and warmongering in general. Like the television show it manages to be political but completely irreverent and uninterested in expressing any form of liking or support for either end of the political spectrum. <br/><br/>The musical numbers are the most memorable and inspired sections of the film, particularly ""Uncle F-cka"", ""Blame Canada"", and ""It's Easy, M'Kay"". The only musical numbers that don't work are the two relatively short ones by Satan, although his beau Saddam gets a really good one here in ""I Can Change"". Actually, the film would have been perfect had it not included the really unfunny sub-plot with Satan and Saddam. It fits with how cheerfully offensive the movie in general is, but it's just unfunny. These scenes, and the bloated ending (which goes from tolerable to bad when Saddam and Satan show up) are the only problematic scenes in the whole movie, the rest of which is just perfect. <br/><br/>Sure, it's rude, crude, offensive to some, and jam-packed with profanity, but ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is also, much like the best episodes of ""South Park"", genuinely funny, intelligent, and perceptive, and it has a lot to say. It's brilliant, brilliant comedy.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Zombie-Kermit","9","2","2","23 May 2008"," Possibly the Funniest Comedy Ever
","I can't say that for sure, since I haven't seen every comedy. But I would definitely say that it's one of my favourites. The transition from a television show to a movie is not an easy one. This is one movie that got it right in every aspect. The movie doesn't come across as a long episode or anything. It comes across as a movie. It's probably the movie I can watch the most without getting bored of it.<br/><br/>It's got a good (and of course ridiculous) plot. America takes Canadian comedians Terrence and Phillip hostage for making a smutty movie, which all the kids saw and picked up bad habits from. If they get executed, Satan and his gay lover Sadam Hussein will be able to take over the world. South Park Humour at its best. And the songs are just fantastically funny. And not just funny but very catchy as well.<br/><br/>The movie basically pokes fun at many different things. It pokes fun at the way things get blown way out of proportion. It pokes jun at how uptight people are about smutty stuff, yet violence is no big deal. And of course there are the gay jokes about Sadam. And if I'm right it's also poking fun at the way America sees other nations. I'm sure many people find this movie offensive, but it's all just good fun.<br/><br/>Heaps of the characters had great lines in this movie, especially the evil Cartman. Of course he doesn't fail us in the movie. He offers us plenty of awesome lines every minute. The movie is packed with plenty of unnecessary swearing, and rude jokes, and that's all part of the fun.<br/><br/>A great aspect of the movie is that it didn't rip us off with the main characters. Each one of the four had their own story going on through the movie. I won't say Cartman's as it may give away more than you want to know, but Stan is struggling to win Wendy's heart again after a new, more sophisticated boy comes to town and rivals him for her affections. Kyle struggles with standing up to his overbearing (to say the least) mother. And Kenny has his own problems even after death. (Yes Kenny dies, big shock there.)<br/><br/>I would also like to talk about the animation. It is the best badly animated movie around. It is sort of hard to explain, but I will try. The movie is drawn very crudely, yet it's done with great animation, especially in certain scenes. I would also like to comment on how awesome it looks during the entering of hell scene.<br/><br/>So in closing, this is an awesome movie that every fan must see. Even if you aren't a fan I would recommend this to you. Well maybe not if you don't like the humour in the show, but if you haven't seen it, it's a great example of South Park style comedy, and I think it serves as an instant fan creator. I don't think any fan will be disappointed with this movie. It's just everything you could hope for and more. (To use a tired old phrase.)<br/><br/>10/10"
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","2","13 May 2008"," A brilliant satire, but also an honest comment on parental responsibility, censorship, and morality.
","Stan, Kyle, Ike, Eric, and Kenny all go to an R rated film which is an adaptation of their favorite show, a crude humor filled Canadian skit comedy called TERRANCE AND PHILIP. Upon leaving, they imitate the language in the film, prompting their parents to react in surprisingly shocking ways. They start the MAC(Mothers Against Canada) before getting president Clinton involved along with talk show host Conan O'Brian before arresting Terrence and Philip and putting all Canadian-American citizens into special Concentration camps. Canada decides to act upon this and thus a gory war on Canada is declared. The boys realize that it's up to them to fix things before Satan takes over the world as soon as Terrence and Philip are executed. The fact that this film is animated is what makes it funny and ironic. In a way, the film is making a comment on itself and it's source material. The fact that the film has something very relevant to say about first amendment rights is what makes it daring and worth seeing. I do not know of any other film that does this. The originality of the concept really helps it define it's ability to be watchable. I consider the show, SOUTH PARK, to be one of the most brilliant and funniest television shows to come around for a while. This film not only pushes the idea of the show in a direction that makes sense, but it also takes into consideration the feedback the show gets for it's language and subject matter. Everything about this film is pretty perverse. Anybody can figure that out by just the title, SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT. When it was in theaters, a lot of people I knew who had no idea what the show was just assumed that it was a pornographic film. Indeed, there were times in the film in which the content was pushed a little too far. However, the show does this to me almost all of the time. What makes the show really special to me is that it actually bothers to challenge me and what I can handle in a way that works because it is animated. There are times when the show is really hilarious and over-the-top, and there are times when it actually challenges the viewer to laugh. There are times on the show in which there are genuinely emotional moments and times where there is heartless cruelty. This film is no different. The character of Eric Cartman has to deal with a V-chip that is surgically implanted into his head that caused him to get shocked when he swears. Stan is in love with a girl in his class who he can't have. Kyle's mother is the woman who starts the coalition against Canada and is forced to deal with the embarrassment of that and has to protect his adopted younger brother Ike as he is Canadian. These plights in this movie are treated with more sincerity and respect than they probably ever would in another movie. To help push things along and add even more emotion, there are also musical segments. The film is a musical and the songs in them are fantastic. This film has one of the better soundtracks of the last ten years. This film will always hold a special place in my heart. Nine years later, it is still amazing and funny as hell. Definitely check this one out if you haven't yet."

","Spooky seeing South Park today, what a prescient, insightful film.<br/><br/>Jump on board. Sing our song. That's the way politics are made.<br/><br/>It shows high artistic standards to use the form of a film, a musical in this case, for the message of a film, very good structural thinking there. Although the spectrum of the film is limited, concentrating on a social codex that could be called hypocritical, it's almost an uninterrupted joyride thanks to a sufficiently short running time on the one hand and a sufficiently over the top story development on the other. I counted just one lame scene, the emergency room.<br/><br/>The criticism is of course both correct and necessary, just by cheering your own position you'll never get something akin to dialogue.

","Before I review this movie, answer this question: Are you offended in anyway by swearing, including the f word? If you've answered no, then keep reading. This is one of the funniest movies ever made.<br/><br/>While the film does contain quite possibly every swear word you can think of, it's still a great film, with hilarious musical numbers and brilliant moments.<br/><br/>One thing I love about this movie is Marc Shaiman's score. I love how it's composed not like a comedy, which is what this film is. Some of the best moments are because of the music. Of course, there's the hilarious musical numbers that will stay in your head for some time!

"Aberrmen","10","2","2","13 December 2005"," One of the Most Misunderstood Movies, Ever
","This, along with the TV show, is probably one of the most misunderstood pieces of film in recent history. Receiving a lot of undeserved criticism as being a show simply based on ""fart jokes"", people seem to easily forget how many other pieces of classic literature contain similar raunchy material to help audiences swallow their moral message (i.e. Jonathan Swift, Geoffrey Chaucer). If you find this film extremely offensive and unfunny you need to step back and try to appreciate the absurdity of it that truly makes it great. South Park (and Team America in parts) both are brilliant satyrs of extremes in society and censorship. The film simply emphasizes the need to look at things in life with a grain of salt, much in the same way people should look at the movie. When people lose there sense of humor, people lose it (or start a war with Canada). There are also a bunch of critiques on responsibility in society and censorship but I'll try to keep this relatively short. In closing, The film is hilarious, the songs are great (Yeah, it's a musical), and the messages are pretty interesting if not valuable lessons, on at least some level or another. Keep in mind, this movie is not for children, it is very vulgar, and they wouldn't understand the true point anyway (as the movie actually shows in its plot). **** of **** stars."
"talkjawking100","10","2","2","24 September 2005"," The Number One Comedy EVER!!!
","Who cares it's violent? Who cares it's offensive? Who cares every other word is the 'f' word or the 's' word? This movie is about three things: 1, to stand up for censorship and the fact that we shouldn't take so seriously. 2, to show parents that they need to worry more about what their kids know and learn rather then worry about what they're watching. And, 3, to LAUGH and HAVE A GOOD TIME! <br/><br/>1: Censorship has it's ups and it's downs. It's ups are that people are comfortable with watching censored shows so they won't get offended. It's downs are when it is taken to far and people go too far with it trying to blame everybody and everything...everyone except themselves. That is what is shown that is wrong with our country. We see something as insignificant as this, and if given the chance, we would seriously start a war rather than take the blame. We've gone into a world where America is never wrong, when in fact, it has about a million more things wrong with it than it does right. Also, this movie deals with censorship in language more than anything else (that's why it swears so much, so people can realize that 'hey, these are just WORDS. Words don't hurt!') Because that's exactly it. Words don't hurt. But violence and some graphic sensuality is seen on TV all the time. Recently, I saw a movie on TV that was edited down, so we didn't hear the 'f' or 's' word, but we still saw a guy's head being cut off. That's right, a guy's HEAD being CUT OFF. Uncensored. But thank God our kids didn't hear the bad words. What's good about this movie is that the parents realized that the deaths and violence in the war they caused was way worse than their kids hearing some naughty words and profanity/vulgarity. Unfortunately, in today's world, parents will never learn.<br/><br/>2: Parents need to worry about being parents. Not fighters. That is what Kyle is talking about in the end. What he says isn't just about him and his mom, it's about every kid in the world and every mom in the world. Particularly in America. If kids are watching bad shows or R-rated movies, than it's up to parents to tell them what's right or wrong and decide if the kids should watch these things. Not go so far as to suing or fighting the creators of the bad shows. You can't just shield all bad programs from kids and expect them to all understand it when they're 18. Basically, you need to start small and end big. Show them G-rated programs and Nick Jr. cartoons until about 6 or 7. Then start with PG movies. These movies have very little offensive material, and it starts small so it can build up to PG-13. Kids will ask ""what does 'damn' mean"" or ""why did they hit each other"" and you, as parents, explain. Then they understand what they mean and whether they are good or bad. Then, around 10 or 11 you can start with PG-13, with a lot more subjectional material. Slowly, they begin to build with what they feel is right or wrong and understanding it all. And then when they can start watching R-rated movies, they are all different, so pick certain ones and build from there (however, the South Park movie, Team America, and similar movies can wait till the end). Then, when they are 18, they will know what their parents consider wrong and right and can build their own opinions on wrong and right and decide how they want it to be in their own adult lives.<br/><br/>Whew. Now...<br/><br/>3: Humor. This movie is a comedy. If you can't laugh at it, then you have a very low sense of humor. But you are entitled to your opinion. But leave us fans alone. I've heard the complainers say they don't like it because of the excessive language. That is the whole point of the movie, der! To prove that language doesn't hurt us, they are just words. And if it's because it's annoying, then just ignore it. I personally didn't find the excessive language annoying, and I don't know why it can be annoying when it's used in perfect situations in this movie! Anyway, if you don't like this movie, stop wasting your time bitching about it.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this is just a movie. Don't take it seriously, and just treat it like it is. It's meant for you to have a fun time, and if you didn't then that's too bad. If you did, then that's what the creators wanted. I give this movie a 10/10. In a weird way, the most profanic cartoon in the world has taught me a lot. South Park can do that to you :)."
"tj_carlsson","7","2","2","22 December 2004"," Funny, in a crude sort of way
","But that doesn't matter because I was laughing my ass of at this movie.<br/><br/>It starts with the familiar gang (Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny) are going to see a movie based on their favourite TV-series ""Terrance and Philip"". The film is jam-packed with crude curses and crude name calling which the guys start using. This then impresses the other kids of South Park that also goes and sees the movie, all to the dismay of the mums of South Park. They form an action-group called Mums Against Canada (because that's where the film comes from) and it all escalates into World War III! As mentioned above, there's a lot of crude words in this movie, but that doesn't take away the focus from the joke, it enhances them. The story takes pretty much a big jab at these whiny people that complain about too much curses/sex/violence in TV/movies/games/music. It is somewhat ironic that to protect their kids from curse words, the Mums Against Canada go so far as rounding up every Canadian in the US and start a World War, thus exposing their kids to extreme violence.<br/><br/>It is quite a high tempo in this movie, but there are some parts that drag along for too long, mainly the Satan and Saddam gay affair which I found pretty unfunny, but otherwise it goes pretty fast.<br/><br/>The songs of the movie should get some extra credit, because there lies the most subtle and funny jokes. The songs are just amazing and I still got ""Blame Canada"" playing in my head. The songs also lift South Park the Movie to a whole different level South Park the Movie is and awesome piece of work from Parker and Stone and should be, or so I hope, an animated classic. The in your face jokes and social criticism still feel very up to date, even though the movie was made for 5 years ago. I highly recommend it, either if you want criticism of American society or just for laughs. 8/10"

The plot is stupid and so is everything else about the movie, but I love it! I was introduced to this movie when I went up to visit my friend in Canada for her birthday. I laughed so hard that I was nearly on the floor in tears! When I went back up there this last summer for a month, I watched it 4 or 5 times and I was still laughing just as hard! Now I own it and watch it all the time! Yeah, OK it has rude humor and incredibly foul language...but it's nothing I don't hear around school all the time. (I know, sad huh?) Anyway, it's a great movie and I recommend it if you don't mind being a tad offended and you don't mind gross humor...You with laugh your butt off! 8/10"

","When George Bush Senior said that America should be less like 'The Simpsons', he probably didn't mean it should be more like 'South Park', the crudely animated, and downright crude, satire of American life. 'South Park' adapts to the big screen unexpectedly well, with an outrageous, almost-coherent plot, a musical format, loads of jokes and a hilarious central idea (the U.S.A. declaring war on poor, innocuous Canada). At its best, it's almost Chris Morris-like in its ability to make serious points in the most offensive manner possible. I suspect the formula has its limits, for at times the film seems as purile as its characters Terrence and Philip, the Canadian humourists whose dirty jokes trigger the war: there's a fine line between laughing at kids who can't stop swearing, and believing that four letter words are funny per se. But viewed as a one-off, it's fresh, funny and surprisingly political, and makes 'The Simpsons' seems cosy in comparison."
"Pedro_H","7","2","2","31 October 2004"," Crude, rude and with plenty of non PC laughs.
","A set of small town preteens get their ""tiny minds"" corrupted by an unsuitable movie and trigger a series of silly events that lead to war - and perhaps even apocalypse!<br/><br/>Told by means of cheap cardboard cut-out animation with only one or two pieces of CGI.<br/><br/>There is no way anybody can summit a comedy as silly and out-there as this. You could talk about this Trey Parker film from now until Christmas, but until you have seen it you won't understand the concept or how it all hangs together - or sometimes doesn't. <br/><br/>The difference between the (same name) TV series and this film is that they take the joke further (and given that the TV series involved a talking turd - Mr Hanky - that is saying something!) and use more foul language and sexual images. This film takes the view that children using four letter words is funny - a concept only possible in a cartoon.<br/><br/>While I haven't read all the reviews most seem to take the view that it is OK to use images of children in this way or at least not to question it. I am not so sure. The crude nature of the cartoon helps of course. If this was done in the manner of the best of Disney animation - although the costs would be astronomical! - then we would hear more about it.<br/><br/>The No.1 rule of silly comedy being that there is no No.1 rule. You can go anywhere - even Hell! - and do anything. The targets are Canadians, dopey school teachers, overprotective parents, homeless people, world leaders and the off-beat folks that hang around in a ""redneck little town.""<br/><br/>For reasons that maybe have something to do with the time it was being made Saddam Hussian is taken as dead - presuming that American's thought he soon would be? - and forms a homosexual relationship with the devil. Who he runs rings around. They make a highly comic couple.<br/><br/>(The film was banned in Iraq when it came out - they even issued a statement as funny as anything on the screen! Is it now unbanned?)<br/><br/>The really interesting part of this movie is that is uses mock old time show tunes to tell the story. The juxtaposition of this style of music being used in such a crude environment works for easy laughs - although only the unbelievable Uncle F***** song stays with you afterwards. I laugh just thinking about it.<br/><br/>(Canadians Terrence and Philips might be the funniest cartoon characters of all time. Despite being the cause of all the trouble we don't see enough of them.) <br/><br/>Yes there is a bit of a South Park's Greatest Hits about the thing and famous faces crop up to have the mickey taken out of them. The part with Wyonna Ryder at the war rally was the funniest thing I have seen in years. A real jaw dropper.<br/><br/>The only thing is that it goes on too long for what it is. The laughs tend to slow down as the film draws to its silly end-of-days conclusion. It doesn't hold together as drama, but a series of scenes that are either funny or not funny. The George Clooney hospital part (voiced by the man himself) is one of the flops.<br/><br/>Let us hope they now know the joke is over and we don't have a South Park II."

","I'm really only posting this to boost the over-all rating as much as I can because pretty much everything that's can be said about this movie has been said.<br/><br/>In short, it was brilliant in both the story plot, the humor, the music, and really in every way except the blood. I thought the gore was unnecessary, but the profanity was no big deal. It was, after-all, the point of the movie.<br/><br/>Personally I find it interesting how they calmed down the main characters for the movie.

","If you need to laugh, then this is the movie for you.  Not being a MASSIVE fan of the South Park series, I didn't really follow the progress of this film, nor did I get excited about it when I heard it was in production.  A mate came up to me and said, ""Lets go see the South Park Movie tomorrow."" I agreed.  I did not know what to expect, but as soon as the Warner bros logo dissapeared and we were left with a crappy cardboard cut out of a mountain, I laughed till the end.  This film needs to be congratulated.  The way it offends EVERYONE.  Not just some groups, ALL Groups!  Especially the way it takes on Disney with all the musical numbers included.  The lyrics to most songs, you will be humming to yourself for weeks to come.<br/><br/>
The plot is very basic, just like the animation. the 4 boys sneak into an R rated film featuring their favourite actors.  Afterwards, they start swearing in the most offensive ways possible.  The parents blame Canada, and hence a war is started between the two countries.<br/><br/>The film takes a look at how our ratings system is going down hill, and how parents don't care about ratings.  They just care about how the film could be banned from being released.  I think it has an important message with regards to this ratings war, which is always going on.<br/><br/>To create an animated film is very difficult.  To create an animated film from a television series, and actually have it work is even more difficult. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a great job.  I am a HUGE Simpsons fan, and even I don't believe a Simpsons Movie could top this.  Definitley one of the best animated comedies in a long time, that will continue to be critically acclaimed."

","This is a great animated film that has so many levels. One of one it is a laugh out loud funny collage of sick humor which we all like. On the other it is a laugh out loud funny look at society. And it is also everything else in between.<br/><br/>It is hard to explain, but the South Park characters pretty much have to save the world. A war between The USA and Canada erupts and Satan decides it is a good time to catch the world off guard so he launches his armies. The result is pure genius. <br/><br/>The only let down is that it can grow a bit tedious at time since there is so much coming at you. But overall this is a definite must see. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for non-stop profane/vulgar content"
"movieguy1021","7","2","2","5 July 2003"," South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut: 7/10
","Most TV shows that are made into movies usually suck. However, every once in a while, a TV show-movie comes along that has fans awe-struck, and that's what South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is. If you love the series, you'll love the movie. If you're like me and enjoy the show but don't find it hilarious, that's the same as what you'll think of the movie. If you think it's deplorable for its language and curse anyone who watches, wellÂ…stay away from this movie.<br/><br/>Surprisingly short and entertaining, it's also surprisingly a musical. Although it boasts famous songs like `Blame Canada' and `Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B**ch', they're all basically the same. They are, however, memorable and unexpected. I don't religiously watch the show, but occasionally I do and have a laugh at it. It's basically what you'd expect from a 30-minute crudely animated TV show. It's a fast-paced movie that has four kids from South Park, Colorado, who try to stop the United States from waging war against Canada. In it is childhood love, Conan O'Brian committing suicide, V-chips, and much more.<br/><br/>Paramount must have paid the Guinness World Record people a lot of money, because it holds a record for `most swearing in an animated movie'. There are 399 curse words (about 128 F-words) and 128 offensive gestures, and I saw it uncut on Comedy Central. It's probably going to make Comedy Central receive its highest ratings, but I don't really see why. It's funny at times, very funny, but it isn't consistent, and the plot moves too quickly for its own good.<br/><br/>The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who also wrote the film, voiced most of the main characters, who all sounded the same. At times, it was hard to understand what the characters were saying, but the animation was a little better than the TV series. However, nobody would care about that. All they want to do is laugh, and I think there are better movies than this to do that in, but if you see South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, you won't be disappointed, or not much.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor, and for some violent images."

It's filled with sing-along songs, constantly making fun of the Disney legacy of musicals, but the songs are smart and witty as well.<br/><br/>The funniest part of the movie simply has to be the whole German scheisse video scene which made me laugh so hard I almost dropped the glass I was holding in my hand.<br/><br/>Not quite as funny as I'd hoped it would be, but still a decent movie. 7/10"

They've managed to create a plot that's large enough to remain coherent for the length of the film, rather than just pasting vignette after vignette together haphazardly.<br/><br/>Don't analyse it - don't look for anything deep - just view it for fun, which is the spirit for which it was intended. If you do that, then you will hopefully realise that a few of the infantile jokes actually do have some kernel of meaningful social comment in them after all.<br/><br/>I revisited the TV series after seeing this film, hoping that some of the insight into the characters would help me appreciate the shorts. It didn't much at all - they're still annoying. The film stands out above the series, so put any prejudice aside, and give it a go.

"sheeleyb","10","2","2","25 April 2002"," Offended? Disturbed? Good.
","This is the first time I had ever seen a movie completely go overboard in all attempts to offend every single person on the planet. When I saw it there were too many times that I just crawled into my seat embarrassed that I was in a room filled with other people watching this. However I was also laughing my a** off so hard I couldn't breathe.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I would have loved this movie much much less if I wasn't offended. If nothing in this picture disturbs you, then you truly can't appreciate it... and you should probably also be locked up. But that's another issue.<br/><br/>Starting off with a nice standard musical number with several 'what-a-minute' lines thrown in to see if the audience is paying attention (for example, Stan's Mother's comment about Jesus), the second number was a complete turn around in-your-face use of the U.S. first amendment. And considering we're in an age where the application of the constitution is optional and often disregarded by many, (how many times do people role their eyes in real life when someone says ""It's my first/fifth/second/fourteenth/nineteenth amendment right!"") this is one of the most important films to come out in a while.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm serious.<br/><br/>Many times we have movies attempt to defend a viewpoint of American rights (and the importance of freedom of speech for everyone in general). The great thing with this satire is that it uses the rights it is trying to defend to the fullest. And by using the ridiculous (for example using Canada as the scapegoat when the real-life scapegoat is Hollywood) it attracts a larger audience and entertains while trying to get the message across.<br/><br/>
Parker and Stone have proven to me to be the greatest satirists in a long while. I might not agree with all of their opinions on issues, but they are extraordinarily skilled in delivering the ideas forward with the grace and elegance of a 2x4 to the back of a head.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that this movie had to be tortured by one of the greatest anti-free speech organizations in America (the MPAA). Maybe they were able to turn this into a better picture due to attempts to trick them and show how moronic the MPAA is, but many other movies have been more hurt or destroyed by the interference from the organization this movie criticizes so heavily. I hope another South Park movie is made, or at least another Stone+Parker film with this level of satire. Because when these people can say what they want to, then I know that all of my own thoughts and ideas are safe for expression without government reprisal.<br/><br/>*SPOILER-ISH WARNING* By the way, I would like to thank the two of them for the scene with Bill Gates.

","Don't let the South Park reputation as a shock-cartoon fool you. Like the TV series, only more so, this is a very astute attack on political and social ""standards"" in the States and beyond. It might be disguised (as one IMDB reviewer puts it) as ""mindless entertainment"" to draw in the crowds, but this is anything but mindless. Targets of bigotry, prejudice, and the dominant social and political order are hit with unerring accuracy; this isn't like 'Wag the Dog'; it's closer in spirit and style to Lindsay Anderson's ""Britannia Hospital"". Amazingly, its constant assaults on its targets aren't scattershot but are part of a coherent point of view.<br/><br/>
That position is perhaps a little too radical for an audience that wants only to see the latest ""Beavis and Butthead"" incarnation. Alot of the gags could I guess go by without notice. So watch carefully, think about this as more than just some exploiting cartoon. As I said - don't be fooled. Trey Parker is a subtle filmmaker despite the sledgehammer he can use at times.<br/><br/>The targets hit are many and varied, and even those who might be expected to be part of the ""resistance"" to the powers that be are mercilessly - but, importantly, accurately, satirised.<br/><br/>A small example.

For the people who will watch it and tut, or turn off, or merely be morally outraged by 8 year olds swearing and farting and generally being rude and abusive to anyone they want including each other, then either a) don't watch it again and shut up so the rest of us can enjoy it, or b) get a sense of humour. I am not blinkered enough to realise that this film will not appeal to all whom by it is viewed.  But at least I have enough of an open mind to admit that.  For people who would brand this movie a disgrace (and I have heard a few), please don't be so self-consciously narrow minded as to ignore the fact that it brings pleasure to many others. If I understand the film, of which I do to a basic level at least, it was not designed to be serious, realistic or politically hard hitting.  What isn't funny about a foul mouthed boy getting a chip implanted in his brain which shocks him everytime he swears, which he did often due to a movie he had recently watched, which had pretty much directly resulted in one of his best friends burning himself to death (almost) to try to win $100 of said boy? Comic scenario or what.  AND ALL A BIT OF FUN. Thank you Trey and Matt, but the hard part is trying to eclipse it in South Park: Even Bigger, Even Longer and Still Uncut.

"BenGW1","10","2","2","25 September 2001"," Takes incredible risks of comedy and even music, and they all pay off
","The SOUTH PARK was the best entry from the ""summer of comedy"" in 1999, when films like AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, BIG DADDY, AMERICAN PIE, NOTTING HILL, RUNAWAY BRIDE, even WILD WILD WEST all earned huge earnings. Some of those films are good, some are really bad (I'm not going to say which, guess if you want to) but none are in the class of SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER & UNCUT. For a lot of reasons, this is a remarkable movie.<br/><br/>One thing that impressed the hell out of me upon repeated viewing of this movie was the mammoth percentage of jokes that were hilarious. I'd guess-timate there were something like 400 jokes in this film over its short running time--dialogue, visual gags, the song numbers--and there were very few jokes were I wasn't laughing and (sometimes) smiling. Considering how much humor Trey Parker & Matt Stone jammed into this film, it's really amazing how much of it is side-splittingly funny and intelligent, as well.<br/><br/>
That's another thing that I was quietly amazed at: this is a very smart, very perceptive film disguised as an all-time shock and obscenities comedy. It shows better than almost any drama I've ever seen how people can go from understandably reacting to a situation to completely overreacting and end up doing more harm than good. Take Kyle's mom, for example. Is what she does here wrong? By the end, yes, she's gone berserk. But is she wrong to be concerned about the way her child is behaving, about the influences on them? No, because those influences aren't going to be good for Kyle, Stan, or Cartman either. Kyle put it best when he asked his mom not to punish anyone but himself when he does something bad. The sense of self-responsibility for one's actions is a powerful message and it's awesome to see it embedded in an all-out comedy.<br/><br/>Add to that the musical numbers, which are raunchy, off-the-wall, and the funniest things in the movie. My favorites were ""Uncle F---a"", ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"", and the ""La Resistance"" marathon number. The only song that isn't great is Satan's rendition of ""Up There"". It was funny but made points about his desires to be a regular, happy gay man that the film had already expressed. All the other songs were incredible, and if Trey Parker wants a career on Broadway, on the basis of the work here he'll have one.<br/><br/>It's said there are greater rewards for greater risks. This movie could have been a watered-down disappointment for loyal fans of the show (like myself) or it could have been an experiment in shock value that didn't keep the elements that make the show great and then didn't translate into a feature-length film, either. What ultimately came about was one of the funniest films ever made, and one of the smartest. It worked on every level it aimed at. 10/10."

But South Park has a section for itself, and this makes this movie a must-see in all aspects. A hit for everyone who's willing to accept it with a smile. My favorite is the relationship between Satan and Saddam Hussein: genius! the musical bits (and the satire to musical bits in movies) give it a fresh look and prevent the viewer from seeing a hour-and-a-half-long episode. A great movie, with a sense of humor which nothing else has, and original-to-the-end gags and lines.<br/><br/>And for every kid who puts the ""cute"" main characters in their Nokias or their wallpapers: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS - WATCH IT WHEN YOU'RE 18."

","I was a little worried before I went that South Park couldn't<br/><br/>take the transformation into a full-time movie. But it could. As a Swede - you know how slutty we are! :) - I've always found<br/><br/>the American Redneck values and the moral aspects of film<br/><br/>censoring a bit confusing. People have sex. Big deal. People say<br/><br/>nasty things. Big deal again. Since when did words hurt anyone?<br/><br/>The worst thing that could happen is that the kids start using<br/><br/>the words themselves. Scary. South Park as a phenomenon fights the lying, oversweet ""7th<br/><br/>Heaven"" way to look at kids. Stan's song in the beginning of the<br/><br/>film is hilarious in its parody of musicals. (I love musicals.<br/><br/>I'm also quite fond of Winona and at least one of the Baldwins.<br/><br/>That only makes it funnier.) When Kyle's mom is ready to keep up a bloody war and let Satan<br/><br/>and Saddam take over the world rather than let the f-word sayers<br/><br/>Terrance and Phillip go free, her son in a simple speech tells<br/><br/>her what the film is all about. It's smart. It's true. It's<br/><br/>dangerously close to sentimental all-American apple sauce.<br/><br/>Kyle's mom listens - and kills T&P anyway. The point with this show is a lot like the animation: it may<br/><br/>look crude, but if you take a good look at it you find it's a<br/><br/>lot neater and harder to do than impersonal disneyfications or<br/><br/>detailed fantasy book illustrations. Part of me has seen this film the way an over-intellectual<br/><br/>college student should. But part of me can't deny that ""Unca<br/><br/>f***a"" made me laugh 'til I almost cried.

The cracks, the singing numbers (M'kay), and the eyebrow raising humor just add to the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Since most of the jokes did not have the traditional set-up/punchline format, I embarrassingly found myself being the only one in the theatre laughing through much of the movie.<br/><br/>Best of all, the movie really does present a relatively accurate microcosm of American ignorance and intolerance as well as the -soon to be- trademark humor of *the next generation*. The messages of the irony of American Freedom of Speech is also a focus of the movie (if you could claim it to have focus). Overall, it was a funny, abrasive comedy that will keep you laughing again and again.<br/><br/>This will be the movie I'll show my children when they get old enough to ask, ""What was your childhood like daddy?"" -If they can handle it (but I think we all know that, by then, they will be desensitized well past the extremes of this movie)."

The whole theatre was singing and clapping along when Cartman was singing ""the bitch song"" which made it an even better experience.

It is absolutely hysterical, with most of the humor being found in that they know not what they say, yet they are emulating their heroes and are thus happy. This is a stinging satire of the state of affairs in many homes across the US. Some of the language is iffy and made me feel that this should have been an NC-17 movie.<br/><br/>However, with all the singing, you might think you wandered into a very crude Broadway play.

","I have been a longtime fan of the controversial TV show South Park, and I went to see the feature-length movie the first night it came out. Well, Trey Parker has done it again - shocked me to the point that my jaw almost hit the floor (and I do NOT shock easily).<br/><br/>Even those (myself included) who believe that the show has lost its novelty (the new episodes have kinda sucked lately) - are in for a treat with this one.<br/><br/>""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" has absolutely NO barriers in its comedy - it pokes fun at gays, straights, blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, the handicapped... you name it.

"Leespam","10","2","2","2 July 1999"," Scathing social satire
","When Trey Parker and Matt Stone were writing the script for the movie, they had to make a decision if they wanted to ""dumb down"" material for the non-fans. Instead, they decided to make this movie for the fans-and by God, this has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen all decade. There was never a dull moment, the audience was uproarious, and I was laughing harder than I have in years.<br/><br/>Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do: make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.<br/><br/>I'll try and not spoil too much. The four kids go to see the Terrance & Phillip movie, ""Asses of Fire."" There is a musical number featured in the movie-within-a-movie which had the audience rolling, the lyrics consisting almost entirely of the f-word (and the TV show's bleeps are discarded for the film). The boys soak in the movie's naughty language and come out spouting forbidden obscenities. Soon other children see the movie. In the school classroom, there is an eruption of swearing and the boys are sent to the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, who calls in their mothers to make them aware of what the Terrance & Phillip movie has done to the kids. They form The Mothers Against Canada and try to have Terrance & Phillip executed. Canada defends its humor while the United States laughs at them, and Canada retaliates by bombing the Baldwin brothers (very clever). Soon Canada and the U.S. are engaging in full-scale war.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kenny dies (not surprisingly) and goes to Hell, where Saddam Hussein and Satan are in a homosexual love affair. Saddam only wants sex every five minutes and Satan wants to be loved. Their scenes in bed are a reason why kids should not see this movie. Back on Earth, the kids form a group to save Terrance & Phillip, ""La Resistance"" (obviously paying homage to Les Misérables) and make a plan to rescue Terrance & Phillip from the big USO show, where they are to executed. Guests at the USO meeting include Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder (who is happy to demonstrate her famous ""ping-pong ball"" trick). The kids attempt to sneak into the show and free Terrance & Phillip.<br/><br/>This movie will shock you. You will not believe some of the jokes in this movie. It will offend many people. The film takes equal shots at Jews, blacks, Canadians, Bill Gates, and Jar Jar Binks, to name a few. I'm quite sure many will be offended by ""The Mole"" character and what the military's plans are for the 14th battalion (snicker).<br/><br/>Fans will undoubtably love this movie. We finally see Kenny without his parka and hear him speak, and there's none of those annoying bleeps. I am a fan. I loved it. In fact, I'm going as far as to recommend it as a candidate for one of the best of 1999, let alone best comedy of the decade. This movie is non-stop laughs and it's very, very entertaining. It's not all toilet humor, either. The creators manage to get a message through, and there are large satirical tones concerning our modern society.<br/><br/>I paused while writing my review to consider people who aren't fans of the show and what they will think, and I have kept those in mind. There is a lot of swearing and a lot of frankly gratuitous sexual material. I salute Trey Parker and Matt Stone for having the guts to push the R rating to its boundaries. This film is fun for movie buffs and those who love political humor. And so, I am awarding it four stars. In these trying times, we need a good laugh or two."

There were some really funny parts, (I.E. Bill Gates.) but on the whole it was like a long episode of the show without the censors.<br/><br/>Also I found it ironic that the plot of the movie was based on how americans can take massive amounts of violence in movies as long as they don't say any naughty words. Which is proably why the rating committee wanted to give this movie an NC-17 rating because they slam on them so much. Anyway, very funny, very crude and very entertaning."

","Yes, some of the jokes are tired, and the profanity would make a sailor blush, but please, look at some of the positives!<br/><br/>1. It's better than MTV's ""Jackass"". 2. It's satirical, and it points out a lot of problems with our society. 3. It has humor, romance, action, and a little bit of science.<br/><br/>I like the fact that Kyle is proud of being a Jew. I like the fact that Chef and his battalion (is that the word?) stood up for themselves instead of being pushed around by the army. I like how Mrs. Marsh makes the point that the war is more gruesome than swearing. I like how the army general says that you can still see fart jokes on Nickelodeon. I like that the kids want to be political, and that they ban together to save their heroes, even if their heroes are profane and explicit. <br/><br/>If you can't find the good in this, you're probably one of those adults who can't lighten up. <br/><br/>And we can still relate to all of this because we are at war, and it's a pretty pointless war. <br/><br/>Watch it again and listen between the lines."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","3","4","24 August 2017"," Yes, get ready to have your minds warped
","Am a fan of 'South Park', more so the earlier seasons than later. Initially thought before getting into it that it wouldn't be my cup of tea at all, but it ended up right up my street despite not being for the easily offended. And to be honest, it is very easy to see why 'South Park' won't be for all tastes and why its humour is controversial.<br/><br/>Had heard nothing but good things about 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut', how great it was and how it did justice to the show in a way that few films based on series do (there are some disastrous ones out there). Seeing it, couldn't agree more with the acclaim and can see why people often put it on their favourite animated films lists (it's close to being on mine, and goes down as the boldest and one of the funniest). It absolutely does justice to the show and is every bit as good as it, and a fond reminder of the show in its prime years.<br/><br/>It is perfect for fans, and also does a fantastic job at having enough to attract a wider audience, one of the few series-to-film translations to do so.<br/><br/>Sure, some of the animation is crude and less than refined. Otherwise 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' is difficult to criticise. Considering that the humour is controversial and normally bad taste doesn't bode well with me ('Freddy Got Fingered' for example is an incredibly tasteless film, and in such a gratuitous, disturbing and unfunny way that it's on my worst films list), but it's wholly dependent on how the lack of taste is handled, whether it's handled wittily and cleverly. 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' is one such film.<br/><br/>Was really surprised at how tuneful the songs were, some of the best actually of any animated film to not have Disney's name on it and perhaps some of the best songs of any musicals of the past 20 years. ""Up There"", ""Wendy's Song"" and ""Hell isn't Good"" are standouts. The story execution worked brilliantly too, it has its poignant moments and some truthful and relevant messaging that makes its point without being over the top. It doesn't feel padded or like an extended episode of the show, actually opening up the concept to something bigger and bolder. It's also an ambitious story, but the ambition doesn't get in the way of the execution, one ends up admiring the ambition and the execution.<br/><br/>Like the show itself, a lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. is crude, extremely rude (every bit as much as 'Team America'), naughty, at times juvenile, often vulgar and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut', again like 'South Park', is hilarious, smart, witty and bold but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated films this daring, risk-taking or bold and doing it in a way that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard. Completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).<br/><br/>Often one is shocked at how much the film, like the show, gets away with, which feels like almost everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance. Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired and why the film has just as much appeal.<br/><br/>Before one forgets, the characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing. The regrettably late Mary Kay Bergman and Isaac Hayes also delight.<br/><br/>Overall, brilliant, as a representation of 'South Park' and as a film in general. Just know what you're letting yourself in for before watching. It's animated satire at its finest and bad taste has never been funnier. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","22 April 2016"," Respect my authority, by going to see this cartoon musical! Its wicked fun!
","At the time, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' was released, Matt Stone and Trey Parker's popular animated series was at the peak of its popularity due to its crude and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics. So it was no surprise that fans were foaming at the mouth to feast their eyes on a full-length cinematic adaptation. They got it in the summer of 1999, due to the success of the Comedy Central show. Made after Season 2, and before Season 3. Stone and Parker were given nearly virtually limitless platform to let their depraved satire and original comedy run wild. And run wild they did with the nudity, violence and toilet humor, they put in the movie. However, it's the profanity that got this movie, the most infamous. In fact, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut went on to earn a spot in Guinness World Record history for ""Most Swearing in an Animated Film."", & first computer-animated film in history to receive an R rating, despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down. Thank goodness, this foul-mouthed musical didn't get it's originally rated NC-17 rating. I would have, thought that would be, way too extreme of rating, just because the movie felt like using profanity. Still, the Rated R movie really went beyond what the television show, was able to do, at the time. What made this movie, very entertaining is the fact that South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters that was originally intended for mature audiences. While, it's more common place, now. In the late 1990s, it wasn't. This movie was never made for kids. Yet, some children did see it, at the theater. I was one of them. My parents knew how controversy, this movie was, at the time, but they understood, that behind the foul-language and low brow humor, there was some intellectually insightful satire view into modern society. After all, the movie is self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrence and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie. I'm not saying, that children should see this movie. It's really up to your call. I just saying, as parents, you should allow your children, some freedom to make their decisions, than acting too much of authoritarian. After all, hearing people swear is, part of growing up in the modern age. You just have to teach them, why certain words are not welcome for general use, and try to guide them into making more moral judgement calls. It's call parenting. I'm not even saying, my parents were even permissive. There were plenty of other extreme movies with sex & violence, I wasn't allowed to watch, until I was, way older. In the end, this movie didn't really turn me into a foul-mouthed psychopath. It just broader my intellectual development even larger. Another thing that was brilliant about this movie is how it's advocates against censorship, and better parenting. In many ways, the plot for this movie is very similar to the sixth episode of the first season of South Park, in which Death comes to South Park, after the parents of South Park protest against the foul language use in a local TV Station. However, unlike ""Death"", this movie use the execution of Terrance (Voiced by Matt Stone) and Phillip (Voiced by Trey Parker) as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse; causing Satan (Voiced by Trey Parker) to return to Earth. In addition to the Canadian Duo, that episode also introduced recurring characters Kyle's mother. (Voiced by Mary Kay Bergman) that would played a big role in this film by blaming Canada for the children use of language, rather than themselves. Much of the plot, is also a homage to the 1993's 'Beavis and Butt-Head' controversy where a little boy set his trailer on fire which killed his little sister on accident. Instead, of blaming the boy, his mother of course blamed the MTV animation show. In the movie, Kenny (Voiced by Beavis and Butthead creator, Mike Judge) is use in very fashion, showing how much people are unwilling to accept responsibility for their actions, and would rather look for scapegoats within the media, government, religion, and culture, as a way to solve their problem. Because of that, it point out the absurdities that both extreme sides of a social issue cling to, so well. It is Meta Humor use at its best and funniest. Another great thing about this film is the use of a lot of subversive, profanity-laced musical songs. All written by co-creator Trey Parker and Hollywood composer Marc Shaiman that ripped off and spoofed traditional theatrical musicals such as 1955's 'Oklahoma', 1961's 'West Side Story', 1965's 'Sound of Music', 1989's 'Little Mermaid', and of course, 1998's 'Les Miserables"". Songs like 'Mountain Town', 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?', 'La resistance"" and others, became a house-hold names, because, how memorable, the lyrics and tone were. Even songs like 'Blame Canada' was nominated for an Oscar, for best original song. Because of this film success in the music department, the creators of this movie were able to make the fame Broadway musical, 'The Book of Mormon', years later, with also got great praise. The voice acting is also pretty good in this film, with most of the original cast reprising their roles. I even love all the celebrity voice cameos like George Clooney, Eric Idle and Minnie Driver that came to lend a hand, during production. The visuals are not that bad, as well. Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut still looks great. Overall: What Would Brian Boitano Do? He would probably go see this movie. So check it out! It's one hell of a film."

(And frequently they come for the more readily available medical care.) <br/><br/>In fact, one of my favorite jokes came from a waitress in a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D.: What is the difference between a Canadian and a canoe? A canoe might tip. (It's a joke very popular in Florida, too.)<br/><br/>All of which might seem to have nothing to do with this movie, but deep down ... it seems to have nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved ""South Park,"" and try to catch the nightly replays of the TV show.<br/><br/>Not every show is a gem, but often enough there is a spark of brilliance that I must express my admiration and respect for its creators, and especially for this longer, uncut, and uncensored movie.<br/><br/>Not for the squeamish, as the cliché goes, and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is for anyone who can appreciate an inventive story and some really exceptional music."

So when the movie came out, I had to see it.<br/><br/>Again, I won't outline the plot because that's already been done, but I liked the point the movie was making. How violence is more acceptable than ""BAD WORDS"", how people blame others for when kids get out of line, censorship, and hypocrisy. <br/><br/>I remember when it came out, some of these parents were shocked when they took their five year old kids to see it, and walked out of it in the first five minutes, and some of them had the gall to blame the theater staff for it.

You even detect a hint of ""All I Really Want"" from Alferd Packer poking into a song.

The Academy likes movies like that.  The cursing was a tool to make a statement, nothing more.  The creators of South Park are all for the 1st amendment, but the point they were trying to show is that there are worse things in this world than bad language - violence, war, racism, and Wynona Rider.  What would you rather have your own kids caught up in?<br/><br/>The movie also makes a great case for anti-censorship.  We live in a country that provides us with the right to choose to see what we want at the movies, read what we want in a bookstore, etc.  However, when one parent (like Kyle's mom) decides that something isn't fit for her son, which is HER right to monitor her son's activities, said parent will spread opinion to others and try to ban the movie or book in question.  Thus, they take away the rights of others to see or read whatever is being banned without being given he choice.  And so toes are getting stepped on, and bad things happen.  As in this movie, an all out war breaks out.<br/><br/>So to those with sensitive ears, look a little closer, and see what's happening behind the foul language.  You'll see why this movie stands out in its politics.  Besides, you might even laugh a little as well.  It is a comedy after all."

","""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" (1999), this movie is tied with my favorite 3D animated movie of all time, and takes a place on my top 10 favorite movies of all-time. This is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. You're probably thinking: ""what?! This is your favorite 2D animated movie?"" Let me explain, I don't care how the animation looks in a movie or TV show. Any type of animation can work well if it's entertaining and utilized to it's full potential. ""South Park"" may have low-budget animation, but that does not mean it isn't entertaining. I'll tell you what, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" fires on all cylinders and then some! Remember, this movie is not for children, but seriously, what kid has not seen it? Or, the TV show for that matter? As long as there's an adult in the room, anyone can watch it at any age. Then as they get older, they'll learn to appreciate the humor much more as time goes on. I first saw this movie when I was in middle school, and I loved it right away. But of course my parents were a bit skeptical about me watching it. Any level-minded child can see that the vulgarity is inappropriate, and know that they can't talk like that in public. If a parent is there to explain to their children, it won't cause any harm. Words are words, and I feel it's important to be straight-forward with kids. Words mean nothing, it's the actions behind them that matter. I love this movie, and I will always love this movie! Usually, I'm not a fan of musicals, but this is one of the few rare ones that I actually enjoy. But it's much more than just a musical. Every time I watch this movie, I always notice something different. That's the sign of a great movie, when it evolves as time goes by. I can watch it 1,000 times in a row and laugh just as hard, if not harder, every single time I view it. Of course, as far as vulgarity and crude humor goes, this movie is on top! Without question, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"", what are you waiting for? I guarantee you that you'll laugh like you've never laughed before in your life. Strap in, it's one heck of a ride!"

The movie is funny in several different ways. First, there's the classic South Park ""shock"" humor. This movie gets OUTRAGEOUS and it's hilarious. Then there's actually some pretty clever humor going on. This movie is critical of American culture in a pretty hilarious way. 
To those who are not familiar with South Park, the humor is much more than just cuss words and inappropriate dialogue, they achieve a much higher level of humor (although the cuss words are still hilarious) by critiquing society in a lot of their episodes, and the movie is no different.<br/><br/>This movie is one I will never get tired of watching.

","In a small American town, four boys learn foul language from a Canadian film which is full of obscenities and toilet humor.

In the meantime, the boys try to stop them, as a much bigger threat is awaiting the highly publicized execution.<br/><br/>It's a movie realized in the world of the famous South Park series, only this time as a film and uncensored. It a wonderful depiction and, of course, exaggeration of people's mistakes and bad habits, which are taken to the extreme and made fun of. Talking about fun, this movie is simply hilarious, almost every action bringing tons of laughter from every possible side. It's very well made, well animated as the entire series, funny, funny and again funny.<br/><br/>It's also a musical which most of the time is very well preformed, but they kind of exaggerated with this type of moments, beginning to be a bit dull and boring towards the finale. The plot is also very well written and put into action.

"freemantle_uk","8","1","1","3 August 2009"," Blame Canada!
","Film adaptations of popular cartoon series rarely match the quality of the series. However, South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is an exception to the rule.<br/><br/>In America the Terence and Philip film is about to be released. All the kids in South Park are looking forward to seeing it and out four heroes, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sneak into the cinema to see it. The result is there are shock to hear them use swear words in the film (get the joke?), and results in them swearing at school. This causes a massive moral panic in America led by Kyle's mother. Anti-Canadian feeling run high and Terence and Philip are arrested in America. This leads to a war between the two North American nations, especially when America plan to kill the comedians. In the depths of Hell Satan has fallen into an abusive relationship with the recently deceasted Saddam Hussien. Because of the events of Earth Satan could raise if Terence and Philip are killed on American soil. So this makes issues even more important and Kenny has to warn the boys from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>What the TV series does so effectively is mix low brow humour and clever satire. Like a fine wine the show has improved with age. Whilst in most TV film adaption some element that made the show good is lost when its transferred to film. But Bigger, Longer and Uncut doesn't. There are sex jokes, and toilet humour as well as the novelty of swearing. But there are more clever jokes about moral panics (namely having the wrong target), censorship, racism, political apathy and even some parodies of World War 2. I agree with the film that American television does act stupidly, blocking swearing but showing violence deaths: I experienced this in New York City.<br/><br/>Basically South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is a fun film, which honours the show it's based on."

","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a very feverished and troubled satirical look at our society today, from politics to morals. For those fans of the show, this is practically a very longer, more epic, more exciting episode of the show, not that there is anything wrong with that. These days, most films based on shows lose the steam of what makes them so good on TV. This film is not that. Instead, we get the rude, disturbing, and bold jokes, together with some really twisted characters along the way. I found myself laughing at every bit. This is certainly a film that people must have thought 'We should do this, NAH' simply because no one ever thought a film, especially an animated film like this could ever be done. Yet here it is, and it does not disappoint. This is a risk taking film, and I admire it for that, but also, a guilty pleasure at everything wrong with the world today, yet we cannot help but laugh.

"richrodi","10","1","1","9 December 2008"," Possibly the greatest musical ever made
","While the musical genre is bogged down by ""classics"" such as West Side Story, and The Sound of Music, or pop contemporary music video pieces of garbage like Chicago and Across the Universe, South Park remains to be one of most poignant satirical musicals ever made. South Park creates a world of absurdity that reflects the absurdity of real life. Due to the animation quality the choreography of the characters is easily manipulated and we see these crude characters both in style and language dance across this epic landscape of morality. An obvious satire of both the religious right and the liberal left South Park delivers on its promises to upset disgust and outright cry with laughter. Such classics as ""Uncle Fu""""er"" make me cry with laughter even after a few years. This movie celebrates the ability to manipulate people through music. This manipulation is never used in the classical sense but used to celebrate the fact that people will listen more closely if a scene is composed through music. This archaic storytelling device works very well in terms of an animated comedy. Since we are already in the realm of the unreal, why not sing dance and fart your through the course of it?"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","24 November 2008"," South Park hits the big screen and all Hell breaks loose
","In case you've been living under a rock for the last decade or so, ""South Park"" the TV series is based around the shenanigans of four young boys in the quiet mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Their exploits are often hilarious though anything but politically correct. Here, the characters hit the big screen and they do it in style.<br/><br/>There's not a whole lot of change in comparison to the television series. The animation is still (in the words of Cartman) ""all crappy"" and the trademarks of the show are still in place. Following the show's tried and true formula, Trey Parker & Matt Stone use the big screen and big budget to create an ambitious musical satire.<br/><br/>The story is a good one and worthy of the extended running time. The jokes come at a steady pace and, as usual, there is a message behind all of the lunacy. In this case the hot-button topic is profanity in films. How very appropriate.<br/><br/>The voice talent is as solid as always and the few celebrities that appear do so in cameos, which is the way that it ought to be. The animation looks as good as can be expected given the style.<br/><br/>The area where the film shows a marked improvement over the show is in the music department. There are several original songs that feature in the film, ranging from the absurd (""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"") to the profane (""Uncle Fucka"").<br/><br/>This is easily my favorite American animated feature film and, unlike ""The Simpsons Movie"", it actually lives up to the reputation of the show that spawned it. Those looking for political correctness should look elsewhere; everyone else, head on down to South Park."

"moviemaniac008","10","1","1","8 August 2008"," So shocked...
","I have only seen a few episodes of the super acclaimed TV show, ''South Park'', yet, the few episodes that I had saw, I wasn't shocked very much and, for a TV-Ma television rating, I found that the show could've been much much more vulgar. So I recently rented South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. First off, let me say that this is not an animation movie exactly, it's more of an animated comedy for older people. So do not watch this movie on family night with young children, because I am Canadian and I do not want an incident like in the movie happen in real life. Speaking of Canadians, I find that the jokes involving the Canadian government(especially the United Nations one) are very funny in this movie.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, I must remind you that the word uncut is present in the movie title, and like I said, before you guys watch this movie on family night, please take a look at this: South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut holds the Guiness world record of the most vulgar film ever made up to date. There are 399 profanities in this movie, with 176 of them being f-words. And if that wasn't enough, there had to be an additional 199 obscene gestures. So think twice before watching it on family night. There are also many sexual references. But still, I really enjoyed the film and I recommend it to all people over a certain age.<br/><br/>The film is loyal to the TV show, at least, the episodes I saw: Kenny dies like in most episodes(very funny death in the movie), Cartman and Kyle still fight a lot, and all the characters are pretty much their own nature. So why was I so shocked? Because the movie is like the whole TV show uncut. Before today, I didn't know about the Guiness Record that the movie had, so hearing these f-words coming out of the mouthes of 8-year old children in the movie seemed pretty, well, you know what I mean. But still, it's a pretty funny(but vulgar) movie that deserves to be watched."
"RainDogJr","10","1","1","1 August 2008"," Viva la Resistance
","South Park was and is not an extremely popular show in my country, it is popular but of course and obviously not as The Simpsons, and obvious that is because it will never air on National TV. I don't really remember in what year exactly this movie was premiered in my country, not on theaters but only on cable TV as a PPV movie but by that year I was already a really big fan of the show and by that year it wasn't already part of the regular programs of MTV so the movie was and still is not popular here. I remember that the first time I saw this movie I was taping it and eventually that VHS became one of my favourites but it's been a long time since I haven't watch this movie and also I stop watching regularly the show after Season 6 (released in my country in 2003 I think) and since then I have just bought the Greatest Hits Vol.1 DVD and I have seen just some episodes on MTV but not long time ago I knew about the fact that now all the episodes are available on the official website for free! So recently I saw a couple of the new episodes and I found them hilarious so I have been listening, for the very first time, some of the mini commentaries of Trey and Matt from the DVDs, in short ""re-discovering"" South Park. Now it was time to finally watch again SP: Bigger, Longer & Uncut after so many years and right now I'm glad I have just did it but I'm more than glad that it is still that film that I loved!!!<br/><br/>It begins in the classic way of making references to Cinema itself, not only with the boys (Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny) going to watch the first feature film of their favourite TV show (Terrance & Phillip), which is R-Rated, but also and quickly putting Cinema as ""where we learn everything that we know"" so what does the boys will learn by watching, lots of times, the 180 minutes Canadian masterwork of comedy 'Asses of Fire'? Well everything that was previously censored!<br/><br/>It is a clever film and until now they have made similar things, for example in that episode with Family Guy, and in this case we are watching in the film a not surreal reaction of the parents if we think in the reaction of the parents if their kids starts talking like Cartman but it is the South Park movie and they make more bizarre stuff than those pair of Canadians. And later it plays as a great satire of war but they just don't care that and that's why it gets better.<br/><br/>As for the boys, basically the four are together (yet Kenny in hell) fighting for the same cause but of course not for the same reasons (Stan must find the clitoris also!) but that doesn't really matters since these kids are clever enough to know that they are living a f*cked up situation. As for secondary characters, there aren't many difficulties in order to remember a memorable moment for most of the regulars support characters of the show and since South Park is the place where problem with T & P and the apocalypse began and since it's a ""quiet"" town everybody has a part. Basically Kyle's mom is the nemesis in the story and we can understand why Cartman hates that bitch. The mothers are of course the ones that are relevant in the story and everyone else has just little moments but as I write those are just memorable, for example Ike hiding alone (stay for the scene after the credits also) and Chef leading the Human Shield squad with that crazy but hilarious general who killed Bill Gates! Sound bizarre and it's really bizarre!<br/><br/>Of course the first feature film of a great show has to contain some ""special"" things ('Asses of Fire' has some great musical numbers and for god sakes it is a 180 minutes film!!!) and apart of being uncut we have many great special effects, Kenny's face (voice of Mike Judge!!), Saddam Hussein (in the great style of those guys) and many great and hilarious musical numbers. Trey Parker has said that 'This Is Spinal Tap' is the reason of why he make movie musicals and definitely this is one of my favourites musicals of all time, simply because the songs fits perfect and all of them are extremely hilarious (who can forget Uncle F**ka).<br/><br/>To recommend Trey and Matt stuff is still not that easy and it could be simply like ""if you love the show you will love this movie"" and that's truth yet if somebody who wants to start with South Park this is great way to and if you love it then you will check the show and if you don't well at least you have seen South Park at its finest.<br/><br/>DVD Extras: only 3 trailers which are all just great but still it is just a good presentation of the film."

But also, this film has a deep moral and political message hidden inside it about censorship, freedom of speech and war along with sun-plots about love, relationships, jealousy as well as strength and extreme bravery being portrayed through the simple ability to stand up and express how you feel.<br/><br/>This film is basically a musical with so many great songs in between the moments of action in the film. The songs are both funny and uplifting as well as moving and dramatic. Listen out for 'Blame Canada' which earned an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Original Song.

"MairegChernet","10","1","1","20 March 2008"," perhaps I have misjudged this show.
","I know it's a little late to write a comment on the south park movie but i must do it for some reason, maybe because the movie has warped my little fragile mind, or may be because when the movie debuted I was just a little kid.<br/><br/>I am not a south park fan, and I don't really keep track of the episodes. The show is nothing to me more than vulgarity and plain outrage. But a couple of days ago a friend of mine lent me the movie DVD, and what I have to say to the creators is kudos for making such an awesome movie. <br/><br/>what is awesome about it is that it is centered on one storyline and revolves around it. there were no subplots or anything. the storyline's basis is the incident of the four boys watching the infamous Canadian Terrence and Phillip movie that's full of foul language and consequently causes U.S.A. to declare war on Canada. I usually don't like movies that are filled with obscenities, but there was something about the south park movie that made it O.K to swear. Instead of being offensive, the frequent obscenities were hysterically amusing. No matter what parents say about the offensive language in this movie, it's inevitable that,at some point, vulgarities stop being offensive but become funny.<br/><br/>Another thing that was awesome about the movie was the musicals. Actually the musicals is what I like about the movie the most. My top three musicals would be,<br/><br/>#3, what would Brian Boitano do? <br/><br/>#2, Kyle's mom is a b----<br/><br/>#1, it's easy m'kay. <br/><br/>The musicals were not only fast and inaudible unless you put on the subtitles, they were also hilarious. All the musical were fast paced and it was almost impossible to hear the lyrics. But if you do hear the lyrics, you will laugh your A$$ off. sorry, apparently I have been influenced by the movie's vulgarities.<br/><br/>I heard this movie was nominated for an Oscar. And before seeing it i was wondering how? but after seeing it, I wondered no more. The south park movie is definitely Oscar worthy, and what's funny is how Matt Stone and Trey Parker showed up at the red carpet with their bizarre looks.(wearing girly dresses)<br/><br/>My overall perspective of this movie is fast paced, interesting and hilarious, and definitely bigger, longer and uncut."

","In the twenty-first century, it appears the world has become more and more cowardly and thus entertainment has attempted to be more about being ""politically incorrect"" than providing worthwhile, honest entertainment. The biggest insult as of date has been the editing of the cartoons of yester-year, due to the smoking and racial depictions that were seen in those masterpieces. Animated series today lack the daring of those programmes and thus children are introduced to juvenile feel-goodery rather than the comic violence provided by the Looney Tunes. Even Sesame Street's Cookie Monster has been put on a diet, due to angry letters from parent's groups. The only cartoon out there that is not afraid to be blunt, satirical and downright naughty is South Park, the crudely animated adventures of four boys in a Colorado mountain town. Each week, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring forth what can be referred to as a warped, politically-charged and happily vulgar version of Peanuts. Yet, looking beyond the construction paper animation and constant swearing, South Park proves to be a witty and funny blend of intelligent, take-no-prisoners humour and even some heart and sweetness thrown in as well. The feature film version of the animated series, appropriately and comically titled Bigger, Longer & Uncut, has a message which Parker and Stone manage to successfully swing it in along with a bunch of side-splitting funny sight gags, musical numbers and flatulence humour.<br/><br/>Free from the restraints of television, Parker and Stone are free to enter possibilities that have not been explored before in the series. Yet, they oddly decide to keep it low-key by centering on the four main boys. Kyle and Stan are the straight men and the eight-year-old altar egos of Matt and Trey. Simply put, they may be vulgar and the comments spewing out of their mouths may not be the most friendly, but they're likable and the characters the audience is most able to relate. Even the bigoted slimeball that is Cartman has a sweet side to him, as he is all for the fight against censorship. In a situation almost akin to A Clockwork Orange, once he has been forced to no longer swear, the audience is waiting for him to get his beloved powers back. And finally, there's Kenny the un-sung hero of the story. While his death is used by the parents as a way to exploit their cause, Kenny attempts to stop the war once he learns of Hussein's intentions. The South Park gang have been around for a decade now and yet it's this film that's them at their all-time best.<br/><br/>Plenty of what makes the film more than just a longer episode of the series is the way in which Trey Parker and Broadway composer Marc Shaiman turn Bigger, Longer & Uncut into a Disney-style musical. The songs are clever and creative and best of all, they help move the plot along and do not feel like they're just adding to the running time. The opening number ""Mountain Town"", a parody of Beauty and the Beast's beginning, fools the audience into believing that they're about to watch a feel-good family comedy by giving it a tone different from what appears after those first four minutes. After that, the music goes in all sorts of directions. The audience is treated to a profane and flatulence filled homage to Oklahoma!, a march declaring the evils of America's neighbour to the north, a song of admiration towards a figure skater and finally, a combination of the film's best tunes done in the style of Les Miserables. There is even a love ballad played during the end credits, spoofing the typical melodramatic songs that Oscar usually awards (and South Park would, not surprisingly, lose to). Parker understands the musical genre perfectly, as previously evidenced in his student film Cannibal! The Musical and Bigger, Longer & Uncut stands as one of the best the art of cinema has offered.<br/><br/>One of the most notable aspects of South Park, along with the humour, is the political satire. In Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Parker and Stone go up against their biggest enemy since going on the air: humourless parent's groups. Along with Stan and Kyle, the two foul-mouthed Colorodians are also represented by the two foul-mouthed Canadians Terrance and Philip. The two characters are not necessarily a parody of South Park, but more-so how easily offended parents view South Park: a badly animated cartoon filled with low brow toilet humour consisting of flatulence jokes and swear words. It may have all of those things, but if people judge it without actually watching it, it's hard to get behind them. If they actually view it, they will find that South Park is satirical and not after all targets, but only those who deserve it. If they actually become offended by what they see, at least they are shown as less intolerant due to actually giving it a chance. Another aspect of parent's groups that Bigger, Longer & Uncut so wonderfully shows is its ability to blame others for their own mistakes. South Park is not intended for children, yet they still manage to find a way to watch it. Instead of blaming Parker and Stone, they should sit down, switch off the television and talk to their children. Sending angry letters to networks and studios that don't read them or waging war with a country which is just providing innocent entertainment isn't going to do any good. Instead, these people are actually giving Parker and Stone more publicity and more targets to make fun of.<br/><br/>Then again, if it weren't for the parent's groups, there wouldn't be this marvelous film. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the two most brave comedians in the television and film business and their magnum opus is the delightful, but meaningful Bigger, Longer & Uncut. This is not just an animated comedy. It's a musical, a message film and an attack on judgmental adults everywhere."

","Okay it's the classic South Park humor!

Secondly, you've got to admit, the voice actors of South Park cannot sing to save their lives! I remember a South Park Christmas episode called ""Mr Hankey's Christmas Special"" where there was 20 minutes of just singing, that was by far the worst South Park episode, in fact it was the only one I could not finish watching due to its awfulness.

The song ""Blame Canada"" was nominated for an Academy Award. The film was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humour, and for some violent images.<br/><br/>The film was co-produced by Paramount Pictures (which handled US distribution) and Warner Bros.

"thatheo","10","1","1","23 June 2007"," Brilliant satire for the not-so-easily offended with lots of catchy musical songs
","Satire disguised as cartoon or cartoon disguised as satire? No matter how you want to see it, this musical-like movie based on the well-known series has insulted several people, mocked them, and said horrible things about them, but also made most of those people rolling on the floor of laughter.<br/><br/>I love South Park. I think it is brilliantly written and very rewarding for those who pay close attention because there are so many comical layers that you want to watch the series and this movies multiple times so you can peel all those humorist layers off.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of 4 boys, Kyle, Eric, Stan and Kenny, who get to see a movie with tons of profanity. Being so impressed with the movie, Kenny Makes a dubious bet and sets himself on fire. Because of this, their mothers find a protest group, Mothers Against Canada, and eventually the U.S. government blames Canada for spoiling American youth. Canada bombs the Baldwins, and the U.S. declares war on Canada, and promises to execute Terrence and Philip. but this must not happen, because if that happens, because if these two figures get executed, Satan, currently having a gay relationship with Saddam Hussein, will come up to earth, making havoc and mischief. Therefore Stan, Kyle and Eric make a group of resistance children to stop the execution and their mothers once and for all.<br/><br/>Such a wildly absurd premise is not only completely ridiculous, but also outrageously funny and a very good basis for political satire and hilarious one-liners like: ""The MPAA says: Horrific exploited violence is okay, as long as there aren't any naughty words! that, is what this war is about!"".

","""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" aims below the belt from its very title and never stops. I wince at posters here who talk about taking their children to see it as if it were some great First Amendment victory rather than a serious lapse of parental responsibility. But give the Devil his due: This is a very funny film that makes you think.<br/><br/>After watching the Canadian comics Terrance and Philip comedy film ""@$$*$ Of Fire"" with its hit song ""Uncle %@*&er,"" impressionable fourth-grade South Park, Colorado student Eric Cartman tells his teacher ""How would you like to suck my *@%%s?"" Reaction is swift, as South Park parents blame Canada, and that %#@*^ Anne Murray, too. War is soon on between the United States and its neighbor to the north. Baldwins die needlessly, Cartman's mother appears in a German $^*&%*% video, and Satan and his abusive gay lover Saddam Hussein prepare to conquer what's left of the world.<br/><br/>What the %@*&!<br/><br/>""BLU"" uses the universe of the hit Comedy Central television show to score points against censorship, jingoism, and parental myopia. It also is hilariously funny, in a way that uses the vulgarity on screen not as a substitute but augmentation for a broad range of humor that satirizes everything from race relations (""Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?"" ""I don't listen to hip-hop!"") to ""Les Miserables.""<br/><br/>""This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!"" says Sheila Broflovski, a mother whose response goes way beyond just saying no.<br/><br/>Sheila is one of several characters voiced by the late Mary Kay Bergman, who also gives life to Cartman's anything-goes Mom and pre-teen love object Wendy Testeberger. Not just funny, there's a lot of heart in her work, which feeds off and embellishes the writing by creators and co-voice artists Trey Parker and Matt Stone.<br/><br/>Is ""BLU"" the apogee of ""South Park""? There are actually funnier TV episodes, and bolder ones, too. But this film has heart to go with its nerve, and works at introducing a larger audience to Stone and Parker's caustic comedy without putting too many people off.<br/><br/>Making the film a musical is pure genius that way. It plays at the whole ""kids-putting-on-a-show"" thread that has run through children-focused comedies since ""Our Gang"", but the songs are catchy and well-composed. ""Up There"" would be a classic show-stopper in a legitimate musical, but it kills with Satan singing it after another spat with Saddam. Philip's Anthony Newleyesque vocal stylings crack me up every time.<br/><br/>How could those ""South Park"" guys create a story where Satan is the most sympathetic character? Well, it worked for John Milton. The movie puts me off with its smugness, though, and a final act that strains too hard for significance.<br/><br/>Pretending nothing in this movie is offensive is ridiculous. But pretending nothing in this movie is funny is hopeless. ""BLU"" merits consideration with ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" as one of the great shock comedies of all time."

There are some in-jokes scattered about for the fan base, but for the most part, outsiders can visit this computer-enhanced paper-cutout land and follow along nicely. The vulgarity is funny and infectious, and you can tell Parker and Stone have a genuine affection for musicals. And let's face it, any movie that can pull off the act of turning an infantile schoolyard chant (""Kyle's Mom is a Bitch"") into an extravagant musical showstopper, courtesy of Mr. Eric Cartman, is a winner all the way.<br/><br/>The main foursome - Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman - work with some of their all-time best material, and this exercise still stands up to some of the best episodes of the TV series, which is still going strong."

They curse like crazy and they say vulgar things but it's all very clever and funny. I do agree with the people who say it is very rude and offensive. The thing is is that it's all a joke.

"tonyu-2","Null","1","1","5 September 2001"," Kyle's mom's a bitch!
","This has to be the most bizarre ""musical"" to ever see a theater screen.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that it helps to already be a fan of South Park in order to understand anything that's going on in this film.  Otherwise, it's going to be a mystery and a bit of a shock to the system if you see this film unprepared.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S FILM.  In spite of the cutsie cartoon caricatures, South Park is for adults only... *especially* BL&U.   It contains some seriously harsh dialogue as well as some intense visuals that simply won't appeal to some of the more reserved viewers.<br/><br/>It also contains some of the most inspired lunacy and visual sight gags that have ever graced a movie screen.   If you look closely at the entire South Park phenomenon, it becomes evident that there's more to the concept than just a collection of off-color jokes and one-liners and tongue-in-cheek TV and film references.  This is a satirical reflection of the memories and recollections that so many of us remember from our times as a child, and how we looked at the rest of the world.   However, South Park the TV series takes it all to an extreme... or maybe not.  It's a love or hate sport of thing.  You either get a bang out of it or you hate it with a passion. Either way, you won't soon forget it.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of controversy over South Park, mostly from people who simply ""don't get it"".   Many of these seem to believe that it's a kid's show and keep condemning it for being such a corrosive influence on ""our children"".  It is not a kid's show.  Others think it's simply a vehicle for Parker and Stone to launch onto the viewing public with jokes and one-liners that in a live action series would get it cancelled in a week.  In fact, there has indeed been some concerted efforts to get South Park cancelled, which is partly to blame (or thank, depending on your viewpoint) for ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" of which the title itself could well be a take-off on the fact that one of the  South Park kids (Stan) is Jewish... which also is no sacred cow, far as the unfolding events are concerned. Nobody is safe.  Canadians, Germans, and French appear to be Prime Targets in South Park along with almost any organized religious, political, or ethnic group.<br/><br/>However:<br/><br/>""It is not prejudiced as it offends everyone equally.""<br/><br/>First, down to the basics.<br/><br/>
SP: BLU is one of the funniest and most imaginative and over-the-edge films I've ever seen.   You haven't lived until you see Satan singing, A&E musical style, about dreaming of living a wonderful life ""Up There"", or the Academy Award nominated ""Blame Canada"" number, or the outrageous ""Uncle F*cka"" song... which could well end up having you humming it at work in spite of yourself.  It's perhaps the most astonishing song in the film.  And that's saying something.  Besides, you've not lived until you witness a professionally choreographed/performed musical arrangement that includes the sounds of flatulence as part of the lyrics.  It must be seen to be believed. What's more, it actually works.  Amazing...<br/><br/>Marvelous fun throughout, for those with an open mind and a taste for the obscure... and aren't bothered with insecurities over how society is being corrupted by the Media... read: South Park.<br/><br/>Now, the serious part:<br/><br/>
""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" actually contains a message.  It's a not very subtle punch to the face of censorship and sensationalism regarding over-reaction to things as inconsequential as bad language vs the numerous and much more serious problems facing the world we all live in.   It's odd that such a message would be overlooked by so many detractors who only see obscenity and gross crude humor as the ""message"".  Either that or they simply chose not to see.<br/><br/>
Of course, most people went to see this film only to get a belly laugh, rather than experience enlightenment over censorship.  Others seem to have viewed this film for the sole reason of criticizing it.  Their minds were already made up before they bought the ticket.<br/><br/>
If you already think South Park is a waste of time and sensibility, forget seeing this film.   You've already decided that it's crap.<br/><br/>But if you can be objective and you're not bothered by adult humor... and you're not afraid of being ""corrupted"", go see it.  Rent it.  Buy it.  You just might end up finding that your memories of being a child might get jostled a bit.   And it's OK to hum the tune of ""Uncle F*cka"" at work... just don't sing the lyrics.<br/><br/>And to those who might take offense at this film... perhaps it's because some of the shots taken at the villains in this movie, whether by direct insult or via metaphor, just might hit a little too close to home.<br/><br/>I was not offended.   I went out and bought the DVD.  It's worthy of repeated viewing, in my opinion.  I also have almost 40 hours of South Park episodes on tape.   It's all a great way to escape the rest of the world for a little while on a rainy evening when there's not much doing.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary...  and I do have nomex underwear.

The movie is nothing but a collection of vulgar language, and fart jokes (sound like any movie you might be reading about?).<br/><br/>When they come out of the movie, not knowing the meanings, the swear words from the movie become a big part of their vocabularies. The parents are outraged at first, and try to boycott the movie. But when Kenny is killed while trying to imitate a stunt from the movie, Terrance and Phillip are arrested, and the government declares war on Canada. When the boys learn that Terrance and Phillip are set to be executed, they form a resistance to save their heroes. Meanwhile, in Hell, Kenny learns that when Terrance and Phillip are killed, gay lovers Satan, and Saddam Hussein will rule the world.<br/><br/>This movie, for a film full of vulgarity and obscenity, actually has a logical, if very twisted plot. It has a serious message about how the MPAA is okay with violence, and everything else is evil. The movie is meant to poke fun at itself. The movie they see is an uncensored adaptation of a vulgar cartoon. That's exactly what this movie is. It's subliminally warning people not to boycott this film, because war could break out.<br/><br/>Oh yeah. Did I also mention that this movie is funnier than Hell (and Hell is pretty darn funny in this)? The concept of little kids constantly spewing obscene insults never gets old in this movie, because the language is all used in a really creative fashion, featuring the filthiest insults ever spoken in a film. The music is the real highlight of this film. The music, while hilarious, is also catchy, and you may find yourself singing the songs frequently. This is one of the funniest movies ever, and gets a strong 10/10.<br/><br/>It is rated R for Pervasive Vulgar Language and Crude Sexual Humor, and for Some Violent Images.

","This was a clever movie that was also the most vulgar, most obscene piece of filmmaking I've seen outside of porn. Which is too bad, because the clever things -- ripoffs of Star Wars, Les Miserables, Disney musicals, race relations, the Motion Picture Association of America and the way the whole movie was really about itself (watch it and you'll understand) -- get buried under an avalanche of cursing (more than in an Eddie Murphy concert film), private parts and blasphemy that I had thought until now would be impossible to get away with in a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>So I appreciated much about the movie. But I can't possibly recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a movie for adults, and I judge it as such. And I'm not exactly chaste in my language or humor, unfortunately. But I cannot separate the idea from the content. The idea, coming through loud and clear, is this: There are no standards. Not between good and evil, proper and improper, right and wrong, etc.<br/><br/>This is a dangerous idea.<br/><br/>In the wake of Columbine, people have been too ready to blame entertainment for our ills. No sane person will see this movie and commit an act of violence because of it, but I fear it does tear down the soul.<br/><br/>I guess that makes me a big, fat b***h."

","I decided to review this film since the 21st anniversary is coming up. The story is when the four main boys (Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman) go to see a R-rated Terrance and Phillip which causes every kid in South Park to go to see the movie and also causes the parents to start a war with Canada. This movie has some of the best comedy I've seen in an animated film. The characters are all like able in this movie like in the tv show. The soundtrack for this movie is amazing, even the songs that are not by the South Park characters are great too. The only minor problems that I have with this film is that the animation and some of the jokes in this film are a bit dated. Despite that, I still give film 10 out of 10 stars, I highly recommend this film if your a fan of South Park or a fan of adult animation. I also highly recommend this film if you like musical comedies or if you like Team America: World Police. I don't recommend this film tho if you hate South Park or don't like offensive humor."

After viewing, Stan and the gang pick up on all sorts of naughty language, which enrages their mothers. This eventually leads into Sheila Broflovski, Kyle's mother, forming a group called Mothers Against Canada (MAC) who plan to execute Terrance and Phillip and start an entire war with Canada. It's up to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to unite to rescue Terrance and Phillip and stop the war. Meanwhile, Kenny McCormick, after imitating a stunt he saw in the film, ends up dying and being sent to Hell, where he meets Satan and his companion Saddam Hussein. Kenny learns of a sinister plan, which involves them rising up to rule the Earth as soon as Terrance and Phillip are executed. Each boy has their own unique reason as to why they must stop the war. Stan must learn to step up as a leader and save the day in order to win over his crush Wendy Testaburger, Kyle must learn to stand up to his mother, Cartman, after having a V-chip implanted in him that shocks him whenever he swears, wants to have it removed, but later uses it during the climax, and Kenny must convince Satan to dump Saddam and not allow him to rise up to Earth with him."

","An elite social satire if there ever was one, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" gleefully marries jaw-dropping obscenity with masterful manipulation of the traditional musical genre, holding a searing blowtorch to misplaced parenting, failed political and religious institutions, and other bastions of hypocrisy worthy of its elevated contempt. Now over twenty years old, its full frontal assault somehow feels no less fresh and relevant than it did upon its release.<br/><br/>Among its many elite strengths, it's the debauched manipulation of the musical genre that distinguishes this ""South Park"" vehicle from other satires, parodies and spoofs, and even from the ""South Park"" TV series itself: Its songs are relentless, hysterical in bite, and enter the ear cloaked like wolves in sheep's clothing.<br/><br/>While certainly arguable, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" may have found its prolific creators at the absolute height of their powers. To this day, it resides in the top tier of film's most brilliant and influential social satires. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

","This film was made in the first three seasons of ""South Park"" and the funny thing is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone say they hate the first three seasons of the show. I don't know if they've ever said that about this movie. Butters appears in this film, but has no lines. It's a shame, because Butters is my favorite character and it was when he had a role that the show really took off. The plot is that Kyle's mother wages war on Canada when the Terrance and Philip movie inspires the kids to swear.<br/><br/>This used to be the animated movie with the most swearing until ""Sausage Party"" came out.

"Hey_Sweden","8","0","0","24 February 2019"," This movie has warped my fragile little mind.
","This is a hysterical feature film version of the enduringly popular animated Comedy Central series, set in a peaceful ""redneck mountain town"" where not much happens. That is, until our youthful heroes - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny - go to see the new movie featuring their favourite Canadian entertainers, Terrance and Phillip. They are inspired by its toilet humour and extremely profane dialogue, and start repeating it whenever they get the chance. This, in turns, inspires their mothers to start an anti-Canada movement that will culminate in war between the U.S. and Canada, and the execution of ""war criminals"" Terrance and Phillip.<br/><br/>What's great about the Trey Parker / Matt Stone creation is that they are able to stay true to their raunchy, profane style while also delivering what is a pretty sharp satire of real-life attitudes. It's true that we're ALWAYS looking for somebody to blame when problems occur, and usually don't do that much to actually solve the problems; it's easier to just single somebody or something out and publicly excoriate them / it.<br/><br/>This results in a movie that is pretty intelligent in its own way, and gives us all the irreverence we came to expect from the series. Parker & Stones' dialogue (they and Pam Brady are credited with the script) is of course priceless in its inventive use of vulgarities. The production values are naturally higher than one would see in a series episode, and a lot of the animation is quite slick and stylish.<br/><br/>The characters are as engaging as they've ever been. Cartman in particular is still the foul-mouthed, cranky brat he's always been, and in the end he is able to put his talent for profanity to great use. One devastating touch is having Satan figure into the plot - a forlorn Satan who can't relate to his goof ball lover Saddam Hussein.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is ideal entertainment for fans of the series, and is also good enough to allow Parker & Stone to reach an even wider audience than usual; you realize these guys are real talents.<br/><br/>A raft of celebrities supply additional voices (in addition to the late series regular Isaac Hayes, who voiced Chef); I'll leave you to discover them for yourself.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"popculturethoughts","9","0","0","25 December 2018"," Pop Culture Thoughts
","Anyone who grew up in the 1990s can likely remember the thunderbolt of liberating inappropriateness that was, and still is, ""South Park."" Gleefully tearing down good taste and censorship while incisively refuting much of the necessity for social graces, the show was a juggernaut before it was lost to its creators's arrogance and vituperative personal grievances. Looking back, the movie shows all the best ""South Park"" had to offer, and the laugh-out-loud jokes are thrown like rhetorical grenades at the audience over and over. There are few comedies that are so consistently risky and hilarious, pushing the boundaries of acceptable cinema in nearly every scene while also keeping its humor rooted somewhere between the juvenile and the politically excoriating, resulting in one of the angriest, funniest, ballsiest studio comedies ever released. With a running time barely over eighty minutes, the movie moves at breakneck speed, never stopping to catch its breath or allowing the audience to do the same, but also not sacrificing density at the altar of brevity."
"RagingDraugr","8","0","0","16 September 2018"," A hilarious film, with remarkable intelligence below its seemingly 'offensive-for-the-sake-of-it' exterior.
","Although I haven't seen much of the original show myself, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' was still insanely enjoyable. It has a lot of crude humour, but also it's surprisingly intelligent - commenting on everything from violence, foul language, censorship, the American military and a lot more. <br/><br/>In addition, despite the large number of references to previous episodes of the original show (which I have not seen much of yet; consider this my first real introduction to South Park), the movie was still funny regardless. <br/><br/>My first criticism is that the computer generated effects, like when Kenny goes to Hell, are a bit dated. But then again, what can you expect from a film made in 1999? Besides it still looks somewhat OK. <br/><br/>But secondly, and more importantly, the romance subplot between Stan and Wendy isn't as interesting or funny as the rest of the movie, takes up a small but noticeable amount of runtime and is resolved rather anti-climatically with Wendy abruptly ditching her then-boyfriend Gregory for no apparent reason (even if it is kinda funny in its abruptness).<br/><br/>Apart from that, though, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is still well-written, clever and most importantly of all, funny. <br/><br/>8/10 (Maybe a 9, but doesn't quite reach it due to aforementioned criticisms)"

"hellraiser7","10","0","0","4 July 2018"," The Full Length Crazy Town Adventure
","When it comes to most movies based off of TV shows it's always kind of hit or miss for me; This film is another one of the good ones in my book because like any TV to movie adaptation it obeys the three most important cardinal rules one staying true to it's source so that it has the same spirit, two having a good story to stand on it's own, but also and it's purely optional three which is continuing off sometime in the show to keep the story of the show going. <br/><br/>I really love how the film just like the TV show as usual wickedly and vulgar satires/parodies on the issue of the subculture of censorship and how ridiculous and stupid it truly is. But how it's easy to play scapegoat to avoid dealing with the true source of the problem or simply issues that really do matter.<br/><br/>The characters are as usual themselves and at there best in the film and each one has something to do, so it's well balanced no one is short ended.
We also see villains like Satan once again though in this film he's not much of a villain which I like that's something different. Here he's a sensitive guy that has wants and needs that haven't been meet yet, and unfortunately is letting himself be mislead into attaining them the wrong way. <br/><br/>However, to me the real villain in this film is Shella whom once again blows things out of proportion or should I say nukes em and she is playing the blame game on visual media. Her intentions aren't evil as she wants to create a safe place for everyone but what she's doing is wrong and as the old universal saying, ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions."" She is so driven by her inhibitions that she can't see the corrupt nature of her actions and the deadly consequences it has produced in the film.<br/><br/>I also really like the subplot with Stan Marsh whom is trying to find a way to win over Wendy Testburger's heart. I know it's a typical one for Stan if you watched the show enough but personally I always like those storylines, because I always like seeing both Stan and Wendy together. Though I'll admit seeing this really makes me sorely miss episodes with those two as they've been sorely lacking in the recent seasons of the show.<br/><br/>But the real highlight is in the music is just great there are a lot of memorable songs that I both laugh and dance to and replay on my CD or iPod; I wouldn't say all the songs are hits but that's always the case with most to all musicals as by their nature an anthology of songs, so there will be hits and misses all around. But it's always the hits that count. I'll just say a few of my favorites.<br/><br/>Kyle's Mom: Ok, I know this song was in the show, but I really like the updated version of it as it's added some new things to it that actually made it even funnier. And it's fitting since she's the villain of the film and from what she does this is the rare time I actually agree with Cartman.<br/><br/>Blame Canada: This is my favorite song in the film, it's a song basically on wrongful blame and is practically the epidemy of any organizations stupidity against any kind of free expression, speech and entertainment. But it's strangely exciting and hilarious at the same time.<br/><br/>La Resistance: This is my second favorite song in the film which is funny but also strangely exciting, as we're seeing everyone getting ready to fight in a stupid war. Which in a way makes it a bit of a commentary as most wars are fought because of stupid reasons?<br/><br/>Small Mountain Town: This is my third favorite song as it's funny but strangely nice it really does give me a good feeling every time I hear it; the song just perfectly sums up what South Park is.<br/><br/>Though I have to warn you, like with most movies based off of TV shows it might not be everyone's cup of tea unless you've had a sip of it before; if you're a fan of the TV show then this film won't disappoint you. 
A lot of wild and crazy things can happen in a small mountain town.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

This is basically just an 81-minute South Park episode that was once available in theaters with more time than usual to comedically bring our attention to some random topic. Said random topic was, in this case, America's bizarre stance on censorship. This is one of my favorite movies, but its definitely not for everyone. If you're a child, don't like crappy animation, and don't like anything that could lead to a movie being rated R - then don't watch.

It acts as a compliment to the show that it is based on, and it stands even if you don't watch the show.<br/><br/>The film parodies many subjects, such as celebrities, war, and censorship in media. The film pushes all of these to the extremes, while still remaining logical and with a point. The characters are all extremes of real people and personalities.<br/><br/>I have had immense amounts of fun watching this film every time, noticing new things that I hadn't noticed in any of my previous viewings.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd definitely recommend this film to anybody looking for a movie that balances multiple types of comedy and darker themes to make an overall enjoyable film experience."

","In this hilarious, subversive, satirical and deliciously offensive romp, the South Park parents pressure the US to wage war against Canada for making an R-rated movie which they feel corrupted their children. Initially this looks like an attack on censorship, which South Park does face a lot of, but it's actually a satirical meditation on virtually every issue imaginable. With so many jokes flying everywhere, this will probably take 2 viewings to fully get and the songs don't really add much to the film in my opinion a lot of the time. It's an undisciplined and chaotic film, but in the best sense of the word. It was made when South Park had yet to reach its peak, but it often reaches the standard of episodes like Scott Tenorman Must Die, Make Love Not Warcraft and Woodland Critter Christmas with its thought-provoking story, consistently hilarious jokes and a surprising amount of action and suspense as well. This one outclasses The Simpsons Movie by some distance (And that was a very good film too) and overall this delightful comedic juggernaut turns being offended into sheer, wonderful fun. It deserves awards for that alone.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Some people might not see it, but South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a very meta movie. The Terrence and Phillip movie Asses of Fire is pretty much an analogy for this movie, and the rest of the film is an over-exaggerated reenactment of how people reacted to the movie. When I first saw this film, I saw it as nothing more than some fart jokes and a bunch of cursing, but now that I am seeing it again at an older age, I realize that it is actually brilliant satire of censorship and the MPAA.<br/><br/>The film follows Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman as they see the new Terrence and Phillip movie. This causes them to become more vulgar and rowdy, and the rest plays out like an long South Park episode. I was always was a fan of South Park, and would watch it whenever it came on, and this film is made for South Park fans, so obviously I would enjoy it. The humor of the show is a very specific type of comedy, and doesn't stray from that, so people who do not like that comedy, don't like all of South Park, and people who like that comedy, love all of South Park. This is why in the Animated Musical HoF, everyone who participates either hates the movie, or loves it. You can pretty much separate the whole world into people who like South Park, and people who don't.<br/><br/>Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail every single line of this film is a joke. There is no moments where they comedy is stopped. Even when they are trying to deliver a serious message, they always do it in a comedic way. The actual jokes are very funny, and are exactly what I expect from Trey Praker and Matt Stone, but I think that there are episodes of South Park that are more funny, and I wish that they went all out for the movie. Because instead of watching this movie, I would just recommend you to watch the 4 best episodes of the show back to back, it would be more funny. This isn't really a huge problem, and it didn't lose the film many points, but I think you should only turn a TV show into a movie, you have to do something you can't do on TV. This is the same problem I had with The Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>And now about that brilliant satire I was talking about earlier. A while ago I watched a documentary called This Film is Not Yet Rated it was a documentary about the MPAA, and how they constantly like to screw over filmmakers. Violence and blood barley bother them, while cursing and sex make them give films the dreaded NC-17 rating. There are many cleverly hidden lines about the MPAA in this film, and I imagine must have been hard to get past them. There were lines in the film were they said that violence is fine for children, but how dare they say certain words. Isn't ""sticks and stones may break my bones"" what we teach children? One of my favorite things about South Park is that it is always the children that realize when something is bad instead of the adults. I now see this movie as an argument against censorship, and I think that it is much smarter than many people give it credit for.<br/><br/>I have now tried to explain why South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is pretty brilliant. In my opinion, the whole movie was an analogy for censorship, and they threw a Saddam and Satan love affair in there just for fun. I think Terrence and Phillip represented freedom of speech, and MAC was the MPAA. It is a very far-fetched theory, and is probably wrong. This review was way longer that I thought it would be, so I'm gonna end it now. If you like South Park, like satire, and don't mind some cursing, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>(This review was originally written on Movie Forums July 30th 2015)"

","Although the animation is crude, that's the charm of the South Park franchise. This is one of my favorite films based on a cartoon, and one of my all-time favorite animated films released by Paramount Pictures, next to the Adventures of Tintin. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is way better than Jetsons: The Movie, and is really amazing. It's one of the greatest animated musicals of all time, next to Frozen and Yellow Submarine. It is very funny, and is very clever. As a South Park fan, I really think that this is definitely acceptable for all the South Park fans worldwide, and is the best adult animated film released by Paramount Pictures. It had a very original story, amazing characters, decent animation (although pretty crude), and a soundtrack of unforgettable songs. This is the best R-rated animated movie ever."

","Ah, how refreshing. I can't remember the last time I watched a comedy that actually made me laugh. This movie is a truly hilarious one. It's jokes are incredibly crude, yet they're also amazingly intelligent. South Park's traditional satire and general parodying of everything and everyone is not lost in the transition from TV to film. The genius writing is still here.The idea of looking at problems through the eyes of children is a brilliant one and opens many opportunities for laugh out loud comedy. Trey Parker and Matt Stone jumped on those opportunities and now we have this film. Surprisingly enough, the music is really, really awesome. Each song is both funny and pleasant to listen to. Trey Parker and Matt Stone put an extraordinary amount of effort into this film and it paid off big time. Seek this film out."

Mr. Garrison: OK, now lets try to get an answer from someone who's not a complete retard.<br/><br/>OMG. When I saw this I was literally rolling on the floor laughing. There's not much else to say other than how hilarious it is.<br/><br/>So anyway it's about Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski and Eric Cartman head to the local movie theater to see the new film Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire which stars the boys' favorite Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip , but when the boys get there, they are refused entry due to the film being rated R by the MPAA, so they pay a homeless man to accompany them. The boys learn obscene phrases from the movie like Uncle Fucka which makes the other kids in town want to see the movie.<br/><br/>Stan finds his love interest, Wendy, ice-skating with a well-educated boy from Yardsdale named Gregory. Whenever Stan tries to talk to Wendy he throws up, so he asks Chef for advice on how to impress women. He is told that all he needs to do is to find the clitoris. Stan does not know what the clitoris is, but nevertheless searches for it throughout the film.<br/><br/>The kids begin cursing in class, so they are sent to see Counselor Mackey who informs their mothers. Learning that the language was from the movie, their parents force the teachers to enforce a strict dress code banning all types of Terrance and Phillip clothing and abandon their previous lesson plans and run a rehabilitation center for the kids to get them to stop swearing. Afterwards, the boys and the rest of the children go to see the movie again. Kenny bets Cartman $100 that he can set his fart on fire like Terrance did in the film. Kenny immolates himself and dies when the doctors accidentally replace his heart with a baked potato. The boys are grounded and Kenny is refused admission to Heaven for having used curse words, stared at boobs every day, throwing rocks at birds, and missed Sunday church. He is then sent to Hell. He is tormented by demons while descending into Hell and meets up with Satan and Saddam Hussein who are gay lovers. The parents of South Park organize a boycott against Terrance and Phillip, which led by Sheila . The new group, called ""Mothers Against Canada"" has Terrance and Phillip arrested as war criminals during their appearance on The Conan O'Brien Show, and when the United States refuses to release the duo, Canada strikes back by bombing the residence of the Baldwin brothers.<br/><br/>Sheila (who is now the appointed ""Secretary of Offense of the United States"") forces President Bill Clinton into going to war with Canada and having Terrance and Phillip executed at an upcoming USO show. Afterwards, Cartman tries to annoy Kyle with a song degrading Kyle's mom (""Kyle's Mom's a Bitch"") but he is overheard by Sheila. As a result, he is forcibly implanted with a V-Chip by Dr. Vosknocker which gives Cartman a sharp violent electrical shock every time he swears. Meanwhile back in Hell, Satan declares that if the blood of the two innocent Canadians touches American soil, it will be time for him to rise up and rule the world. Saddam wants to come with him, but Satan is tired of being bossed around by Saddam (""Up There""). Kenny tells Satan to break up with Saddam to which Satan initially agrees, but Saddam wins back Satan with a song (""I Can Change""). Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him of the consequences of executing Terrance and Phillip. The boys, after failing to convince their parents, decide to take matters into their own hands (""What Would Brian Boitano Do""). They have a secret meeting to talk about how they can save Terrance and Phillip. They form La Resistance and Gregory tells Stan to recruit a God-hating French expert on covert operations named ""The Mole"" While the troops, waiting for the execution of Terrance and Phillip, are being entertained by Big Gay Al, La Resistance and The Mole infiltrate the USO show, but The Mole is discovered by Sheila and the guards and is killed by guard dogs after Cartman fails to deactivate the alarms. The remaining three children attempt to warn their mothers and the army about what will happen if Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they instead laugh at them, and Mr. Garrison throws the switch to the electric chair. A large Canadian force attacks the base and a massive battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's V- chip begins to malfunction. The other moms, seeing the destruction their ""Mothers Against Canada"" movement has incited, decide to call it quits and head off to look for their children. After being stunned by an explosion, Stan has a hallucination and is visited by ""The Clitoris"" which tells him that all he needs is confidence if he wants to win Wendy's heart and also reminds him what will happen when Terrance and Phillip die.<br/><br/>So anyway blah blah blah.. they save the day.

","People have argued that, after 16 seasons, South Park isn't as fresh as it once was. Its creators/writers (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) are self-confessed 'Python fans' and many of the early seasons were made in the a similar vain. As the seasons progressed, it moved away from simple wackiness and into 'causes' and 'celeb-bashing' (the wackiness remained, but seemed to take a back seat). This lost a certain amount of viewers, leaving only the die hard fans remaining (not that that must have particularly worried Trey and Matt, as South Park has a LOT of die hard fans left out there).<br/><br/>But, if you really haven't seen South Park and are wondering what all the fuss is about, then its movie incarnation is as good a place as any to start.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the crude animation. You've probably heard that South Park is simply smut and crudeness. And it is. And yet it's so much more as well. The wonder of South Park is that it's an adult world seen through the eyes of a child (or four children, to be precise). They are forced to navigate a pretty weird and frightening world with only the guidance of a sex-obsessed chef and a school teacher with split personality issues. The four boys sneak in to see an X-rated Canadian movie which teaches themselves all sorts of naughty words. This, in turn, leads to America declaring war on Canada.<br/><br/>Yes, it's pretty wacky, but there are plenty of cultural references and takes on modern life thrown in there among the smut and depravity.<br/><br/>If you want to want South Park, you need an open mind and shouldn't be easily offended. It's not an 'adult' cartoon for no reason. However, if you're looking for something that is - secretly - intelligent and mad in the best sort of way, then you can do worse than spending an hour and a half watching Satan and Saddam Hussain battle it out with the residents of a small mountain town in Middle America."

","Being commonly referred as the year that changed movies, it's only fitting that 1999 hasn't lost its historical significance on the field of animation.<br/><br/>The year saw the release of Disney's official last animated feature from the 'Renaissance' era, making a successful torch-passing to Pixar animation with the great ""Toy Story 2"". Although there is a natural propensity to label ""Tarzan"" the last classic animated film, in my humble opinion, this honor goes to the contender, the unexpected newcomer that blew me away, as a movie viewer, the movie adapted from a 2-year old TV series: ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"".<br/><br/>The most remarkable achievement of ""South Park"" is its perfect combination between a classic approach to the genre of animation with all the elements that forged the series' controversial reputation, and I'm not only referring to its use of vulgar humor and profanity but also its satirical treatment of timely issues, at a time where ""The Simpsons"" was starting to show a slight decline of quality. ""South Park"" feels like a two-part episode but with nothing to envy from Disney classic films, the plot is coherent, the film takes us in one of these unexpected climaxes like only the show has the secret, and I'll be damned if the film doesn't feature the greatest set of songs since ""Aladdin"".<br/><br/>The songs deserve a whole chapter. The first time I saw ""South Park"", I didn't see them coming, it starts with what I thought was a cute homage to ""Beauty and the Beast"" with ""Another Quiet Sunday Morning in my Quiet Mountain Town"", a sympathetic way to introduce to all the characters (not everyone is familiar with the show after all). Then, the story takes off when the leading quarter Stan, Kyle (and his cute brother Ike) Kenny and Cartman go to the theater to watch the movie version of Terrence and Phillip, featuring the outrageous song with the titular F-verb involving a family member not to mention a very creative use of fart as musical accompaniments.<br/><br/>Naturally, there is an uproar following the film's release, ""South Park"" prudish inhabitants, mostly mothers, lead by the dominant and hot-tempered Sheila Broflovski condemn the use of profanity, the vulg.wait, didn't I say that before? You got it, it's a self-referential plot where the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone anticipate the reception of their own movies, something that can be summed up in a catchphrase belonging to the rival series: ""will somebody please think of the children"" The mothers form an association in order to protect children and since Terrence and Phillip are Canadian, they don't blame the government, nor society, nor the images of TV, they blame Canada! <br/><br/>And right now, I have the ""Canada"" march in my ears and without a doubt the song of the year (played during the Academy Awards' Ceremony) ""Blame Canada"", the only one to be nominated for an Oscar, which is a shame, because there was at least 2 other titles to include. Indeed, ""What would Brian Boitano Do?"" would have been a great second choice, an example of great writing, catchy music and surrealistic fun. If ""The Lion King"" had three Oscar-nominated songs, I don't see why, ""South Park"" didn't get the same respect. What would a good juror do? Blame the Academy! <br/><br/>The plot goes on and on and leads to one of these spectacularly cataclysmic twisted twists we never see coming when we watch ""South Park"", resolving a question many would have in mind. Indeed, I've often wondered why it took 17 years for the most successful TV sitcom of all-time ""The Simpsons"" to have its movie while ""South Park"" was still recent in mind, hell, even Butters wasn't a major player and Mr Garrison was still a man  sadly, even Mary Kay Bergman, pretty much all the female voices in the film was still alive (Rest in Peace to one of the most talented female voices ever whose sudden suicide is the only veil of darkness on the film's shining legacy) <br/><br/>Anyway, I guess the fans will know why the show made a movie so early ""South Park"" plots often start with an ordinary issue and takes inevitably dramatic proportions flirting with fantasy and surreal humor, it's satire to the extreme. This is why it's not surprising that the last act features a war between America and Canada, Stan's quest of Wendy's Heart and the mystery of the G-spot, and an unexpected cameo from the devil himself and his lover Saddam Hussein  well, I understand the makers won't have a soft spot for the late dictator but I give them the benefit of the doubt, this was pre-11 September era (as if it ever meant something) and not all the members are Hitler-like figures.<br/><br/>But the inclusion of hell is a good plot device as it allows one character to be still preeminent even after his death, you know who I'm thinking of, the one that got killed every episode because of some bastards' move. ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" is everything a film can be : an adventure movie, a satire, a coming-of-age story, a fantasy and more than anything, a great musical, this is Golden Globe, what I'm saying, Broadway material and I hope some producers will think of an adaptation, and I'm only half-joking. Witty, intelligent, subversive, the film is perfect to the point it even questions its own criticism through the very plot it features, not ""The Simpsons : Movie"", no classic Disney film ever achieved this.<br/><br/>And for that achievement, I applaud the film, and me I don't applaud for not getting immediately the joke behind the title."

","When people think cartoons they automatically draw memories from their youth; bright colors, fantastic heroes and lovely princesses. Boy and girls of a certain age love the magical kingdom of Disney and the sly humor of Warner Bros. Saturday morning cartoons. Today, with the advent of computer digital imagery cartoons have risen to a whole new level of experience for the young. But we all have to grow up someday I guess.<br/><br/>That is unless of course you are a fan of Comedy Central's savage satirical cartoon show South Park (1997-Present). Drawn in a crude, cardboard style and centered around three foul-mouthed boys from a Colorado mountain town, South Park brought a level of edginess to the animated arts not seen since The Simpsons (1989-Present). The level of South Park's accomplishments is even more impressive when you consider all the episodes are written by two men, college friends Trey Parker and Matt Stone.<br/><br/>A few years after their runaway success the duo decided they wanted to green-light a feature length movie focusing on the four boys and the chaotic town they call home. What resulted was arguably one of the funniest animated-musical-comedies to come out in the latter part of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The story of South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut begins with the four boys being refused at the movie theater for wanting to watch a rated-R movie. The stars of the movie are a pair of Canadian comics, Terrance and Phillip, who traffic in the lowest of low comedy. So naturally the boys don't want to watch a watered down TV version a year after the fact. They manage to sneak into the Bijou and are exposed to the movie which sets the parents off on a crusade against the entire nation of Canada. The boys Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman (All voiced by Parker and Stone) must then put a stop to things before everything spirals out of control and Hell itself engulfs them all.<br/><br/>The world in which the boys inhabit is full of hyperbole, anarchic bedlam, and catchy, brilliantly written musical numbers. Avid aficionados of classic musicals, Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to convey that affection at a time when musicals weren't in vogue. The heads of Paramount Pictures were not 100% on board with the decision yet still slated South Park for a June release.<br/><br/>Weeks after opening night, reports of underage teens sneaking into the film began to circulate causing a bit of controversy for the film. The MPAA originally slapped an NC-17 rating on the Guinness Book of World Record holder for most curse words in an animated film. That decision was later rescinded but didn't put parents' minds at ease. There were minor protests here and there but overall the film was a rousing success, garnering praise from critics and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.<br/><br/>Parker and Stone would later go on to pen a Tony Award winning musical The Book of Mormon and create an impressive marionette-themed action satire called Team America: World Police (2004) which also collected accolades and controversy. This is in addition to reaching new heights with the Emmy Award winning South Park for fourteen more years. Not bad for two foulmouthed kids from Colorado who never grew up.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","http://filmsnob.blog.com<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut was what really got me interested in South Park, I did see a few episodes before that, but the movie is where I really ""got it"". Most people see the show as low-brow humor, done cheaply, for cheap laughs, but anyone who's really paid attention notices the social commentary and ""nothing is off-limits"" angle of the humor to the show, and movie. South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut does pick up between shows, but you can still watch it without seeing the show and enjoy it for what it is, nearly 15 years later it's still funny and relevant, taking a stab at how American entertainment is skewed to allow violence to go to extremes, yet sex and fowl language are very regulated. Co-Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have dealt with the MPAA on several occasions, especially with this movie, which was just a big middle finger to them to begin with. Like bullied victims the South Park movie was a big return upper-cut after tons of abuse and beatings.<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut begins with the boys (Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny-all voiced by Parker and Stone) going to see the new Tarrence & Phillip movie: Asses of Fire. The R rated Canadian movie sets off a fire-storm of trouble when the boys' parents blame the movie for the their potty mouth and the death of Kenny, after he lit one of his farts on fire. With Kyle's mom Sheila (Mary Kay Bergman) leading a group of parents against Canada, war and (literally) all Hell breaks loose. The Oscar nominated music is wonderful, and needless to say the Parker and Stone's craft has come full circle with ""Book of Mormon"" musical, the same talent shines through here.<br/><br/>As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, once again Paramount dropped the ball, and the new release is hardly worth celebrating, considering the original DVD was bare bones, there isn't much for extras here either, the fact that the Blu-Ray was obviously made from a film-print and not the original digital animation files is beyond me. Makes no sense that a new master for the Blu-Ray simply wasn't ported over, considering the movie and show have always been animated by computer (minus the pilot episode, that was actually done with construction paper cut outs). The last few years of the show look better than the High Definition presentation we are given here. It's not the worst picture ever, but unless it was requested by the creators I don't know why they would chose to master it this way.<br/><br/>The only extras are a collection of trailers, a music video of ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"" , and a commentary by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, which of course is the reason to get this Blu-Ray. The commentary is very retrospective of course being over a decade since it's release, but they are entertaining of course, the duo does mini commentaries for each episode on the season sets, but they never get real in-depth, so the rare chance to hear them talk about the film and South Park in general in a more candid and open way is a treat and the only reason there is even a rating for the extras on my final grade. It's about half-way there, but this movie screams out for a kick-ass full blown Special Edition, c'mon Paramount!!!<br/><br/>RATINGS:<br/><br/>MOVIE: 10 out of 10<br/><br/>AUDIO/VIDEO: 8 out of 10/7 out of 10<br/><br/>EXTRAS: 5 out of 10"

","It's been well over a decade since I last saw ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut."" Of course, being a fan of TV's ""South Park"" since almost the beginning, this movie just had to be seen by me in the theaters in 1999. Well, obviously, since I was just 14 that year, I couldn't see this movie in the theaters, but I WAS able to see it when it came out on VHS. The show, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, was thus expanded into feature-length territory, and it will not disappoint fans of the show (since both Parker and Stone had a hand in writing and directing the film). ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" came out at the perfect time at the end of the cynical, politically correct '90s. Parker and Stone are both equal-opportunity offenders, and nothing is sacred in their view - religion, race, politics, free speech, etc. But despite the rampant toilet humor, they do seem to be saying things about free speech, racism, censorship, homosexuality, the nature of war and of course, political correctness. These themes are laced in a story in which potty-mouthed third-graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into the movie theater to go see ""Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire"" at the theater. When their parents discover the truth, they launch a campaign to wage war against Canada, with the boys the only hope of averting World War III - and - the apocalypse (because Satan and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein are in on the fun, also). If you were a teenager in 1999 like I was, this movie will have you in stitches; also, if you were a teenager in 1999, you most likely had parents who forbade you from seeing this movie at all costs (yet you probably got away with a few private viewings anyway). I managed to catch a few viewings with my mom (who could stomach the proceedings, while my father obviously couldn't). 14 years later, ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" has not really lost its power to offend, and captured that chaotic atmosphere amazingly well.<br/><br/>See it, and be offended.<br/><br/>10/10"

","First thing's first, I'm a huge fan of the show (have seen every episode at one point in time or another), so the natural bias on this film will be evident. Second I was thinking of a title to call this review and the other was going to either the one above or ""This Cartoon Isn't Meant for Children"" because that was actually written at a local video store that is surprisingly still in business (Shout out to Village Video in Hickory, MD by the way). But I digress again, as per usual Trey Parker and Matt Stone got them kids in Colorado in a sticky situation where they change the course of history. Much like the show, nothing changes, the kids are smart, the adults are stupid, and anything wrong socially was pointed out in hilarious ways (such as the very racist Operation: Human Shield). But much like the combo's other works, the musical numbers are funny and catchy at the same time. Plus, bringing in Saddam into play in this film was excellent and knowing that some soldiers from the Army's 4th Infantry Division showed it to him repeatedly in prison makes it all the better. But hey who cares about that because as they say in the film ""Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words. That's what this war is all about."""

","This film is one of the greatest animated films of all time (usually making most critic's top five lists, sometimes top ten) and one of the finest comedies too. It's funny, meaningful, and has a message that isn't too extreme for it's viewers although it may not be obvious to them. Parker and Stone are fine voice actors, but Mary Kay proves herself as one of the greatest of all time. She takes all of her characters and puts so much life into so much of them, she can make somebody funny with just her subtle voice, and has so much drive and emotion in each character. If Fellini's 8 1/2 was a look into the director's unique life this films one ups it by having the controversy, perception, and content of South Park at the time parodied. The series it's self was a field major in the culture wars of the 1990's against political correctness and censorship, this film serves as something of a climax to the war with a clear winner. It's impact is still felt in theatre and film today, it's message just as meaningful. Matt and Trey extend the analysis of their show (something rarely if ever done in film at this point) to new heights through the avatars of both Terrance and Phillip (who beautifully parody both the derp comedies of the day especially from Canada, and the false perception of the show it's self) and Stan and Kyle. Through this they give us a meaningful film that has a message that extends from their own lives into so much more and that's universal. The songs are A+ too and deserved the Oscar above Phil Collins. Great film."

","South Park is one of the most raucous animated movies you will ever see. There are so many curse words and their derivatives that it's unbelievable.

","It's always very iffy when we see a film based off a popular Television show hit theaters. We are unsure if it will just be a typical story stretched to fit theatrical standards, boasting virtually nothing unique or big screen worthy, or if it will be an exclusive adventure only fit for theaters. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut knows it's leaping from the small to big screen, and to prepare for its monumental leap, caused a great deal of controversy with the MPAA about whether it deserved an R or NC-17 rating.<br/><br/>The film has to be one of the smartest animated pictures in decades, and probably the best Television-to-film adaptation along with Beavis and Butthead Do America and The Simpson's Movie. It is an unforgettable excursion, not only providing a plethora of good, and bad, laughs but also giving us hefty commentary on social issues and a delightful and poignantly brilliant satire on customs, war, vague xenophobia, and the handling of strong moral issues.<br/><br/>Our story centers around the mountain town of South Park, Colorado where our four boys, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny (voiced by Parker and Stone), foul-mouthed, ill-behaved elementary schoolers, take a trip to the movies to see the Canadian picture ""Terrance and Phillip: Asses on Fire."" The film is vile and littered with foul language, politically incorrectness, and flatulence, and the boys eat it up. They repeat the off color phrases at school, along with the rest of the students, which eventually gets their mothers involved to start a war against Canada.<br/><br/>If there's anything the film does extremely well, and believe me it does a lot of things of commendable nature, it's adding in a highly memorable, insanely catchy score. Parker and Stone have incorporated a musical aspect with everyone of their films, except BASEketball. Here, it is fitting, infectious, and witty in its attempts to add zest and flavor to its arguments.<br/><br/>I mentioned the film is sick with satire. That it is. It discusses very strong elements, some of which I believe South Park is all about. The film has something to say about censorship, first amendment rights, parenting, and acting on behaviors impulsively, where the thought of no serious consequences will ever come into play. The strongest thing it comments on is the parenting aspect. The film would've been over in twenty minutes if the parents sat down with their children and had an honest, open, and influential talk about morals, language, and the media. There is a scene where Mr. Mackey tries to take charge of the issue by getting the kids to replace their ""naughty words"" with things a bit lighter and less offensive (in the form of song of course). But it doesn't work. Immediately when they're released from school, they return to the cinemas for an umpteenth helping of ""Terrance and Phillip."" It shows that the schools can't do the job of parenting, and when they try, they fail to reach any point of reason. Parenting should come from the parents. Not third party outlets.<br/><br/>When it comes to censorship and parental reactions in the film, I'm sure Parker and Stone weren't the least bit shy in incorporating elements and remarks they've probably received from the show itself. South Park has to be the most controversial show of the 1990's and still the 2000's. The show has just entered its sixteenth season, remaining on the mellow side poking fun at how we sit on toilets and ""Cash for Gold"" outlets. But its last few seasons have gotten its creators in some major, major trouble. Both times involving the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a running joke.<br/><br/>This is truly one of the sharpest satires to come out in years, nonetheless an animated one. I can't help but laugh at the idea on how seriously some people take the show. The beauty is it is so crudely animated; just vibrant construction paper resembling the look of a grade school project, yet it is so harsh, mean-spirited, violent, vulgar, and sex-driven. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut basks in the idea of having a full length movie about itself. A movie where truly anything goes. No beeps, blurs, or restrictions. Unadulterated, unmatchable satirical humor combined perfectly with gross out gags and wit to envy. I'll be damned if it's not one of the most profound pictures of the nineties decade.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by: Trey Parker."

","I have always had very mixed feelings about the South Park TV series. On one hand, it is infantile, coarse, graceless, outrageous for the sake of it, and - let's be fair - one of the least sophisticated animated series ever. On the other hand, it has often had some very good points to make, some sharp satire, and it is frequently very funny.<br/><br/>So what of the movie? How do you manage to sustain the triviality of the typical half hour episode for feature length. Well, you start by writing a really good script, which wraps a number of excellent points (not least the free speech issue, with particular reference to bad language ie. South Park itself) in a narrative which effortlessly embraces them all, notwithstanding how daft it is, pepper it with some very catchy songs (and these songs are genuine ear candy, albeit peppered with profanity), crank up the production values (musically and animation effects: the basic animation remains clumsy cut-outs), and you have a film which maintains the appeal of this series, has an underlying seriousness, and is very, very funny.<br/><br/>This is a work of demented genius."

","It's often a worry for fans when a T.V. series, animated or not, decides to make a feature length film. The types of stories you can tell vary between 22 minutes and 81. But if anyone has ever succeeded at this then it's Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The film is definitely better if you properly know the first couple of seasons of South Park as the amount of references is staggering. Having said that the first time i saw this was when i was about 10. It may have been the TV premiere over here in the UK. But i was laughing so hard by the end, which is impressive considering how many of the dirty jokes I wouldn't have gotten. Since then I must have watched this movie over 50 times and laughed every time. The story is incredibly well told and the characters are 'super sweet'. What is also nice about this film is that not only is there no particular 'bad guy', just a series of connected events and you can clearly see each character's motives whilst the film remains hilarious throughout. It has even stood the test of time and after 12 years it is still just as funny every time i watch it. And it's also worth pointing out what a great job the entire cast, though particularly Matt and Trey, do with regard the voice acting. Just go and watch it!

","This is my comfort movie. When I'm sick, when I'm tired, when I've had a bad day, this movie makes me feel better. It's on my personal Top 10 List of Awesome, and I can't think of Juvenilian Satire done better.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is crude, and rude, and other words that end in 'ude'. That is kind of the point. South Park always has, and continues to, point out the ridiculousness of our world in a blunt and disgusting way. They point out, and play with, taboos and things we're not 'supposed' to joke about.<br/><br/>I could go on about the parallels in this movie to the initial responses Stone and Parker received making South Park. I could talk about how the movie points out the ridiculous double-standard that Hollywood has regarding content; how the MPAA, and many others, believe that hearing profanity or seeing sexual content will have a greater damaging effect on the population than seeing glorified, gratuitous violence that dehumanizes the on-screen victims. I could even talk about the excellent use of the adults in South Park as representatives of the mob mentality, as well as a population that is complacent in allowing TV to raise their children until they hear something they don't like. I could write essays. I'm sure people already have. South Park is a smart show, and the movie is no exception. Many people can't get past the vulgarity, which is a real shame. They are truly missing out on excellent social commentary.<br/><br/>What I will says is all this movie needed to win me over was Stan's opening ensemble number and Satan's insecure neediness and Disney Heroine-esque solo. And neither of those songs holds a candle to ""La Resistance."" If you're uninterested in reading too much into the message or purpose of your movies, this is a hilarious musical parody from start to finish. There is a ton of pay-off for fans of the series, which doesn't get in the way of new-comers enjoying the film."

","Matt and Trey were smarter with South Park. They made their film version when the show still had a lot of momentum, they also had an opportunity to be a little different in the cinema as even though Stan, Kyle Cartman and muffled Kenny were filthy little buggers they couldn't get away with most of the swears that these little 8 year old wanted to say. In the movies? No f*ckin' worries.<br/><br/>The average South Park episode is better than the average Simpsons episode - has been for about 6 or 7 years. The problem is that when both at their very best The Simpsons is clearly head and shoulders above, only The Simpsons haven't been at their best since the mid 90s. For those in their 20s this means there is a real chance that you swear black and blue that Family Guy and South Park kick The Simpson's yellow arses.<br/><br/>Only at this time I am comparing the movies and letting them battle it out for 80 minute supremacy honours, not which show was better over the decades.<br/><br/>The South Park movie takes all the best SP bits, ludicrous premises, sheer genius stupidity, quality musical bits and smart and insightful messages delivered in a profane way by crude cardboard cutouts. Only South Park could take all this sh*t and have it even vaguely make sense.<br/><br/>They also pull the p*ss out of a lot of celebrities (not always the easy targets too) and have the best ""post-scene"" throw in jokes of any animated show, sometimes the joke has gone and you're wondering if you just heard what you think you did.<br/><br/>This is a seriously short movie but it manages to cram an awful lot in.<br/><br/>(Assuming you know) the boys are going to see the new Terrance and Phillip movie, the romantic comedy (probably) ""Asses of Fire"". Inspired by the flatulent antics and potty talk they head back to home and school and tell everyone all about it, in no uncertain terms.<br/><br/>After a brief brainwash where the profane tendencies are exorcised from their little cardboard bodies they promptly head back to the cinema for another look, afterwards Kenny is inspired by one of the stupid acts and accidentally lights himself on fire. As you can't live with a baked potato in place of your heart the operation to save Kenny fails and he is sent to hell.<br/><br/>Everyone else is grounded, and Cartman gets a chip implanted in his head that emits and electrical shock if he swears.<br/><br/>Due to their role in the death Terrance and Phillip are arrested due to the shrill barkings of Kyle's Mum and many other do-gooders, America goes to war on Canada (where T&P are from) after the Baldwins are bombed and T&P are scheduled for a very public execution during a big army show emceed by Big Gay Al.<br/><br/>{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Meanwhile in Hell Kenny meets Satan, who is shacked up with the recently killed Saddam Hussein (who wasn't actually dead when the film was made), they announce that the spilling of innocent Canadian blood will allow Satan's rise to Earth, where he can turn it into another level of Hell. Nice.<br/><br/>Kenny's ghost comes back to warn the boys, who in a moment of clarity realise they must stop the execution. Fortunately the war, Satan's rise and the big show where Terrance and Phillip are to be killed all happen in South Park. Lucky! There are a myriad sub-plots and everything wraps up nice and neat, there aren't really many high points but some of the many songs are extremely good, especially ""Uncle F*cker"" and ""Kyle's Mum is a bitch"". (What did you expect?) Kenny finally took his hood off which I remember was a big deal apparently at the time, and the boys got to unleash every version and arrangement of the f-word ever thought of.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10.

","This movie is amazing. The only reason I rated it an 8 out of 10 is because of the content. It just is not suitable for some people. But getting beyond that, it is clever, it was unique, and it is still funny. There have been other funny movies that did not hit home the way this one did, however. The reason this one is great is because of the subject. And no, I am not talking about Satan's relationship with Sadam. I am talking about its stance on censorship. I always loved South Park for its social consciousness. Not many shows can do what Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done for 10 or 11 seasons of shows. This movie, however, takes it to the next level( presumably because there was enough extra time to take it to the next level). Just the fact that the mothers got that out of control and wanted to blaim Canada that badly is very typical among parents. They want to blame everyone except for themselves for their kids behavior. Also, I have never seen the harm in a bad word. A word has never killed somebody. If anything, a bad word can be a release for someone who is feeling down or depressed, it is kind of a pick me up. This is another subject South Park addresses. Why are people getting mad at their kids for words, when there are usually bigger problems to deal with? Well, now that my audience has listened to my rant, I will conclude with a suggestion. Watch South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut."

","I'm not a long-time viewer of South Park(those that are... keep your eyes open for in-jokes), but I have taken in a reasonable bit of it. This plays not unlike three episodes of the show, and pretty darn good ones at that. The plot is great, and develops well throughout the entirety of the running time. The writing is almost invariably funny, and a considerable amount is undeniably satirical and smart, to an impressive extent. The self-irony and -referencing raises this above similar releases. This definitely has a lot of offensive material(my personal theory is that Matt and Trey grew up not being allowed to look at, say, and so on, such, and now that they're old enough to call the shots for themselves, they're getting even), and some of it certainly is there for the purpose of outraging those who have little tolerance for such. But for anyone who enjoys the humor that we connect to the series, this is rather likely to have you laughing for most of the 81 minutes. The pacing is fast, without being overwhelming. The songs are quite catchy and well-written. The acting is marvelous, and the guest voices are cool. The animation is the same stubbornly poor kind as we're used to from something with this title, but there are some nice extra stuff thrown in, and the various actual effects are, in fact, magnificent. It would be a shame if someone didn't see past the crude comedy and thusly did not realize that Parker and Stone do have stuff to say(although it is arguably in part their own doing, obviously). There is heavy violence, moderate sexuality and almost constant language herein. If you can tolerate, perhaps even enjoy, musicals and the content that censors frown upon, consider giving this a shot. I recommend this to, in addition to aforementioned, fans of Matt Stone and Trey Parker and their other works. 8/10"

","My first exposure to South Park was the film, Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Experiencing it for the first time, I was shocked, bewildered, and entertained by Stan's search for confidence, Kyle's moral compass, Eric's obnoxious personality, and Kenny's death. The Terrance and Philip movie has swept through South Park. It is so profanity laden, the kids of South Park are imitating the art. This provokes a violent reaction by the parents, it eventually leads to the capture of Terrance and Philip. Since they are Canadian, our neighbor to the north decides to declare war on the U.S. Meanwhile, Satan plans to use the war, particularly the execution of Terrance and Philip to usher in his new reign on the Earth. I will first get a few gripes out of the way. While The Simpsons uses subtle irony and satire to provoke thought, South Park hits the audience over the head with a shovel. There is no subtlety. In fact, sometimes the spirit is downright mean and vicious. In fact, sometimes it slaps fundamentalist puritanical culture with the same hatred it dishes out. This is the predominant weakness of South Park. Parker and Stone work so hard to shock and offend, they often sacrifice that for the message they try to get across. Also, the lovers spat between Saddam Hussein and the Devil was really drawn out too long, making the movie about 20 minutes too long. But there are some things that work. The best part is the humor that rests in both irony and unpredictable dialog and situations. One of my favorite parts was having Cartman rigged up to a V-chip that gives him a shock every time he utters a curse word. Another good scene involves the rescue of Terrance and Philip amidst a very strange USO show featuring Big Gay Al. Another involves the U.S. military strategists shooting Bill Gates for making Windows 98 too hard to handle. What really got me to like this movie, though, was its overbearing satire. Despite the shock factor, most people will get what Parker and Stone are trying to say. At one point, Kyle tries to dissuade his Mom from her vendetta against Terrance and Philip. However, she is so wrapped up in stopping their filth, she forgets to pay attention to her son. Also, one musical number stands out: Blame Canada. Apparently, the parents of South Park were so outraged at Terrance and Phlip, they break into song. Their battle cry is to ""blame Canada before someone thinks of blaming us!"" South Park does push the limit of good taste ... but that is what makes it fun. You could enjoy it ... if you are not too easily offended."

The new T&P movie is extremely vulgar and rated R, but the guys struggled and saw it, so they started to say words like ""you uncle f*cker !"", even more often ""f*ck"" and so on, so Kyle's mom started an association against the Canada, and overall against Terrance and Phillip. (what humorously resulted in Cartman singing a superb extended version of his song ""Kyle's Mom is a Bi**h"") Stan is jealous of a new South Park Elementary student, thinking that he flirts with Wendy. He asks Chef how to make a girl who has already someone in her heart come back to himself, and Chef answers him to find the cl**oris, what he regrets a second after. Kenny's moments are certainly the turning points of everything in the movie, helping the other guys by saying to Satan not to listen to Saddam Hussein, the main villain. At the end, the unhooded Kenny leaves the guys with courage, going back to hell... or heaven, then. Soooooooo. You must definitely see it."

","Now, I think the show was better but this movie was still extremely funny like the bit where Cartman is in the trench and he says "" hey Kyle"" Kyle ""yes Cartman"" Cartman "" When I called you a big fat Jew I did not mean it you are not a Jew"" it was priceless I mean you cannot pay to have laughs like that. Anyway the story is about the 4 boys who go and see an R rated movie and are pronounced Corrupted and from there the mothers convince the American President to plaid all out war on Canada. I think it is funny and shows you what all South Park fans have always wanted to see- Kenny face. Overall this film is a must watch for fans of the show as it keeps the charm of the show and is funny all and all. I rate this movie 78%. GO TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE."

","South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is the feature length version of the TV show South Park. It is longer; more fully developed, and better animated then the brilliant show. It is also more vile and offensive; generally it's more in most ways, whether good or bad. The first three seasons of South Park were created purely with construction paper, after that they began to have more and more computer's involved and now they have images in a data base on the computer that they can move around with the mouse. The movie was the first thing they did with more computers than drawings and cutouts. This was a big step and now the episodes look much better, but have unfortunately lost some of the original look they had. The general plot of the movie is that four eight year old kids from South Park Colorado go to see an R-Rated Canadian movie and learn swear words from it. They begin using these words and are eventually sent to therapy, meanwhile their parents wage war on Canada for stealing the innocence of youth. It basically gets weirder from there on when characters such as Satan, Saddam Hussein, and the kids teacher Mr. Garrison show up. The plot is surprisingly tight and well written for being so difficult to explain; in fact the screenplay is the strongest aspect of the movie. It weaves through the odd world of South Park and makes it believable enough to be hilarious. It also has some of the most quotable lines in movies of late. The animation here was the beginning of using computer animation for the series and while not entirely computer animated most of it was. It works so well though because often it still looks like cardboard even when it isn't. It's 2D and looks incredibly simple, but of course isn't. South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one of the funniest movies out there and it's not just because of the crude jokes. It's because of the political commentary, most of which is spot as well as hilarious, and the fact that it's simply so well done. It's a perfect example of the power of animation because it's not just hilarious but for once you actually feel for the South Park characters."

","SOUTH PARK:BIGGER LONGER & UNCUT is one of the best movies I've seen, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Movie being on top. This movie was more evil and twisted than the television show. No bleeping noise when they say the ""F"" word. In fact, that was half what this movie was about.<br/><br/>The boys see a Terrance & Phillip movie and after the movies, they attempt to light Kenny's fart on fire like Terrance and Phillip did in the movie. Kenny got caught on fire and he is taken to a hospital. The boys are grounded. Later again they see the movie and cuss in school.. Or did they do that first? I don't remember because it has been a while since I've seen this movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie if you are a South Park fan or if you just love funny cartoon adult movies with bad language and violence.

","The televised exploits of Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman were greeted by some with praise, for its exaggerated satirical exploits of small town life: conversely, they have also been criticised for destroying the moral fabric of society. Needless to say, those falling into the latter category won't find much to enjoy here and will probably dislike this film more, with its 399 instances of swearing, a lot of words which were bleeped out when broadcast on the show. That said, this film is positively tame in comparison with recent series of the show, which have featured blistering attacks on Scientology, Mormons, and ginger kids.<br/><br/>The story, loosely held together by musical numbers, concerns the boys seeing the profane Terrence & Philip movie A***s Of Fire, which leads the boys to some fine inventive swearing: 'Sh*t-faced, rectal wart', anyone? The parents take offence and start a war against Canada. Meanwhile, Sadaam & Satan are plotting to takeover Earth, and Stan is on a quest to find the clitoris.<br/><br/>It is in the musical numbers that a lot of the films best points are exhibited, choice examples being the excessively crude 'Uncle Fukka', Sadaam Hussains 'I Can Change', and the reprise of 'Kyles Mum Is A Bitch'. The satire is strong as the plot of the film seems to be allegorical about the American reaction to the T.V. inception of South Park, most laughably in how it was mentioned around the time of the Columbine massacre.<br/><br/>There are points when it all gets a bit too much. Satans 'Up There' song isn't funny and is an irritating song too. Also, the Stans clitoris subplot feels tacked on. South Park - The Movie, though, remains hilarious and will please fans of the show and reaches the heights of the benchmark TV animation adaptation to film, Beavis & Butthead Do America."
"famelovingboy68","Null","0","0","29 September 2006"," I'd much rather watch the TV show
","It wasn't too bad, if you ask me, but I think the TV series, is possibly the most entertaining animated show on TV.At times, asinine as it may sound, it seems to be more than one genre, it can get to our emotions at times, as in Kenny dies and A Ladder to heaven and be dark, as in the Butter's show episode, and straightmen Stan and Kyle, can be soulful, sensitive, expressive, and convincing. Kenny seems lovable and charming, but perverted. It can also teach lessons about humanity, it is not based on vulgarity. However, I didn't find the incessant shut your F*****n face uncle F****r, from the Terrence and Phillip movie, that funny. The funniest part, I think, is the devil, as a nice guy being in a romantic relationship with Suddam Hussein, who cares only about sex, and how the devil says how "" he doesn't nurture my emotions "" even though that's about as absurd as you can get, I found it funny, but not wet my pants laughing funny. That Mars and Venus study that is extreme and offensive, not to mention annoying, is portrayed as being the Devil (from Venus) and Saddam (from Mars) when the devil is reading a book in bed, so they are individuals, not the two genders that seem to be stereotyped more than anyone. Eric Cartman really seems like the leader, as he is the most outspoken and main character in the movie. Wendys ""boyfriend"" is not cool, to me, as a little kid with the deep voice of a British boy whose voice dropped in the third grade, and an overly sophisticated manner.<br/><br/>The kids and parents life at home is hardly seen. Kenny taking his hood off and speaking(voiced by Mike Judge) was one of the reasons I watched it, but the scene, right after the climax, was rather melancholy to me. M'ckay!"

They should know better than to go see it. I've seen it several times and laugh right up through the end title song by Michael MacDonald. I'm still outraged that ""Blame Canada"" didn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song! I've seen and enjoyed plenty of good musicals. Oh, and I've hated plenty, too, but that's not important. This is a GOOD musical and even those for whom this movie is tasteless and offensive would have to admit that. The music is good, very good and blends well with the story, which is pretty basic. Terrence and Phillip, Canada's greatest comedy duo make an R rated musical that the boys see. I won't go into who the boys are or explain any characters. Sorry, no time or desire to get into it. Anyway, they come out spouting the dialogue, much of which is pretty filthy. Well, Canada gets the blame and one thing leads to another, and war is declared. Some celebrity's die in the process, but that's life, eh? There's a fair amount of social commentary in this film, as is the norm for Matt and Trey and of course, nothing is spared.

","Usually whenever a TV show makes the jump to the big screen, something gets lost; South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is the best exception to this routine. Never before had such a tremendous middle finger to the MPAA and censorship in general been released in theatres nationwide. And to think, all along, the secret weapons were four animated foul-mouthed children in winter garb. SP:BL&U is a musical (Music and lyrics by Marc Shaiman and Parker), slightly ripping off Les Miserables, following Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman who all see a new R-rated movie based on their favorite TV show and return spewing newly learned profanities. Their flabbergasted parents blame the Canadian stars of the popular movie, starting a war, an execution, the untimely deaths of many celebrities, and the takeover of Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein all at once. It's so hard to choose my favorite scene (the war room scene has its inspired moments, with Bill Gates getting blown away and the emancipation proclamation being disregarded as ""hip hop""), but I believe I'll go with ""Up There,"" a Little Mermaid-esquire solo delivered with wide range by the prince of darkness. It's probably wrong of me to promote such ""toylet yumuh"" with a perfect rating, but the film is perfect through my eyes, mostly due to its message of taking responsibility for one's own self or else be prepared for the worst of consequences.

Here we find our 4 heroes Stan Marsh, Kyle Brofloski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormic have gone to see an R rated film (Asses of Fire) made by their favorite Canadian comedians who specialize in Fart and Butt jokes Terrance and Phillip. At school and around their ""quiet, little, redneck mountain town"" they start to repeat all the dirty words they heard in the movie. The parents find out and rage war against Canada. Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and Saddam Hussien are Homosexual lovers who make a plan to take over the world via USA vs CANADA war. So the boys decide to defy their parents and save Terrence and Phillip all while Stan tries to win Wendy back from ""that Gregory kid"" who has ""a 4 point o grade point average and his strategy to do that is to find the clitoris (as learned by Chef). Not only is this movie laugh out loud, squirt beer out of your nose funny but it is also very political and has a good message about freedom of speech.

"IridescentTranquility","7","0","0","6 June 2006"," South Park - the Musical!
","I'm not going to start this comment by talking about the swearing, but instead about the music. South Park as a TV programme has never struck me as being especially music-driven, but I seriously think Trey Parker and Matt Stone should consider renaming it South Park - The Musical. Strange as this comparison sounds, there were a few moments that reminded me of the recent version of Chicago (and I never thought I'd ever draw a parallel like that). Also, Satan's song - maybe it's the way Satan's drawn - is like a moment from a Walt Disney film.<br/><br/>Look past the swearing and the violence (which I'll return to) and - if you know how to look - you can almost see very mundane truths about life. The Blame Canada song is a great example - it's a brilliant interpretation of mob mentality (and, dare I say it?, perhaps it's even applicable seven years later) and it also reminds me of that classic parent-child battle - if you ban it then the kids just try harder to see it or do it.<br/><br/>I didn't see this film until earlier this years, so I wonder if Trey Parker and Matt Stone had a sixth sense when they put this film together - the declaring war part and the inclusion of Saddam Hussein seem spooky watching it in 2006.<br/><br/>A final bit I can't allow to get away is about poor Kenny. South Park being what it is, I suppose it was inevitable that he had to die but I don't think I've seen him do it so graphically before. The ghost of Kenny is a nice touch - for the first time ever we see a continuation of his death, but I don't feel that he deserved to go to Hell."

When they swear, it's so natural that it almost has a poetic rhythm. If one of them feels his feeling are hurt (especially Cartman), he retaliates with a blast of profanity. In some cases, as with the ""C"" word, the characters don't even know what they are dealing with. They take advice as genuine and go from there. No one gets left out when it comes to a lambasting. The parents are the real nut cases. The kids are trying to find a way to get their heroes, the Canadian comedy team, off of death row where the parents and the military have put them for misleading their youth. Who's doing the misleading? <br/><br/>The subplot in Hell with Satan and Saddam Hussein is amazing. Satan is a really sensitive, introspective fellow, while Saddam is the nut case maniac. This, of course, is pre 9/11. In addition to the clever animation and voices, there are some great songs. ""Blame Canada"" is great and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" is so over the top, it makes me giggle. Why did they pick this person as the object of the song other than for us to ask this question.

","I wanna describe this film in 3 words: funny as hell. Speaking of hell you get a good look into it as well. What could be funnier than 8 year old cursing up a storm? A love affair between Satan and Saddam Hussein. It doesn't get much stranger than that. Or America in a war with floppy headed Canadians. And Terrence and Phillips ""Shut Your F-ing Face Uncle F-er"" song, or the fact a song like ""Blame Canada"" can be nominated for a Oscar. Its brilliant comedy. Trashy and disgusting, with some very tasteful moments. I was surprised because I didn't think this would be a funny film at all, but I was sadly mistaken. Its better than Beavis And Butt Do America an Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story. Watch it without laughing, I dare you. And while your at it, count the number of curses in it. It'll save me time to and you can just tell me."

","A glorious self parody I had not been a massive fan of the South Park series, it was a bit hit and miss for me so I waited for the DVD to watch this film. To put it simply, this film blew me away. On the surface this film seems quite normal looking at the several relationships between the main characters, and 2 of Americas perceived biggest enemies (still as fitting in 2005 as it was when made). Underneath this, and the normal South Park humour is a clever self parody that says more about American life than 100 documentaries. If that wasn't enough we are given some fantastic musical moments far better than anything Disney has to offer. I enjoyed the sound track so much I bought it and still play in now all these years after the film. Make sure you wait and hear the second song during the end titles, it is amazing and I believe was meant to be in the main film but was cut.<br/><br/>I do not want to say anymore in case I spoil the film for people who haven't seen it yet. Just go and watch, then watch it again and see how this film works on so many levels.<br/><br/>The best cartoon film ever."

","Absolutely hilarious! Eminem meets Orphan Annie! The songs were probably the best part of the whole movie. They were so well written and able to tell a story and be obscene at the same time. I would put the kids to bed, because with songs like ""Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B****"", ""Shut Your F***ing Face, Uncle F***a"", and with over 300 cuss words said in the duration of the movie, as well as references to drugs and sex, it's definitely not for children. Other than that, the story is a funny one, and the songs are cute. Definitely a must see if you're a South Park fan or you don't object to things like cussing, sex, and drugs. The most offensive musical of the 20th century!"

","As if Southpark isn't the greatest TV show of all time, Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to go and make the greatest movie of all time. I've never given a movie a 10/10 before and I probably never will again. This movie is so funny and clever you wonder why these guys aren't ruling the world.<br/><br/>The regular school boys Stan Marsh (Trey Parker), Kyle Broflowski (Matt Stone), Eric Cartman (Trey Parker), and Kenny McKormic (Matt Stone) have found themselves in peril again. But this time they're stuck in the middle of World War 3, Canada VS. U.S.A. all because they sneacked into an R rated movie, Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire, and learned some really bad words. Now the kids are off to settle their own problems, as well as the countries.<br/><br/>This movie had me laughing so hard I felt sick. And when I found out the movie was a musical a cried tears of happiness. It just worked so well that you wonder why the show itself isn't a musical. If this movie doesn't win an Oscar I might kill myself. This is the perfect movie."

","I have been a fan of the South Park show for quite some time now, and I have always hated how they block out the swear words! In my opinion, its far more annoying to her ""beep"" than f**k and s**t so I was glad that they didn't do that in the movie. ""South Park: Bigger, longer and uncut"" starts off with Stan's version of the song ""Mountain town"" which he sings as he goes around town rounding up his friends, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman to go to the Terrance and Phillip movie,""Asses of fire."" Kenny's mom lets him skip Sunday morning church to go to the movie, so the two boys make their way over to Kyles house. They find him in the front yard kicking his baby brother Ike through the window. Kyle lies to his mom and tells her they're going ice skating. She agrees to let him go as long as he took Ike with him. Then they all go over to get Cartman, who is, as usual, sitting on the couch with some cheesy poofs watching TV. When all five boys including Kyles baby brother get to the theater and ask for their tickets, the ticket guy refuses to sell them any because the movie contains ""naughty language."" They decide to pay a homeless guy to sneak them in. When he does, the boys give him ten bucks to go buy some vodka. When the movie starts, Terrance and Phillip immediately start swearing and singing their song ""Uncle F***a."" everybody leaves the theater except the boys who are having a great time, carefully learning every swear word said through out the movie. After the movie they head over to the ice rink singing the song. Stan notices Wendy the girl he is madly in love with, skating with a new kid named Gregory. Every time Stan tries to talk to Wendy, he barfs in her face, and he did so as soon as she skated over and said hi. Wendy likes Gregory because he is smart and political. They are the only two kids who don't like Terrance and Phillip. At school the next day Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Stan got caught swearing continuously in class and were sent to the office to speak with the school counceller Mr.Mackey. When their moms found out they were very mad and started M.A.C. (Mothers Against Canada.) Since Terrance and Phillip are Canadian they decided to blame them for teaching their children foul language. After Mr.Mackeys lecture, the children were dismissed for personal reflection time which they spent at the theater seeing the movie again. Afterwards, Cartman bets him $100 that he can't light a fart on fire. Kenny tries...and succeeds! He burns to a crisp and is rushed to the hospital. There, the doctors begin hacking him up, removing his organs, and heating up his heart in the microwave. When Kenny wakes up, they tell him that they have accidentally replaced his heart with a baked potato and he has three seconds to live. Kenny dies and is denied access to Heaven. He falls down to Hell instead and is greeted by Satan and Saddam Hussein. meanwhile, the adults are still trying to get their children to stop swearing so the plan on using v-chips. Little patches that are inserted under the child's skin, which gives them a shock of electricity whenever the say a swear word. Cartman was the one they put one in to test it out. It worked. Then there was an announcement on TV that there would be a war between Canada and America. Also, Terrance and Phillip would be executed. The boys didn't want their idols to be killed so they organized a secret club, ""La Resistance,"" to rescue them. Stan thought the idea would make him seem more political and get Wendy to like him. At the meeting Gregory gave the boys ""The Mole's"" address. The Moles real name is Kristoff. He had done this type of thing before and they hoped that he would be able to help them. The mole agrees, and said he would sneak them into the USO show where Terrance and Phillip would be executed. Kyle and Stan's job was to stall the show while he dug a hole underneath the stage and broke out Terrance and Phillip. They got Big Gay Al to sing a song. Cartmans job was to shut off the alarms. he didn't and guard dogs attacked The Mole. But before he died, he managed to free Terrance and Phillip. Then the war started. Satan and Saddam Hussein came up from Hell to take over the world, but Satan was getting angry at Saddam hussien cause he wanted to do it all himself. Kenny came up too. Cartman's v-chip went all screwy. instead of getting shocked when he swore, he could shoot electricity. So he began swearing his face off and shooting electric bolts at Saddam Hussein. Satan finishes Saddam off by tossing him down to Hell again where his body was impaled on a sharp rock. Satan thanked Kenny for helping him see that Saddam was an a**hole, and said he could have one wish. Kenny said that he wanted everything to go back to normal before the war, even though he knew that he would go back to hell too. Satan agreed to grant his wish, and for the first time Kenny removed his hood and said to his friends, ""Goodbye you guys!"" Then all the war soldiers and minions disappeared. Everything was back to normal, except the Canadians and Americans were friends again. When they looked up into the sky, they saw Kenny. Instead of going back down to Hell, he soared up to Heaven.<br/><br/>This was a great movie and i would give it a perfect score! 10/10!"
"Into_The_West","10","0","0","7 May 2005"," The Animated Musical Grows Up
","The South Park movie has always been one of my favorites. A major question would be why. One reason is the successful translation of a TV show into a film, with the film being far superior. Another is this is an animated musical where you actually like the songs. Another is this is a very mature animated feature whose mature elements don't seem there just for shock.<br/><br/>But this is also an insightful view of society in the late Clinton years, people wrapped up in battles to maintain ""family values,"" and in doing so promoting hatred and prejudice. But this displaced perspective on right and wrong seems to stretch all the way up to Heaven (where Kenny is rejected) and Hell (where George Burns and Gandhi are accepted).<br/><br/>Satan also is sympathetic, something that drives evangelicals crazy. But the fact is this movie is strongly about Christian ideas in the compassion and self-sacrifice of Kenny. In what seems a not too hidden analogy, Kenny goes to Hell to redeem the world. He also is so compassionate, he can even care about the pain and suffering of Satan, himself.<br/><br/>Indeed, amidst all the profanity uttered, one might miss that this film ends quite sentimentally, with allusions to the ""summer of love"" end of Yellow Submarine and with Kenny reprieved from Hell and getting his wings as he flies into Heaven. And perhaps that is the point. As Cartman notes ""it doesn't hurt anybody."" Along with this view, there are other favorite targets of Parker's, such as the American love of seeing people executed. How far is ""Tomorrow night we'll be entertained/An execution, what a sight!"" from ""Cannibal! the Musical""'s ""It's as nice as a day can be/won't you come to the hanging with me?"" There are, however, two sad things about the film. One is in many ways the United States has become very much like it is in this movie, acting, as Gregory says, ""as policeman for the world."" It almost feels chillingly prophetic to see Saddam Hussein's country attacked by the US (Note: in the South Park Universe, Saddam is Canadian, as evidenced by his flapping head).<br/><br/>The other thing is that thing film is a testament to the genius of a cartoon voice artist who belongs up there with Mel Blanc, June Foray, Paul Frees, Mae Questyl, and Jack Mercer: Mary Kay Bergman. Not only does she do the speaking voices of all the mothers, but the singing voices, too. In the great ""Blame Canada"" number, she does 16 different voice parts. In the final reprise of ""Mountain Town,"" she can be heard at the end hitting a High C.<br/><br/>Sadly, only four months after the debut of what had been her greatest achievement, she took her own life, having suffered with crushing, but unrevealed fears. It is tragic to see this film as her swan song, but on the other hand, she managed to give ample proof of her greatness before she left us, and in a movie I think will become (if it hasn't already become) a classic of animated cinema, and cinema in general."

This movie is about Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kyles Canadian baby brother Ike, and Kenny going to see the R rated Terrence and Phillip film and becoming influenced to swear by it. The school counseler Mr. Mackey does a swearing rehab for them, ending in them seeing the film again. Kenny is influenced that he can light his farts on fire by it and he does, but he catching on fire and dies going to Hell. Meanwhile, the parents of South Park get mad at Terrence and Phillip, who are both Canadian, so they start a fight. It ends in the Baldwin actors being bombed so a war starts. Kenny is in Hell and Satan and the newly dead Saddam Houssain are gay lovers, but Saddam only thinks of sex. Kenny tells Satan he should dump him. Meanwhile, Cartman gets a V-chip implanted in his head so he cant swear and him, Stan and Kyle make a big protest group against killing Terrence and Phillip. During the execution of them, Cartman helps them out, but Stan said that if the two Canadians blood hit American soil, he would come to Earth. Totally entertaining with 14 toe tapping, though slightly short, that last about 25 minutes for all the songs. George Clooney is cool as an uncaring doctor. The Kenny Going to Hell animation is really cool, where totally flatly animated Kenny is in 3-D Hell(done with computer animation). Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, sings the last song in the film. Watch it! My rating:A.

The movie contains several original catchy jingles, like La Resistance, Blame Canada, Mountain Town, and It's Easy, Mmmkay (as you can guess, feat. Mr. Mackey). I give this movie thumbs up, hilarious, yet I agree that it shouldn't be for those under a certain age. They take full advantage of the R rating, just a heads up.

","9/10 South Park is one of those terrific little films that people (and by people, I mean critics) find it hard to like. But like they did, only with the reservation that they were liking something that uses the f-word far too often for it to be clever. Who would have thought that this South Park creation would be getting a rating of 83% on rottentomatoes.com? It turns out that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have churned out an absolute gem of a movie. What surprised most people is that, basically, we have an eighty minute long musical. With this premise, Stone and Parker managed to create an incredibly original and funny political satire. Yes, that's right, political satire AND musical all in one; even if the satire is not exactly subtle. They pushed the boat out, trying to see how far they could go in this day and age. A brave move to make, and a move that paid off in abundance.<br/><br/>The best jokes come from a weird and wide variety of contexts, one example being the Satan/Saddam Hussein love affair. Stone and Parker have done well not only create something that is consistently funny but also to create a FILM - not just an extended episode of their series. You get the feeling that this story line would only work at the cinema, which is a massive achievement.<br/><br/>Although this is not life changing, nor is it one that will break all rules in film-making, it is extremely funny and inventive. In 1980, 'Airplane!' was released and provided a fresh look to comedy - taking slapstick to a whole new level. The jokes were certainly not subtle, and could easily be considered crass. The same goes here. And whilst the jokes have a little more depth (are Trey and Matt telling us that TV and films have gone too far or that peoples objections to TV and film go too far?) they don't have the same impact that the ones in Airplane! did all those decades ago.<br/><br/>For those that like to laugh at clever fart jokes (maybe this film has finally told us that a clever fart joke doesn't need to be an oxymoron) this is for you. For those that are offended by the use of swearing in movies, perhaps you should go see Toy Story 2. I gave this film 9/10."

If you're small-minded, uptight, or easily offended this movie isn't for you. I thought it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Just when you think they won't say that or go there they do and this movie pushes the boundaries of good taste. It's a classic. The musicals grate on your nerves sometimes but some of them are funny.

"justafanuk","Null","0","0","12 August 2003"," AKA South Park: Everything And The Kitchen Sink
","I first saw South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut when it was initially released in the cinema. I can't remember much of it except laughing helplessly for the duration. And for some reason I forgot about it. Never got it on DVD at the time as I thought a decent release would be made available in the future. A few years pass and I find I don't have the same television access I used to for new South Park episodes. A few years more and I catch the occasional episode and realise South Park is still as great as when it began. This prompted my frustrated searching for DVD's of episodes that weren't ridiculously expensive. The first thing I got hold of was the DVD of this incredible film. When I first watched it I was amazed at not only how good and hilarious it still was, but that it was still pretty inflammatory and shocking at times. Subsequent viewings gave me no choice but to hold it in the highest possible esteem as one of my favourite films. If you want a plot summary before we continue, you'll find it on the main page.<br/><br/>The film races along at a tremendous pace, with barely a second of screen time wasted. This is one of the most minimalist films I've seen, certainly in terms of dialogue. Matt and Trey don't seem to have heard of the term 'exposition', for which we can only be thankful. The minimum amount of information is conveyed between characters but to maximum effect for the audience, i.e. there's never a point in the film that doesn't feel relevant to what's going on. Every scene belongs in the film, which sounds strange but think about how many films you've seen which has moments you felt the film could have been stronger without. I don't think this applies to South Park, everything is in there for a reason.<br/><br/>I think Matt Stone and Trey Parker must be two of the most intelligent guys working in the business today. This is shown every week on the show with the quality and economy of the writing and the ease with which they take aim at targets just waiting and deserving to be satirised. In the film these targets take the form of the military, religion, censorship, education, musicals, death and many more that I can't recall off-hand. I can't remember ever seeing a film which managed to combine, and effectively hit, so many targets, and to do it as well as it has in this film. Perhaps the best example in this film of how good their level of satire is, is based in the wonderful mockeries of Disneyesque songs. Every song in this film is incredible, with Matt and Trey working alongside Mark Shaiman to produce some of the most memorable songs I've heard. The fact that I regularly play the CD soundtrack is testament to that. The songs are not only expertly composed and crafted, with wonderfully skewed and satirical lyrics, but they're also performed far better than I would imagine. Remember this is mainly just Matt and Trey singing on these tracks. And the singing's actually pretty damn good! I mean what else can these guys do?! On a wee side note, anyone who loves the songs on this film as I do should really pick up the soundtrack. Some on the songs have been reworked slightly to fit better away from visual accompaniments, and while they sound a bit strange at first because of that, repeated listens will reveal them to be even better. And again, as a note to how good these songs are, is the fact that they stand up well on their own away from the film.<br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't seen this film yet (and I hope age would be the only barrier there) there are some comments coming that could be construed as spoilers.<br/><br/>I was also quite shocked at how moral this film seems to be. 'Moral' and 'South Park' are two words that are generally placed at the opposite end of the spectrum, but I disagree. (I find it ludicrously hilarious that the Christian CAP movement denounced this as one of the most anti-moral films they'd ever 'reviewed'. But that's what can happen when you only take things at face value) There are quite a number of moments where this film teaches, what I will refer to as, 'life lessons'. And you can argue that this is just character moments, and yes they are, but look at the film and the context that they're in and tell me if you expected this. (Smart enough viewers who see this in the series every week can ignore this poser)<br/><br/>Example 1. The Satan and Saddam sub-plot. The behaviour and dialogue in all they're scenes immediately puts me in mind of a thousand bad relationships I've seen in real-life and onscreen. Saddam having the part of the uncaring and uncouth partner, Satan being the subservient significant other, always failing to please and not understanding the other. With the emphasis on Satan clearly being in the right, and trying to do the right thing, you have Satan teaching people how they should behave in a relationship if it is to survive. How subversive is that?!? Example 2. Kyle and his mother. All throughout the film there's is an action/reaction relationship. Kyle does something wrong and Sheila reacts to it. Usually badly. Well in this case she brought about the second coming of Satan and 1000 years of darkness, so. This relationship is similar to how the other kids and their mothers act, but Sheila is the voice for all and is clearly portrayed as the one of the 'reactionary people'. Those people who act before thinking. And no, that is definitely NOT a good thing. Even THIS is shown in the film. Little life lessons shown within the big life lessons. And by the end of the film, we have Kyle telling his mother that she needs to talk more to him if she wants to understand him. Again, in a film like this, where, although clearly marketed for adults, will be seen by masses of children, to have a character of a kid telling other kids who are watching to communicate better with their parents, I find simply astonishing. There are other moments like these dotted throughout the film but these were the two main examples that stuck with me.<br/><br/>I briefly mentioned at the start as to how I was still shocked in parts when watching this. Part of that was the moral aspect of the film, but mainly it was due to the content and what they managed to get away with. I actually think they missed some opportunities, for instance I only briefly glimpsed their Jesus character while he was marching with the troops, but given the involvement of Satan it seems strange that they didn't feature him more. Think of the 'Damien' episode and you'll see what I mean. But in terms of context at least, I'm not sure I've seen anything as shocking as an eight year girl wearing a 'c*ckmaster' t-shirt! To say nothing of the internet incident featuring Cartman's mum! And let us not forget the lyrical implications of 'Uncle F*cka'! But then they topped even those with the use of the words Ba*bara Stre*sland in Cartman's final expletive filled burst to defeat Saddam! What's also interesting is that the film manages to deftly mix contrasting styles of humour, the examples above no doubt fall into the crude category but there are also moments of smart comedy. For instance, the scene with the military commander outlining the plan for the white soldiers to 'get behind the darkies'. When Chef asks if the commander has ever heard of the 'emancipation proclamation', the commander replies that he doesn't listen to hip-hop. That scene also makes some rather pointed comments about race in the military without resorting to making a big statement about it. Or how about when Stan is using his parents PC and has to 're-route the encryption' in the space of about five seconds, neatly taking a swipe at films where computer programmes are hacked into all too easily.<br/><br/>
But I think the one thing that will stay with me most is the laughs and the tears (of laughter). From George Clooney's voiceover doctor cheerfully whistling the opening song as he saunters away from Kenny's (literal) deathbed to Mr Garrison's exclamation that 'ALL the Baldwin's are dead?!?' to the location and position of Stan when finds the clitoris to Satan's scrunched eye falsetto during his big number 'Up There', it's a fun filled romp for all the family. Watch it with kids, grandparents and pets alike."

","Usually I don't like movies that sing and dance through out the whole movie. But ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is not like all the other musicals. I think it was real creative for Matt Stone and Trey Parker to think of Sidam Husane having a love affair with Satin. That was kind of stange though to make all the Canadians look like a paper doll instead of like all the other Characters in the movie. It was also weird to have an angry mob of people hate Canada because of a canadian movie Staring Tarence and Phillip in ""Asses of fire"" with some bad language instead of violence.<br/><br/>
I love this movie because it literally blew me out of my chair and onto the gound laughing. This movie made me laugh and it made me cry. My favorite part in the movie was Kenny's good-bye.

","After reading many of the comments posted for South Park i am seriously glad that 99 per cent of you feel the same way i do about this gloriously funny and farsical film. Firstly i must point out the people who should NOT see this film: 1: Deeply religious types and/or people in league with saddam (you will not want to see your idol in bed with the devil quoting 'mmm, you like that don't you Bitch?'). 2: People easily offended by coarse language (there are over 400 uses of the most common swear word in the english language). 3: Midgets in bikini's might be slightly offended by the gratuitous use of your otherwise admirable use of clothing. 4: Donkey Raping S*** eaters might also find themselves scrutinised by the pigeon holeing aimed at their questionable antics.<br/><br/>I can honestly say i have never heard a cinema full of people laugh so loud to a film in all my life. I missed a lot of the dialogue not only because of the roaring laughter all around me but also because i was crying with laughter. The only people i saw who were not impressed were a row of french students (who left half way through the film) who i think thought they were coming to see Amelie! Mat and Trey are a very intelligent collaboration as the film does not consist of just toilet humour but some quite poingnant undertones about the society in which we reside. It is a satire aimed at all who take this environment far to seriously and it throws it in your face for us all to laugh at. The Musical score is genius also, showing us all that the talent of Matt and Trey does not lie just with film making. I liked the fact that they got good old George Clooney back for a cameo as the doctor who accidentally replaces Kennys heart with a baked potato! I always liked Clooney but this role compounds my already good view of a man who likes good humour and is obviously very down to earth.<br/><br/>All in all, South Park is an awsome film which should have won oscars. My only disappointment is that i fear i shall never laugh as hard again.<br/><br/>Shut your f****** face uncle f*****, you're a c*** biting a** licking uncle f*****...... hoo hoo.

Once they did, the kids change their language and all they do is swear. Enough is enough and Kyle's mom decided to declare war against...ahum...Canada! In the meantime Kenny has already been killed and sent to hell at where he discovers that Satan has a homosexual affair with Sadam Hussein! Of course our remaining kids must deliver their filmheroes from death, as the American government has decided to put them on the electric chair! South Park, the movie, has become a musical. I kid you not, even a sort of tribute to the classic musical and most of the songs are top! Even if it's kind of hurting for the ears when you're in the theatre hearing Eric Cartman sing! This movie is full of jokes and despite the fact it's not art, it's more humoristic than tons of other comedy crap that is doing the business (perhaps Eddie Murphy can view some episodes from South Park, just a hint....).

"coolmule","9","0","0","28 July 2003"," Quite simply the funniest movie I've ever seen
","*******some spoilers************<br/><br/>When South Park first appeared on TV, I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen, and for a short while it even replaced The Simpsons as my all time favourite TV show. But after a while I grew bored with it - the show seemed to be a one trick pony, and unlike The Simpsons it seemed it could only be funny when it was being offensive, even though I admired a TV show which went out of it's way to offend as many people as possible. So I didn't see South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut in a theatre. And that is something I've regretted ever since I saw the film on video, because it is quite simply: 1) the best comedy I have ever seen; 2) along with Monty Python's Life of Brian and Dr. Strangelove, the best satire I've ever seen; and 3) the best musical I have ever seen. <br/><br/>What, I hear you ask, the best musical I've ever seen? Better than Moulin Rouge or The Producers? You bet. Leaving aside for a moment the content of the lyrics, rarely can a film have featured so many instantly catchy songs, even if the majority of them are only 1 minute long. Their short length is actually a strength, making them more memorable and stopping the obscene content of the lyrics from seeming too gratuitous. Of course, the songs deliberately rip off virtually every other musical going, from Les Miserables to Disney's The Little Mermaid, but again this is a strength - all the melodies sound vaguely familiar, which makes the lyrics sound even more inappropriately funny. Actually the songs are almost like a form of punk, with their short length and ripped off melodies. And of course the lyrics. I would say at least 50% of what makes this film so hysterically funny and gloriously offensive are the songs. In particular ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"", ""Blame Canada"", the ""La Resistance"" medley and ""Kyle's Mom's a B***h"" are brilliant, but standing head and shoulders above them all, at least in terms of offensiveness and being infectiously catchy is the now legendary ""Uncle F***a"". Make no mistake, you will be singing this tune out loud for at least two weeks after seeing the movie, often in the most inappropriate places. Trey Parker and Matt Stone must have realised the effect the song would have, as the film even makes a joke out of the its catchiness, with the boys constantly singing it out loud in class, on the street, etc.<br/><br/>As I said above, at least 50% of the comedy in this film probably comes from the songs, but that doesn't mean the other 40-odd% is any way substandard. Yes, most of it is based around deliberately gratuitous swearing and purposefully trying to offend as many people as possible, but this is necessary for the film's satire to work (more on this in a moment). The film's short running time means that the jokes come far thicker and faster than even in the likes of Airplane. I don't want to spoil any of it, but I will just say this - you will never have laughed so long or so hard as you will do on seeing this film. You will be sore laughing. Your head will hurt from laughing. I'm laughing thinking about the film as I type this.  <br/><br/>
South Park is so way out beyond the pale in terms of offensiveness that it would probably still be funny even if there was no point to it. But undoubtedly what elevates the film above other bad taste comedies to the level of a true classic is the satirical content. Of course there's the obvious satire of parent's blaming TV for their kid's behaviour instead of paying more attention to their offspring, but the film also riffs heavily on US foreign policy. Actually, for a film made four years before the current Gulf War, the film is frighteningly current - the US invades a country without UN backing and a comedy Saddam Hussein is cast as being in league with the Devil - axis of evil, anyone?<br/><br/>In summary, so long as you can stand an f word count of well over 100, not to mention over two hundred other profanities, numerous references to obscene sexual practices and bucketloads of gore in the war scenes, you owe it to yourself to give this film a chance - don't let the deliberately rubbish animation or your views of the TV show put you off, because otherwise you'll be missing out on the funniest 80 minutes in cinema history.<br/><br/>Rating - 9/10"

","Somewhere between love and honour, somewhere between courage and not courage somewhere between Ohio and Utah lies South Park<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut  review South park is a quiet and peaceful town until the latest Terrance and Philip movie comes out. Once all the kids see it, all hell breaks loose, as the parents try to find a way to stop their kids from saying all the naughty words coming out of their mouths. The parents blame Terrance and Philip, place them under Citizen's Arrest, and declare war on their home country, Canada. It is up to the kids to save the world from Satan and keep Terrance and Philip from being executed The animation is deliberately simple, like elements cut out of construction paper. Characters consist of simple arrangements of basic geometrical shapes in bright colors. The movie is crass, rude, yet funny as all hell.  Their brilliant move is to combine razor-sharp satire with a surreal and absurd cartoon .There is no doubt that South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut has plenty to offer filmgoers who enjoy lots and lots of crude jokes. From start to finish, they permeate the film. It's a mini-course in swearing that taught me a new term or two. I laughed. I did not always feel proud of myself while I was laughing, however. The biggest difference between the movie and the television series is that along with everything else, the film is a Disney-style (or anti-Disney, if you will) musical with 15 songs. The musical numbers are wonderfully entertaining. Especially clever is Mr. Mackey's song about alternatives to using dirty words and the Oscar-nominated 'Blame Canada'. If you're easily offended, or have never seen South Park, STAY AWAY!"
"jimbo25202","Null","0","0","6 July 2003"," Way better than the TV show
","This movie is a hilarious satire which pokes fun at everything from censorship to musicals.  In this movie, our 4 young heroes-lovesick average kid Stan Marsh, brainy Jewish boy Kyle Brovlovski, angry fatboy Eric Cartman, and poor hard-luck Kenny McCormick sneak into an R-rated movie starring flatulant Canadian actors Terrance & Phillip, who make Beavis & Butthead look like altar boys.  The foul language and toilet humor of the movie rubs off on the boys and they start cussing twice as much as usual. In response, Terrance & Phillip are arrested and put on death row for corrupting America's youth, and the boy's parents incite a war with Canada. Meanwhile, Satan and his new lover, Saddam Hussein, plan to take over the world as soon as Terrance & Phillip are executed.  It's up to the four plucky prepubsants to save the world, as well as their idols, Terrance & Phillip. Although this movie has a spot in the Guiness Book of Records for most swearing in a film, it doesn't seem so bad coming from a child's mouth. Stan, the most mild-mannered of the bunch, hardly cusses at all, while his companions spout 4-lettered words every chance they get.  And although their mothers are hell-bent on cleaning up their language, even going so far as to plant V-chips in children, ultimately, it's Cartman's dirty mouth that saves the day. This movie also has quite a few memorable musical numbers, including the Oscar nominee ""Blame Canada,"" the energetic and motivational ""What Would Brian Boitano Do,"" the hilarious chant-along ""Kyle's Mom's a B*tch,"" and, of course, the funniest (and most offensive) song I have ever heard, ""Uncle F*cka."" So will Satan and Saddam's plan succeed?  Will the boys save Terrance & Phillip?  Will Stan find the clitoris?  See this movie and find out!"

","That sums it up pretty well, but what it doesn't express is that South Park actually manages to sustain the laughter over the length of an entire movie, something most TV-to-film adaptations fail. And although its critics will point to the incredible amount of swearing and other questionable situations the movie involves, what they miss is that this is actually far more intelligent than most movies aimed at the teen audience. After all, what better way to frame a satire on censorship than in a film completely packed with bad-taste moments?<br/><br/>South Park also marks a return to the musical genre of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's other brilliant movie, Cannibal! The Musical. The songs are actually very well made (I think one of them has a musical background) and anything that spoofs the awful, staid songs of traditional musicals is in my good books. If you're a fan of the TV show you've probably already seen this; if you're not, then I'd suggest ignoring all the negative publicity and giving it a go.

","As a South Park fan it's really hard to give an objective rating to the movie, the show definitely shows high and low points with the high points being the first season and the current one and the low point being the 4th season, this movie comes from the end of the show's first high point and is probably funnier than any south park episode.<br/><br/>The plot is as zany and off the wall with many subplots, much like an episode of south park, The boys go see the Terrence and Phillip movie which is laden with foul words, the movie becomes a craze with american youth and spreads like wildfire through south park elementary (one really funny scene includes a girl wearing a shirt in the cafeteria with a word that i can't say here). The boys get in trouble at school for using the foul language towards Mr. Garrison and the school starts a counseling program, the kids see the movie again and undo everything they learned, this leads the parents to starting a war with Canada over their entertainment and there's so many subplots that i don't even want to begin to get into it.<br/><br/>The movie is a musical and anybody who thinks there was no effort put into the songs (yes, even uncle f---a) really needs to take a second listen, especially to ""Blame Canada"" which was very clever and earned an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Trey Parker uses the popular South Park license to get across a very important message about censorship and the American government overstepping its bounds which is very true today, it gives answers instead of bringing up new questions (Who's responsible for the kids behavior? The parents.), and is an essential viewing seeing as how prophetic it was. The war with Canada in the film is very very similar to our current situations after 9/11 with Iraq and Afghanistan, civil liberties are going to the wayside and our government does whatever they please and chalks it up to the war on terror. And is there really any difference between that and a war on foul language? It's just an excuse with a different name.<br/><br/>This movie would work fine if the South Park TV show never existed, the characters are defined well for new viewers and the musical approach makes it fresh and new, the original NC17 rating and studio censorship really angered Trey and Matt so they're probably not going to make another South Park movie, as much as i'd love to see it.

That explains enough, doesn't it? I mean, it was so extremely funny I just couldn't stop laughing. If it wasn't for the language used in this movie, I guess everyone could just enjoy this piece of excellent entertainment, but because of the non-stop swearing it's just not suitable for children under the age of sixteen. <br/><br/>Although my feelings towards the whole concept of the movie are quite positive,although I must say that Trey Parker and the writers shouldn't have made the Canadians so obviously ridiculous.

Maybe not, but as a Canada-fan, I didn't really like it. <br/><br/>The scenes with Saddam and Satan are hilarious but tend to get boring after a while (sigh) and Kenny's ghostly appearance was incredibly funny. Oh yes, how can I possibly forget about the SONGS? Man, that was SO BIG! It all starts with this lame, stupid song about South Park's spotless reputation as a normal, lovely, boring, etc. mountain town. Then there's the unforgettable song in ""Asses of Fire"", sung by Terrance & Phillip, and after that we get these filty, cruel sing-a-longs performed by the kids of South Park.

","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is the most intelligent animated movie I've seen (I couldn't sit through Waking Life).  The dead-on parody of the animated/musical stereotype (especially in Satan's song, Up There, which is almost a direct punch in Disney's face) layers beautifully with the fact that the movie actually IS a musical, not just a poke at them (demonstrated best by the climactic medley of La Resistance).  Beyond the comic genius and well delivered jokes, the political satire and comment are first rate, and the plot in no way suffers for all the other foci of the film.  The self-referential foresight of the story line shows how well-wrought the movie is from the get-go, and I love that, in the midst of all the subtlety and symbolism, Parker and Stone are mature enough to admit that we all love a good fart joke in the end."

I understand, however, that it was necessary to give us a glimpse of the movie to provide a basis for the parents' anger of this movie & its effect on their children.  I don't believe the song ""Uncle F----"" was necessary, though. The devil & Sadam Hussein didt't do anything for me. It's possible there was a deeper meaning with that, but if so, it went over my head.<br/><br/>I don't have room to go into full detail of all of the satire of this movie, so I will list some elements: The egotistic quality of Americans -- The Canadians were all drawn funnily, as if Americans think them below us. The fact that people always blame others instead of themselves (at the end of the song Blame Canada, the lyrics are ""We must blame them before somebody thinks of blaming us"") The way people put celebrities on a pedestal & exaggerate their accomplishments  (""What Would Brian Boitano Do""). The way parents get caught up in causes etc that will supposedly help their children instead of spending time with their children (Kyle's mom).<br/><br/>There are many more, but I haven't seen the movie in a while, so I don't remember them all.<br/><br/>Since seeing the movie, I have downloaded & watched most of the South Park episodes & even in those, you find great social commentary. My favorite episode is ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" when the ""rich"" people move in.  I sat in shock the first time I watched it because of the last line.<br/><br/>If you understood the reason of Satan & Hussein in the movie, please let me know, cause I really would like to appreciate it also."

","Future generations will divide the world into people who love South Park and those who hate it. Obviously no one who hates the TV show will like the movie. Those that like the series are in for a treat though. Parker/Stone have been given a lot more freedom here than they have on TV and it shows. The opening 20 minutes with Terrance and Phillip's movie ""Asses of Fire"" is hugely over the top, even for South Park standards. It's also one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>The writing is very good, and many of the incidental characters have a lot more depth than in most live action movies. This shows particularly in characters like the Canadian Ambassador (in fact every Canadian), Saddam Hussein or the mole, one of the funniest characters ever created. Although after that initial opening burst the movie seems to run out of steam a bit, it does pick up again towards the end. Like the later TV episodes it also starts getting a bit preachy in parts and tries to hammer home its point a bit obvious, although this doesn't really take over as much here. Basically it rallies against blind censorship of people who rather see laws implemented than looking after their own kids. In a predictable move, this ended up being the exact scenario when the movie was released.<br/><br/>
The movie is actually an improvement on the TV show and meant that watching the series was for ever after a bit of a let down. There are so many great ideas hidden in this film, like Saddam & Satan, Bill Gates, making the movie a musical or the hip hop remix of Terrance & Phillip's song. Two negative points, Chef is criminally underused and this movie has to be just about the shortest feature ever released.<br/><br/>Kudos to Channel 9 for showing the un-edited version."

","I've always liked South Park the television show for its amazing social commentary, and for the movie it seems that the creators have not held back for a second. EVERYONE gets bashed, from the flappy-headed, beady- eyed Canadians to the U.S. military and especially the parents who are quick to protest anything that might 'corrupt' their kids instead of, I don't know, being an actual parent. What's great about the movie is that it's a musical, and a good one at that. I have most of the songs on my computer, and while they're very short (most don't run over two minutes in length), most do a good job of riffing 'real' musicals. If you know anything about Disney, then you'd catch the little references to Beauty & the Beast in the opening Mountain Town song, and Satan's Up There ballad reminded me of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid. Some of the songs are great just by themselves, like the Oscar-nominated (I kid you not) Blame Canada or the swear-ridden It's Easy MMMkay. The story's pretty silly (something about Armageddon coming to pass if Terrance & Phillip are executed), but it's only there to set up the constant jokes, riffs, and gags. It's hard coming up with my favorite moment, but I especially liked when the Mole grabbed one of the kids and said something like, ""What do you think this is, some kind of Saturday kiddie show where we all sit around and lick Barney's big purple pussy?"" He cursed God a minute later, calling him a bitch, and that probably falls in at second place. If you like the show, then you will absoultely be floored by the movie. 4 out of 4 stars!"

The parents gather to end the foul mouths of the children and also plan the execution of Terrence and Philip.  Of course, the plot continues.  This work is the best the writers have come up with since the early, more-funny South Park episodes.  Yes, the movie has the most foul language I've ever seen in a movie.

","This movie will surely prove itself quite offensive to a small amount of population.  Also provides a great tribute (poke) at the now-defunct old scheme of Hollywood's music-number-based hits like ""West-Side story"" and ""Le Mis.""  Those who would be susceptible or sensitive to racy language and innuendo will most likely not attend.  The ""South Park Move"" Is not only unimaginably hilarious, its purpose serves mainly a socially critical purpose.  Yes, the movie has around three-times the average profanity of your run-of-the-mill ""R-rated movie"", but its release could not have been better timed.  The movie's premise circles around our four heroes sneaking into an R movie and spreading the language therein.  At the time of this spiel, the theatre owner had just pledged to card anyone who looks too young while purchasing a ticket.  The film is a witty knock at censorship, but even more so, a satire of the fact that Hollywood is blamed for violence (thanks to the school tragedy in Little, CO), but punishes foul-mouths (which cause virtually no significant problems).  There's a line which alludes to it (something) like this: ""Gratuitous violence can run rampant, but the first profane work spoken and kids can't see it.""  Hilariously and willy significant on many levels, but simply outrageously funny based upon the comedy alone.  See it... if you're not shy, timid or easily offended."

","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  Some of my favorites in the past have been the Cable Guy, and pretty much everything that Kevin Smith has done.  Never once have I laughed as hard or uncontrollably as I did during this movie.  The movie is basically an extremely vulgar satire, but it's so much more.  For one, it's a musical.  Most of the songs are reminiscent of Disney songs, borrowing some inspirations from Les Miserables and Jesus Christ Superstar.  Some of the songs include ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"", a delightful jingle sung by Stan, Kyle, and Cartman, and a poke at the Church's ""What Would Jesus Do?"" campaign.  Another is ""I Can Change,"" an Middle-Eastern ballad sung by Saddam Hussein to Satan.  Saddam, recently killed, has been courting Satan since he made his journey to Hell.  Another important part of this film is its immediate relevance.  With the R-rating supposedly going to be strongly enforced, the plot of the movie seems as if it was written last week.  The boys go to see an R-rated Terrance and Phillip movie, chock full of obscenity.  Soon, the boys are repeating everything they've heard, and the boys' parents are quick not to blame the movie, but the lead characters Terrance and Phillip, who happen to be Canadian.  Their aggression leads to a declaration of war on Canada.  I don't want to give away any more, but go see this movie!"

As much flak as this film caught over being an excuse to use to profanity, it turned out to be one of the most barbed and pointed satires of the last several years.  Wildly absurd in its parody of the current ""Moral Majority"" as more Squeaky Wheel than Defender of Righteousness, the film takes turns slapping the Holier Than Thou in the face with sheer defiance (Fart jokes by the bushel) and needling them with the pinpoint accuracy of a master fencer (The MPAA banning profanity but allowing graphic violence.)<br/><br/>Also to their credit, Parker and Stone are unafraid of pushing the envelope of taste, forcing the audience to draw a line of That's Just Not Funny, It's Sick somewhere in the sand.  Be warned at some point this film will either shock or offend you (The line about being stabbed with a coat hanger while still in the womb drew a huge gasp the night i saw it).<br/><br/>The musical numbers are so big and brash as to top any since Disney's Beauty And The Beast; and they are riotously funny.<br/><br/>The ideal espoused here is one of honesty above piety.  The question begged is whether to lack shame is to lack decency.

","This movie ought to be up with the best political satires America has ever seen.  Yes, I'm serious.  This movie is hilarious, laugh-til-your-sides-ache comedy, but don't be fooled by all of the swearing and toilet humor.  This is not just intended for adults because of the language and violence.  This movie skewers war, censorship, the ""blame game"", racism, religion and so many other topics in a way that (sorry kids) goes right over most childrens' heads.<br/><br/>I noticed one reviewer commented that he would not want his children to see this movie.  Neither would I, until they were mature enough to understand it!  But isn't that exactly the point of this movie?  Ironically, I recall quite a bit of parental uproar at the time of this movie's release over kids sneaking in to see it, blaming the movie industry for not trying harder to stop the kids.  The theme of this movie could not have been more appropriate, then.  To summarize the basic plotline (and in so doing, unfortunately glossing over or even not mentioning some of the best parts), Kyle and co's parents blissfully give them permission to see the latest ""Terence and Philip"" movie without even knowing anything about it.  Guess what, folks?  ""T&P"" is R-rated and chock full of some of the most hilariously gratuitous swearing and toilet humor you've ever seen (and yes, ""Shut Your F***ing Face, Uncle F***er"" is exceptionally catchy, but then, how would this movie work if it weren't?).  The kids walk out of the movie intrigued by their new vocabulary, and impress all of the other kids at school, who promptly run out and see the ""T&P"" movie themselves.  The parents only begin to take note of what their kids have been up to when the kids start spouting out vulgarities.  Instead of admitting to themselves that perhaps they might've done a better job of monitoring their childrens' activity, they blame Hollywood, Terence and Philip, and yes, all of Canada (T&P's home country) for their childrens' ""degeneracy"".  Of course, the children are the only ones who see the ridiculousness of the whole scenario, and join ""Le Resistance"" to counteract America's war against Canada.  The movie does have its flaws -- the Satan and Saddam plotline quickly becomes predictable and (dare I say it?) over-the-top -- but this movie is chock full of enough priceless comedy and satire to more than make up for them.

The film brought nothing new to the audience, apart from losing the beeps on swearwords, more expensive cgi effects and slightly bigger musical numbers.<br/><br/>Very little new ground was broken, and I think many of the season 2/3 TV shows from the same era are actually better than the feature film. Sorry Matt and Trey, I love your work, but admit it, this was a bit of cash-in.<br/><br/>That said, if you like South Park it's well worth watching, just don't expect it to be radically different."

","It's not very often that you leave a movie with a sense of being overwhelmed by what just transpired on the screen.  It's even less often that this amazement stems from an animated feature.  South Park does all of this. With South Park's stabs on every facet of American Society from violence in the movies to Jar Jar Binks, South park hits a home run with anyone who is into a clever plot, funny musical score and great movie spoofs.

","This is just a great movie, one of the funniest I have seen in a while. Not to mention the fact that it actually has a point to make, and does so by making fun of its own ordeal in making it to the theaters.<br/><br/>Also, though, I'd like to respond to TC Raymond, who is a few comments below.  He writes, ""I also got ticked off with the Mole character, and the constant anti-Canadian stance. Imagine if Parker and Stone had been ripping at blacks, Asians or Jews. This film wouldn't have gotten off the ground. Racism is racism, boys, but what do I know?""  Are you seroius here?  I would have thought you were being sarcastic, but you really didn't seem to like the movie, which is fine.  But to call it racist?  Against Canadiens?  You are either a dumbass, as you yourself put it, or ignorant and missing the point of the movie (other than to make you laugh), which would be too bad. Being a fan of Python, as I myself am as well, I would think you could figure out that they were making fun of the way America has in the past portrayed our enemies while at war.  And you gotta admit, 'a-boot' is pretty funny.  And if you were just pulling my leg, well, good one, cause you had me convinced you were serious.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd recommend this movie to anyone, especially someone who thinks bad language is the downfall of civilization, because there are worse things out there than four letter words.

","I question the integrity of any self-proclaimed critic who dares call South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut a `mindless' production. The truth is that it is far from mindless, and actually succeeds in securing its place as one of (if not THE) greatest American culture satires ever created. Brimming with meaning, especially in today's tumultuous political climate, South Park is worthy of everything from its high volume unit sales to its Oscar nomination. I dare say that in a time where it is easy to forget the evils that plague society in light of the looming hand of foreign terror, South Park's importance grows by the second. <br/><br/>True, South Park: B,L,U is a crude romp through a spitting babble of tangled curses and crass language. Yes, it deals with excessive violence, gore, and even ethnic epithets of the tasteless variety. Oh, and you WILL see a penis. Numerous times. <br/><br/>But above all, South Park delivers something Hollywood dares not touch in the lands of modern cinema: the TRUTH.<br/><br/>Yup, to ignore violence, aggression, and downright wicked decadence is to pander to the glossy coat of Hollywood escapism  that general American trend in which we all bend the truth, alter history, and accept the manipulation of life in the light that we will be entertained, or at best, find ourselves in the stunning poignancy of art.<br/><br/>Rubbish, I say. What South Park accomplishes with its overdriven wit and alarming explosion of foul dialogue and clever scenarios is exactly what today's cinema audience needs...and that, my friends, is a slap in the face. It's an extreme overdose of everything safe media' tries to shroud by sweeping real evils underneath the rug of self-respect; it's an exploitation of all Hollywood holds sacred in its glorification of the kitschy buzz of the week. This film takes that newsreel desensitization you though you had by viewing Time Magazine's sidebar caption on Sierra Leone and cranks it up to ten, proving just how little you know about yourself, the media, and the power of issues society has somehow grown scared to even talk about.<br/><br/>Death? Hell? Swearing? Murder? Exploitation? Sex? Taboo?<br/><br/>
Bah...more like questioning societal mores, advancing a cultural revolution, identifying the idiocy in censorship, and parading the notorious tendency to scapegoat.<br/><br/>This isn't mindless entertainment. This is life. This is South Park. So watch it and learn something. Worse comes to worse, you'll get a good laugh from the experience. Well, that is if you still have a sense of humor left. Hollywood's been feeding on yours for years."

The SP series bring to me  nothing else than big-ass laughters everytime I have the opportunity of watching an episode. I say ""have the opportunity"" because the episodes are not broadcasted in Mexico (except in satellite systems). So, when I have that golden opportunity I don't miss the chance and enjoy it as much as I can.<br/><br/>Well, when I knew about South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut, I thought this was the chance of having the whole package of the midly-censored episodes that I have watched, into a monster fully-uncensored movie. It didn't dissapointed me at all. The best of this movie is that they criticize themselves and the censored f-words, mature-rated episodes revolution they created in TV. Of course, another feature that really hooked me into this movie was the songs. I'm not used to watch Disney movies because of the constant interruption of the stories with a lame song. Well, this happens in SP: BL&U, but this is a different way of interruption, because you can laugh your ass while Cartman sings to a bitchy mother, Sadam Hussein claims ""he can change"" in an arabesque song (and performs a great choreography) and Satan sings in a very melodic song that he wants to come ""up here"" and live amongst us (Satan, the Prince of Darkness singing a ballad!!!). I'm not denying the movie is slow sometimes, but while it is, you're busy laughing about the last gag. Full of swearing? Yes, but this is what all the SP fans wanted to see. If you're not really into the SP frenzy, try a different kind of movie, but you want to explore another kind of adventures with Cartman, Kyle, Stan & Kenny, this is your movie. Of course, you won't find it in theaters, where I think you can enjoy a lot more, but go rent it. If you have that golden opportunity, don't miss the chance and enjoy it as much as you can."

Their parents don't respect their newly learned vocabulary and attack the Canadians. Another reason was for the death of Kenny who lit his farts on fire unsuccessfully because he saw it in the film.

The obscenity works because it is a movie about the censorship of the Terrance and Phillip (T&P) movie due to that movie's use of obscenities.  So, they have to show T&P's obscene movie.  The South Park movie is then able to poke fun at its own bad language, how it affects children, and people's criticism of it by showing the silliness of T&P and the ridiculous reactions to the T&P movie.  <br/><br/>The songs in this movie are great.  The music is a good as any Disney movie and most of them are hilarious.  ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"" is great musically, creatively and its very funny.

Every single line uttered by the Mole is a classic!<br/><br/>All things aren't good in this movie. Some scenes (like when Cartman's mom is in that German Scheisse movie), aren't funny at all, it feels as if they have been put there because the film makers wanted to see how far they could go without being censored.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the first time I watched it it was in a cinema full of kids. It was allowed from 7 years in Sweden (where the censorship board actually DOES think that horrific violence is worse than foul language), so it seemed as if the cinema just assumed that it was for kids and only screened it as a matinée. I'm not saying that they should have had a higher age limit for it, it's just that I couldn't enjoy all those naughty jokes when there were children present (me and my friends were the only ones older than 15). The funny thing is that we consistently laughed at different times all the time. The kids were mostly there for the fart-jokes (exactly like Cartman + gang with ""Terrence and Philip"") and were completely silent when ""ze Mole"" appeared and me and my friends laughed ourselves to tears.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film much more the second time I watched it because firstly I wasn't in a cinema full of kids, and secondly I knew what was coming, so I could look past the few jokes that I find tasteless without being funny.

It's true that these people or situations have been subject to the writers' caustic humour many a times in the series, but it is in this movie that all the jokes have been collected together and bound into a single 90 minute feature film with a plot which has a beginning, middle and ending and keeps you rolling on the floor laughing for the whole of its length.<br/><br/>Overall a 9/10."

","I'm a pretty big fan of the South Park television show.  It has to be the funniest thing on television mainly because of it's shear honesty.  I got so excited about the movie, and while I did like the movie, I know this is not the best Try Parker and Matt Stone could do.<br/><br/>Well, the language isn't as offensive as some people make it out to be. But, the movie really lacks the edge that the show has.  The movie over uses songs, uses tired language gags, and focuses too much on the story. Seriously, I think they did TOO good of a job being emotion, characters, and plot to the screen.  This is South Park man.  They should focus on all of that, but try and be funny too.<br/><br/>I mentioned the over use of song.  Well, that's problem number 2.  There are too many songs.  I know that SP frequently uses songs in the show, and I like that.  Some songs are funny.  But this is so close to being a musical. Really close.<br/><br/>But, the movie can be hilarious.  The jokes are so good infact, I wouldn't dream of ruining them here.  But, as many loyal fans know, this could have been better had Trey and Matt not pushed it so far.  The whole Gay Al bit is just sick.  I can handel the Saddam dildo scene, but that Gay Al thing is just sick.<br/><br/>So, I'm not going to rate this movie.  Why?  I'm too conflicted.  The show is worthy of a ten out of ten.  the movie is still conflicting me.  If your a mature adult who has never even thought about watching a show, you might not like this.  It is a good movie though, so if you casually watch South Park, but haven't seen the movie, see this.  Like I said, it could have better.  But, it still good.there is good stuff here.  Like all South Park, it is terribly honest (in a good way).<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, the mole is the man!  Viva La Resistance!"

I found the animation crude, the language occasionally vulgar, and the whole show wildly funny....so funny, in fact, that I wondered why it was on the Comedy Channel. The movie was free to be even more vulgar. I remember some people in the audience walking out in the middle of it. What were they expecting? Well, I wasn't expecting a musical, but I sat through it. Crude and vulgar as it sometimes is, it's still a biting satire, as well as a send-up of....well, pick a movie genre. Odds are that somewhere in South Park it got skewered.

However, being an R16 (in New Zealand), I was not able to go - being only 12 at the time (damn movie association!), so had to wait for 6 months for it to come out on video.<br/><br/>Those six months were well worth it. 'SP: B,L & U' is one of the FUNNIEST movies I have ever seen!!!

Trey and the gang went all out with explicitness as many stunts in the movie were shameless and explicit.  But that is what made it so great!  This movie is going to do very well, and no doubt the soundtrack will be a big seller.<br/><br/>The swearing never stops and neither does the sexual innuendoes...rather, they aren't innuendoes at all...it is all explicit.

","SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (1999)-- Grade: A-<br/><br/>The year of 1999 was, for me, a hell of a year for cinema, especially the American cinema. Stanley Kubrick died, but he left his last jewel EYES WIDE SHUT. We came to knew new talents as Spike Jonze (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) and to have a strong proof of others' abilities- Paul Thomas Anderson with 1999's best, MAGNOLIA. That was also the year of BOYS DON'T CRY, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, ELECTION, THE SIXTH SENSE, THE INSIDER, THE MATRIX, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, ARLINGTON ROAD, MAN ON THE MOON, CRUEL INTENTIONS, GO, FIGHT CLUB... But the one that is most likely to stay as a classic is AMERICAN BEAUTY. Even not being the year's best (MAGNOLIA is even better), it won 5 Oscar. And it touched us and made us laugh with an original and dark satire of the stupid and unbearable American way of life. AMERICAN BEAUTY was a semi-commercial, semi-artistic picture, or maybe not one nor the other, that used symbolism and mise-en-scene to tell its story and criticize the American family, also talking about the beauty that we can see even in a plastic bag. If that criticism was deep and bittersweet, the one that is in SOUTH PARK- BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is very different. Not just the American society is criticized, but also the militarism, the racism, the movie ratings, the patriotism, Brooke Shields, Saddam Hussein, the Baldwin brothers, Winona Ryder... Everything and everyone you imagine... And much more.<br/><br/>I started watching the animated series some years ago, but I was never a die-hard fan. But when I watched it I had a great time. When the movie was released in the US I was looking forward to see it, but the Brazilian distributors committed a mistake and the movie was released here only in August 2000. But the wait was worthy. SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT is the most offensive movie I've ever seen and also one of the funniest. I couldn't stop laughing a minute. There was more and more and more absurds and wicked situations to laugh at. But the good thing is that all those offensive things have a point. Trey Parker and Matt Stone criticize everything, but in fact they just want to show the American hypocrisy, using all the kinds of over-the-top situations. Of course the criticism is not so mature and strong as in FIGHT CLUB, but Parker and Stone just want to make us have fun with that, while David Fincher has a very different point- with no links to make audiences have fun. <br/><br/>The story starts when the four boys go to the movies to watch a R-rated movie starring Terrance and Philip, two Canadian comedians who use the sickest kind of humor. The boys start to use the words they heard on the movie and after some days all the school is using the words. Of course the mothers get very, very angry, so what they can do... Blame Canada, why not? They start a real war against the country ""above"", but the things get really nasty, involving even the Devil and Saddam Hussein as lovers. You can't even imagine what happens then... Kenny's death in the hospital room is one of the funniest parts, but this is a minor thing (there is the ""search for the clitoris"", a certain German porn video in the Internet and more). Of course everything is taken to the limit, but all is covered by an intelligent screenplay and much originality.<br/><br/>The idea of using a musical structure is another smart thing. The Disney animations are musicals, but some of them (POCAHONTAS, yawn!) are so pathetic that they may harm children's minds. SOUTH PARK is not for children- don't even think that! The point is that the songs are more realistic and intelligent, even using an interminable number of F-words. (That song about the uncle is so sick!)<br/><br/>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT may be really hazardous, even fatal to the most delicate and conventional people, but if you are an open person and like to laugh of absurds, then this movie is for you. The funniest film of 1999 by far and one of the funniest ever made. But don't forget there is a point, that makes it... bittersweet."

","""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"" provides an introspective commentary on the postmodern state of popular culture.  Some of the jokes may be crude - take the title, for instance - but many are sophisticated enough to be funny nevertheless.  The plot revolved around a ""Terrence and Philip"" movie. Parker and Stone employ irony when Cartman says that ""the animation is soooo crappy,"" but that is only the tip of the iceberg.  Canadian South Park afficionados may remember that when the show was first broadcast, some people were so offended, that the time slot got kicked back from 9:30 to 12:00 midnight.  So what would happen if an X-rated movie featuring a couple of Canadian dolts singing vulgar songs about uncles were to make the return trip across the American border?  Without giving away too much of the plot, and with sincere apologies to Frank Sinatra, send in the troops.  The ""Terrence and Philip"" movie is, in fact, a commentary on how political correctness has purged most sorts of cerebral comedy from television and movies, that all that remains is lowbrow humour revolving around bodily functions.  Parker and Stone also take pot shots at other contemporary icons (the Saddam Hussein bit is a riot!), and having studied French history, I found the ""Vive la resistance!"" angle one of the funniest of the movie. Now let's talk about the music in the movie.  I tend to find most musicals to be irritating, even the Woody Allen one from a few years back, but I like this musical - maybe because it makes fun of musicals!  Besides the song about the uncle, you've got ""It's Easy, MMMKay,"" ""Kyle's Mom is a..."" and, of course ""Blame Canada.""  Oddly enough, shortly after ""Blame Canada"" lost at the Oscars to a Phil Collins tune, Parker and Stone lampooned Phil Collins in a recent episode which also involved Ritalin and an unorthodox teenage rock group.  How do I know that this movie had an impact on society?  It's easy, MMMKay.  After our national anthem, what do you suppose the most popular song was at the recent Canada Day celebration on Parliament Hill? That's right.  ""Blame Canada""!"

","Sure, the South Park movie is as raunchy as you'd expect.  Matt and Trey go all out to evoke some kind of reaction from everyone.  It's also just as funny as you've always expected.  A friend of mine was in tears from laughing so hard.  The song and dance numbers, something I don't usually enjoy in a movie, were fantastic.  And all of the twisted humor you've come to expect from South Park is here.  But there's also a commentary on society today, and how we should worry less about what's going on in society and deal more with what's going on with ourselves.  All in all, I think this movie was fantastic."

","South Park belongs to those who love it. Many people don't. That's their problem. I love it, so I will write a positive remark.<br/><br/>The episodes are great, but the movie is better. Stone and Parker saved the best jokes for the film and it has an intelligent storyline too. Basically the film makes fun of itself. The whole thing about violence and cursing being bad for young children is depicted beautifully. Problem with South Park is that after an episode of 20 minutes you're bound to have enough. That is why they made a number of beautiful songs to break the tension and liven things up. That is what makes this movie so great. And get a load of the special effects. They're amazing. Whoah!"

I think what bothers people about ""South Park"" is that it hits so close to certain truths about our culture. Sexual stereotypes, the media, politicians and censorship in the name of ""family values"" are fair game. As always, Matt and Trey manage to offend everybody, most of all those who would decide for us what sort of entertainment we are allowed."

We don´t have the series here in Portugal, and so the movie wasn´t even released here. But i knew the characters by fame, and i was always very curious to see this movie. I bought the DVD a couple of days ago, and it just totaly blows me away each time i watch it.<br/><br/>I´ve already seen it 5 times ! And i can´t stop watching, sometimes i just listen to it, because of the songs. This movie has such a positive feel, that it always cheers me up. Every time i punch play, i just can´t take the dvd out no more untill it has ended. This is totaly adictive, because it´s so wild and crazy, not to say brilliantly acted. We can see the actors were having lots of fun, and that totaly transmists to the viewer. It´s impossible not be in a good humor watching this.<br/><br/>And the songs are trully brilliant. Great açid lyrics and crazy tunes, pontuated with brilliant small almost tender classic musical moments that always end with a punch line. Or shoul i say a punch in our stomach. :-)<br/><br/>The only fact that i think works against it, is that this movie is so anti-politicaly correct, that becomes almost armless.<br/><br/>I tell you, i don´t have any problem with letting young kids watching this.<br/><br/>In fact i think everyone should watch this, because it´s such a perfect depiction of the moral hypocrisy that exists in the world today, that the fact that this movie is rated R is just the confirmation of that same way of thinking, wich should always be fought. And nothing like good humor, and very well writen one to fight the false moralities.<br/><br/>This is a very happy movie. In fact one of the most beautifull movies i´ve seen lately. Nothing like an honesty of a kid to show us how the world realy is and what can we do about it.<br/><br/>Brilliant movie.

"steelz","Null","0","0","21 April 2000"," The most enjoyable film I have ever seen!
","I would just like to say now that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is my favourite film of all time. Okay, it may not be the best made or whatever but it is so damn entertaining and is one of the only films I could watch over and over again. It is the best animated film ever, the best musical ever and the best TV show to film transfer ever. It has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the four main stars of the show: Eric Cartman, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broslofski and Kenny McCormick who get into an R-rated film with their fave TV characters, Terrance & Phillip, in their debut feature film (sound familiar?). However, as soon as the film starts rolling, the swearing begins as well. Affected by the crude and inventive swearing from the Canadian duo, the young foursome begin to show off their new phrases but their mothers try to put a stop to it by focusing on the main source of the problem, Canada. Soon, war is waged on the Canadians and all hell is broken loose with the arrival of Satan and Saddam Hussein, who are partners in evil and love. Yes its crazy, yes its stupid but yes its also intelligent, satirical and damn funny. <br/><br/>The quality of the animation has improved due to the bigger budget. The characters appear more 3D than ever before and Kenny's descent into hell is so superbly dizzying and memorable due to the amazing computer generated fire and devil effects. At first, you may feel turned away by the inclusion of songs but each one is so catchy and brilliant. They really teach Uncle Walt what songs should be like in animated films. The lyrics are hilarious (you only have to listen to Terrance and Phillip's song and you will know that this is NOT a Disney film). The song 'Up There' could be used in your average kids film if it weren't for the fact that it is sung by Satan. The songs and music fill you with so much emotion, more than your usual Disney pap and are all perfectly taking the mickey (or should that be Mickey Mouse) out of it. 'Blame Canada' should have won Best Original Song Oscar and not Phil Collins and whatever rubbish he did in Tarzan.<br/><br/>Not all of the characters from the TV show make much of an appearance. You would think that Jesus and Damien would have more of a role in the Satan-Saddam relationship and the Mayor and Barbrady have nothing to say about what's happening to South Park, along with Pip but they only manage cameo roles. However, the new characters more than make up for it. Gregory really puts a spin on things for Stan, and Christof aka The Mole is one of the coolest characters in cinematic history (""Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger when I was still in ze womb?"") and should make a reappearance on the TV show. It is also good to see that all characters get equal amounts of runtime due to their separate plot lines which create some great scenes. Stan has to cope with Wendy going out with Gregory, Kyle has to stand up to his crazed mother, Cartman's V-Chip electrocutes him whenever he utters an obscenity and Kenny (who gets loads more runtime as he is almost the main character) needs to alert his friends that Satan and Saddam are coming to take over the world. The celebrity guest voices are great too, especially the E.R. rip-off with George Clooney. And don't forget to catch Kenny's Goodbye at the end. By the final 'Mountain Town' reprisal you will be wanting more, though you know that watching it all again instantly will be too much but the film is so addictive and the scenes and songs so catchy and memorable you just have to watch it again and again. Even now I feel like sticking it into the video machine and watch it again but I know I shouldn't. Oh, and check out the most bizarre post-credits sequence in movie history featuring Ike.<br/><br/>Overall this is a truly brilliant film which deserves more attention. It is a fun film to watch and its humour may be not to everyone's taste but I think everyone should see it regardless of anything (actually, maybe that's not such a good idea)."

","First of all, I like the TV show, and I think the movie was great. The Soundtrack is very nice (not all of it, but most of it, anyway), and the story, although a little bit 'recycled' from episodes of the show, is highly amusing. The only problem with this movie is that they shouldn't (whoops. watch out, SPOILER!) have shown Kenny's face or let us understand what he says in the end. But I recommend that movie to anyone who likes South Park... The rest... go see American Beauty or something... you WON'T like this movie if you don't like South Park."

The scene with Bill Gates was the only time in my recent memory when an entire audience broke into applause.  And anyone who has read about the Vietnam war will understand the real meaning of ""Operation Human Shield"" near the movie's end.  There's five billion of us on this planet, which means that if nothing else, there is a lot of sex going on.  It's something we all are interested in, and most of us do it as much as we can.  And yet, you can make a movie that depicts incredible violence and murder, and get a PG-13 rating, but if sex is treated in any real way, count on an 'R'.  This is even more true on television.<br/><br/>South Park fans will love this movie.  People who don't know much about the tv series will be shocked, but may find some funny moments in the film.  I predict the religious right is going to go ballistic over this film.

From the start to finish this movie grabs you, and the usual South Park-stuff mixed with a really reasonable plot. Well, as reasonable as it could be. The way Parker & Stone has built the story up like a Brodway-musical, is genius. The songs, from ''Quiet mountain town'' to the final, through ''I can change'', ''Brian Boitano'' and ''I'm Super (thanks for asking)'', are fantastic. <br/><br/>                              This movie was actually the movie that made me interested in musicals of any kind. I guess the plot is known, and is nothing I should grab, but even the smallest and weakest jokes gets fun.<br/><br/>
                              The even better thing is that the movie is taking about everything from the TV-series without even feeling something like a repeating, like ''The Flintstones'' for example. Any fans, should have seen it already, but you don't have to be any kind of South Park to like this movie. In fact, where I live, you only have to be 7 years to see it! REAL scandal!<br/><br/>                              But I still recommend this movie for anyone who can apriciate cartoon blood and violence, sarcasm (plus entertaining song) and still finding it fun.<br/><br/>                              8.5/10"

I understand that swearing isn't allowed on Comedy Central where the series runs, but for the movie, the swearing could detract from the main theme because it was overused.

Now that that warning is out of the way, I must say that this movie was absolutely hilarious and entertaining.  The entire movie is a political message, whether you like it or not, and it spends a lot of time showing the stupidity of extreme censorship and political correctness.  Mothers in particular are probably insulted the most by this movie, because it shows how a lot of them overreact to swearing.  Just so that a ""pottymouth isn't used, extreme violence is okay"".

Some of the jokes are really sick but at the same time you can't stop loving these little creatures. The movie is even better than the TV series (although I haven't seen many TV episodes). I was very surprised finding  some social-critical tendencies. The film also stands against racism and questions several other things concerning our behaviour.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent film that is more than just a simple comedy.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

They pay a man to get them tickets, and they love the film. The film is Canadian, and makes the kids swear like hel# The kids` mothers form an organisation called MAC(mothers against Canada), and demand that the President declares war on Canada. They want to get rid of everything Canadian in America.  Canadians in America are sent to death-camps eehhhhhh...... vacation-camps. (This is just what happened in Nazi-Germany).

","If you don't like the series you will hate the film. If you do, you will enjoy it. It is as simple and clear cut as that, all the quirks that make the series what it is are out in force, the individual mannerisms of the characters, and the ruthless and hilarious disregard to political correctness. This time it is Canada which bears the brunt of the assault (follow the story and you'll find out why) but gays, blacks, the poor, the disabled and many more don't miss out. The irony is that the group most ridiculed by the whole South Park phenomenon are the white middle-class majority, as subtlely (and not so subtlely) pointed out  - ""we must blame them [Canada] and cause a fuss before somebody thinks of blaming us"".<br/><br/>The film has a wonderful soundtrack of stunning songs, indeed if you can block out the voices and lyrics, Copland and some of the other American greats would have been proud to put their name to some of these, particularly the hoedown-style ""Uncle F***er"" (yeah really!) and the ensemble ""La Resistance"". The latter song is very reminiscent, both in terms of the musical dexterity and the expression of impending conflict, of the ensemble ""Tonight"" from West Side Story. So in short, South Park fans will not be disappointed, and the music for me pushed this film up to ""fantastic"". The mystery remains however - did Saddam Hussein actually give his permission to be featured?????"

","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is probably one of the funniest comedies of the summer. It starts off when Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny go see the Canadian feture Terrance Movie. There was one thing though the movie was rated R for a lot of profanity. The kids get hooked on the movie and they start saying all the dirty language they picked up from the movie. Then they even use it at school. So the other classmates things the kids are cool for seeing the Terrance and Philip movie, so eventually they do it too. Then when the mothers get a hold of all kids saying a lot of curses, they form MAC (Mothers Against Canada). So everything gets messed up and eventually World War 3 breaks out in South Park!<br/><br/>This is one of the funniest animated movies ever.

","When I first saw this movie I thought it was so great, that I just wrote a very simple comment. Here I am to leave my point of view.<br/><br/>
Right now ''South Park - Bigger, longer and uncut'', is nr.27 of my favorite movies (I have really listed them all) and I must say that this is a comedy-masterpiece. From the start to finish this movie grabs you, and the usual South Park-stuff mixed with a really reasonable plot. Well, as reasonable as it could be. The way Parker & Stone has built the story up like a Brodway-musical, is genius. The songs, from ''Quiet mountain town'' to the final, through ''I can change'', ''Brian Boitano'' and ''I'm Super (thanks for asking)'', are fantastic. <br/><br/>This movie was actually the movie that made me interested in musicals of any kind. I guess the plot is known, and is nothing I should grab, but even the smallest and weakest jokes gets fun. <br/><br/>The even better thing is that the movie is taking about everything from the TV-series without even feeling something like a repeating, like ''The Flintstones'' for example. Any fans, should have seen it already, but you don't have to be any kind of South Park to like this movie. In fact, where I live, you only have to be 7 years to see it! REAL scandal!<br/><br/>
But I still recommend this movie for anyone who can apriciate cartoon blood and violence, sarcasm (plus entertaining song) and still finding it fun.<br/><br/>
8.5/10"

A lot of the jokes were shock jokes, where as you can see them once they are really funny and then that's it.  If I ever see the movie again my rating will probably be lower, but see the movie yourself and make sure you keep your kids away if they imitate movies unless you want them to be swearing left and right.<br/><br/>My review 9 out of 10."

This being the kind where nothing is held back and anything goes.  I mean they make fun of every race imaginable and every sexual orientation.  I'm not racist or homophobic but EVERYONE gets made fun of in this movie and you don't feel bad for laughing.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the whole South Park gang being exposed to a Terrence and Phillip movie (Canadians who title there movie Asses of Fire). They come out cussing and swearing.  Parents find out and in the South Park way it ends up with Canada and America at war, Satan and Saddam Hussein having a very graphic cartoon love affair, and the Apocalypse slowly approaching.<br/><br/>I warn you the humor is both graphic and most likely offensive to a lot of people.  But it's great.  It'll catch you off guard and make you chuckle, or if you like the humor, fall down on the floor laughing.

"Binky-11","9","0","0","23 February 2000"," Genius - and the critics didn't even notice...
","South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is without doubt the most intelligent mainstream film of the last decade.  Snubbed by critics for pointing out the flaw in their arguments against it even before it was released, it takes Hollywood movies and the censorship debate as its ammunition and fires round after round of toilet and sick humour from its gun-of-truth directly at the movies of Disney, Lucasfilm and anyother big name vacuous motion picture production company.<br/><br/>It saddens me that the message this film put across was ignored or not noticed by any critics.  It is even spelt out for them towards the end of the movie (although I doubt any critics were still paying attention - they were more than likely thinking up clever metaphors for the morning edition). Kyle's mum, the ringleader of the Anti Canada ensemble, anounces the point of their conflict:  ""Death and carnage are all okay, as long as no one says any dirty words""  (Or words to that effect).<br/><br/>I'm losing my narrative.  To cut to the chase, this film is a two finger salute to all the people who are getting all worked up over a bunch of cartoons who swear.  Simultaneously, it proves its own worth and worthlessness.  As I said, it's genius.<br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned the quality of the songs and orchestrations - they put Disney's collaborations with Tim Rice and whoever to shame easily. I hope ""Blame Canada"" gets the oscar this year, although I doubt it.  The CG, most notably in the hell sequences, is perfectly competent.  Not great, just good.  And before anyone tells you other wise, let me assure you that if you appreciate the humour from the series, you'll definitely appreciate the humour in the movie.  There are so many hilarious bits packed into an hour twenty that it shows how empty and dull There's Something About Mary actually was.  (My personal favourite bit is when Brooke Shields announces she once farted on the set of the Blue Lagoon, after which there is a long pause.  Then Terrence politely slaps her.  Genius)<br/><br/>To sum up, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is, and I quote, 'genius'. Don't know who said it, though.  9 out of 10."

Unlike other 30 minute shows that are wheezing at the end of 100 minutes, South Park remained fresh and innovative throughout.

","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)<br/><br/>
South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut<br/><br/>
Directed by : Trey Parker, 1999<br/><br/><br/><br/>The essence of Trey Parker's South Park - the television show - is crude and foul-mouthed social commentary dressed up as an ugly drawn (low-tech paper animation) cartoon, that on a good day can be as politically sharp and relevant as it can be magnificent fun.<br/><br/>
The show chronicles the lives and adventures of third graders Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny, as they endure down the path of life towards adulthood in the small, hick town of South Park somewhere in desolate Colorado.<br/><br/>
Obviously influenced not only by such raunchy and classic adult animation as Fritz The Cat (1972), but by more recent 90s favorites  the dead-on teenage angst and dimwitted humor of Beavis and Butthead, the charming and intelligent social satire of The Simpsons, and the subtle, white-trash, rural middle America characterizations as depicted in King Of The Hill - South Park has nevertheless clearly distinguished itself in both tone and style if not subject matter.<br/><br/>
How? By being twice as rude, offensive, obnoxious, absurd and calculated as anything ever before.<br/><br/>
This formula works because South Park - however repetitive it may seem with a constant cavalcade of filth, wall-to-wall-cursing and depraved acts - relentlessly keeps the punches coming and has both heart and grit enough to do so, thus ensuring that the only safe bet is that the character of Kenny will get killed sooner or later (no spoiler, a trademark). `No one here gets out alive´ seems to be the message. If Jim Morrison was alive today he would be a fan.<br/><br/>
Amazingly, the movie too wins you over because of this general element of surprise and flow in the verbal attack, and ""Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" is actually a very descriptive subtitle to the full-length movie (it runs 80 minutes). It is exactly that.<br/><br/>
However, Parker has also built this pro-longed edition more in the veins of a musical than a regular episode thereby making everything seem very fresh and initially different. Fans may be annoyed at the many musical moments (some are more entertaining than others) but it makes for a nice pacing and an appropriate abrasive feel (as South Park should be).<br/><br/>
The good song and dance routines are superbly written and robustly crafted in the best of musical traditions. I will be the first to admit that they had me singing along more than once. Blatantly humming something like: ""Shut your f**king face, uncle f**ker"" - as the four kids do after having seen their heroes Terrance and Phillip's R-rated film, ""Asses On Fire"" - whilst laughing my head off and tears rolling down my cheek, is not how I would like to be remembered. Yet it happened to me. You have to hand it to Trey Parker: South Park can be genuinely addictive.<br/><br/>
That is because there is a much needed moral behind all the adolescent obscenity. The moral being not only anarchistic, but both intelligent and reflective. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone slam censorship and intolerance, and make a hard case against the lack of parental guidance - in general, not only at the movies. Kids nowadays in America are not necessarily victims of any sleazy outside influence or a decaying society, but namely of a lack of communication with their parents. An issue that can not get enough of a forward push in the United States today.<br/><br/>
On the downside; some parts of the movie work better than others. For instance, I never took to the Saddam Hussein and Satan relationship. It carries on too long and is unfortunately at center throughout. There is also mock genitalia shown simply to shock - and that is beneath even South Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On the upside however, other vulgarities, like the ethnic stereotyping - a tireless joke in the world of South Park - takes on a whole new meaning towards the end of this movie (Q: Chef: ""Ain't you heard of the emancipation proclamation?"" A: Army General: ""I don't listen to hip-hop""). The movie nakedly addresses cultural and racial misunderstandings, minority bashing and human shallowness in a both hilarious and sinister fashion without tooting any specific horn. Brilliant.<br/><br/>
The experience of viewing South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut rests primarily on the unknown factor (as much as it is also jam-packed with inside jokes which may seem unfamiliar to many non-Americans), so I will not reveal anything more. If you can stomach the extreme vulgarity that resides in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado, and want to be wooed by some wry and open-minded wit, then you are surely in for a joyride.<br/><br/>
Summing up the warped but wonderful humor of South Park is best done by quoting a news reporter as heard in the movie itself :<br/><br/>[Covering a bloody war] : ""It doesn't matter if it's loaded with violence, as long as there's no foul language, then the MPAA says it's safe for children."""

","South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is being touted as the best musical of the decade, and that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has seen it. Capturing the essence of more than one classic musical, this nasty little parody with those foul mouthed little children is one of the best films to come out in a long time.  <br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone do for the big screen what they have been doing on television for a few years: they push the envelope way over to the other side!  Tackling censorship and parental discretion, this will be significant because it truly challenged and carried forward, the NC-17 debate.  This isn't the first time that Parker and Stone have taken the censors to task, but it is certainly their most daring effort.  <br/><br/>As the story goes, the kids of South Park eagerly rush out to see the latest film from those flatulent Canadians, Terrance and Phillip.  The movie is filled with foul language which the children start repeating.  When the school and their parents get wind of it (excuse the pun) all hell breaks loose.  Kyle's mom heads up a committee to blame and eventually go to war with Canada. As she sees it, the film is corrupting America's youth. <br/><br/>In keeping with the TV show, this film carries with it a strong message, but Parker and Stone don't fall into the trap of clouding their story, because the message is often diluted in the 'toilet humor' that they typically present.  <br/><br/>Fans of the show will love this film, as we get to hear all those words (and then some) that are beeped out on TV.  We also get to see, and understand, Kenny.  And of course, that ""I can't believe they did that"" style of comedy runs rampant.  Where else could we see the Devil in a torrid relationship with Sadaam Hussein?  And who would have guessed that the Devil is a sensitive bottom?<br/><br/>Parker and Stone also seem to have a musical flare.  The powerful anthem, Blame Canada, the up tempo, I'm Super, and one I can't even cite in this review, will have you singing for weeks.<br/><br/>Canadian's will find even more to laugh at, especially since we seem to love to laugh at American views of us.  I roared as I saw my countrymen being interned in American death camps.  I applauded at the burning of Alannis Morrisette albums.<br/><br/>No doubt, South Park is not for the faint of heart, nor the closed of mind. And I strongly suggest keeping this one away from the kiddies.  For the rest of you, sit back, keep some tissue close by, and enjoy."

"Anardil","Null","0","0","27 January 2000"," Brilliant and biting satire... and hilarious comedy too!
","Well, where to start? South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was one of the funniest movies of 1999. It has the same weird 2-dimensional animation, the same foul-mouthed characters and the same bizarre plotlines that have made the TV show so popular, but Parker and Stone have taken it to a whole new level with this movie. And surprisingly, the humour isn't just Howard Stern-esque, lowest-common denominator type stuff, despite what you may have heard. South Park is absolutely the most blistering, insightful and explosive social satire to appear on the big screen in years. And its funny too.<br/><br/>Does this movie shock the viewer with almost unbelievable levels of profanity and vulgarity? Yes, that's the point. But is it funny? Absolutely. If you can get past the surface stuff, what's underneath is a very intelligent, and very needed, skewering of American people and politics today, especially those who represent the so-called ""right wing.""<br/><br/>
Good satire has to be shocking to be effective and understood. Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" in the 18th century shocked contemporary audiences by proposing that the poor be used as food for the rich. It was an effective way of pointing out the inequalities of life in Britain at the time. In the same tradition, Parker and Stone point out the absurdities of American politics through shock tactics with this film. And they also make a hilarious movie.<br/><br/>As a Canadian, one of the ""victims"" of Stone and Parker's film, I find it extremely amusing to read all the comments posted by outraged Americans warning all of the dangers of this ""filthy"" movie. To me (and many others, it would seem, judging from the movie's popularity) it is obvious that by putting down Canadians (and everyone else) Stone and Parker are actually making fun of Americans. Most especially (though by no means exclusively, everyone gets ripped here), they are poking merciless fun at the mainstream, white, middle-class conservatives in the United States today. You know, the kind that complain about violence and swearing in movies and then go bomb Serbian civilians. <br/><br/>One of the messages of South Park is that kids get their values from their parents, not from movies. In the wake of Littleton and the resulting knee-jerk reaction from American politicians of every variety to blame the tragedy on the media, guns, Marilyn Manson or whatever, this message is even more effective. Too many Americans blame everyone but themselves for their problems. The South Park parents' overreaction to the ""crisis"" of Terrence and Philip and their declaration of war on Canada satirizes the similar attitudes of those the movie is making fun of. And yet everyone but these people get the joke! They just see the violence and swearing in these scenes and declare that South Park should be banned! Its influencing our children! And they fail to see that they are behaving exactly like their cartoon counterparts! Here the movie is absolutely brilliant, and so accurate its almost sad.<br/><br/>So there you have it: South Park is a cutting, iconoclastic social commentary that's also extremely funny. I haven't laughed as hard watching a movie in years as I did when watching South Park. Its hilarious, and there is an important political message to it. So ignore the naysayers, go see this movie, and give it an honest chance. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10"

","The animated feature length film ""South Park:  Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" is an endlessly creative, imaginative and high energy version of the hit TV show. But amidst all the unbridled crudity, clever movie musical parodies and incisive social commentary, the question must finally be asked:  is it funny?  Actually, not as funny as it could be or as it thinks it is but amusing enough for a rollicking good time, provided one is able to overcome the nagging suspicion (one its makers are more than happy to instill) that one is witnessing the beginning of the end of western civilization as we know it.<br/><br/>The makers of this film show a remarkable ability to look inward, turning the spotlight on both their own product and the cultural phenomenon of which they are a major part.  In its plotting, ""South Park"" wisely goes the route of self-parody having enormous fun with the issue of censorship (particularly in the realm of foul language vs. violence as sources of offensiveness), while pushing the envelope of tastlessness about as far as it will go. In its tale of a group of youngsters ""corrupted"" by their exposure to a crude R-rated feature from Canada and the hysterical overreaction by a group of irate parents (actually resulting in a war against Canada), the filmmakers are obviously addressing the issues surrounding their own creation.  <br/><br/>""South Park"" sparkles most in the ingenious parodistic musical sequences which brilliantly approximate in both style and sound those found in productions like ""West Side Story"" and ""Les Miserables"" (with lyrics that would get them banned in Boston of course). The animation matches the sound in its inventiveness and high energy style.  Much of the imagery also echoes sweetly those ""Peanuts"" cartoons of yesteryear.<br/><br/>So, given all these virtues, why does the film not register more highly on the laugh meter?  I suspect that it arises from the fact that the makers too often fall into their own trap of expecting the constant repetition of foul language to be a source of comedy in itself.  Unfortunately, though i am far from offended by such a barrage of obscenity, I am also not much amused by it.  Hopefully, most adults have long since passed the stage in their lives when the mere utterance of toilet humor can elicit a burst of hysterical laughter.  Luckily, the filmmakers provide enough creativity in story and style to make ""South Park"" a very entertaining piece of entertainment anyway.  One simply regrets that it isn't a funnier film all around."

","This movie is one of the best movies in a long time.  It is a complete social satire of what America represents.  I saw this film with a Colombian friend, and he didn't find it funny, because he says Americans really do act that way.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are a little long, but well worth it due to the portrayal of American cinema and Broadway.  The film offers low brow trashy humor and high brow parodies too.  Several references to Les Miserables, Busby Berkely, and Musical comedies, along with the sex and excrement jokes, make this movie hilarious.<br/><br/>I didn't find anything in the movie offensive, even though I was the only one laughing during some of the jokes (the average age of the audience was around 16-18, who didn't have any idea where half the material was taken from).  There are items that could be offensive, but they are a social comment of how society works (i.e. operation Human shield).<br/><br/>If you are easily offended, and don't like to look at the reality of today's youth, then don't go see this movie.  On the other hand, if you like to have a good time viewing a rehash of American culture, and you find items that challenge American ideologies interesting and exciting, then go see this masterpiece."

 It's every bit as original and surreal as Being John Malkovich, while managing to do what it wants to more successfully.  It is simply a brilliant parody of the classical musical, with examples of songs ranging from the typical Disney animated spectacle to musicals such as Oklahoma.<br/><br/> It also precedes Malkovich in its self-inversion - the response to the movie-within-a-movie documents the filmmaker's prediction  of the public response to South Park. Of course, it was simply perfect that the MPAA gave the film an NC17 rating (later changed to an R). What more could Trey Parker, the director, have asked for?<br/><br/>I loved the Matrix, but while that film was the most visually exciting of the year, its plot borrowed from about ten different science fiction authors - it's a very good movie, but perhaps not the most original.<br/><br/> Run Lola Run deserves a mention, but is smaller in its program.<br/><br/> American Beauty has been done; The Insider is well made, but not great; Three KIngs is original and interesting and well-made... okay, it should be in the top five.  Haven't seen Toy Story 2 yet, or the Ripley film...<br/><br/> Anyway, back to South Park...  The Bitch song, and video, deserves to go down in history as one of the best movie musical songs ever.<br/><br/> And Skeet Ullrich's picture above Satan's bed by itself deserves an Oscar for best Production Design."

(It certainly picked me up after that abysmal EPISODE I.) If you love the show, just believe me when I say that you'll literally choke with laughter during the film. It's easily the best comedy I've seen so far this year. If I had to describe this film in two words ""Brilliant Satire"" would effortlessly come to mind.<br/><br/>My only real concern is that half of the audience will probably miss the satire and especially the film's overall important message against censorship and intolerance. That is exactly why this raunchy film should not be seen by children. (It's rated ""R"" anyway.) The only thing that the kiddies will come away with is a warped-mind full of profanity. Adults, on the other hand, will be either too busy laughing at or being appalled by Southpark's nastiness, which is fine, but to do so at the exclusion of getting the point is an insult to the brutal satiric genius of this work. That said, Southpark is not for the squeamish, religious, easily offended, those impenetrable to satire--who could easily be part of the former--and especially not for young children under 17 years-old.<br/><br/>Quibbles: Other than exploding the brains of unsuspecting children who see this film, and they _will_ see this film (not unlike the boys of the film itself!), despite being explicitly prohibited, South Park is maybe ten minutes too long. I'm sorry, but after about twenty minutes, small, rotund, and badly-animated characters spewing expletives gets ever so old, which is exactly why the movie needed either more satire or simply _had_ to be shorter. <br/><br/>-------8/10"

","I've seen South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut half a dozen times, and it still manages to have me reeling with laughter.<br/><br/>What I can't believe is how so many viewers have completely missed the point of the movie. It amazes me that people get hung up on the swearing and toilet humor when Parker&Stone have obviously thrown it all there with a clear purpose.<br/><br/>Besides, it's not all fart jokes and vulgarity. I haven't counted them, but I would estimate maybe 3 instances of fart jokes (two of which are by Terrance&Phillip, who are the epitome of pointless humor for the sole purpose of self-irony from the makers or South Park - remember Cartman's comment ""besides, the animation's all crappy"").<br/><br/>On top of that, there are two or three dozen F-words, but very few in the second half of the movie. It's only a spark that gets the plot rolling. As for the nudity that some apparently delirious reviewers have been going on aboot, I for one couldn't see it. There's less male genitalia in South Park than in Boogie Nights.<br/><br/>It doesn't make much sense to compare South Park to ""normal"" movies. How could one rate the acting, for example? Suffice to say that South Park is, IMHO, one of the funniest movies ever, but also one of the most misunderstood movies ever. But I bet Parker&Stone knew this would happen when they set out to do what they did.<br/><br/>In a sense, it deserves 10 out of 10 in its own narrow genre, because I can't imagine it having been done any better. It could not be any more outrageous without being tasteless (I don't consider it tasteless at all, but then again, maybe I'm one of those emotionally dull GenXYZ'ers or whatever).<br/><br/>Anyone who is offended by South Park should take a serious look in the mirror. It is blatantly obvious that SP doesn't seriously put down any race, religion or group of people. They make fun of everything, because all people should be able to laugh at themselves before laughing at anything else.<br/><br/>To sum up, I suggest you watch it and make up your own mind. But please, please try to see past the obvious vulgarity and shock value. The movie does have an actual message, and a very rewarding one at that.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for?

Lots of vulgarity and some might actually find it offensive if they are of Canadian descent. But fear not, it's typical Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Everybody should like this movie from one stand point or another. If you have a favorite SP character, you will not be disappointed as all the kids and adults have pretty major roles. It is a must see for SP fans and anyone who likes animated movies with an adult theme.  Way to go for Matt and Trey!"

This is one of the funniest satires to come down the pike in a very very long time. The MPAA is slammed repeatedly. Knee jerk parental conservatism is slapped down again and again. I was a little disturbed, however, by the behavior of one audience I saw the movie with. During the scenes in hell there was what I perceived as an inappropriate reaction to Satan & Saddam's love life. Now, it's pretty clear that Parker & Stone are indeed attempting to rub our noses in some of the more 'colorful' aspects of man to fallen angel love.... but are they (Parker & Stone) aware of bull necked straight boy reaction to this in-your-face depiction? The reaction was one of derisive laughter and execrating gagging.<br/><br/>So - one gets back to the argument that sometimes satire - if it is too subtle is lost on all but the most discerning audience - and though the satirical bar may have been raised - some folks have no problem simply walking under said bar."

It's easily the best comedy I've seen so far this year. If I had to describe this film in two words ""Brilliant Satire"" would effortlessly come to mind.<br/><br/>
My only real concern is that half of the audience will probably miss the satire and especially the film's overall important message against censorship and the prevention of freedom of speech. This is exactly why this raunchy film should not be seen by children. (It's rated ""R"" anyway.) The only thing that the kiddies will come away with is a warped-mind full of profanity. Adults, on the other hand, will be either too busy laughing at or being appalled by Southpark's nastiness, which is fine, but to do so at the exclusion of getting the point is an insult to the brutal satiric genius of this work. To know for certain, you'll just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Again, I must warn that Southpark is not for the squeamish, religious, easily offended, those impenetrable to satire, and especially young children under 17 years-old.<br/><br/>Keep in mind this is from a guy who never intended to see this movie."

Before you start saying ""that kid shouldn't have seen that movie, it's too offensive"" or something like that, let me continue. I am a huge fan of the show, so I went to see the movie on the second day after its release. I was expecting a very offensive movie, from what the press had said. And they were right. However, it's not like I was spewing profanities after seeing it, go badmouthing other religions and races. By all means, parents, don't take your 7-year olds, but responsible viewers can get younger than you might think. Now, on with the review. This movie was brilliant. As a Canadian, this movie did not offend me at all; it's not supposed to be taken seriously. The musical numbers were classics (I bought the soundtrack right after seeing the movie) and there were actually some awesome effects in there. But above all, there is the moral of the movie.

","South Park:  Bigger, Longer and Uncut is one of those movies where you can't decide if you like it or not.  On one hand there are funny parts, such as all the songs and ""musical"" aspect of the movie.  On the other hand, there are parts that make you feel uncomfortable just watching it.  (Don't get me started on the Satan/Saddam Hussein thing).  I feel that it crosses the line too many times.  Now, I know what you're thinking, ""this guy probably never watched an episode in his life.""  Well, you're wrong.  I've watched South Park since it's birth.  Also, I'm one of the few people that actually has a copy of ""The Spirit of Christmas"" The very FIRST South Park, and therefore also one of the few that actually understood where the ""What Would Brian Boytano DO?"" song came from.  So as a fan of the show, believe me when I say that Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a disappointment.

The poor animation of the is far smoother in the film, and (gasp) the character's legs move when they run towards the screen. The descent into hell animation was superb too. It was great to see Sadam Hussien return (after his appearance in ""not without my anus"" from the TV series""). It would have been nice to see how Kenny resurects every week, but, some things are probably better left unknown. The songs were really great, especaily Terrence and Phillip singing ""Go f**k your uncle, uncle f**ka, your a bo*er biting ba***rd uncle f**ka!"" Those lines will probably make you decide wether you're going to see it or not. The swearing isn't the only joke in the film (unlike many people have said), theres a joke that will make all windows users around the world laugh. There are jokes at praticly ever corner of culture.

"IMDFan","Null","0","0","23 September 1999"," The next logical step
","I always worry when a TV show makes the jump from the small screen to the big one -- LOST IN SPACE is a prime example of why I worry.  Fortunately, SOUTH PARK didn't suffer from the TV-to-movie jinx thanks to the brilliance of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, two guys who thumbed their noses at the MPAA with flair and side-splitting satire.<br/><br/>People who say that this movie was simply pointless and an obvious attempt to cash in while the series is still popular were probably watching a different movie.  BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT rightly skewers parents who ignore their parental responsibilities and hand over the task of raising their children to TV and movies.  Sheila Broslofski epitomizes the uptight parent who screams in horror when she discovers her child is talking like every other child in the country.  She also represents interest groups that push the government (literally, in the case of the movie) towards their own goals -- in Mrs. Broslofski's case, laying blame on another country that actually belongs to her.  Even America's beloved military get reminded about their questionable methods of classifying soldiers for use in different assignments, like ""Operation Human Shield.""<br/><br/>As for the songs, some people have said they're disruptive and boring.  Word of advice for those people:  try *listening* to the lyrics -- they're pure genius!  From the hilarious ""Uncle F**ka"" to the rousing, LES MISERABLE-parodying ""La Resistance"" medley, the songs are entertaining and integral to characterization.  What better way to show Satan's longing to live on the surface world than to have him sing ""Up There?""<br/><br/>The argument that BIGGER is supposed to be a comedy and not a musical doesn't wash for an instant:  how many musicals have there been that were *not* comedies?  The two are practically synonymous in American cinema.  And again, the songs are, themselves, comedic -- they don't detract from the humor, they *contribute* to it.<br/><br/>While BIGGER didn't do the same kind of business that TARZAN or PRINCE OF EGYPT did, it certainly was more topical and relevant to what's going on in America today.  The MPAA and all the holier-than-thou watchdogs out there should watch this movie over and over -- they could stand to learn a thing or two."

I thought it had the potential to be funny, but could never live up to Election.  I knew it would ignore all indirect  and sophisticated humor, and I knew it would be composed of 99% toilet humor.  I was right.  I loved it. Leaving the theater I honestly DID find it the funniest movie of the year, and immediately recommended it to all my friends.  Many stay away because South Park is likely to offend.  That's the point.

But what is possibly the most interesting parts of the movie can. Parker and Stone have stated many times that they did constant battle with the ratings board over the movie.  For everything taken out, something worse was added in.  This makes South Park a one-of-a-kind movie.  No other movie has been such a slap in the face of ratings.  This quality will either make South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut a cult classic (loved and remembered by few) or a movie that changes the ratings system forever."

Actually, the humor aspect isn't surprising, but the satire and wit mixed in with the flatulence humor was razor sharp. Sure, the boys said the taboo F-word quite a few times, but there were nice parodies throughout. The musical numbers were quite funny, in my opinion, keeping the movie going for as long as they could. Although the movie is only 80 minutes, it still seemed just a tad too long, but I think it is safe to say that I was laughing for about 75 of those minutes. Terrance and Phillip seem to tickle my funny bone all the time, and having them throughout was good for me. I find it weird that this movie is possibly my favorite movie of the summer; it's easily in the top three. That's something I cannot say about movies I eagerly anticipated (Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, et.al.)

Indeed, the whole plot hangs on this kind of knee-jerk moralising and instinct to blame the media for everything that's wrong. And the very fact that films like this _can_ get made and certified and that the adults they're intended for _can_ go and see them is something to be proud of and to be defended.

While everyone and everything is made fun of in this movie, from Christians to Jews to Homosexuals to Canadians to Satan to Winona Ryder, this movie also brings out an important message: the right to freedom of speech.  While I don't know if the ingenious creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, meant to do this, or if they just wanted to get away with as many things as possible, or if their only reason was to flick off the MPAA, I have no idea.  What I do think however, was it was all three of those.  Sure Parker and Stone have expressed their dislike for the MPAA, and they have a right to after being smacked with an NC-17 rating for ""Orgazmo,"" their previous movie attempt before ""South Park.""  But they also created with this movie a very offensive, yet hilarious opinion on freedom of speech in America.  And who can't love this movie anyway?  Sure, every single viewer of this movie is made fun of one way or another, sometimes more than once, but who can't love the American Army going to war with Canada, and their creative language of mixing sex terms with various other nouns?  For example: ""You donkey-r*ping sh*t-eater.""  C'mon, that is just downright hilarious.  Plus, this was an excellent musical.  From the Terrance and Phillip movie's number one hit, ""Uncle F**ka,"" to Satan singing ""Up There,"" or Saddamm claiming ""I Can Change?""

","THE most brilliant satire of American culture to ever hit the SCREEN.  I am going to praise this film highly in this review so I wish to stress that there is one animated show to which it cannot, willl not, and does not hold a candle.  I am talking about The Simpsons.  The Simpsons is a mass parody of American culture that succeeds independently of media attention and long after the death of Bartmania.  That said this is a funny movie.  Being from a small town in Arkansas, the song Uncle F***er  was a shocker and a great release for me.  In fact the heart of the movie is its unmasking of the insane obsession Americans have with cursing.  The characters in the film favor inflicting pain on children, starting a war, kidnapping, demagogory, and commiting murder as long as the people who get hurt were using dirty words.  That is what is known as embarrassingly and frighteningly misplaced priorities.  This film teaches three lessons America must learn. 1).  There are NO BAD WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There are only bad thoughts and bad intentions.  Words themselves are innocent whereas people are not.  2). Violence is worse than anything, including sex and ""bad language"".  3).  The only ones who usually don't get blamed for the corruption of children are their parents and that is insane.

The songs are all so brilliant and much of the hilarity of the movie comes from watching top heavy cartoon characters with fat stumpy legs trying to do Gene Kelly dance routines. You get a feeling that Parker and Stone have an ambivalent attitude towards the musical for while they show how stupid some of the dances and tunes can be they are done with a wonderful exuberance.<br/><br/>The film is also marvelous because it not only takes a dig at the so many stupid things like moral panics, xenophobia, Bryan Adams and such but the musical genre is one of celebration and the film is a celebration of so much, of freedom of speech, friendship, of being young, of being young and learning swearwords for the first time, and of so many other things. <br/><br/>
Whereas films like Austin Powers are similar in that they have a rapid fire of crude one liners and visual gags you aren't left with the empty feeling of those films because beneath all South Park's expletives and jokes this movie has a plot and a hell of a lot to say. So if you aren't of an easily offended disposition this is highly recommended viewing."

","An excellent movie!!! If you can stomach plenty of harsh language, take a look... I happen to think that being able to swear repeatedly in a sentence, and create truly offensive insults is a fine art...masters of it would include Trey Parker/Matt Stone, and Quentin Tarantino. This film is a triumph of the masterfully crafted cuss. Worth a look for that alone! ;o) Anyway...as for the plot...America declares war on Canada for corrupting their youth ('horrific, deplorable violence is ok as long as nobody says dirty words!') and much chaos ensues...including the coming of Satan....with Sadam Hussein... Well...look...you have to see, it's too wierd to explain briefly. The fact is that it's hilarious...vulgar...and gloriously childish. I loved it, so I gave it an 8. Remember to look out for the Star-Wars references!  ""yousa sayin' people gonna die?""...and Cartman throwing lightning from his hands... not to mention a dictator getting chucked down a big hole!"

The film is like a comic, cartoon version of Les Miserables. Although the film is replete with profanity and crude humor, the levels, this most basic of animated feature, reaches is astounding. From racism re. Canada, to homosexual relations between Satan and Saddham Hussein in Hell, to musical production numbers, this is the best cartoon ever and one of the best films of the year.

It's gloriously and unashamedly non-PC, but that doesn't really matter as everyone is a target for the Axis Powers of Kenny/Kyle/Stan /Eric - nobody is spared.<br/><br/>The Financial Times, hardly a rabid anarchist newssheet, described this film as the greatest pæan to free speech', and awarded it 10 points out of 10.

I am a recent convert to South Park and have only managed to watch a few episodes. A couple of the episodes had me in stitches and while the film never reached that height it was close.<br/><br/>A couple of insights:<br/><br/>Both heaven and hell are depicted during the movie. While heaven is portrayed using 'normal' (ie. cardboard cut out) animation, hell is lavished with fluid special effects. No prizes for which destination the animators are more interested in.<br/><br/>This is the second comedy I've seen that depicts the US going to war with Canada. Some of the jokes went over my head; '(Canada) is not even a real country.'  This is funny? There is obviously some friction between these two nations. National distrust between neighbours is common; the Scottish don't like the English who don't like the French. Most of Europe can't stand the Germans and they hate the Russians. Most of this can be put down to historical conflicts but US and Canada? Why?"

Otherwise, this movie was a laugh riot.  When I thought the movie was starting to go downhill, they introduced The Mole, one character who had me laughing with every word he spoke.  Please, see this movie... it'll make you laugh, and possibly even think of how you're raising your kids, or how we're all raising America.

Instead, it takes a big step in political and social satire at things most Americans and Canadians have not given a second thought about.  The film also adds a really good touch of adult humor to both child and adult situations.  We hear many songs like a Disney musicals have,  but with a touch of curses.  At some points the film has the appearance of Peanuts with language like Penthouse (the love scenes with Satan and Sadaam Hussein are more raunchy than in any ""Mary"" movie).

Now that I have that little rant out of the way, I'll say that ""South Park"" is about the only movie I found to be worth seeing this year.  By South Park's standards, it's average; in other words, it's about as funny as any of the TV episodes (which I think is pretty darned funny). Compared to every other movie out there, though, it is a work of genius! Behind the crude jokes and overall bad taste lies real honest-to goodness satire!  (In an age like ours which begs to be lampooned, I'm often bemused at how little real satire is out there.)<br/><br/>One caveat: this movie is R-rated for a reason.  It's pretty raunchy.

","This is a movie that would make John Waters proud and, possibly, even blush. Here is the best adaptation of a series to a full length feature.  Beavis and Butthead stood by their usual antics on the big screen as they did on TV but Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done something (dare I say?) clever here- Not only have they simply make a longer feature, but have turned it into a musical which makes it a lot more entertaining!  You won't stop humming T&P's song, nor ""Blame Canada"".<br/><br/>As for the content some say this shows that society is being degraded and more offensive with less and less class  (Trey and Matt did the movie on purpose to get back at the MPAA for what they did to Orgazmo).  My humble opinion is that it has actually forwarded progress of our society.  Long before this movie, the four letter words were very taboo.  They still are but not as bad, and I think the effect has lessened now that this movie is full of it.  First (?) came Blue Velvet, then Pulp Fiction, now this, and i bet many more movies, to come.  Also, moviemakers can take more risks too. Think about it- 50 years ago a girl walking around the town showing her ANKLE was considered offensive-which is utter silliness.  Just think what another 50 years will bring.<br/><br/>I only have minor complaints about the movie- the songs aren't clearly understood, and the movie drags near the middle but picked up the pace near the end.  Overall the whole effect of the movie is awesome and, quite powerful, in fact. It's also funny as hell.  Looking for a hilarious, offensive, profanity filled movie?  You get your money's worth."

If you're easily offended, then don't go see this, because it picks on just about everybody.  It was very artistic, the construction paper looks excellent on the big screen, and even though it's animated, it has some great special effects, especially Kenny's trip to Hell, and the Hell sequences in general.  The fire mixed very well with the animation. The musical numbers were mostly great, but they could have done without the Saddam Hussein song or the Satan song.  The rest were really funny.  The Saddam/Satan thing got kind of old, but Kenny giving advice to Satan was good.  There are a lot of hidden and ""in"" jokes for fans of the show. Lots and lots of profanity.  And you finally get to see Kenny's face and hear his voice sans hood.  I'm still trying to decide if that was a good move or not. A GREAT cameo by George Clooney.

About 4 friends in a small little red-neck town, and the repercussions upon their viewing of a ""Rated R"" film, this movie blasts us in the face with the message of HOW POORLY PARENTS ARE RAISING THEIR CHILDREN.

","What can be said of this film that ""reputable"" reviewers haven't already said? It is a comedy, musical and war film all rolled into one. If you're looking for a moralistic story, there's one in there as well. I saw the film during the school holidays in NSW and was surprised at the number of under 15's who managed to get in.<br/><br/>The real fans of the South Park TV series will appreciate the effort that has gone into the making of the film. It is not representative of the way the series episodes are structured. In retrospect, it seems to be a rehash of an older South Park episode, Death, that featured Terrance and Phillip being protested about by the adults of the town, but the story has filled out well.<br/><br/>I won't reveal any major incidents here. That would spoil the fun but:<br/><br/>Satan is at his best trying to cope with the advances of a lovestruck Saddam Hussein while receiving life advice from Kenny.<br/><br/>Kyles mother still maintains her position as the moral center of the town and it's occupants, much to the dismay of every child of the town.<br/><br/>Some startling omissions from the cast are Mr Hankey and Jesus. After all, what is a battle of good and evil without the ultimate good?<br/><br/>The profanity level is what gave the film an MA rating in Australia, which apparently is the equivalent of an R rating in the USA, so make sure you don't let your parents know you are going to see this film. Do what the kids did in the film - pay an adult to pretend that you are with them.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is superb. The music isn't half hearted and the songs fit in well with the story, sort of like one of the old MGM Musicals of old.<br/><br/>My rating of the film has to be at least 11 out of 10.

"Rerun-2","Null","0","0","1 July 1999"," Outrageous, offensive...and funny
","I shrink from criticizing ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"".  The movie is uncategorizable, except perhaps as comedy, I guess.  It is appalling, outrageous, incredibly offensive...and in the end, very funny.<br/><br/>That's right, funny.  I am probably one of the last people who would expect to find myself laughing at scenes of small, badly animated children uttering unbelievably foul dialogue in rapid succession, but ""South Park"" left me rolling on the floor sometimes.  I am not too proud of all I laughed at, nor am I sure it is a good thing.  It is an understatement to say that much of the humor in the movie pushes the boundaries of bad taste.  It is certainly not for young children, which is of course the point of the movie, or as close as you will get to a point.<br/><br/>What plot there is follows the misadventures of the children of South Park, mainly Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, in trying to get into an R-rated movie starring their heroes, off-color Canadian comedians Terrance and Philip, whose comedy centers mainly on shouting curses at each other and making bodily noises you would not likely hear at dinner parties.  One thing leads to another, and soon President Clinton is issuing war against Canada, while Satan and recently departed Saddam Hussein carry on a affair fraught with communication issues.  It doesn't matter how the movies gets there. In the meantime there are jabs, or better put, groin-kicks, against countless celebrities.  I think I can recall Brian Dennehy, Brian Boitano, Wynona Ryder, the Baldwin brothers, and Bill Gates, just to name a few.<br/><br/>What is there to say about this movie, but that I laughed?  I am familiar with its characters from the series, which I have watched only on occasion. Most of the laughs on the series were genuinely drawn, but the movie forced laughs out of me, partly from shock; I simply could not believe what I was seeing.  The movie goes way, way over the top the way it pulls its punches, but it is certainly ambitious in its undertaking.<br/><br/>Expect to be offended.  Many of the jokes are flat-out gross.  These are the ones I laughed at.  I also laughed at the ones that made fun of popular culture.  This is fair game, in my opinion.  I did not laugh at several jokes that were simply racially insensitive, to say the least.  Those left me feeling unclean, and could have been left out without taking anything away from the movie.<br/><br/>I am told that the creators of South Park, who made this movie, did so largely to send a message to the Motion Picture Association of America, who is notorious for giving tougher ratings to movies with strong language than those that are blood-soaked.  They have responded by creating a movie that contains heavy doses of both, with a smattering of gross-out humor.  The result?  A movie that Cartman would say ""warped my fragile little mind!"""
"TomServo-17","10","0","0","20 July 1999"," A stroke of ironic genius.
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone created a monster in 1997 with the release of ""South Park"". Very few films based on TV shows are as good as the show (Beavis and Butt-Head do America comes to mind), but ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" really is a great movie. And believe it or not parents, this movie has a message! It says that nobody notices violence and perversion, but profanity is just a disgrace. As George Carlin says, ""No bad words. Bad thoughts, bad intentions, and words."" The words don't matter. It's the motivation behind them. When Cartman says ""What's the big f**kin' deal, bitch?"" He's basically addressing my exact thoughts. Why do parents care if their kids say the f-word? I bet a lot of the kids who are ""protected"" from this movie will end up in an asylum if not a state prison. This truly was ironic genius, because they get their message out, and they keep their gimmicks (i.e. ""Oh my God! They killed Kenny!) intact. Sheer genius. They manage to get your attention and hold it. Granted, not as long as Saving Private Ryan, but still, South Park's message is more original. I love this movie."

","Uncut? Unlikely. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is very, very rude and very often hilarious but it could and should have gone much further.<br/><br/>I'd say that either the producers got cold feet or they just ran out ideas. But still the result is often a scream.<br/><br/>The movie is in the form of a Disney musical and at first the lyrics are delightfully seditious, very South Park. It's a shame that the songs, and there are many of them, become straight. They BECOME Disney musical numbers and that is where South Park gets a bit boring.<br/><br/>But there is plenty to feast on before the next yawn.<br/><br/>The charm for me in the television series of South Park lies largely in the innocence of the South Park kids. They say and do awful things but hardly ever have any real idea of what they are up to.<br/><br/>For instance, one of the boys falls in love with his lesbian teacher and his Dad jokingly tells him that if he wants to impress her he'll  have to learn how to ""lick carpet"". So that's what we later see the boy do. He literally licks carpet! What's a lesbian?<br/><br/>In this film version, the satire is, if anything, more intense and more offensive than the TV series. Fans will be pretty delighted. Puritans should probably not attend.<br/><br/>I do recommend however that all grade 8 children should be taken to see the film by their schools, and especially that the teachers attend. Most young students will see it anyway one way or the other and at least then the teachers will know where the obscenities that will erupt from sweet little mouths have come from.<br/><br/>And I would hope that teachers would find much of South Park hilarious. At least then we could be sure that our children are being properly prepared for life with the proper amount of skepticism!<br/><br/>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut has a strong dig at Canadians for some reason or another, Australians fleetingly and  exults in a  wonderful smack at Bill Gates and Microsoft.<br/><br/>Hey I was one of those who cheered and applauded in the cinema when Windows 98 was deliciously maligned. There must be a good deal of resentment (or is it envy) sucked deep within this little Windows victim, and a good many others as well, judging by the comments coming from around the world on the internet re the film.<br/><br/>Some plot elements. Satan is Gay, a nice guy and he's being literally screwed by Saddam Hussein! It's the mothers who are the reactionaries. One of the teachers is recruited to become a state executioner and Winona Ryder is very, very clever with ping pong balls.<br/><br/>But there are many more rude and crude words in South Park than Winona Ryder can fit ping pong balls within herself. But remember. It is indeed true that words can never really hurt you. At least words from eight year olds."

Ok, the Saddam/Satan thing got a little old, but it did make Saddam look like a real jerk, so it was ok by me.

Adults, on the other hand, will be too busy either laughing at or being offended by South Park's nastiness, which is fine, but to do so at the exclusion of getting the point is an insult to this work's brutal satiric genius.

","This Movie is Excellent. I am a big fan of South Park(series), But the show has lost it's humor a little bit. This Movie is what the series needs to survive. South Park is a change from the low level violence/humor combination of the Simpsons. South Park(series) was right on the edge of high level violence/humor combination, But(in Australia) it didn't quite make it(because in Australia the swear words are beeped out), it wasn't offensive enough to get the high level rating. The Movie, however, gets the high level violence/humor, but this isn't why it gets the 10 in my books. It gets 10 because the way it delves into subjects that most people start of by saying: ""Hey, What If...?"" and your friend replies: ""Yeah, That Would Be Really Cool"". That's what attracts most people. It also scores a 10 for the way its 4 main characters are set. They're all different, they all have their different problems and handle them in different way, But they also have different lives. It's amazing they're all friends, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone make it work with great success and this where I end my comments and end by saying: MATT STONE & TREY PARKER ARE THE BEST AND I URGE EVERYBODY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>

","After much ado, and after seeing most of the first season and a handful other of the TV shows, I saw the movie today.<br/><br/>First let me emphasize, second, and third the notion that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT for kids (middle school or younger).  I know this is true because when I came out of the theater, I felt that the movie had been a bad influence on ME, a 19-year-old (although I admit I know some 13-year-olds that would NOT have been influenced badly by this, judging from their vocabularies and attitudes; it's all relative I suppose).<br/><br/>I'm surprised that none of the reviews I've seen so far have mentioned the original ""Jesus vs. Santa"" short.  The profanity in this movie, though more massive, just about pales in intensity and density compared to the 5-minute short.  In fact, throughout most of the movie, I noticed the creators paying homage to the short (in some of the vulgar jokes used, and the whole ""bryan boytano"" sequence).  I laughed so hard, when they set it up like they did in the short but he didn't appear, that my brother got mad at me (I was disturbing the other 5 people in the matinee showing).<br/><br/>I loved the social commentaries, satires, and parodies.  I liked how the whole ""terrence and philip movie"" concept was actually a parody of ""the south park movie""!!  I liked the musical parodie, and how it didn't quite tear down musicality but instead used it as a tool for more satire.  The rips on the MPAA were ""sweet"".  The bill gates thing was unexpected, funny, and short enough to contribute before becoming petty (like the ""siskel and ebert"" gag in godzilla).  I was also surprised by the amount of screentime and destruction recieved by the scanned-headed character of Saddam H; it seemed like it would be just a one-liner, judging from the commercials.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks the movie is mean-spirited truly doesn't get the whole parody/satire deal.  Everyone they bashed, except for saddam and the MPAA, was being bashed in backward-satire; the usual bashing was being exaggerated in order to properly satirize it (such as ""operation human shield"", an ingenious farce of racisim in the military).<br/><br/>This all being said, I must admit that as a whole the movie wasn't perfect. It was more of a roller-coaster in its various parts; it started off slow, shot up, went down some, shot up again, and on and on, being a little weak in some parts only to draw outrageous laughter (or outrage) a minute later. All in all I'd say it's very worth seeing, but ONLY if you are keen to south park's usual satirical humor (or, not offended by every little thing like some people I've seen).  A definite DVD purchase for me!  I just hope they include the original short!  (I was rather disappointed that it didn't roll after the credits, though another ""tasty"" morsel did if you missed it).<br/><br/>In closing; 9 out of 10 stars (only since i can't give 9.5), and the last star is for the weak parts, and saddam's rubber ""thing"" which i really didnt need to see.  Also, i'm curious as to how (as one reviewer put it) it pokes fun at anime??  ;-)"

Nevertheless, this is proof that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are for real.<br/><br/>The TV show has often been the target of cultural worriers - the film answers back with a broadside: it features as much profanity, violence, blasphemy and deliberately offensive behavior as any film I've ever seen, and it presents it's critics as morons who found organizations like Mothers Against Canada and end up inviting the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The boys sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie, starring their heroes Terrence and Philip, and emerge with an obscene  vocabulary that sends their parents into a tizzy. The parents then do what parents do best: engage in a fit of blaming other people. They end pointing their finger at Canada - it's about as logical a target as ""the culture,"" ""the media"" or ""the guns"" - and start a war.<br/><br/>There is an absolutely  hilarious sequence involving the US military operation (the general says something like, ""OK, 14th squadron, you're our shield - you're at the vanguard of this operation. Where are you guys?"" Every black soldier tentatively raises his hand.)<br/><br/>Cartman is forced to test an anti-obscenity V-chip implanted directly into his brain - the results are predictable, but pretty funny, though it's a bit of a crib from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br/><br/>Maybe the best scenes involve Kenny, who dies and goes to hell, where Satan and Saddam Hussein are involved in a torrid romance - Saddam is a randy, insensitive lout, and Satan is the insecure, manipulated, oft-abused ""female"" of the pairing.<br/><br/>Brilliant, twisted and immensely satisfying."

","I don't know about you, but I thought this movie kicked ass!  It certainly was a hell of a lot more than I expected it to be.  I thought it was going to turn out like ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"", which lost it's comedy almost immediately.  ""South Park"" was a non-stop laugh throughout, and they aren't lying when they said it was ""Bigger, Longer, and Uncut""!  Finally, I found ""South Park"" extremely funny, because the R-rating finally gave it's creators the freedom to swear and get some really disgusting humor out. Oh, and anyone who says this film is plotless and is just a bunch of kids using foul language obviously didn't pay much attention to the movie.  This was the perfect time to release the film, since the whole nation went up in smoke after the Columbine incident.  After the Columbine incident, an eruption of attacks and blame flew at the media, the games, and the movies. Never at any point, did the people try to find out why those kids did what they did.  They simply, and ignorantly searched for a scapegoat.  Now we've got Bill Clinton reminding theater owners to card kids to see R-rated films. It's ridiculous that society could be this idiotic.  What are they protecting kids from?  In ""Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"", the foursome sneak into an R-rated movie, and come out swearing and cursing.  However, the parents didn't try talking to their kids about their language problems. They blamed Canada for making the R-rated film.  This film is a comedy, yet it played moreover as an attack on the MPAA.  The MPAA is an unconstitutional system created years ago.  And the public, who felt secure with a somewhat official system, stuck with it, and here we are.  The creators of ""South Park"" were obviously trying to cram in as much foul language as they could, without getting an NC-17.  People wonder how this movie escaped an NC-17.  The answer is simple.  The show was extremely popular, and slapping a film with an NC-17 would destroy the marketability.  I told my dad that Paramount wanted to go for a PG-13 rating, and he said ""That's impossible!  It wouldn't be the same movie!"" So, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" may be really nasty.  But that doesn't mean it's not a hilariously funny movie that's got a message locked within it.  The TV show was restrained, so at some times, I got bored with it.  This movie was so funny, and so unrestrained, my sides were hurting by the end of the movie.  Definitely see it, but be forewarned, THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE!  I was suprised to see how many 8 and 9 year olds were at the theater.  Parents should see it first, and judge for themselves.

","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut addresses many current social issues besides being uproariously funny.  The vast majority of people in the audience each time I saw this film were laughing outloud.  The film is -- to say the very least -- politically incorrect, crude, and irreverent of ""traditional"" values, and while poking fun at politics, religion, ethnic and social issues, it does not take itself too seriously either.  The movie is inventively presented as a musical and has the feel of an old MGM film or Broadway show.  The songs written mostly by Trey Parker were very well done and fit well.  BUT what the movie does best is address the MPAA ratings issue and in a larger context the question of what is wrong with contemporary American society.  By the way, I believe I read this movie had to cut to get an ""R"" rating.  It presents the cultural war going on in America today.  Is it values (allegedly decreasing) or violence (allegedly increasing) which is at the heart of our social problems?  The movie addresses these issue subtly, all the while being hilarious.  This is a well crafted movie that can be appreciated on more than one level.  CAUTION: It deserves its rating and if you are easily offended avoid this film. Otherwise I highly recommend this film for its importance and entertainment value.  Three and half stars!!!"

There is lots of toilet humor, but the best parts have always been strange little bits that just come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The ""South Park"" movie makes up for the current episodes, since it is obvious that all of Trey and Matt's creativity has been focused at making this movie something worth paying money to see.  The situations are absolutely outrageous, the musical bits all work, and there's plenty to tick off everyone on both sides of the political spectrum.<br/><br/>The only major problem is not enough of Chef who, even though he is a minor character, is one of the best in the show.  The parts he is in are great, of course.<br/><br/>From what I understand, quite a bit had to be cut out of this movie because of the MPAA freaking out.

""South Park"", the show, has has so many brilliant moments that it's easy to overlook how amazing the things they say and do really are.<br/><br/>Also, like me, they hate the Baldwin family, Bill Gates, the military, censorship, and school counsellors; like me, they like Nick Rhodes enough to have him do a line (which doesn't sound like Nick at all -- he's the Canadian bomber pilot who...

Sure, the word and many, many others are found all throughout the rest of the film, but it's done in such a blatantly gleeful manner, that you can almost see Trey Parker and Matt Stone sitting back and laughing at the Motion Picture Association. So is the movie just about how far they can push the profanity barrier? No. It's actually entertaining as a musical, and has a message that, with the way things are happening in the news today, couldn't have come along at a better time.  Four potty-mouthed kids actually make a strong, sensible point.  Who knew?<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, everything that could have a boundary to be crossed, from racism to homosexuality, is completely trampled on, making nothing safe or untouched.  This movie is very much an equal-opportunity offender.  The movie spoofs everything from Star Wars, anime, Tommy, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the songs, although bizarre, are actually quite good.  My only complaint about the music is that Chef didn't have his own musical number.<br/><br/>The movie also reveals some of the great South Park mysteries such as ""What does Kenny look like under his hood"", and everyone cameos at some point or another.  The animation ranges from what you would find on the show to ""dramatic"" cinematic camera angles.<br/><br/>Overall, South Park is an enjoyable film, but is definitely rated ""R"" for a reason.  I'm sure there will be a lot of groups saying that this movie is exactly why there are so many problems with society, but these are the same people who will never watch the film, and see that the film is poking fun at itself.

I mean it. I'm not being prudish or censoring, I'm just warning you of dire consequences.  There are phrases in this movie even I've never heard, and I thought I had heard them all.<br/><br/>I don't need to tell you the plot, or how funny it was, because a hundred reviews have already said as much.  I remember what it was like to be a child, and I know that this movie, if they see it, will affect them permanently.<br/><br/>Having said that, I think it's also fair to note that this movie, in addition to being Adults Only, should have a minimum intelligence requirement, for two reasons.  First of all, if you're not smart enough, you won't ""get"" the point of the movie.  You'll only perceive it as a politically incorrect trashfest (which, in all fairness, it is) and nothing more.  However, allow yourself the nerves of steel to get past the blue humor (or perhaps embrace it, if you dare), and pick up on the theme: parents are responsible for their children, not the rest of the world. There are worse things out there than ""South Park"" (probably), and it's up to parents-- ah, forget it.<br/><br/>There's the other group of people who will enjoy this simply for its shock value.  They, too, are missing the point, though only slightly.  Sure, vulgarity supposedly saves the day in the movie (I won't say how), but IT'S A JOKE.  They're not trying to promote the ""F"" word (right?...), they're just trying to get people to see how trivial language can--<br/><br/>Okay, no more tangents.  Bottom line: this is the best movie I've ever seen that I wouldn't recommend to just anyone.

It's when the parents act shocked at the behavior that they themselves probably indulged in that the world gets screwed, with possibly apocalyptic results.<br/><br/>From start to finish, ""South Park"" is an all singing, all dancing riot -- just as musical as the latest Disney crap, but with a point.  Make no mistake, this is NOT a Disney film, despite the animation.  Best that the grown ups see it before deciding whether to take their kids -- but, again, that's part of the point.  The film is rated ""R"" for a reason, and parental responsibility (or rejection thereof) is a big topic in this story.<br/><br/>I won't try to describe the plot here; suffice it to say that the latest ""Terrence & Phillip"" movie, ""Asses of Fire,"" causes a bit of controversy in South Park, the parents over-react, and everything takes off from there. Along the way, there are hilarious songs, foul language, a couple of really nasty sight-gags, hypocrisy on parade, several penises, lots of flatulence, celebrity cameos, and an almost constant barage of funny lines that will have you rolling in the aisles -- unless you're a stuck-up puritan who thinks movies like this shouldn't exist -- or you're dead.<br/><br/>Anyway, see this movie.  Let me say it again.  See this movie.  It's a perfect example of how truly good and funny a film can be when the filmmakers listen to their hearts, and not some A-Hole in a suit who's read Syd Field and thinks they know movies.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made a fortune off of ""South Park,"" and yet don't seem to have sold out at all. Here's hoping that this film leads to a just as raunchy fanchise, and that the viewing audience actually gets the lessons they're trying to teach us.<br/><br/>If not, well, to paraphrase T&P -- ""You're f*****.""  And, the fact that I have to use asterisks is yet another commentary on ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.""  Or, maybe, vice versa..."
"Joel I","9","0","0","10 July 1999"," A great comedy
","This is one of the funniest movies ever made if you're not going to be offended by crude language and gross-out behavior that sets a new standard. In addition to being just flat out funny, the movie is also an excellent satire on moral hypocrisy as well as a dead-on parady of Disney musicals (with ""Les Miserables"" thrown in as an unlikely bonus).  Totally unexpected is the excellent song score, the best since ""Beauty and the Beast"" (and the songs are just as hilarious as the rest of the movie).  This movie is better than the TV series and exceeded my greatest expectations going in.  Don't miss it -- just don't bring kids, your Aunt Hannah, or Pat Robertson."

The realism of some of it was incredibly disconcerting, but that's not what you leave the theater thinking about.  It was truly funny, and it amazes me how far they were willing to go with certain jokes, and what lines they were willing to cross.  The ""musical"" aspect of it was also surprisingly good.

Nothing is sacred in South Park, something we have learned from the TV show. But this time Trey Parker and Matt Stone take it to a new level in this satire focusing on current political and social issues in the US and in the world.

This movie is hilarious right from the beginning and doesn't stop.  A lot of the humor is really vulgar and they make fun of everyone that is different.

"Rusty-61","Null","0","0","9 July 1999"," I laughed so hard my stomach hurt the next day
","This is the hardest I've laughed at a movie I saw in the theater in literally years. I expected it to be pretty good, but it was even better. Though I don't get Comedy Central, I've seen about half the episodes on video and read the scripts for them all, and have always laughed my butt off at the incredible bad taste and Cartman's voice. (it's the WAY he says stuff). And yes, I am a grown woman. It's too bad the idiots at the MPAA wouldn't let them go with the original title, ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" as it would have been more appropriate to the plot and tone. As I'm sure you've read, Parker and Stone told the MPAA, pretty much as a joke because they never expected them to go for it, to change the title to the present one, and the MPAA didn't get the joke and said it was OK. The songs were great, and didn't slow the movie down as I thought they would. I especially liked, ""It's Easy Mmmmkay"" and ""Uncle F*cka"" but my all time favorite number was ""Kyle's Mom is a B*tch"" as performed by Cartman, this time with a couple of extra languages thrown in. I laughed so hard and loud at this that I had to put my hand over my mouth, because I was actually worried that someone would complain to the usher. And Cartman's one-word reaction (which I can't print here, partially because of the profanity and partly because it will be funnier if you don't know it's coming)at the end of the song when he turns around and sees that Kyle's Mom is actually standing behind him and has heard the last verse had the whole audience cheering and clapping. Speaking of audience reaction, the only time the audience cheered more strongly was when Bill Gates is shot. I saw the movie in Seattle and you should have heard the crowd go nuts! So besides the movie being hilarious, it's actually well thought-out (I thought) and had care put into it. Man, would I love to see the parts they cut out, considering the stuff they got away with! My only complaint was that it was too short, and that the insane school bus driver was not in it-I missed her. I also was grateful my least favorite South Park character, Mr. Hankey, did not make an appearance. I plan to see it again in the theater at least once, and then buy it on video. Oh, and don't feel guilty if you were the only one laughing at ""Operation Human Shield"". Though you could practically hear the jaws dropping, every single person in the theater laughed their guts out at that (and cheered for Chef's revenge). I can't say enough good things about this movie, or describe how funny it is--you have to see it to beleive it. Unless you're Mr or Ms P.C. in which case stay away--though who knows, even people who need to lighten up might find themselves hating themselves for laughing at this movie. I give it 10 out of 10 stars."

This film has many things, many the pre teens should not see, and many of them are slapping the censors in the face.  The film has many raunchy scenes and enough curse words to make a NC-17 non-animated film.  But there are a lot of funny scenes that make up these sick ones.  Watch for Canada as they bomb the Arquettes and Baldwins and as Stan looks for a very sensual part of the body.  This film defies everything censors try to block out and then some.

It is sad that the makers of South Park didn't even try for a film that would have gotten a PG-13 rating.

","""South Park: Bigger, longer & uncut"" is an uneven film that is nevertheless hilarious, witty and one of the crudest things you'll see this or any year. Imagine your shock upon seeing the TV episode for Mr. Hankie, the Christmas poo (trust me, if you don't know you don't want to) and triple it. There are fart jokes, women's time of the month jokes and enough explicit gay sex references to make Rupert Everett wince. In addition, there are moments of razor sharp satire (for those unsure which is which, humorists go after their target to make it like a pet; satirists want to mount it over the TV.) concerning ""moral authorities,"" the dangers of mob rule and French Existentialism. And did I mention that it's a parody of Disney musicals, with 16 songs? There's even a cgi-enhanced 360 degree tracking shot of Satan (whose lover is Saddam Hussein) as he warbles in melancholy, ala ""Beauty and the Beast!""<br/><br/>And there's no way in hell you should let your children see it. ""South Park"" is gleefully profane. One musical number is entitled ""Uncle Fu-ka"" and you'll be tempted to sing along, for it and many others are very catchy tunes. But unless you're George Carlin I doubt you want your ten year old belting out ""She's a big ol' bitch..."" around the kitchen. The reason I said it was uneven is on account of these musical numbers, which begin to become monotonous after awhile. In addition, some scenes do rely too much on the spectacle of the tots cussing a blue streak and the shock wears out quickly. Overall, this crude, crass and sharp film made me laugh out loud more than any film of recent memory."

","Some people might call it crude, vulgar, the core of the problems in our damned society, etc. etc. but that's exactly what this movie is making fun of.  It's pure genius.  It's absolutely the funniest movie I have seen in years. Behind the crude and ""infantile"" jokes and gags, there is a wonderful and heart-felt satire -- really makes you think.  At one point or another, it manages to offend just about everyone in the world, but at the same time the message is loud and clear -- there are worse things then vulgar languages -- war, hatred, racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious brainwashing, violence, ignorance, etc. etc.  It's all there. We laugh at them, and then we realize we are living with them.<br/><br/>Aside from the social message (OK, maybe it's not as deep as we thought), the movie is just purely entertaining and hilarious (however, I do suggest you not let anyone under the age of 10 to see this)   Making it a musical is just marvelous. The songs are catchy (I can't get ""Uncle F**ka"" and ""Blame Canada"" out of my head)  and the way they parody the various musicals from ""The Sound of Music"" to ""Les Miserables"" to Disney cartoons (the opening sequence is a dead-on parody of that in ""Beauty and the Beast"") is simply delicious.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws, however, like everything else.  The third act is a bit weak, especially when compared with the first and second. There were some dry spots and some jokes weren't really that funny by the end. And my personal gripe is that they showed Kenny's face at the end.  I groaned.  Please, one of the joy of seeing South Park is that we never know what Kenny looks or sounds like or says.  So that kind of spoiled it for me.   And the relationship between Saddam and Satan dragged on a bit too long. Just like any real relationship, I guess.<br/><br/>rating:  *** 3/4 out of **** or       A-"

","After you see this movie, I guarantee that you will leave the theater, speechless, for a while. South Park delivers a comedy that holds no limits and explodes in a violent assault on every race, creed, group, sex, or affiliation and doesn't give in, ever. If you are somebody who is easily hurt when hearing constant bashing of minorities and foreigners or if you are offended by the use of foul language, don't see this movie. For the rest of the public though, this is the best comedy that I've seen in a long time. Like any other South Park episode, the movie has an elaborate story that is completely bizarre and impossible, but believable enough to enjoy. Unlike the television show though, this movie holds no limits on cussing and cleanliness, along with the fact that it is a musical. Unless you are a very uptight individual, the movie will make you laugh until your ribs hurt and then you will laugh some more. I've always felt that I knew dirty comedy, but there were sexual bashes in this movie that I didn't even understand. This is truly an excellent work of comedy in its darkest form. The fact that Trey Parker and Matt Stone used this movie as a way to get back at the stupid MPAA is even better. Well I congratulate Parker and Stone, because this movie was incredible and made me a much bigger fan of the series.

Practically no one is spared in this movie, as far as satire is concerned, and you'll be rolling in the aisles if you can recognize the parallels that Parker and Stone draw between life and art.  Despite the cursing, fart jokes, and Broadway-style musical numbers, the film is truly a serious look at the seemingly downward spiral of American society.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of the ""South Park"" TV show, though I have yet to see some of the later episodes.

It's rated ""R"" for a REASON -  the same reason that the show itself is on cable at 10:30PM... it's for ADULTS only!  Sometimes ""animation"" does not equal ""for kids"".  That being said, the movie's raunchiness has a purpose - to teach us not to blame the world for what our children do but to look to ourselves for a change. The boys sneak into an ""R""-rated movie, and as a result begin using foul language. The parents (led of course, by Kyle's mom) want to wipe out Canadian comedy rather than face the facts that they should be paying more attention to their children. Not everyone will like or ""get"" this movie. But in the words of Joel Hodgson, creator of MST3K, ""The right people will get it."" Or maybe in this case, the people who NEED to get it will not. There are what seem on the surface to be a lot of racial/ethnic/sexual remarks, but it isn't offensive, since everyone is slammed in the same manner, and the insults are there to show you how stupid they are. Social commentary aside, it's one HILARIOUS movie from beginning to end. I have never heard so many bust-a-gut laughs in a theater in my life. See it if you dare!!"

It's a bit heavy handed in spots, but that's partially obscured by all the jokes.<br/><br/>The film does contain a great deal of language, violence, and adult humor. However, it's never gratuitous.

One of many points made by this film is that the ""blame"" for foul language cannot be put squarely on the shoulders of performing artists exercising their right to free speech. Parents!  Wake up!

","In its abhorrence of moms, the Army, appropriate viewing material, Bill Clinton's legacy-polishing through NATO bombing, Alan Menken scores, and finally itself, SOUTH PARK ranks among NATURAL BORN KILLERS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in the annals of studio movies that atomize every item of mainstream culture and dearly-held values that pass in their wake. Unfortunately, it doesn't equal those movies in acuity, skill, or even laughs. It's a ninety-minute movie in which construction-paper stick figures call each other testicle-biters. That the filmmakers manage to hold our interest with that material on a giant screen for an hour and a half is a heroic achievement; but the pre-release hype outpaces the movie--at least in the yuks department.<br/><br/>The movie suggests that Stone and Parker may be smart guys who could actually graduate from the poo-poo world; it also suggests that might not really believe all this scandalous stuff, any more than Howard Stern does when he pulls off a gross stunt to maintain his ""outrageous"" quotient. (You can sense him wanting to discuss politics, or talk to Albert Brooks.) The test of the movie's effectiveness for me, though, is that it really makes you angry at its satirical targets. It has an invigorating I'm-gonna-say-whatever-I-want-and-you-can't-stop-me quality--you wouldn't think anyone could work you up into a lather over nosy parents and Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>SOUTH PARK is a badly needed corrective to the protect-our-precious-children smarm that arose in the wake of the Littleton shooting--it's the only voice that has emerged in popular culture to say what's needed. It says the unspeakable--that all this protectiveness really isn't about the kids in question at all, but about parents' images of themselves. The weird thing about the picture is that it really is a movie of ideas--you come out wondering about Stone and Parker's politics more than you remember laugh lines. And the scenes in Hell, involving some poignant gay sex between Satan and Saddam Hussein, are more deliriously surreal than anything ever seen with a Warner Brothers label. But for all that, the Disney song parodies are endless, repetitive and endlessly repetitive; and Stone and Parker have more funny ideas than funny jokes. But they once seemed like a couple of obnoxious, gen-x frat boys in the manner of Kevin Smith. They ain't no more. If they put on a button-down shirt and get away from the scissors and rubber cement, they might grow into a millennial version of George Axelrod."

The movie however, exceeded the shows limits in probably every single way! Go and see it if you like the show or have a really open mind, but otherwise, you might want to steer clear and see something less risky."

","Trey Parker and Matt Stone's brilliant and raunchy animated sitcom has done what few TV knockoffs have achieved, they made it into a good movie. I was skeptical about how good it would be (usually, what works on TV doesn't work on the big screen, take it as a rule), but this was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneaking in to see the raunchy, R-rated movie titled, appropriately enough, ""Asses of Fire"", starring two of their favourite Canadian actors Terrence and Philip (if you've seen even one episode of ""South Park"", you know what I am talking about). The movie is so vulgar (including a priceless musical number about incest) that the kids pick it up and start repeating the obsceneties in school. This leads them into trouble with the school, and ultimately with their parents, who launch a crusade against Canada, who they blame for warping their children's minds. Not since Michael Moore's ""Canadian Bacon"" has a movie ripped into Canada so fiendeshly. Canada is the main butt of all jokes here. There are some colorful musical numbers in the movie as well, sung by the cast themselves.<br/><br/>""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" is one of the most crude and offensive movies I have ever seen, so needless to say I loved it. The humour is razor-sharp, and the vulgaraties come at you at a mile-a-minute. There are so many four-letter words here, and they have spared nobody from their pot shots. There is no word to obscene, and no blow too low. It is obvious that the two creators have attempted to offend as many people as possible: gays, blacks, jews, women,  chinese, germans, everybody. It is the perfect mix of low-brow humor and political satire. It is no secret that the TV show South Park has lost a lot of popularity, this can easily be attributed to that fact that there are no new episodes, and people are getting sick of re-runs.<br/><br/>I don't think there were two minutes in this movie that I went without laughing, both because it was pure comedy, other times because I simply could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. Even fans of the show (like myself) will be shocked, yes, the movie is that raunchy. It is the perfect mix of low-brow humour and political satire. I have never has such a good time at a movie.

A brilliant satire on how people (sorry, Americans) are constantly looking to find someone or something to blame for society's downward spiral instead of accepting it themselves. Given the freedom to finally say what was on their minds, (something the 'moral' restraints of television wouldn't let them do) Trey Parker and Matt Stone have come out fighting.  And believe me, no one will be left un-offended. And the great irony is that parents will be joining up to protest and prevent their children from seeing a movie about parents joining up to prevent their children from seeing a movie. Few movies based on TV shows are able to successfully present that transition from the TV screen to the Theatre screen.... but this is the natural progression of the South Park gang. Where can they go from here? I can hardly wait to see the next season....or dare I say it...the next movie. Do yourself a favour a visit South Park at least once.

A good portion is taken almost directly from Les Miserables and several songs are right out of Disney movies.  There are even parodies of traditional musicals like Oklahoma.  Satan has a pretty good voice too.  One warning however.  Do not see this movie if you are easily offended.  The aim of the movie is to offend and it does this very well.

","My previous experience with South Park had been limited to one viewing of the ""Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo"" episode, so I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised, not only at the number of belly laughs, but that the theme of the film is something I've been saying for years:  It is unconscionable to ""protect"" our children from words and ideas, while exposing them to the most graphic and gratuitous violence imaginable.<br/><br/>We don't allow children to see movies where people take their clothes off, or make love.  If a movie contains two people of the same gender expressing ordinary affection for one another, God forbid, audience members had better be at least 18.  But if the hero is blasting away with an automatic weapon in each hand, while dodging a hail of bullets, it's nothing but a rollicking good time.<br/><br/>There's something very sad about a society in which sex in the context of a caring relationship is obscene, but the taking of human life is not.  It was not lost on me that South Park is set in a small town in Colorado.<br/><br/>Sure the movie is rife with potty humor, and the f-word ricochets off the screen like bullets in ""The Matrix.""  But sex talk and fart jokes won't hurt us, and we know all to well the consequences of young people who are predisposed to violent behavior becoming inured to its consequences.<br/><br/>There are great laughs in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.""  I loved seeing Satan agonize over his failing relationship with Saddam Hussein. The musical production numbers are a glorious send-up of the kind of saccharine crap that Disney animated films are rife with, with titles like ""Cartland's Mother is a Big Fat Bitch"" and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do?"".  And Brook Shields (voiced by Minnie Driver) confesses that she once farted on the set of ""Blue Lagoon.""<br/><br/>Sure the animation is a little crude.

","This may come as a shock, but the film was just okay.  I have read many reviews on this movie hailing it as one of the funniest comedies of the decade, but the truth is that, as I said, it was just okay. The film starts off with a Sound of Music-esq musical number and the South Park gang sneaking into a showing of the R-rated Asses of Fire starring every kid in South Park's idols, Terrence & Phillip.  Asses of Fire of course has a ridiculus amount of vulgarities and repulses everyone and forces them to leave the theater except the South Park gang, leaving the four kids to sit and marvel at the speech of their heroes. The kids then go to a local hang out and impress every kid in South Park with their new vocabulary.  The mothers of the kids eventually find out about this and launch a campaign against Canada(the film's origin). From there the movie enters many, many subplots, most of which are only mildly amusing and some of which are just boring.  There is one subplot I felt was disappointingly wasted...the Satan/Hussian relationship.  It struck me during the trailers of the film as hilarious, but turned out to be unfunny due to the fact that there were no jokes-just Saddam acting horny. The musical numbers were less entertaining as the movie drug (and I mean drug) along.  The plot was lost near the middle and replaced with subplots until it was picked up again at the end.  The film also opened up with a point about censorship, but seemed to lose that also. The swearing in the film was pervasive and not for young fans of the show.  Also, the laughs from the constant barrage of swearwords died out quickly (not only from me, but from everyone else in the audience) and the script just couldn't seem to pull anymore laughs out of the audience after the initial shock of it all.  What was amazing ,however, was that the largest laugh lines in the film had no swearwords in them at all!  The scene involving the death of Conan O'Brian was hilarious and did not involve a single vulgarity. The one thing the film missed overall was something the show is full of...sharp and cleaver humor.  I keep thinking of one of the first episodes of the show when Officer Barbrady suggested that Mr Garrison (who was intent with assassinating Kathy Lee Gifford) could get a good view of her from the town's Book Depository.  That kind of sharp satirical humor was lost amid all of the rediculus subplots.  THE SCRIPT NEEDED ONE MORE REWRITE. The film did offer SOME major laughs and kept me mostly entertained.  I recommend it to anyone who is a die hard fan of the series, but those of you that are not, may find yourself bored.  ***"
"ISJ","8","0","0","3 July 1999"," I've never laughed harder, longer, or as uncut in my life.
","A good number of comedies (say, The Spy Who Shagged Me, for instance) give you about 10 good minutes of laughter at the beginning of the movie and then perhaps a couple more good laughs the rest of the movie, leaving you searching the rest of the time for even the slightest chuckle to justify the ticket price you spent.  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut does not treat the viewer quite so rudely.  Not only are you granted one of the most shockingly hilarious opening sequences ever, the movie never allows you to stop laughing for more than a couple seconds, which for some folks (like me) might be detrimental to catching ALL of the good lines in this movie (a reason I will be seeing it again soon).  For other folks, such as the woman sitting in front of me, it might be detrimental to your health.<br/><br/>Be warned, however, this movie contains far more obscenities (particularly, instances of the ""F"" word) than an Eddie Murphy stand-up routine (before he became Dr. Doolittle, that is).  If you're easily offended -- heck, if you're difficult to offend -- this movie will make you blush.  Shots are taken at pretty much everyone who ever set foot on this planet and belonged to some categorizable group.  You will find yourself laughing and at the same time feeling guilty because you are doing so.  But because laughter ALWAYS wins out, you will ultimately feel very good about yourself.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the movie isn't merely about offending. There does seem to be an underlying message which parent's groups and censors will likely miss because of the time they'll spend bleeping out words.  See if you can locate it between the moments you are picking your lungs up off the floor."

","This movie made me laugh so hard Junior Mints came out my nose! Be warned, the language is extremely foul. You'll hear the F word to many times to count just in the first 7 minutes - but it's FUNNY! The basic plot is that the boys' favorite cartoon characters release a movie that is rated R (hmmm...). The boys sneak in to see it and return with potty mouths. The parents declare war on the root of the obscenity and the rest is history. This movie is a musical and shows absolutely brilliant orchestration and arrangement. One of the most amazing pieces of music is a medley of the different themes that reminds me of the end of the first act of Les Miserables (the broadway musical). There are also lots of guest voices including George Clooney and Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran). If you like South Park you MUST see this. If you hate South Park, you'll hate this movie.

"Stroheim-3","9","0","0","3 July 1999"," What the hell?! A good South Park movie?
","I must say, I enjoy watching the South Park television show. Nevertheless, I thought that the humor of Trey Parker and Matt Stone was to random and mindless to successfully transfer South Park to the big screen.  Boy was I wrong.  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a definitive '90s film. In a time where political correctness and blaming mass entertainment for societies ills runs rampant, Parker and Stone have managed to create a brilliant satire reflecting the ridiculousness of our society.  In the decade of school shootings, violence on the big screen has been replaced (in this film) by a raunchy curse-fest called ""Asses of Fire"" starring the flatulent, Canadian duo, Terrence and Philip.  When the kids of South Park begin emulating their heroes, their parents and teachers become outraged, and instead of blaming themselves for allowing them to see the movie (the parents pay for their tickets), they blame the movie and the country that exported the film, Canada.  Parodying Disney and Broadway musicals to the extreme, Parker and Stone trace the blame game all the way through the the impending Apocolypse caused by the spilling of Terrence and Philip's blood on American soil (it is the Seventh Sign).  For however raunchy and crude the humor in this film is, it is not without purpose.  It makes the viewer look at themselves and where they stand in society.  In the aftermath of the Columbine shootings, who is to blame?  Is it the movies that kids see or the parents that allow their kids to see them?"

","The last episode of South Park I saw I actually turned off halfway through. It was so bad, I wasn't laughing at anything. So I was a bit wary to see this movie. Then I saw good reviews everywhere, and figured I might as well check it out. And boy am I happy I did! South Park is probably one of the funniest movies to come out in 1999. You know the story, so there's no point on going over it. South Park's creators basically engage in a hilarious self-parody of everything that has happened to South Park and the protests that can be expected from the movie. I've heard more swearing in this movie than I have anywhere else in my life, I think. Some of it seems to just be thrown in for the shock value of hearing little kids saying four letter words, but much of it is pertinent to how kids talk, and very funny. The film also makes fun of the MPAA, among others, with the line, ""You can kill as many people as you want in your movie, but you can't use bad language!""

The movie's plot is simple and reminiscent of an early episode where the parents of South Park take on the cable network that shows Terrence and Phillip for the constant fart jokes in the ""Canadian"" comedy.<br/><br/>This time, Terrence and Phillip put out a movie where they pull all the stops in showing profanity and even more fart jokes (Hmm, familiar?).  The kids go see the movie and begin cursing and farting and once again, led by Kyle's mom, the South Park parents are on a rampage.  This time they wage war on Canada itself, the home of Terrence and Phillip.<br/><br/>Beyond this point the movie slips back to its standard of irreverence and crudeness.  On the face of it, there's nothing particularly redeeming about this movie, but I still laughed 'til I had tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>Parker and Stone have tried to pull this movie off as something of a musical, but this sure  ain't no Gilbert and Sullivan score.  With songs like ""Uncle F**ka"", and a world spanning rendition of ""Kyle's Mom is a Bitch"", you can bet there'll be no Oscar nominations for best musical for this one but you'll still be humming the tunes afterward and no doubt giggling like a maniac from time to time.<br/><br/>In the end, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut remains an acquired taste, if you're easily offended, forget it; there's something here to offend just about everyone.

And believe me when I tell you, it's also foul beyond belief. The movie revolves around the notion that instead of battling the rights of free speech, a parent ought to regulate their kids more closely.

"Brogan","Null","0","0","30 June 1999"," It's funny the first time around.....
","I'm a SOUTH PARK fan, I highly enjoy the t.v. show, and I have every episode on tape.  So this means that I should enjoy this film, right?  Yes and no.  First of all, I do enjoy rude and raunchy comedy, I liked BIG DADDY a lot, and I enjoyed BASEketBALL. But sometimes a film that has a lot of potential, can fail also. The plot of the show has the four guys (Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny) going to see a ""R"" rated Terence & Phillip movie. If you haven't seen the show, then you probably won't get the jokes or character's traits that much.  After seeing the film, the guys walk around and start using the foul words, that Comedy Central usually ""bleeps"" out. Because of this, Kyle's mom, decides to organize a strike not only against Terence & Phillip, but against all of Canada! I have two words of advice for Trey Parker:  1.)  A joke is funny first time around, but annoying the second, third, even the fifth time around. & 2.) Less is always better!  There are jokes in SOUTH PARK that are funny to watch the first time around, but then when the joke is repeated and repeated and so forth, it's not only not funny, it's very annoying!  And less is always better.  Trey Parker decides to have the movie begin with a song and dance, that's funny.  But he decides to have the ENTIRE movie have songs and dances, it's not a comedy, it's a opera?!?!? I'm guessing that Trey Parker is  taking advantage of the Disney animated film philosophy, ""I can't tell you how I feel, but I can sing it for you!"" And sing these characters do.  Not just the main characters, but almost every character!!! I did enjoy BASEketBALL, and I did think ORGAZMO was decent, but SOUTH PARK was a disappointment.  It can be a witty and original show, and there are some episodes that prove it. But the movie decides to go on the movie bandwagon and just have the t.v. show episodes be funnier than the movie.  I also think that Parker wanted to show everybody how talented he is with song lyrics, that's fine.  He proved that with CANNIBAL: THE MUSICAL, but with SOUTH PARK, well......... it's boring.  Sad to say, this 85 min. film seemed to go on too long for me, and I can sit  through SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and TITANIC four times with no problem.  While all of the critc's are going to try to be ""hip"" and recommend this film, I suggest you catch BIG DADDY first, then SOUTH PARK, then AUSTIN POWERS 2.

Filled with hilarious musical numbers that made me want to go out and buy the soundtrack album, amazingly funny writing that uses profanity to it's utmost effect and some very impressive CG mixed into the standard South Park animation.  I don't want to give away ANY of this film, even though, aside from specific jokes, there isn't much to give away, since it doesn't have an extremely in-depth plot (nor should you be expecting one).  Suffice it to say that it is well worth seeing once, and great to see again.  Oh by the way, if you're a person who is easily offended, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.  I am dead serious, this is the type of film that would give my parents a heart attack if they knew what was said and done throughout it's duration.  Yes, it's that bad.  Even if you think of yourself as someone who is not that easily offended, there are several scenes that made the whole audience groan and shudder.

The movie is bursting with funny gags and sharp jabs at anyone and everyone, and the frequent self-referential bits were hilarious. The potty humor, though, sucked.  I know that was the point -- it was supposed to be overdone, but it was pushed just a little bit too far over the line.  I didn't like the nonstop profanity, either: I'm as foul-mouthed as the next person, but the bleeped-out speech on the television show is endlessly funnier than the uncensored version in the movie.<br/><br/>I did like the movie, though -- it's funny, irreverent, and downright stupid (which, of course, is the point).

As I saw it, Matt and Trey very effectively spoke out against society's willingness to blame anyone but those who are truly responsible, as seen in the Columbine shootings, etc. However, I must also say that I do feel that the MPAA may have been right in this case.  South Park truly was ""uncut"" as the title claims and the ""adult"" language and crudeness were there as I have never seen before in a film.  In other words, it was fully deserving of the R rating it received (if not the NC-17 rating it didn't..).

Many critics were right in their assessment that beneath the crude and crass exterior hides a surprisingly witty satire that takes aim at everything from our preconceived notions of right and wrong to the hypocritical attitude we have towards the media.  The film spares no one and in the process provides some truly hilarious moments.  Unfortunately many of the gags are unnecessarily vulgar to the point of being downright embarrassing, but then again, that's probably the point.  Maybe...  The musical numbers are a hoot, especially the duo with Terrance and Philip with a rather peculiar musical bent.  I'm still trying to decide whether or not to recommend this film.  It is definitely not for everybody, and ABSOLUTELY NOT for kids.

An R-rated movie aptly titled ""Ass of Fire"" (guess what THAT conotates) comes to South Park and its language infests the children's mouths. Its results range from full-scale war to Satan trying to take over the world.<br/><br/>Although I find the TV series to be funny yet completely brainless, the movie actually is smart.

Yes, it's disgusting at times.  But it's also an incredibly relevant look at our society, and it carries several messages that we should all take to heart.

","...but *not* for children.  I saw it the opening day, and the theater was doing a good job of keeping kids out.  The second day I saw it again at the same theater, and a lot more kids were getting in.<br/><br/>At any rate, the movie is well paced, it starts off with a bang then settles down a bit as the plot races along.  The language is foul beyond belief, but it is there for a purpose as a key plot element.  The violence towards the end is as close as a cartoon has ever come to ""Private Ryan"", and the sexual elements were a shock to even this die-hard South Park fan.  I really don't know how ""Orgazmo"" got NC-17 and this movie got an R, ""Orgazmo"" is pretty tame by comparison.<br/><br/>The songs are well done, advancing the plot as well as entertaining the audience and spoofing half the musicals ever made.  Anybody that can make a hummable, toe-tapping song composed entirely of farts deserves an oscar for sheer inventiveness, while the ""Up There"" number easily matches anything from Disney for sappy sentimentality.  The last half of the movie is loaded with very well-done spoofs of Evita and Lez Miserables that are clearly targeted at a higher audience than the stereotypical pimply-faced juvenile delinquent that is the widely presumed audience for ""South Park"" (BTW, the first night's packed crowd was largely composed of 25-35 white-collar professional *couples*, all laughing so hard it was frequently difficult to hear the dialogue).<br/><br/>The comedy is widely varied, compassing lowbrow humor such as bodily functions, racism, and sex, to much more  highbrow humor intertwined with political and social commentary, such as the ironic Anne Frank-like scene where a Jewish character hides a Canadian character in the attic to save him from the soldiers and death camps (did I say ""death camps""?  I meant ""happy camps"").<br/><br/>I thought it was definitely a home run, easily surpassing even the best of the first 6 episodes.  Being commercial-free and 80 minutes long only made it better, and certainly made up for the many marginal episodes since the first batch came out."

","This is the funniest movie I have seen in years!  Not since the first time I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail have I laughed this much at a movie.<br/><br/>Being a musical can destroy even decent movies, but South Park pulls it off, partly because (while some are annoying, musically) each and every song in it is absolutely hilarous, and partly because most of the songs have some lame excuse or another to be sung.  It isn't as jarring when a character breaks out into song as it is in...well, any other musical.  But that might just be because the dialogue and visuals are so extreme.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the very best part of the experience of seeing this movie.  The GASPS, and SHOCKED SILENCE from about a third of the audience (who clearly had never seen ""The Spirit of Christmas""  (the original South Park short), and didn't have a clue what they had gotten themselves into) when the first instance of the phrase ""pigf**ker"" occurred.  Doubtless it will be less when I see it again, but this movie is worth going to just for the audience reaction.<br/><br/>And this isn't just a pointless comedy, by the way.  This is some of the best animated satire you're going to see outside an exceedingly good episode of The Simpsons.  The frequent digs at the MPAA, and all the would-be censors in the US make it brain food, not just brain candy.<br/><br/>This movie is everything in the TV series, the Spirit of Christmas, and the Terrence and Phillip special taken to new levels.  It is the most amazing experience I've had at the movies in a good long while.  It is easily the best movie I've seen this year, and that includes the Phantom Menace.  The ONLY down side to this movie, apart from the animation which is as lame as you would expect, is the fact that you don't have enough time to recover from one joke before they hit you with another. Bits that would otherwise be unforgettable are lost in the torrent of profanity and twisted humor."

This is like the TV show in most every way, only more over the top, in that it asks hard questions and masks their seriousness in dark humor often reflecting what a majority of folks think and feel, but are often unwilling to admit to others, or themselves.<br/><br/>Good art not only reflects the artists thoughts and feelings, but those of the world they live it, even it that world doesn't want to hear/see it. As far as the quality of the film, it is very well done smooth and sound.  It starts out quick and is so funny it is tough to hear the dialog because EVERYONE is laughing so hard.  It slows down as it progresses and becomes more serious.  The editing is well done.  The sound is better and more interesting than one might think.  The animation is not all ""construction paper cut outs"", but often sophisticated and lush.  Keep in mind they are working with icons and ideas, so it all doesn't need to be overly sophisticated. As expected Trey and Matt pay homage to a myriad of classic images from films of the past and use them to punctuate their own ideas. This film is about good vs. evil, as simple as that.

I hope stores start selling the anti-Canada tee-shirts.<br/><br/>But here's the important part: South Park pushes the envelope of acceptable free speech, it knows that, and it makes sure that you know it knows that.

And to get around the ""R"" rating they're going to have to bring their parents. And their parents are going to be really bothered. I went to see it during the day, playing hooky from work.

"Bozo","Null","0","0","29 June 1999"," An hour and a half of South Park fun.
","How far can a television show go before it hits the big screen? South Park has tested the viewing public's interest and has made the big jump, quite successfully. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's creations have offended and astounded people on what is supposed to be a censored-for-television-show, and now, the four foul-mouthed youngsters have pushed the envelope to the edge. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut may not be Parker and Stone's first feature film, but it is their first animated motion picture. It utilizes the show's entire main and supporting characters and includes several songs that could practically make the film a musical. Viewers of the Comedy Central program are familiar with Terrance and Philip, television show that features two characters who flagellate on one another for half an hour. South Park's main characters, Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman are big fans of the program and make plans to see their feature film. (Sound familiar?) Although the film has an R rating, the group views the film and is exposed to its extreme foul language. Parents and teachers are shocked to hear the kids repeating lines from the movie in their day-to-day lives and make it their mission to silence Terrance and Philip once and for all. Because the show is created in Canada, the US Military plunges into war with them, being led by Kyle's mom. Meanwhile, the kids of South Park create their own resistance to stop the killing and bring freedom back to speech. Parker and Stone's message is pretty clear. The film itself has a restricted rating, aimed at preventing people under the age of 17 admission without a parent or guardian's accompaniment. This just so happens to be the film's target audience and the box office meal ticket. The film's release couldn't be timelier. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has just announced that all theatres must check identification before allowing teenagers into these films. Even President Clinton has jumped on the bandwagon and announced the same intentions not long after the Colorado shootings. So how far can a movie go? South Park seems to attempt to offend everyone in an equal manor. The Christian, Jewish, Canadian, disabled, gay, black and pro-choice all take heavy hits in this film. But to its creators, it is all in good fun. After all, if you can't laugh at yourself, you are taking things too seriously. As for the film's quality, it mainly has the same production values as the show. Some electrifying computer effects are used after Kenny torches himself to death. But amidst all of the gigabytes and pixels, the small cardboard character remains the same. A few of the jokes are recycled from the program, but most of the humor is new and is even more crude than before. To say that the profanity is extreme would be an understatement. Although it is the basis for the whole movie, it begins to get old after the first 15 minutes. The films best humor revolves around people's misconceptions about each other. Other hilarious moments include the relationship between Satan and his live-in lover, Sadam Hussein. Their musical numbers outdo the rest and culminate the film to its explosive ending. There is no doubt that South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut will do well at the box office, no matter who is buying the tickets. I was pleasantly surprised once I left the theatre. Many of the viewers in the audience laughed so hard they couldn't hear the jokes coming up next. Very rarely does a film generate more entertainment and laughs than the television show it has spawned from."

Truly, this is one of the few movies based off a TV show that breaks the boundaries of what the TV show is and can become a movie within itself, while still entertaining fans and causing an uproar among parents.  The movie even made fun of itself, using the show within a show, ""Terrance and Phillip"" which makes a movie based on the show called ""Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire"" and is just as offensive as ""South Park: The Movie"" itself.<br/><br/>The only problem I really have with the movie is the character of Satan, which seemed to become a good guy while still being evil.

This was one of those movies that most people in the theatre couldn't catch their breaths going from one laugh to the next.  I don't want to give away too much, but I'll just entice...<br/><br/>The movie is centered around the new Terrance and Phillip movie, which just like Southpark, is the movie form of a popular TV show.  Of course, the kids have to sneak in because of the ""naughty"" language, and they are, of course, corrupted.  Complete with social commentary, the parents, instead of blaming themselves for not paying enough attention to their children, turn to blame the most guilty culprit: Canada.  They pulled a lot of material from ""Not without my Anus"" for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is full of really funny songs and great parodies.  The musical soundtrack parallels a few Disney Musicals (I noticed Satan's song was a lot like ""Out There"" from Hunchback), and Les Miserables (a few songs of the kids when they go to war).<br/><br/>The movie ties together many other episodes of SouthPark, and there are some jokes which only diehard fans will pick up on (hope you all remember Brian Boitano).  However, my friend who barely ever watches the show still found it really funny.<br/><br/>Warning: This movie is definitely adult-only.

It is very outrageous at times and very vulgar at times but it was part of the humor and part of the story line. It's got morals, humor, drama, and most of all it's got all the edge and excitement of the t.v. show. If you only see one movie this month go see South Park because you will be pleasantly suprised just like the critics who are raving about this film. GO SEE THIS MOVIE."
"LitMatch","Null","0","0","2 July 1999"," Hilarious nearly all the way through, esp. for the fans...
","Let me just start off first by saying I did not have the greatest of expectations for this film going into it.  I am a big fan of the TV series, and like many other fans, I have felt that the show has been slipping a bit in its third season.  But, in my opinion, the creative energy that was present in the first two seasons was present in this film!<br/><br/>The jokes in this move come so hard and fast, you will miss some because you are still laughing from an earlier joke.  And, this movie is ""on"" about 85% of the time.  Now, the question of vulgarity is a valid one, as there are in my estimation around 2000 vulgar words in this film, but the context of the usage is really comedic, and very rarely vulgar.  The only scenes that I thought went ""too far"" were the ones that took place in hell.<br/><br/>South Park does have its fill of music, and considering this summer's ""Tarzan"" is not a musical, this would make South Park THE musical this season.  The songs were really funny, and well written.  Just about everybody gets to sing in this film, with the better songs coming from Mr. Garrison and Big Gay Al.  Just about all of the characters you know and love make an appearance.  However two of my favorite characters were hardly in the film, if at all:  Officer Barbrady and Jesus.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a hilarious, tightly written comedy, that has something to offer even to the first-time viewer"

","I watched south park the series in the beginning and then lost cable rights. So I thought I knew what to expect, and they surprised me. It's a musical, it's such an interesting dichotomy--crudeness and broadway-type music. Some of the numbers were parodies of prior songs but Parker and Stone didn't stop there, they made the musical numbers good. It felt like a real movie, with the movement of camera and along with a few elements borrowed from other genres, namely anime and war movies. It's also a coming of age..of kenny and Kyle. The theme of this movie could very well be said in the motto ""be yourself"" All the characters in their own ways realized who they are by the end, and the movie itself proudly declares that it is what it is and won't hide it. They use anime-type battles, musical numbers, parodies of new ""relationship-centered crap that they call romantic comedies in recent times and yet still remain without a doubt south park.<br/><br/>I recommend it for anyone that has an open mind and wants to laugh real real real hard and sing some catchy albeit rated R songs. I definitely will be seeing it again.<br/><br/>PS: the soundtrack is mine, I got dibs"

The cheerful Terrance & Phillip song, ""Shut your f*cking face, uncle f*cker"" had me in tears.  It is right-on in many political issues: ""It's okay if it has horrible violence, just as long as they don't use naughty words.""

","Did I mention that it's hilarious too?  Formatted as an old-fashioned musical, complete with Broadway-ready tunes by Marc Shaiman, this tells the story of the loss of innocence in South Park thanks to Hollywood's R-Rated movies.  Sound familiar?  The parents pick up the cause, of course neglecting their own kids as they find themselves fighting Satan and Saddam Hussein. The numbers are fantastic; I'm worried that audiences (and even critics) have forgotten what a good song is, and that, unbelievably, this film will fly OVER everyone's head. But listen to Kyle's Mom's song, ""Blame Canada"", for a great example of a song advancing the story AND being wildly entertaining at the same time. Each offensive joke also makes a point, either about racism, homophobia, or plain bad parenting...you laugh because it's all true. A warning: I have no idea how this film got an R-rating; use extreme caution with letting your children see this film. If they must see it, go with them, so that you can talk about the offensive portions; it's too easy for children to just pick up the imitative behavior without getting the accompanying satire."

Just go watch it and it will be a superb laugh riot).<br/><br/>Well, this is a movie which would easily offend you. And yes, it did offend me. Not because of the swearing pr anything, but because of that character ""Mole"" who is an atheist. There's nothing wrong in being an atheist. But to call God like that, really infuriated me and made me angry. Which is why instead of a 9, I'm giving this a 7.<br/><br/>Well i know its a movie thats just made for fun.

"Matt_Layden","7","1","2","20 July 2009"," Doesn't Feel Like A Longer Episode.
","I have an odd relationship with South Park. I never watch the show when it is on, yet I own the first two seasons on DVD. I find the show funny, but never watch it consistently enough to get the jokes that my friends make when they refer to an episode. I've never seen the film until now too. I get the appeal it has, but I just never really got into it.<br/><br/>The film, as is with any film adaptation from a TV show plays out like a longer episode from the series. This time there is a war against CANADA because of a film that contains foul language. Why a war? Well, the kids are swearing. That is it. The film is basically Matt Stone and Trey Parker's thoughts on the current state of censorship with the MPAA and the films they rate.<br/><br/>For a cartoon, yes it has a wide variety of curse words, which are spoken by kids in grade school. There is violence, blood and guts grace the screen in a hospital (with cameo voice acting from George Clooney) and the final war scene between Canada and the States. There is also a bit of nudity, which is their version of heaven.<br/><br/>I laughed more at the subtle humour then the in your face bits. I didn't find myself laughing at the language they use which is one of the main draws (damn those young teenage boys who like swear words). There is a smart film here, but when you listen to it, it sounds like it was written to two 15 year old boys who think every bad word is funny.<br/><br/>Did I forget to mention it is a musical? The musical numbers are nice and sometimes funny. Hell, one earned an Oscar nomination. Sometimes the humour in the film is so random that it's funny, like a Skeet Ulrich poster above Satan's bed. I don't know who would think up of something like that, but it works.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the show, this film will appeal to you. If not, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I dug it for what it was, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done better and funnier things."

Also, there are several very funny and well written songs that are able to make this movie a great musical as well as being an animated comedy. The only drawback is that some show characters, such as Barbrady and Jimbo don't get adequate screen time. If you like the show or just like having your jaw drop, then I highly recommend this movie"

After using their colorful language in school, the boys are caught at school and punished. It is by than already too late, the f*****g language has already permeated the school. In willful disregard to their parents will, the boys see the movie again. Kenny dies by setting his fart on fire, and I will leave the rest to your discovery. <br/><br/>This movie is approaching comic genius! It is exactly as sick as it is funny! If the language doesn't offend you too much, I promise you that you will be rolling on the floor. The movie is also not without a point. The creators included all the swearing as part of the films commentary over violence in movies. I think that this film would be a top notch children's movie if nobody minded the language. 10/10"

I was extremely surprised and overwhelmed by the total brilliance of the entire movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a that big fan of the ""South Park"" series, even though I really enjoy watching it from time to time, I wouldn't rate it any higher as an 8/10.<br/><br/>Probably thing that is most brilliant about ""South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut"" are the songs. I think it originally was intended as one big joke to make the movie a musical. I think the makers never expected the songs to be so totally brilliant and highly fun. Marc Shaiman really surpassed himself and did an amazing job. All of the songs are so totally brilliant, beautiful and extremely funny.<br/><br/>Also the story is really brilliant, I mean having Satan and Saddam Hussein being lovers in hell while the Americans are starting a war on the Canadians over the Terrence & Phillip movie ""Asses of Fire""? Brilliant! It's totally ridicules but the message in it is important and works so extremely well, that the movie is really powerful as a political and anti-war movie. The movie might very well be the most entertaining movie with an important and powerful message in it, along with ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" I have ever seen.<br/><br/>All of the jokes work really well and makes this movie one of the funniest I have seen the last couple of years and is what makes this movie perfectly watchable time after time without loosing any of its power or entertainment value. I truly is one of those movie that I enjoy watching multiple times.<br/><br/>Powefull, very funny and with an important and well brought message.

","I heard many comments about this movie from my friends and had to see if the reviews were true, and obviously they were. This film shows the genius that South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker are. This animated musical starts off with the gang sneaking into an R-rated film, however when they and other students start saying plenty of obscenities in school they get in major trouble with their parents. Instead of just forbidding the kids from seeing it again Kyle's mom takes further action and the parents plan to execute Terrence and Phillip. But when Cartman finds out that if they are executed then Satan and Saddam Hussein will come and rule the Earth. Will the kids be able to stop this from happening, and most importantly What Would Brian Boitano do? At first looking at the soundtrack you would imagine that the lyrics and lines in this movie are poorly written but if you listen very carefully you can see that they are perfect.

","Being a fan of the show it could be assumed that I'm biased towards this film but I'm sure that lots of people will enjoy this movie because it is both a wonderful political satire as well as being a great exposé on the censorship issue in America and the double-standards that American society has. I love Mrs. Browlowski's line near the end when she says to the troops at the USO show ""Graphic, deplorable violence is O.K. as long as nobody says any naughty words. That's what this war is all about."" Sarcasm, yah can't beat it.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this movie great is the way in which it sends up other animated films. The cliché Disney films of the 40's and 50's where boy meets girl but girl is in love with another boy etc. etc. This is evident in Stan's obsession over Wendy and his hilarious attempts to woo her but only ending up vomiting all over her. LOL. Also the songs are, more or less, parodies of the kind of songs found in these cheesy Disney flicks that appeal to the younger generation. For example, Satan's INCREDIBLY cheesy song of hope, 'Up There' is highly inappropriate for a creature that is supposed to be pure evil.<br/><br/>In short, this film can be watched again and again for a good laugh but also as a great social commentary. I hope people don't judge this film too harshly because it has swear words in it. A LOT of swear words. It's not like other films where the swear words are only added to appeal to the young demographic and add nothing to the plot. After all, this movie is about censorship so why not say the F word hundreds of times?:p The critic's actually loved this movie and so did I.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

How they depict conservative people and their line of thought is not only important, but sometimes very accurate deliberately or not. But this film will certainly be remembered for its extremly foul language, and I was very surprised to see that they actually could make such a film in the US.<br/><br/>Even more astounding was it to see that the audience seemed to be made up by mostly boys of the age of ten or so.

And then I do not mean the bad taste of the makers (I had heared about the many swear words before, feared it would be boring, hoped it would be funny, found it had a good function in creating a consistent atmosphere), but the preference for the various movie styles. I simply do not like musicals, and although some of the songs in this movie are actually quite good, I am of the opinion that they break the tempo of the movie, in a negative way. I had hoped to see more humor. There is a good dose of humor, but I still feel the density is considerably lower than in a TV episode. On the other hand the makers have succeeded very well in having a morale to their story and at the same time making fun at that very same morale.<br/><br/>All in all, anyone who has been following South Park all the time certainly has to see this movie and will not be disappointed, but those who, like me, have only seen a little bit of it, or just heared of friends how good it was, would do better to make a tape of two or three of the TV episodes.

It was like having your 5-year-old nephew with tourettes syndrome on your leg and yelling at you.<br/><br/>The movie has its share of good ideas: Saddam Hussein and Satan in bed (even though you have to wonder why Hussein is used as a joke six years after the HOT SHOTS sequel), the use of Conan O'Brien and George Clooney. Also, the Winona Ryder bit featuring the voice of Minnie Driver.<br/><br/>Though I liked the La Resistance thing, the whole war on Canada was dumb and excrutiating. Probably because it was a main plot point and hey you have an hour and a half, you might as well have some kind of story. Also the joke with Chef involved in the army is offensive (for the wrong reason) and there's a little to much going on between Satan and Sudaam. And the much-hyped scene featuring the face of Kenny wasn't so special, in fact, I was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>But at least Trey Parker and Matt Stone are smart enough to use the freedom of making a feature film. It could have been worst, but it could have been better."

","I will grant you, this film is hillarious, but at the expense of making fun of every kind person imaginable (which is fair, no one is left out) and subjecting the audiance to a constant barrage of gratuitous language and extremely lude depictions of the human anatimy.  But by God this movie had everyone rolling in the aisles.<br/><br/>But afte the film was done, I was left wondering...have Parker and Stone gone too far?<br/><br/>I was an advid viewer of South Park before the film and when I found out that there was going to be movie I was hoping to find all the things that made South Park great...only more. Boy was I in for the biggest shock in my life.  My reaction to alot of scenes was basically the same as little Stan when he is confronted by a totally off the wall experiance, ""Dudes, this totally fu(beep)ed up.""<br/><br/>If they took out the constant showing of certain parts of the male anatomy and gone a little bit easier on the language, I wouldn't have any problems with the film.  But for some reason I was left with almost the same feeling as I did when Stone and Parker made that South Park episode  totally devoted to Terrance and Phillip....it caused me to avoid South Park for a while. But now this movie has made me go on a sort of boycott of the show now.<br/><br/>
It is funny, but it is a film that you would want to see.....only once (at most).<br/><br/>But be forwarned: Very Very Strong language, repeated showing of nudity (both female...and male), extreme violence, and no-holds-barred, anything goes, racists jokes targeted at everyone (and I mean everyone, even white people)."

The funniest thing about the whole film is that it's a parody of censorship and mimicks the reaction they knew this film would get from the so-called moral majority (more like minority in my case).<br/><br/>To quote Cartman after having seen the silly and offensive Terrance and Philip film: ""you've warped my fragile little mind"".<br/><br/>The script writing was excellent, the film took a swipe at everything from Satan's sexuality to Saddam Hussein, and there was some brilliant scenes in which the writing really shone through.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's time to change my mind and start watching the series, although it's much toned down to appease the incredibly anal culture of US television."

"frankyep","1","5","32","26 October 2004"," Disappointing, Stupid & Terrible!!
","The cute kids of South Park finally come to the big screen in South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut from the clever creators of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. However, this is a disappointing attempt at the series' first film. In this tale, the kids sneak into an R-rated film starring their two favorite Canadian comedians and they soon discover much profane language is used. They start copying this language and soon the parents react. The moms form Mothers Against Canada(MAC)and prepare to lead an all-out war with the neighboring country. Meanwhile, down in Hell, Satan plans his to conquer the Earth along side his love partner Saddam Hussien. This is, unfortunately I have to say, is a terrible film. The musical numbers for one do not seem to add anything to the movie and just make it more non enjoyable. Secondly, because Parker and Stone now have the advantage of ""Uncut"", they feel it needed to overload the film with profanity instead of concentrating on the jokes. It's almost as if the only joke it this film is simply having these third graders curse. Only two scenes in the entire movie gave interest to me: one(the only)humorous scene where a V-Chip that is inserted into Eric Cartman's head is tested for the first time and another where we are given the physical appearance of Kenny's face. But other than that, this film was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen. Thankfully, third time was the charm for Trey Parker and Matt Stone [first time: Basketball; second time: South Park movie; third time:Team America] (*)GRADE: D"

"thousandisland","6","1","3","9 September 2000"," It's a musical!!
","I had heard a lot about this film, how great it was, and I think it got played up a little too much.  However, it does have some great aspects, including an AMAZING collection of songs... The tunes are swingin', lighthearted and lots of fun.  (My favorite was ""Brian Boitano"")  That songs even exist in this film is crazy.  That they are good, well-orchestrated production numbers is incredible, and adds a genuinely Broadway feeling to the movie.  It is my opinion that the music in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" rivals what is found in many Disney films.*********** Still, this movie is not as good as the TV show.  I would have to agree with some of the other viewers, by saying that I DID find the constant profanity distracting.  (Particularly, the Terrance and Phillip ""movie"" is pretty annoying.) In the TV show, the profanity is used with style and character, but here it is just overused and gets irritating.   As a space filler, the profanity robs this film of its potential for a great verbal script.   One of South Park's outstanding attributes is the unique, zany dialogue... I was expecting that same, provocative banter between the characters in this film, and it did not deliver.***************** I do not feel that the overall quality of this movie is near that of the average TV episode.  It has little of the intelligence and filthy charm, the honesty and clever, child- perspective that makes its lead characters so joyous to watch. It does make a statement, and has the social commentary that is the show's trademark, but it is dragged down by CONSTANT, overtly sexual references, which are limiting and uncreative.  (By contrast, ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" was much better able to bring on a plot that was original, and mesh it with the characters' normal dialogue. It did not change the style and feeling of the TV show just to take advantage of an R Rating, which seems to be the case with ""South Park""..)******************* Beyond this complaint, the film has merit.  The plot is interesting and unpredictable (Parker and Stone would have it no other way), full of opinion, color and satire.   Between the tiresome lewdness, there is some true wit and laugh out loud comedy. There's even an endearing new character (The Mole, a gritty, French revolutionary who gives his life for Stan's ""La Resistance"") and a touching ending that is both sad and triumphant.  Under all the offenses, there are poignant messages here about society and parenting.  Try as they may, the producers are unable to drown the meaning in eff-words, or make this outing mindless.   It may not have quite the heart and shine of the TV show,  but any South Park fan will enjoy watching Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and all their cronies embark on this musical, political adventure that is a classic in its own right.    My score: (all things considered) 6.5"
"Nathanel","5","1","3","9 July 1999"," Do people really understand the satire?
","I will admit I am not a big fan of South Park. I've only seen about 4 tv episodes, and I don't find the crude humor that amusing. So as you can imagine, I wasn't expecting that much out of the movie when my friend dragged me into the theatre. After watching the movie, I am still not really a South Park fan, although there was something about the movie that was both impressing and disturbing. South Park is an incredibly sardonic, cynical movie. The entire film is basically poking fun at our society in recent times. A logical parallel can be drawn between the plot of the movie, and our nation's attack on violence in the media. While the teenagers in the theatre laugh at crass remarks such as the Uncle $@%!# song, do they realize that they are symbolizing the very objects that the makers of the movie are so heavily poking fun at? If one realizes this, it is very amusing, and for me was probably the funniest part of the movie, however I am afraid that the majority of the kids seeing this movie do not realize that they are laughing at themselves and other controversial parts of our society that so many of us share."

Sure, there is some of the twisted humor that's given South Park it's cult following, but not really any more than a standard 30 minute episode that you can watch every Wednesday on Comedy Central.

I never had cable, and honestly crude humor never really did it for me. But I saw the series was on Hulu and decided to give it a try and I fell in love with it and it's crazy antics.<br/><br/>This movie is just like an extended version of an episode, but free of all the censors that Comedy Central had to adhere to with the show. F-bombs can now be said, and in abundance; nudity can be show, though it isn't in this that much; and the gross-out humor and violence can go pretty much as far as it wants to.<br/><br/>The show for sure has it's ups and downs, but I was genuinely surprised how amazing this movie was. It's just as funny as their top tier episodes. The animation is essentially the same as the show, but with a few scenes that included some 3D graphics. Those 3D scenes haven't aged well, but them being crappy probably was part of the joke that the creators think the show's animation is also purposefully crappy.<br/><br/>As someone who generally is annoyed by musicals, this might be my favorite musical of all time. The songs are crude, but also catchy and extremely well written. I was ecstatic to get a new version of ""Kyle's Mom is a B****"" that had originated in the show.<br/><br/>It's a shame they don't do more movies. but I kinda admire their one and done mentality. They did what a lot of 90's hit TV shows, did one movie because the studio was interested, then they kept doing their thing on the show.<br/><br/>It's hard to say if you'll like this if you aren't a fan. It's really great, but if you don't like the humor of the show, it might be hard to recommend. Even then if you're familiar with the show you might still have a curse-laden good time with it."

"MovieAddict2016","10","1","5","11 September 2004"," A bit overrated, but still a fun film -- if you have an open mind.
","'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been major protesters against the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) since one of their early films, 'Orgazmo,' was tagged with an NC-17 rating due to strong language and pervasive sexual content.<br/><br/>They have been known to purposely upset the MPAA by a number of methods, but nothing they've done yet reaches the low standards of 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' (1999). This, an animated feature film spin-off of the immensely popular cult television show from Comedy Central, is one of the most deliberately profane, vulgar and controversial films I have ever seen  and, like many controversial films, it is a social satire with bite.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it's flawless. The movie is funny, and it has its fair share of hilarious moments, but it isn't great by any means  and often goes searching for laughs in all the wrong places. Still, one has to admire the guts of Parker and Stone  who also voice most of the characters in the movie. I never thought I'd see so many racial stereotypes packed into a single movie  much less an animated one. I never thought I'd see young (albeit animated) children using four-letter words with such pride. I never thought I'd see Saddam Hussein and Satan having a homosexual affair together. Then again, I never thought I'd really see anything remotely close to the content in general that exists within 'South Park' the movie.<br/><br/>Fans of the TV show will already be familiar with the characters: four animated kids named Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Cartman. 'Uncut' opens with a cheery musical number and rapidly moves towards vulgarity as the 'innocent' children sneak into an R-rated movie starring their boyhood idols, the foul-mouthed Canadian duo Terrence and Philip, whose combined humor consists of bodily function gags and songs with extreme profanity. ('What did he say?' one of the boys mutters in the theater after the first expletive is heard.)<br/><br/>Terrence and Philip's movie becomes number one at the box office, inspiring many local children to start frequently swearing. The parents of South Park decide to launch a campaign named Mothers Against Canada (MAC), with the sole intent of starting a war between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.<br/><br/>If Terrence and Philip are killed, Satan and a recently deceased Saddam Hussein (the character of which is actually represented by real photos of Hussein blended with animation) will rise from the bowels of Hell and take over the world. Terrence and Philip's death somehow  for one reason or another  signifies the coming of the apocalypse, and Kenny  who dies early on in the film, goes to Hell and realizes Satan's plan  rises back to Earth as a ghostly image and tells his friends they must stop the war.<br/><br/>I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone are making a statement here, not just about war in general but also about what they believe is 'censorship' by the MPAA and their absurd standards (as one character sings in a musical number, it's okay to show nasty blood and guts  but just don't say any naughty words!). And it's quite obvious that 'Terrence and Philip' are metaphors for the creators of 'South Park,' and the reaction of the public in the film is an eerie foreshadowing of the controversy surrounding the 'real' film's release. It's a clever bit of self-parody that works quite well. I don't think anyone can say that 'South Park' is dumb, even if it's immature.<br/><br/>Canadians in 'South Park' are represented by crude stick figures with heads that part at the mouth into two pieces, flapping about as they 'talk.' The animation on the Americans isn't much better  very, very basic drawings. In a bit of a self-referential stab, one of the kids in the film says that he likes Terrence & Philip, but 'the animation sucks.'<br/><br/>Some people said 'The Passion of the Christ' was anti-Semitic. Some people said 'Birth of a Nation' was racist (indeed, a recent limited re-release was protested). 'South Park' is both. Packaged along with more than a handful of scatological references are cruel jokes surrounding ethnicity. There are running gags about Jewish residents of South Park, as well as African-Americans and, of course, Canadians. However juvenile their jokes may be, however, Parker and Stone manage to make us laugh  even though we may sometimes feel disturbed by doing so. And one can't help but realize that a lot of the racial jokes are satirical  such as when the Army decides to launch an attack against Canada, and a platoon of black soldiers are used as the 'human shield.' The movie is often trying to say something important, which isn't at all what I had expected  and the notion of America trying to blame other countries for its fault (in this case, Canada) isn't so far-fetched.<br/><br/>'South Park' contains less profanity than 'Scarface,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'GoodFellas,' and 'American History X,' among others, but it's known for its strong language. It constantly pops up on Internet message boards as one of 'the' most profane films of all time, despite the fact that according to official sources it contains less than half the amount of foul language found in Martin Scorsese's 'Casino.'<br/><br/>So why are so many people convinced that it has the most profane language of all-time? Well, part of the reason is its length  barely more than 80 minutes  and I'm sure another large issue is the fact that it's animated, and all the profanity is delivered at a rapid speed, mostly by supposed 'children' (who look like big blobs of cardboard). And, unlike more serious films, the profanity in 'South Park' is there for no reason at all  at least not in the same context as dramas. In an interview, director Trey Parker claimed that the intent of 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' was to shock. And indeed, if that was his point then he and co-writer Stone have succeeded  this is a revolutionary advancement in mainstream entertainment. The MPAA is constantly stretching its boundaries, and with 'South Park'  which they originally gave an NC-17 classification prior to certain scenes being deleted by Parker  they really have shamed themselves.<br/><br/>I liked 'South Park,' a number of scenes made me laugh and I was very amused overall. No fault can be found in its short length, either  had it dragged out another twenty minutes, perhaps it would have seemed too long, but its current runtime is appropriate given the material. Not all the jokes work, and sometimes the film just goes too far  but if you're looking for something funny, and you have an open mind and aren't easily offended, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is a worthy recommendation."

","True to its title, this big screen version of the popular animated TV series features more violence, profanity and obscenities than any prior episodes of the show. The film is not, however, offensive simply for the sake of it; the plot is full of satirical bite as the story focuses on four boys watching a controversial motion picture (not unlike the one that they are in!) and the over-the-top reactions of the local community when they start repeating obscene phrases that they heard. Intelligent debate is brought up in terms of whether offensive language or graphic violence is more dangerous and there is something pointed in how everything culminates in war simply over words. The relative innocence of the boys is notable too; as they say in song, ""the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say""; they are only curious about the adult world and are not interested in offending anyone. Cartman aside, the boys do not repeat any of the obscenities from the film-within in hate. Interesting as all this might sound, the movie runs out of steam well before the credits roll and the carnage towards the end comes across as a rather mindless. The series consists of half-hour episodes after all, and running at nearly three times that length, it is perhaps only inevitable that the material does not stretch out that well. There have also been several better satirical episodes released in the years since this feature length treatment came out, but full of bright songs and quirky characters, 'Bigger Longer & Uncut' does quite well for what it is."

Animation is flat with characters moving in a hopping action with little change or effect. All of the child characters are here including foul mouth Cartman, mama's boy Stan, shy Kyle, and Eskimo Kenny who dies in every episode. Plot regards Canadian actors Terrence and Phillip whose latest film Asses of Fire is blamed for the recent profane behaviour amongst the children. Kyle's mother forms a group called Mothers Against Canada and as a result Terrence and Phillip are arrested on the Conan O'Brien Show and sentenced to death. The result of this threatens to resurrect Satan and Saddam Hussein from Hell. Interesting plot concept with a detailed screenplay that grows chaotic and about as offensive as any film all year. It is directed by Trey Parker with voices by himself and collaborator Matt Stone. Several celebrities lend their voices including Isaac Hayes, George Clooney and Brent Spiner.

Soon after, their parents find out what they have done and start a war between America and Canada, all because of the ""toilet humor"" in the foreign film starring Terrance and Phillip. The two are captured by the U.S. government, with the intention to kill the Canadian duo. However, in doing this, the parents (Kyle's Mom) unintentionally summon Satan and his lover Saddam Hussein. But when Saddam tries to take control Satan kills him. The movie ends with everything going back to normal (as normal as it is in South Park). This is a pretty broad summary of the film.

True its one of the rudest films i have ever seen but it really shows off how we shouldn't censor different arts and that adults shouldn't go out and blame something for the reason something has gone wrong. This may be rude, crude and stupid but it really does touch on real life problems and how children are not always heard through the problem and so much more that you can't put in to words. As soon as you are old enough (14 and over i would say) you really should see it as you will laugh and see the point I'm trying to make with its little messages. <br/><br/>This is a must see that may be rude but still has a great charm, great messages and feels so real within its awful animation."

It's like the kind of movie you watch over and over again, and every time, you notice something new. In some occasions, you will find many things noticeable only in HD, such as hilarious posters and details of people's faces.

","South Park; Bigger, Longer and Uncut is classified as an animated comic, musical. Released in 1999.The stars of the show are nothing more than cut out paper figures made from colorful construction paper.<br/><br/>South Park; Bigger, Longer and Uncut is about a group of third graders who bribe a homeless guy to buy their movie passes so that they can get into a foreign film called ""Asses of Fire"" starring two Canadians by the names of Terrance and Phillip. The film ""Asses of Fire"" has been rated ""R"" by the MPAA. This goes to show you that there are always ways of getting around the established rules in life. The movie is filled with obnoxious farting and swearing set to music so that it can also be considered a musical. As a result of the children seeing the movie, which they consider totally awesome, they themselves immediately begin mimicking what they have just seen by incorporating the foul language into most every conversation from that moment on. Of course they go to school using their new found persona and the parents are notified immediately. Kenny sets himself on fire by trying to light a fart as a result he dies, of course.<br/><br/>The reactions of the parents bring on an all out world war. The parents accomplish this by putting all of the blame on Canada because that is where Terrance and Phillip are from. The President of the United States declares war. Canadians become enemies to everyone accept of course Eric Cartman(Trey Parker), Stan Marsh(Trey Parker) and Kyle Brosloski and Kenny McCormick(Matt Stone), who must now save the world.<br/><br/>Satan is portrayed as a gay wimp that is involved with Saddam Hussein. Because this film was made in 1999, Hussein was still alive then, who knew just how ironic that would end up. Satan and his bed partner decide that the war up top has given them the edge to take over the world.<br/><br/>There is a lot being said that is of a political nature by the writers underneath the mask of these characters. Even though watching this type of film was very disturbing to me, I realized that there were some issues embedded throughout the film that deserve mention: There are religious fanatics that want to put the blame on someone and punish them for everything in the world that goes wrong. In the process they themselves afflict pain onto others which is supposed to be God's job.<br/><br/>The issue of censorship, if people do not want to watch something they have a choice not to. They do not have the right to tell others what to choose. And even if children are underage, if they really want to do something they will find a way to do it. Children usually mimic what they see, especially by their parents.<br/><br/>Prejudice against any group of individuals, this film is riddled with the irony of prejudice. The very mother waging war had an adopted child that is a Canadian. This type of film reminds me of Beavis and Butthead which is another show that I have never watched in its entirety because I couldn't get past the content.<br/><br/>The use of colorful construction paper has merit for visual appeal and because of it lighting was not really an issue. There wasn't any special lighting needed. There are plenty of musical ditties throughout and you really expect it with every changing of scenes, however it never really signified a dramatic change in mood.<br/><br/>The content of South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut includes an extreme amount of obscenities, violence, nudity, sexual innuendos of which should shock anyone. I think the writers are trying to make several statements about the world as it appears to them and at the same time make it entertaining on a bazaar platform. This is not my kind of entertainment, but everyone has their own preferences."

","I've never watched a single episode of South Park, so the reason why I decided to watch this movie was because it was on the top 50 animated films of Rotten Tomatoes. I've seen South Park here and there back when I was about 10 or 11, but never watched it since I understood that its humor is usually obscene and was targeted for adults. I thought, while deciding whether to watch it or not, that I've matured enough to give this movie a try. Damn. Do I regret it.<br/><br/>First of all, let me state that I'm not a prude. I curse almost everyday. I am trying to put a stop to it, though. But, wow, was I surprised at the amount of swear words this movie had! Even if the first 10 minutes! I don't know if all South Park episodes are like this movie, filled with much profanity, but gosh. I don't think I'm going to be watching the TV series any time soon.<br/><br/>Let me also say that I was very disturbed with the images of Saddam Hussein and Satan. I thought it was offensive to Saddam, too. I am impressed with the openness this 1999 animated film had with homosexuality, though. I'll give it that.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some of the songs. For example, that rehabilitation song that Mr. Mackey taught the kids was funny and kind of inspired me! AAAAAAND, that's about the only song I remembered.<br/><br/>Overall, this wasn't really a funny film. It was funny during the first 20 minutes, with everyone freaking out because of the corrupting of the youth and the children experimenting with ""new words"", but then it just began repeating itself. Imagine Friend A throwing a pie at Friend B's face, unexpectedly. Funny, right? Now imagine Friend A throwing his 3654th pie at Friend B's face. Not so funny anymore, right? And I'll bet Friend B just wants to kick the crap out of Friend A now. This movie is just like that.<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone. I thought that it would appeal to me, but it didn't. I guess this one's for South Park fans and people who enjoy crude humor."

","This movie is like ""The sound of music"", but not as funny. By that I mean it has the American passion for musical numbers (a passion that I don't share). If the songs were better, I'd give this movie more. It has nothing of the poppy catchiness of ""Dreidl"" from the vastly superior TV version of this cartoon.<br/><br/>Another thing which I think is noteworthy is that this movie made me react like Australian politician Franca Arena: ""The children! The children!"". In other words, I kept thinking how inappropriate this movie is for children. One moment of shock and delight happened when the boys in the cartoon sang a song with lyrics ""uncle f_r"". The lyric is not bowdlerised in the cartoon.<br/><br/>The other shocking moment in the cartoon (at least when thinking of ""impressionalbe minds"") is a scene where you see what looks like a photo of an erect penis (if it's not real, it looks very real).<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this foray into movies is a very disappointing one for the boys from South Park: the foul mouthed passive aggressive/aggressive aggressive Cartman, the conscience of the trio, Kyle, the po' white trash of Kenny, and Stan...whatever attribute it is that he's meant to possess.<br/><br/>Some regular characters of the TV series make an appearance in this movie: Saddam Hussein and Satan, as well as, from memory, Terrence and Phillip.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie lacks the killer social and pop cultural satire of the TV series. And it has loads more music. Americans and music...what's up with that? I mean, I HATED those scenes in movies where characters burst into song, like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""The wedding planner"" (or whatever that movie was where they sing ""I say a little prayer""...UGGH!!)."

I was heartbroken. Then a few years ago i found it cheap on DVD. My dad said i can get it. After i watched it i realized why my Dad wouldn't let me see it. Now this isn't as good as the TV show but it was still entertaining.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to see our favorites singing. But the songs were funny and were in my head for the next couple of days.<br/><br/>This was very rude. It was basically a whole season of South Park rudeness worth. There is probably every swear word in the book.

","I have always been a South Park fan, but I never really understood the movie, in other words, I thought it was pretty naff. I've re-watched it recently, and I have formed a new opinion of it. Mainly because I watched it with my mum, I realised it wasn't just the show in a movie. No, far from it. For one, the story is far more well worked. For those who didn't know, the story in this film is next to identical to the B-story in the episode 'Death' on the first season of South Park, but with a twist. For one, it gets even more violent at the end, and two, it has a lot more swearing than the show, and even the stronger words go unbleeped, which brings me onto my second point. For those who were born when Monty Python's meaning of life came out, and when you think how disgusted people were by that, look at this. It contains one hundred and forty-something f-words, and plenty of violence, sex, and things like that throughout. And just like Meaning of Life, it remains funny. But it's also very very smart. It gets some political and social issues about bad influence for kids, and quite ironically provides a good hour and a half's worth. So yeah, buy it and watch it, It will probably offend you, if you share my belief in God, your'll be offended by the Mole, but then, so what? This movie is supposed to offend. Just sit back and enjoy it. And don't watch it with your mum. It's not a great idea."

Along the way, Kenny dies, Cartman curses, Stan vomits on the girl he likes, and Kyle curses at Cartman. So... it's essentially everything they do in the show, only stretched out into a full length movie. Hooray.<br/><br/>I can handle the show ""South Park"" in small doses. Some episodes I find extremely funny and also rather poignant as the creators point out what's wrong in society. However, it can rapidly become tiresome. At the end, that's exactly what this movie has become. It starts out fresh and interesting, but quickly dies during the scene where the boys watch the Terrence and Phillip movie.<br/><br/>Pardon me if I go off on a slight tangent here, but it seems to me that this movie is indicative of the steady decline of the intellectual decline of humor from clever usage of language and satirical swipes made at society to cursing and bodily function jokes. People, please. Grow up. There is nothing inherently funny about somebody cursing. If used correctly and something to occasionally shock the audience, I have no problem with cursing. This movie throws foul language around as if it were rice at a weddings. It loses all ability to shock and simply becomes irritating. ""Oh. He just cursed again. Ha ha. And again. Ha ha."" This film tries to be satirical in what it pokes fun at, but it crosses the line between satire and parody far too often. Eventually, it crosses the line to paradoy and decides to stay there, but it's too late. Too little of either and too much of immature dreck.<br/><br/>Don't tar me with that ""too old to understand South Park"" brush. I'm 18 now and saw the movie when I was 13, when I was still laughing at Cheech and Chong films. I got it then and I didn't like it. Same goes for today. So, I give ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" a two out of ten and a punch in the nose for helping to screw up humor. Screw this film, I'm going home."

","South Park bigger longer and uncut is an absolutely brilliant film. It has a great story , great characters and a hell of a lot of great laughs.

Its full of profanitys and it warps all four of the boys minds and causes them to spout 4 letter words in abundance. The film is from Canada and nor School or parents are pleased at the boys new found vocabulary so they set up Mothers against Canada. It eventually leads to a war brewing and many Hilarius sequences. For the first big screen outing creaters Trey Parker and Matt Stone have decided not to update the animation but keep it the way it is, in fact there are a couple of jokes at the expense of the crude character design throughout the film. 99% 0f the jokes work very well and I found myself laughing most of the time which with a comedy is definitely a good thing. However the film is nigh flawless apart from one ill judged set of Characters. Satan is funny for a while but his bedroom scenes with Sadamm Hussein are not and they will only cause this perfectly good film to get slated as Homophobic. That said other Gay character big Gay Al is very funny and there are also some celebrities involved, including Winona Ryder doing some funny stuff with ping-pong balls. So all in all its a good first cinema adventure for the gang but the pity is, as the years go on it looks like it could be their last."

"fret_guy89","10","0","1","4 March 2006"," Not for kids, unless you choose of course.
","I'm sure there are plenty of reviews here advocating how good the movie is, so that topic I won't discuss. A lot of people do mention how this movie is not appropriate for kids. I am all for not taking, say, a seven year old or younger, because they will naturally be repeating all sorts of things. Howver, I find that depending on the amount of maturity you instill upon your kids is the proper basis. The ratings on movies is based on a general audience, and you know your kids better than they do. I am sixteen years old right now, and I first saw the BL&U when I was only ten years old. Not because I saw it at a friends house, because I said to my mom at the store and said, ""Ooo I love South Park! Can we get the movie?"" She said of course we could. I watched it over and over again.<br/><br/>People have this notion that letting your kids see graphic movies will ***k them up for later. I admit, I'm no perfect child, but for someone who has see slasher movies since he was two and has had outing to see things like ""Scary Movie"" and rented flicks such as George Carlin and Mallrats in my youth, I find that all of the vulgarity, nudity, gore, and innuendos has had very little effect on me as a person. It is all about how you treat your kids. Babying them will most likely result it a shock when they see said movies, but if you treat your kids right and don't sugar coat EVERYTHING, then you will find that they have a higher point of maturity. <br/><br/>When people think of someone like me raised the way I was, they think of some screwed up kid who does all sorts of crazy stuff because my mom didn't care about what I saw. In reality, I am a A and B student who is perfectly respectful of people with a real future. I think a lot of that comes from this. It may seem like movies wouldn't have such an impact, but I think that seeing such graphic material, then being able to hear the real meaning from an adult and not from my friends let me begin forming my own opinions about things at an early age and helped my maturity a bit. <br/><br/>The lesson here, don't baby your kids. I may not be a parent myself, but I know how I was raised and I have seen the result of overprotective parents on some of my friends.Letting your kids see movies where there is drugs, sex, or violence WON'T make them want to do any of those if you know how to talk to them about it. Seriously, expose your kids to these things while they are young so that YOU, the PARENT are the ones who can first explain it to them, instead of the kids who truly ARE bad news and can give them the wrong idea."

","Mmm-kay, due to my total lack of motivation to follow any TV series that forces me to sit in front of the screen at a certain time every week, I missed most of South Park. I think I never saw a complete episode.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into details about the movie - it was not made for being described, you really have to see it. But be prepared for the biggest collection of dirty language and the worst exploitation of prejudices, religious convictions and bigotry that ever was assembled. Also put some handkerchiefs next to you - at least I could not avoid the tears.<br/><br/>You will find out a lot of new things during this film, for example that there are grizzly bears (and also fair maidens) in the Alpes and who is ""the biggest bitch of all"" (this religious truth is known by a French kid, so one has to believe it). If you need more information on what's wrong with these German people, then you will find the shocking truth here and finally you will learn how to find the clitoris, which is exceptionally useful in certain situations.<br/><br/>The movie is a musical and there are some very good songs in it. My absolute favorite is ""What would Brian Boitano do"", the sound is just great and I want to hear it again and again. But of course also ""Uncle Fxxxer"", ""Blame Canada"" and ""Kyle's Mom a Bxxxh"" are unforgettable jewels.<br/><br/>This movie has nothing in common with intelligence insulting comedies like ""Meet the Fockers"" or ""Along came Polly"", it is really rude and bad.

"Lt_Coffey_182","7","0","1","20 January 2006"," Very funny and well written
","I have always been a huge fan of South Park; it is one of the funniest and most clever cartoon TV series over the last decade. This is very impressive considering cartoons such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama have all been running in the same era as well. When it was announced that a film was being made, I couldn't wait and thankfully wasn't disappointed in any way.<br/><br/>Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Pam Brady really go to great lengths to offend as many people as possible in this film which is of course making an ironic point considering the film is about a war over censorship issues. People who get caught up in moral dilemmas regarding South Park but they are morons who miss the point. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut and the TV series has always observed issues and ridiculed them in an extremely funny way. People getting offended at South Park simply prove the writers' point. What is so brilliant about this film is it is like one big episode of the TV show and Trey Parker definitely went to great lengths to achieve this. As with Parker and Stone's first feature length film, Cannibal: The Musical, South Park: BLU is a musical which adds another dimension to the film and Trey Parker writes very witty lyrics. Possibly the cleverest aspect of this film is that the Terrence and Phillip movie that kicks off the plot is in fact a metaphor of the South Park movie itself.<br/><br/>South Park is full of hilarious characters. Sadly characters such as Butters are not used in this film but the four main characters and the adult characters are all fantastic. Cartman for instance, is one of the funniest characters there has ever been. His hypocrisy makes him such a standout character and his desire to offend as much as possible means that memorable quotes always come from his mouth. Mr Garrison is an extremely morally wrong character which, as he is a teacher, makes another very funny character. Parker and Stone's voice talents go to great use and further proves how multi talented they are as film makers.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is how it mocks the US Army. The racism shown by the army General, for example, is very funny because the film is not mocking blacks in anyway but making fun of racists and their stupidity. Also the USO show allows for more moments of hilarity and does a great job of making idiots out of all the army grunts. The war is almost prophetic considering the war against Iraq which happened some years after the film was made. Parker and Stone obviously read in to political situations very well when writing the film.<br/><br/>Extremely funny and very witty, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut benefits from being a cartoon because it gets away with so much more than it would have done with real people. The crude humour is immature but it works so well with South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a terrific job with this film and deserve all the praise the film received."

","""South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it. In this film, the parents of South Park declare war on Canada after a movie starring Terrence and Phillip, Canada's star fart-joke comedians and only source of income, corrupts the children with foul language. This movie has the same style of humor as the television show it is based on, only now Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't have to abide by broadcasting decency laws.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that has parent and religious groups going spastic over the content. While it does have a lot of vulgarity, the movie also has an underlying message about censorship and first amendment rights. If you watch this movie looking for a good time, and not a soul-enlightening experience, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>The only problem with this film is that it lacks replay value. Once you have seen it two or three times, it is easy to lose interest. Jokes won't have the same kick. But for some reason the songs never get old. The funniest part of this movie is the musical numbers, my personal favorite being ""Blame Canada"" (which went on to be nominated for an Oscar).<br/><br/>This movie is definitely one of my favorite animated movies.

The jokes are tasteless,the religious cosmology will bother more than a few people(I suppose I could say that applies to me somewhat),the fans of Bryan Adams,Brooke Shields and the Baldwin brothers can sit this one out. Still,this has to be one of the most creative and fun movie musicals that have been concocted in years! South Park/Baseketball/PArker&Stone fans will probably appreciate this more than the average viewers. But I figure that even casual South PArk fans will get a kick out of this show.<br/><br/>The plot is centered on the four boys,Stan,Kyle,Kenny and Cartman,go see the R-rated movie of their favorite Canadian entertainers,Terrence and Phillip. After sitting through the film,they come home with potty mouths(or even pottier than before),this shocks and horrifies their parents and Kyle's mom Sheila decides to take ultimate action in assessing blame on why the town's kids now have bad mouths,dirty minds and nasty attitudes. Thus setting in motion a series of events--and before I forget,Kenny is killed because he tries a stunt from the movie,at Cartman's egging--that sends the U.S.A. to war with Canada. Meanwhile,Kenny returns from Hell with news that Satan and his lover,Saddam Hussein are planing a takeover of Eart that is a direct correlation of the war and the fate of Terrence and Phillip.<br/><br/>If that summary hasn't basically disgusted or confused you,then congratulations! You are probably right to watch this film. My personal opinion is that the music from this film(co-written by PArker and musical guru MArc Shaiman)is even better than the film itself and is worth purchasing,although I suppose if you haven't seen the film and/or South PArk the television series,it will be lost on you.

Of course the aforementioned kids spread their colorful verbal antics to the other children at their elementary school and soon the parents are in an uproar, so much so that military action against Canada and the executions of the duo from the film seem imminent. No ""South Park"" entry is complete without Kenny being killed. But this time he goes to Hell and we see that Satan himself and Saddam Hussein are just waiting for the events to transpire so that they can rule the world. Amazingly Hussein becomes the dominant figure in a strange sexual relationship that he has with the Prince of Darkness (no kidding folks). Censorship, v-chips, crazed musical interludes and constant vulgarity dominate the action from minute one through minute 80. ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" just does not play as well as the Comedy Central series. Length becomes a real issue as the characters are not totally successful being transferred to the silver screen. The film would have been about the same with an hour cut out. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone do everything possible to offend and insult their audience. Nothing is to be taken too seriously though (you just have to realize that Parker and Stone are little more than hacks that make up for their lack of talent by being as outrageous as possible). Anyway the movie is hit and miss. Some of the gags are hilarious, while some are just disastrous mistakes. Surprisingly the musical numbers may be the picture's greatest strengths.

Also, I can't believe that this movie didn't win the Academy award for best song. Clearly a song with minimal words about a certain characters mom is pure genius. Yeah, sure, I can bang my head on a table for 2 minutes to get a better song than that. And no, I don't think I'm missing the real message in this movie. I'm pretty sure that the message is it's not worth taking you're own life over a movie. No wait, that's what my fortune cookie said the night before I saw this garbage. Besides our time this movie also wasted precious film. I would have rather watched an iceberg try to melt for a few days than sit through any portion of this complete disregard for my anticipation of at least a bad movie that I could tolerate. If I was given a choice of watching 20 minutes of this movie or the death penalty, I might just have to try and talk them into giving me life in prison instead. Surely one of the worst movies ever made. Sucked worse than anything from start to the painful finish. Pointless and worthless. 1/10, 1/100, 0 stars, thumbs as far down as they will go. Just even mentioning the word ""stars"" with this movie is an outrage."

This movie is designed to offend. What exactly the message of this movie was supposed to be eludes me. Perhaps it was saying that cursing is a good thing and may save the world. Or perhaps it was saying that people shouldn't overreact to cursing in entertainment or else it may start a war that will begin the apocalypse. Or perhaps it was just trying to be as offensive as possible in order to throw the gauntlet down to South Park's critics. Perhaps all three reasons?<br/><br/>The good news is that the movie has some funny spots. A couple of the songs had me laughing. ""Kyle's Mom's a _____"" was hilarious. The battle at the end was funny. Overall, I liked it. But the profanity got tiring after awhile. Most of the jokes I liked were where they restrained themselves: ""Can I finish?

","What a huge disappointment this one was! Although I'm not a die-hard fan, I enjoy South Park on occasion; it's different from other cartoons. I like listening to Stan Marsh's voice, for an eight year-old, his voice is breaking early. However, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have always disrespected their audience by disappointing them frequently with their quirks, and this film suffer because of it.<br/><br/>SP:BLU features the four boys (Stan, Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman) going to see Terrence And Phillip's R-rated movie. After seeing the film, they come out spewing unedited profanities and using them on everyone, including Kyle's mother. Mrs. Broslofski decides to start a movement to ban all things Canadian (Terrence and Phillip, despite British accents, are Canadians). When the Canadians answer by blowing up the house where Baldwin actors live, the Americans invade Canada so they can capture Terrence and Phillip and execute them. However, there's a catch. For some reason, if Terrence and Phillip die, it will allow Satan to take over the world. While he waits, we see Satan's crisis with his lover Saddam Hussein (who's also Canadian, go figure). Satan wants to see other guys and Hussein will have none of it.<br/><br/>Until they start invading Canada, this film is hilariously funny, with great songs and ""colourful"" language. It's a dream come true for those who want an unedited ""South Park"". From the invasion on, the film is woefully unfunny, with pointless scenes like the USO Party before the execution and the recon mission to save Terrence and Phillip.<br/><br/>If there's a good thing, Stone and Parker keeps the animation the same, with cardboard paper cutouts, so purists will be happy. Yet again, they allow their indulging in infuriating their fans get in the way. If the whole movie was as funny as the first half, this would have been the funniest animated movie ever. Ultimately, it's just another example of Matt and Trey's arrogance. Still, check it out for the first half, then decide if the second half is a huge step down."

I own Heavy Traffic, Akira, Perfect Blue, Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa, Grave of the Fireflies, Wings of Honneamise, Ghost in the Shell, and about a dozen other adult and young adult animated titles, most of which are more subversive and clever than South Park (especially Heavy Traffic, which has some of the most bizarre and original sex jokes in any movie ever--and while the animation is a bit limited, it is by far more creative and stylistic than SP).  Hell, just about any made-for-TV Japanese anime not aimed at children under 7 (e.g. Pokemon or Digimon) has nudity, violence, and the Japanese version of cursing--and even Pokemon had an episode where James from Team Rocket, dressed as a woman and wearing inflatable breasts that would make Lara Croft jealous, tells a young girl, ""These are too much for you.""<br/><br/>I think maybe I've become a bit jaded towards movies that pop culture deems ""subversive.""  But what I really think puts these other movies at least a notch above South Park is that they are not content in just pushing the edge of what can and should be protected by the First Amendment--they actually have something to say that is worth protecting with the First Amendment that is not just some chicken and the egg paradox (i.e. using first amendment protection to protect the first amendment).<br/><br/>I mean, honestly, if all we as American citizens get in return for letting artists say what's on their mind is a bunch of fart jokes, expletives, and epithets repeated over and over just so they can rub sensitive people's faces in the first amendment one more time, then BRING ON THE BLUE PENCILS!"

","I don't trust people who ask questions like ""What's wrong with profanity?""  If there wasn't anything wrong with it, why the social proscriptions?  The truth is some of us know that it is; that restraint is the right road to take; and that movies like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" promote the idea that the best approach to take is the shortest one between your brain and your mouth.  It doesn't matter how childish or stupid or hateful the thought is; it has a right to be heard--and considering ""South Park's"" popularity, a lot of people must feel this way, or else have never really thought about it seriously.<br/><br/>Considering how many Emmies it won, I must be in the minority on not liking the TV series ""The Wonder Years,"" but I always felt like the writers were always putting words into the mouths of babes that sounded more eloquent and sage than they should.  I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone do the same thing. They revel in the nastiness they force out of the mouths of Kyle and Cartman and Stan.  They may feel that profanity doesn't hurt anyone, but isn't the point of profanity that it be offensive?  That it is trying to revolt someone?  Trying to sully someone or their reputation?  Trying to outrage Mom and society and convention?<br/><br/>The dishonest part about this is, whether they care to admit it or not, Parker and Stone like holding up Kyle and Cartman and Stan as moral beings.  We are getting the same nonsense about their forthrightness as we did when people were praising Bart Simpson for his irreverence and cynicism.  Even I'm willing to accept a good dose of this stuff, if it clears the air.  But if I'm to believe that a lot of kids talk like the ones on South Park, then the moral methane that rises from the confusion that a Terrence and Phillip create must to God make the world look like Gary, Indiana. <br/><br/>Unless we or grace or both are constantly in touch with our children, they remain pre-moral imps like Cartman or Kyle, congratulating themselves on what little triumphs over vice they manage to eke out every so often.  This moral underachievement may not be a bad thing; but it's hardly a great thing either.  And the praise this movie is getting stumps me.  Profanity may not be as bad as, say, mowing down your classmates with a semiautomatic weapon, but the distance between the two is not exactly reason to stand up and cheer either.  South Park is in Colorado, right?  Is it anywhere near Littleton?"

The annoying thing is that when it does it is usually very funny (I say usually because there is only so many times you can laugh at the 'f' word) and you feel that the film could have been so much better.<br/><br/>It is far too concerned in being controversial.  Trey and Matt seem like little boys with a new toy in their overuse of things that they couldn't get away with on regular T.V.  The prime example is the now unbleeped swearing. Also, they need a stronger plot for a film; it needs to last a lot longer than the T.V. show so the plot and characters need to progress.  Problem is that Trey and Matt are very good at being mildly funny but not at writing that vital plot.

One premise in particular (I won't say, but I'm sure everyone who saw it can guess) was far too long and wore out its welcome just a few minutes into the scene.  The film's use of language and sex added nothing to the movie.  The one sparkling (yet not redeeming) quality about the film was the brilliant use of musical numbers.

However, the actual movie in and of itself, regardless of its overall meaning, is not funny.  There are few really good laughs in this movie.  Many characters are unnecessary and undesired.  Most people who watch the show on a semi-regular basis will be dissapointed by the lack of comedy in this movie.  Some parts of this movie are just plain juvenile, and Kenny's character is misused.  Most people who leave the theater will realize that they remember little from the movie - there are just few memorable moments.  However, despite the fact that this movie is devoid of any truly memorable moments, people will ultimately remember its message. *** out of *****"

","How in the world did this movie avoid an NC-17 rating? I have never heard the f-word so much in one movie (not that I am offended by that word.. I' m not, but in a movie that has a huge, teen and pre-teen fanbase, it is not appropriate). The scene with Sadaam pulling a male body part from under the covers was a tad too much (on top of that, he did it twice). I am a fan of the TV show, but I did not care for the movie too much. Seems like the attitude was ""Gee... let's see how offensive we can be"" with little or no emphasis on the story itself. I also did not care for the ""musical"" format. They should have stuck to what made South Park a success."
"elcopy","5","0","2","12 July 1999"," A 30 minute episode stretched too long
","Yeah, it's hilarious, yeah the kick a**. Yeah, you can see even better storylines of South Park for the price of basic cable or a movie rental.<br/><br/>When I went to the theatre I wasn't expecting the earth to move, and that's maybe what everybody else is doing. Yet, it's still not a good reason to pay for this. Basically the movie is the standard South Park cartoon with some filler in it (like the singing per instance). During the final minutes the laughs are more scarce which proves my point. The ""F-Word"" jokes are funny the first 3 million times, but then they become annoying. Add up a very tasteless sexual relationship between Saddam Hussein and Satan, and you got yourself a cartoon that is better worth waiting for it to come on video."
"jaws!","6","0","3","11 July 1999"," Funny,but after a while tiresome
","The first 20 minutes of this movie is hilarious. Then after that the bad language,and jokes get repeated over and over again, but once in a while there's a laugh-out loud part after the first 20 minutes. Also there's way too many songs. This movie is not as funny as Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. And it can't hold a candle to American Pie. But the South Park movie is still funny at times. I give South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut **1/2 out of ****"
"Stormhnd","5","0","2","7 July 1999"," A mixed bag
","As someone who really enjoys the show, and in general loves a good scathing satire, I entered the theater expecting to have a good time.  After all, I had enjoyed Baseketball, and figured that Matt and Trey knew what they were doing with a feature film.  Unfortunately, as regards SP:BLU, they don't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; the movie has some genuinely side-splitting moments, and there was some brilliant parody.  I even loved (most of) the musical numbers, and found the self-deprecating comments quite witty.  But there were also moments when I was sitting there wondering why I'd come, thanks to the unending torrent of filth pouring out of the screen.  It seems that our dynamic duo forgot the first rule of entertainment: always leave them wanting more.  The South Park series gets a certain amount of its spice from crudity, rather like adding a few drops of tobasco to a recipe, but its substance is in its relentless parody of our foibles.  SP:BLU is more like drinking a bottle of tobasco straight, and at points is about as funny as a broken ankle.  The vulgarity seems to have been used more as filler than as a seasoning.  If the spice had been used with a little more precision and restraint, the resulting dish would've been a real delight...rather than merely hot.  I think in the future, I'll stick with the series, where the limits of time force them to concentrate on being truly funny...and I hope they will too."
"T.J.-6","3","0","7","5 July 1999"," Ummm...Are they Sure this isn't NC-17?
","I went to see South Park the day after it opened with a buddy of mine. Now, for the most part, I usually enjoy the television show, South Park, by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  I appreciate the satiracle nature of the television program and was looking forward to seeing the film.  Now that I've seen the movie, I'm not sure if I'll ever view an episode of South Park the same. Scratch that, I'm not sure if I can ever watch an episode of South Park again.<br/><br/>I understand what Parker and Stone were trying to do with the flick.  They were taking a look at censorship and taking potshots at their opponents in the process.  The problem that I have with the film is that they went so overboard in trying to get that point across that the movie became disgusting.  I laughed at parts of the film (I loved the Brian Boitano song), but soon felt ashamed at doing so.  Parker and Stone smashed so much dirty language and sick humor (the bedroom scenes between Saddam and Satan) that I just didn't want to watch anymore.<br/><br/>I'm left with mixed feelings about the film.  My biggest concern is that the film only received an R-rating.  Now, I'm eighteen years old and for the most part a jaded viewer, but I must say that I would hope that no kid under seventeen should get into this movie, even if they are with their parents. I think they should have gotten the NC-17 tag on this movie and surprised that they didn't."
"Xenophore","2","0","8","3 July 1999"," Love the series, hate the movie
","If you're expecting a two-hour episode of the series, that's not what you're going to see. Although the movie title includes the word ""uncut,"" the word is that some things had to be cut to get the ""R"" rating instead of ""NC-17."" If this is the tame version, I'd hate to see what was removed. At the theater where we saw the movie, an usher was posted outside the door handing out movie passes as people left during various parts of the movie when they exceeded their individual offensiveness tolerances.<br/><br/>If Stone and Parker had made a two-hour movie with the offensiveness level of a normal episode, it would have been a popular movie, but perhaps moviegoers might have left the theater thinking they hadn't seen anything new. If they had made a two-hour movie with the offensiveness level of ""The Spirit of Christmas,"" I think we would have been reminded of what we saw in that original short that made us want to see a TV series. However, by releasing the movie they did, I think they may have killed the proverbial golden goose; I'm not sure I can watch the series anymore as it might remind me of the (for lack of a better term) assault to which we were subjected tonight."
"Houmatt","Null","0","1","4 July 1999"," Worst Film of The Decade
","""Uh oh"" is right. A sick, perverse TV series is now an even more sick, even more perverse motion picture. Yes, those graduates of the Howard Stern School of Taste and Tact, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are at it again.<br/><br/>Between Kenny dying and being sent to a heaven populated with topless females, Saddam Hussein having sexual relations with Satan, songs laden with profanity and an open attack on Canada, I am saddened that the IMDB does not have a rating lower than one star.<br/><br/>I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE this film!!!!<br/><br/>As Saving Private Ryan is easily the best film of the 1990's, this could very well be the worst."
