","I've heard so many critics and average joes ripping into this flick like it was the first sign hailing the antichrist. The movie is simple, yes, but damn funny. Maybe I'm just not caught up in my own pretense to enjoy a simple movie. Yes, there are times when I crave something more sophisticated, but this movie still has my friends and I rolling in the aisles. Give it a chance and you just might like it. 7/10"
"Mr. Gore","8","59","73","3 August 1998"," Genuinely funny movie
","David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts which include ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", and ""Naked Gun,"" the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take ""Mafia!"", please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for ""South Park,"" its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of ""Unsolved Mysteries."" By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk."

","I once watched Baseketball, got hooked and since then I watched it like 50 times. It is one of the films I cannot ever seem to grow tried of. I don't know what it is about it, but it is somehow so complete in its rough form.<br/><br/>Obviously, it doesn't hurt that there is plenty of nude (and amazingly gorgeous) women in the film (Victoria Silvstedt; WOW! is the only word that springs to mind!!!), but also because it is so delightedly respect-less towards just about anyone or anything.<br/><br/>All I can say to this flick is, if you like South Park, you'll LOVE this one! In fact, anyone with a sense of humour should enjoy this one!<br/><br/>7/10"

","Just sickly and twistedly funny as hell. Parker and Stone are OBVIOUSLY demented, and hooking up with Zucker was a brilliant move. I laughed until I cried. I had to stop the tape several times because I was incoherent from laughing so hard. The Robert Stack bit was just sooooooooooo funny, as were pretty much all of the jokes. Now the DVD version on the other hand has some serioous problems, like missing scenes, no extras to speak of and horrible picture quality. Pick it up on VHS instead, no extras, but you get the entire movie."
"dbarbanti","8","26","32","23 December 2003"," Great!...But let me tell you why!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.  I am of the firm belief that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time.  They have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way ...if that makes any sense.  This is mainly what makes South Park soooo funny.  Once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever, you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed.  That is apparent in BASEketball.  Although it is directed by David Zucker and is utterly rediculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is major league sports.  I am also a fan of sports so I find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love.  The opening prologue is brilliant...tears from laughter form everytime I see those football players begin Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea...but, just like South Park, once you look past the absurdity...it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius.  I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars."

Don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality...and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and that might not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts, I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That's all I'm going to say. It's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak.

","Why the crap is this movie rated so low?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line to this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop ""Airman"" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or ""Sir Swish."" Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called ""Townsell."" I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: ""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over: ""Minnesota."" Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious."

","The sick minds of the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, bring you BASEketball. Yes, if you are expecting a respectful and tactful movie, don't watch it. If not, sit back and laugh until you want to cry. There are so many things that actually made me laugh out loud, which very few movies do. I loved the part when Coop is driving in the car, and that funny song comes on the radio. Robert Stack and the entire cast was hilarious in this also. I really liked the fact that they have a character named Kenny in the movie.  Don't forget to watch the outtakes on this as well!

"bowmanblue","8","4","4","15 June 2015"," Live action 'South Park'
","Okay, so 'Baseketball' hasn't really got anything to do with the adult cult animated TV show, but it stars both its writers/creators and is basically the same sense of humour, i.e. adult. In short if you like South Park, you should like 'Baseketball.' It's about two losers (Trey and Matt – the men behind South Park) who invent a new game which is basically a cross between basketball and baseball in their driveway.<br/><br/>Before long it becomes a national pastime. As with South Park, a lot of the humour is vulgar, crude, disgusting and totally 'adult' in nature. You could be forgiven for thinking that Baseketball is nothing more than a low-brow gross-out comedy (and you may have a point!), but, also like South Park, it has its moments of satire and social commentary that raise it to more than just Trey and Matt's version of 'American Pie.' <br/><br/>The jokes come thick and fast and, if you've seen Trey and Matt in action, you'll realise that they're basically playing themselves. Yes, there is some character development (believe it or not!), but the film is geared towards laughs over story and plot. And, because of this, it totally succeeds. As soon as you sit down to watch it, you'll be able to predict where exactly it's going, but don't let that put you off. So I'll end where I basically began by saying that if you like South Park (and I do!), you'll enjoy this."
"blackwolf14016","10","25","38","17 January 2004"," Great, Crude fun
","There really isn't much to say about this movie....it's crude, but fun.<br/><br/>
Plot outline (From IMDB)<br/><br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invent a new game playing basketball, using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success, they, along with a billionaire's help, form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer's team, the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute.<br/><br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>The Acting is pretty good, since there arn't many big stars in this movie. Although I am not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. <br/><br/>There are so many funny moments in this movie I can't come close to naming them all. It never really lets up, and they don't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. <br/><br/>And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's GREAT. I especially like ""Take me on"" and ""Beer"" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated.<br/><br/>
Overall, a crude, but extremely funny, movie. 10/10<br/><br/>James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston"

","This movie is just funny. mindless, but funny. to enjoy this movie completely you can't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film. I still find the bit at the start funny when he says ""want a beer........cock"". funny stuff. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don't believe. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch"
"jellyneckr","Null","16","25","21 June 2004"," BASEKEketball ""scores!""
","BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to ""psyche-out"" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking ""Wow this this over already?"" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines, and it is very fun to watch!"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","9","13","3 February 1999"," Slam dunk
","I've never been one for sports dramas or comedies. Anything from A League of Their Own to Space Jam just doesn't work for me, mostly because of the Deus Ex Machina nature of happy endings. Kingpin has been the only movie that avoids this overdone cliché.<br/><br/>BASEketball doesn't avoid the ticking clock, last-minute win, but it does give us lots of sight gags and random madness. Though I don't want to sell it short, the film is also a biting satire on modern sports and corporate sponsorship, something that I feel has spoiled sports across the whole planet. Many players no longer play for the love of the game, but for themselves, for obscene amounts of money.<br/><br/>As with his other movies (such as Airplane or Naked Gun), David Zucker makes sure there's at least one gag every thirty seconds. Many fail, but most work, so the film stays on our good side if you only want laughs and couldn't care less about satire.<br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a great comic pair, and have absolutely no shame or delusions. But an even funnier comedy duo are the real life sports commentators Bob Costas and Al Michaels, who have the funniest lines and most perfect delivery.<br/><br/>It's become a little dated now, a fault of movies that have too many pop-culture references, but there's still plenty to laugh at and enjoy with BASEketball."

","This movie is really underrated, one of the the best comedy movies ever, it's about two below average American guys (Joe Cooper and Doug Remer) who are good at nothing except scoring basketball points from the standstill position, so as a they were challenged by two rivals in a party to play a two-on-two game, knowing their limited capabilities they convinced the other team to play it in a new way , the BASEketball way, and from here a new game is invented and spread across the nation. the film is really funny, the acting is bad but it makes the movie even better, the jokes are new and you can't stop laughing for the whole movie, I was astonished to find this rating for a movie that has a lot in common with the overrated dodge-ball, only it's funnier."
"ah-andy","9","2","2","1 January 2011"," Finally!
","Finally, a comedy that actually makes you laugh THROUGHOUT the whole movie! These days, it seems like most of the comedies are boring and lame, and don't really have jokes that make you laugh; it's all forced. But I actually laughed while watching BASEketball.<br/><br/>The story is about two best friends who take a game that they created and and played in their backyard, to an official national sport. They then face problems along the way and try to solve them.<br/><br/>The primary characters are Joe Cooper - played by Trey Parker - and Doug Remer - by Matt Stone. They are both portrayed splendidly and humourisly. The acting didn't lack anything and it was near perfect! Joe Cooper is the serious, responsible one that has his principles and goals. Whereas Doug Remer is the loose, spoiled one. In a way, they're a perfect match.<br/><br/>The secondary characters are Jenna Reed - played by Yasmine Bleeth - and Squeak Scolari - by Dian Bachar. They add a lot to the story, and make it all the more better. Jenna works for a foundation that helps sick kids, and both Joe and Doug are attracted to her. Squeak is hilarious, and is Joe and Doug's teammate and friend.<br/><br/>The story is unique, like the sport, and funny. It was really well written and produced. Certainly one to talk about for decades, and one of a kind.<br/><br/>You should definitely watch this movie! It would be a waste if you don't, since it's one of the funniest movies ever."
"StevePulaski","8","2","2","13 August 2010"," A Game Worth Playing
","BASEketball is a satisfying Comedy film by two creators of a certain animated show thats currently in it's fourteenth season. Why of course, Im speaking of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and their creation of the controversial television series, South Park. They star in one of the few actually acting films they did that is pretty much forgotten about. Its a very good Comedy and from the kind of humor in this Im upset they didn't do more acting Comedy films. Seeing them come back nowadays would be a miracle since if one looked at their filmography the only thing they've been doing for a while now is strictly South Park. Anything else is minor cameos.<br/><br/>Buddy movies are what I love. Two or three friends, hanging out, getting into fights, antics, and anything that involves them somehow finding humor is what I love. Half of the movies on my list of favorites are dynamic duo, buddy movies. Clerks, Black Sheep, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, etc. They're enjoyable movies. Especially when the characters are close to home. Thats what tops it off.<br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone plays Remer and Cooper, underachieving slackers whom shoot for nothing that involves work. After being challenged at a party to a Basketball game, they come up with a game on the spot called ""Baseketball"", an obvious pun on Basketball and Baseball. The movie then cuts five years later where Remer, Cooper, their friend nicknamed ""Squeak"" (Dian Bachar) for his notably short size, and numerous other guys have formed a Baseketball team called the ""Milwaukee Beers"", parody of the Brewers. After the manager dies choking, the team is now in the hands of Cooper who is shy and scared to do anything to change it causing much dismay Remer, Squeak, and the remaining teams. The team's quest is to win the ""Denslow Cup"", the biggest title in Baseketball.<br/><br/>I always loved the work of Parker and Stone. They prove to be a witty and clever duo in this forgotten movie. The movie throws in various counts of humor assuring audiences never come close to boredom. Definitely one to check out. Only wish DVD included all the deleted scenes from the VHS release.<br/><br/>Not too much to say about this then it's just a great Comedy movie. This is the kind of Comedy the 90s were all about. Two slackers sums up the plot who amount to something much greater than themselves. You can basically name ""Two slackers"" under every Comedy in the 90s. Clerks, Black Sheep and so on. Very good Comedy right here, very well done humor, some jokes overdone, but well done at the same time. Decent cameo made by Jenny McCarthny as well.<br/><br/>Starring: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, and Jenny McCarthny. Directed by: David Zucker."

Don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure, there's plenty of that but it's all contextual, not gratuitous. I loved this film and it only cost me £2.99 on DVD , so in terms of entertainment value for money, it has been the best film I've seen this year."
"jaysilentbob37","8","3","4","16 July 2006"," I'd take this over all the Scary Movie films put together.
","David Zucker + Trey Parker/Matt Stone = Hysterically funny Airplane-style comedy from the master of the genre. BASEketball is easily one of David Zucker's most underrated films. I've seen this movie many MANY times, and I still can't figure out what there isn't to like about it. My friends all loved it, and I showed it to my parents who hated it. Ironically, the adults I've watched this with all LOVE Airplane and The Naked Gun, and I have no idea what's so different. This film has the exact same kind of humor as the previously mentioned films. So why is it that they love the other films and all have the same reaction to this film: STUPID. So what if it isn't as deadpan as the others, I can't really find anything to dislike about the film.<br/><br/>The film's ""plot"" revolves around two best friends Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper (Trey Parker), and Doug Remer (Matt Stone), who had big dreams as kids, but for some unspecified reason, became loser , time-wasting slackers who are always late at paying bills. Anyway, when the two guys are challenged to a basketball game by a couple of jocks, they make up a game called BASEketball, which obviously is a hybrid of basketball and baseball. The game soon becomes a national pastime, and recruiting their friend/perpetual victim, Kenny ""Squeak"" Scolari (Dian Bachar) also known as ""Little Bitch,"" the trio become big sports stars, and face the temptation and corruption that occurs behind the game, putting the friendships to the test.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" is merely a setup for a constant stream of jokes and gags. Almost, not all, but almost every frame in the movie has a sight gag of some kind, and any plot or logic is simply lost among them, as we spend most of our time watching the background for something randomly hilarious, which almost always shows up. Some of the best gags involve people such as news reporters, and Robert Stack on Unsolved Mysteries, saying words on TV that can't be said on TV. There is a gratuitous, and joyously offensive subplot about a terminally ill kid, who is a fan of the character's BASEketball team. When he comes into play, many brutal slapstick jokes ensue at his expense. The ""psyche- out"" rule (players can do whatever they want to make the opposing player miss their shot) was a genius addition to the script, as they allowed endless gag possibilities, which while hit- and-miss, were usually very funny. Of course, my personal favorite gags were at the expense of Squeak ""Little Bitch,"" who was the butt of nearly a third of the jokes in the movie. These are all hits. You both feel sorry for Squeak, and yet you want to join in in endlessly ridiculing him. I nearly laughed myself into asthma attacks on more than one occasion, as did my friends who all want to buy the movie on DVD now. The film should be required viewing for (younger) fans of the earlier spoof films. I'm coming to a conclusion that this movie was made for the new generation of silly gag-a-minute comedies, and adults who were alive during the release of the older films of the genre will ultimately dislike it. <br/><br/>One good thing about the film, is that unlike most films of the genre, the film isn't really a spoof, and the little plot there is, is actually quite original (I'm referring to the idea of the game of course). The fact that they don't have to set up the gags around the setting from another movie gives it a fresh and free feeling. The film has no target of parody, and instead of mooching off the plot for another movie for jokes, it uses a simple, ridiculous premise for that kind of humor. And it works well.<br/><br/>South Park fans will be pleased to see Trey Parker and Matt Stone in starring roles, which they actually do really good in. I truly think that they should do more movies of this genre when they aren't busy with the hilarious South Park. Their line delivery is as good as I've seen it (Trey Parker gives one of the best-delivered s-words I've ever heard), and their slapstick humor is totally brilliant. The way they react to much of the situations, and their treatment of many of the best lines with dead seriousness (sometimes) is absolutely priceless. These two should really get more acting jobs. Nobody could have played their characters better than they did.<br/><br/>Being a fan of South Park and David Zucker, I was thoroughly satisfied with this film. I can only guess the reason why adults hate it so much is the fact that the movie practically wallows in bad taste, and features some of the most offensive (hilarious) jokes ever put to film, many of which involve young kids who are crippled and/or terminally ill. But I don't care. I highly enjoy this film, and am always sad when the end credits roll, knowing that due to the box-office failure of it, there will never be a sequel. I had a great time with the characters in the film. I recommend the film to those who are open minded or who have a sense of humor and just want something silly. In the words of a talking pineapple (don't ask) towards the end of the movie, ""Isn't this game just about getting together with your friends and having a good time?"" That applies to the movie perfectly. BASEketball is one of the most flat-out enjoyable comedies I've ever seen. 8/10.<br/><br/>BASEketball is happily rated R for Strong Language and Crude Sex-Related Humor. Sex: 6/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 8/10 Drugs: 5/10"

","I saw Orgazmo a few years back and I was talking about it with a friend of mine. He told me that I had seen nothing yet and then he recommended BASEketball. Sort of... he couldn't remember the name. He only remembered that it was a combination of two sports. Well, obviously finding the correct movie name wasn't very hard, but finding the movie in Finland wasn't as easy...<br/><br/>... but it was well worth it.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much what you would expect from a cooperation between Parker & Stone and David Zucker, which basically means politically incorrect humor with a lot more happening than you can absorb with a single viewing... and a classic DVDA song in there somewhere. To me that is a perfect recipe for humour. The only thing missing (in my mind) is the underlying message I've grown to expect from Parker & Stone. Maybe there is one, but since I'm admittedly not a ""big sports guy"", I might just be missing the point. I do like the intro to the movie though.<br/><br/>In the end, this is the kind of movie I can watch time and time again. It might not be a classic movie, which will be remembered through the decades, but the pure entertainment value is pretty much unrivaled. I guess some people can't handle the humor and should therefore probably stay away from this movie, but otherwise, you probably should go through the trouble of seeing this movie."

","This movie is a standard side-splitter, with little storyline to back it up, but outstanding comedy. This is the first film for Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators) as actors, and although that shows, they do a pretty good job. Voices from their hit show are lent to the dialog every now and then, which just adds to the humour. A great underdog story (reminicent of 'Dodgeball')- where a team/group of friends has to overcome a challenge to rise above as a victorious group of friends once again - but with much less of the story to go on. Nevertheless, the movie will have you laughing more than enough. Where the story may fall short, this is the point of the movie; viewers will notice this after a few minutes in...it's just that type of comedy.

BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didn't write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes. ""Airplane"" was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.<br/><br/>I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today. Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny. Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them. It's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity. I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons. It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class. Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.<br/><br/>Parker and Stone have never been great actors. They've been serviceable in their films. I can't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball, other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film. Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way. It's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way. I am reminded of the South Park episode ""How to Eat with your Butt"" where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out, Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture. Really it's sad.<br/><br/>And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isn't any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Don't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around"

","On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball (1998): ""This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie.""<br/><br/>So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior ""There's Something About Mary"" in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. ""Mary"" was a gross-out fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.<br/><br/>""BASEketball"" tried to outdo Mary, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of ""South Park,"" Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing ""I'm Too Sexy"" as he videotapes his will, Jenny McCarthy, who has little screen time as Borgnine's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by ""Airplane!"" alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate ""Airplane!"" humor and mixing it up with the crudity of ""South Park,"" but failing in every way.<br/><br/>To make this long 100-minute movie short, ""BASEketball,"" a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee, is about two lazy losers (Parker and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house. After Borgnine dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly Parker, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.<br/><br/>Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, egg-throwing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy, who seemed to get over Borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of ""Riverdance"" and ""Titanic."" Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ, post ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series.<br/><br/>And like Siskel, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out, then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!"

What did move this talented person to take part in a piece of garbage? He was already famous at that time, and I am REALLY sure he was and is not fond of the script.

","David Zucker really never came close to what he accomplished with Airplane! and I would hope that by the 90's he realized he never would. BASEketball makes me think that he did have this revelation because this movie is just pure amounts of dumb. It stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park. They play two jobless bums named Coop and Remer who invent a game that combines baseball and basketball. Their game is picked up by Ted Denslow and major league BASEketball becomes a sensation that returns sports to their original and more respectable roots. But when Denslow dies, others want to cash in on the opportunity to make BASEketball a profitable industry. The film is fairly funny and it satirizes professional sports very wittily in some instances, but it eventually boils down to another cookie cutter storyline that lacks that thing called originality.<br/><br/>BASEketball has a great opening. It chronicles a fictional history of professional sports that has some great satire worked in. Then it goes on to introduce the two main characters and I will say that Parker and Stone are pretty funny in this film. Their characters are very uncreative and fall perfectly into the quirky lose stereotype, but Parker and Stone definitely pull the stereotype off well. The story goes on to introduce a love interest, Jenna Reed, that the two leads fight over. This is where things really start to go downhill. As if I haven't seen this scenario in every movie ever. It can be a funny scenario in some instances, but in BASEketball I wanted that subplot to be gone as soon as it arrived. But of course it carried all the way to the end of the film. No surprise there.<br/><br/>The amazing thing is that this film isn't good, and it is really dumb, but strangely enough I don't hate this film like I do other lame comedies. I guess it is because this movie honestly is funny. It banks on some really easy laughs and some cheap jokes, but it at least amused me. I won't deny that I laughed out loud during this film and its crudeness really brings a smile to your face. This movie is unapologetically vulgar and obscene and it doesn't hold back. As silly and stupid as it is, I can't knock it from a purely comic standpoint.<br/><br/>I would never watch this film again, as it isn't a good film. But I don't regret watching it because I did laugh and it did entertain me for what it's worth. Parker and Stone are very funny and I definitely think they need to star in more films together. This is just another comedy where the story isn't whats important, it's the jokes, and luckily the jokes are actually pretty funny. I can't call BASEketball a good film, but I can't call it a piece of crap either."

","Could there be a more unfunny comedy this year?  Oh yeah, Blues Brothers 2000.  Okay, well this one comes close.  Comedies this year are just not doing so well, and this one just adds to the list.  The box office receipts prove it.  I got so extremely bored with this movie that I was hoping to see more of Jenny McCarthy, who was the funniest thing about the film.  McCarthy played the character very seriously, and that is the key to laughter in these types of films.  Leslie Nielson was a genius because he played everything straight-forwardly.  It's like he just wasn't in on the joke, such as when a woman asks him if this is some kind of bust... he replies, ""Well, it's very impressive, yes.""  That's funny.  BASEketball is not.  I just hope there aren't any of these films coming out for a while.  Please, see Mafia!  It is so much funnier than this boring film."

The sport created in this movie sounds good, as it's basketball mixed with baseball, with added rules like psyching people out with vulgar lies (some which, depending on your tastes, may cross the line). Then again, this movie is not for kids. As this is rated R, expect lots of foul language, sexual content, and crude humor. This is a nice adult comedy, and makes me wish BASEketball was a real sport."

"Electrified_Voltage","7","3","6","7 July 2009"," A silly, juvenile, but funny sports comedy
","Since this David Zucker comedy is rated R, I would have been too young for it back when it was released in 1998. I was around twelve years old at the time. The first time I saw ""BASEketball"" was in 2005. At the time, I was just getting into ""South Park"", and I knew that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of that long-running adult cartoon series, starred in this sports film. Seeing it for the first time, I really liked it a lot, despite how polarizing it is. Nearly four years later, I've finally seen it again, and this time, I certainly didn't find it as entertaining as I once did. I used to think it was an excellent comedy, but now I still think it's a reasonable one. It still made me laugh the second time, so I still have to give it some credit.<br/><br/>Joe ""Coop"" Cooper and Doug Remer are two idiots from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who have been friends since childhood. While competing with two basketball experts, they change the rules to try and win, which leads to the invention of a new sport, BASEketball! This eventually becomes a popular driveway sport, and catches to attention of Ted Denslow, who approaches Coop and Remer, suggesting the creation of a National BASEketball League (NBL). Five years later, this league has become a huge success, with teams all over the country. Coop and Remer play for the Milwaukee Beers, owned by Denslow himself. During the BASEketball championship, the Denslow Cup, Ted Denslow chokes on a hot dog, which unfortunately kills him. His will says that Coop will be the new owner of the team if he wins the next season, or else it will go to his widow, Yvette. Baxter Cain, the owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to make significant changes in the rules of the game, but the Milwaukee Beers are the only ones stopping him, so has a scheme to try and prevent the team from winning! <br/><br/>This is a silly, juvenile, crude film, like many other modern comedies, not that I have a problem with that (as long as it's funny), but some people obviously do. Unlike some of these films (e.g. ""Dude, Where's My Car?""), I think this one is actually funny overall. During my second viewing, I found that in some parts, they might go just a little too far with the juvenile humour or overdo the slapstick. For a while, it wasn't making me laugh very hard, but that eventually changed. There were still several comic highlights for me, including a number of the scenes involving teammate Squeak Scolari (played by Dian Bachar, who has collaborated with Parker and Stone on several other projects) taking abuse from Coop and Remer, some of the psych-outs during the games, team members trying to treat a kid in the hospital, and the song Coop hears in the car when things have gone wrong for him. For a rather simple sports comedy, the plot isn't bad, either. There may be some fairly poignant moments.<br/><br/>In the 2004 ""South Park"" episode, ""The Passion of the Jew"", when Stan and Kenny want their money back after they see ""The Passion of the Christ"", Stan says that it's just like the time they got their money back for ""BASEketball"". In an interview in 2005, Trey Parker said one of the two meanest things people say to the controversial comedy duo is, ""Oh my G*d, it's those guys from BASEketball."" I don't know if the two SP creators hate this film and now regret ever doing it, or they just don't like being known just as the guys from this movie (that would definitely be understandable, since they just starred in this film, and were not involved in the writing, directing, or producing, so it certainly doesn't show the full extent of their abilities), but whatever the reason is for their comments on this 1998 comedy years after it was made, it can still make me laugh. Is it David Zucker's best work? No. Is it Trey Parker and Matt Stone's best work? No. Is it an atrocious film that should be avoided at all costs? Well, some people would obviously think so, but not me. While it's no masterpiece, it can still make many people laugh (mostly guys, I think). I still think it's superior to ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"", just not as far superior as I used to think it was."

When I first saw this movie, I did'nt immediately realise that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey, later on. The humor is sometimes crude, sometimes foul, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall, this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt, under rated. Well actually, its insane. Totally insane."

","BASEketball is one of the most bizarre films ever made. Obscure and forgotten, but I almost urge you to see it. It's so inconsequential, and counter-productive, and incredulous in it's existence. I can only make sense of it as the product of two theories that have been floating around my head as I watched it. Theory #1: (perhaps the most likely) David Zucker, having realized that Airplane-style parody movies were dead, attempted to make a late-90's, Adam Sandler-esque gross-out comedy and settled on the South Park duo when no other big name comic talents signed on to the project. Theory #2: Trey and Matt wrote a screenplay for one of their trademark surreal comedy ideas, realized they didn't have the financial means to create it themselves, and hired David Zucker to direct it for them. Whatever the reason may be, the Zuckers and South Park teamed up to make this, and their comedic sensibilities mix like oil and water. In one scene, it's just Trey and Matt goofing around with a camera rolling, in the next scene, it's a typical Zucker set-piece with sight gags cluttering the frame. It's an absolute mess. It's comedy gone awry... and yet, that gives it one hell of a charm. I laughed many times. More times than I had every right to. I love a good oddity. It sparks interesting conversation.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone are solid as Coop and Doug; I can only imagine they have acted in so few films is because they are busy with 'South Park'. Dian Bachar also impresses as their friend Squeak Scolari, who they treat fairly badly.

Aside from the laughs, I didn't find much to like about this movie. The main characters were a bit cocky and irritating to me. The movie of course featured a lot of sports scenes, as the title implies, but I wasn't captivated by them for some reason. I guess some sports are more photogenic than others. Or maybe the directors lacked the ability to create sports scenes that were exciting. Or maybe they just went on too long. I wouldn't want to ever watch this a second time, which isn't an encouraging sign for a comedy like this. There's a reason this DVD is probably selling for 99 cents at the bottom of a bin near a grocery store checkout counter somewhere."
"sol-","Null","0","0","12 June 2016"," Near Sporting Satire
","Two longtime friends responsible for inventing a new national sport attempt to keep their game pure and free of corruption in this vibrant comedy starring 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. While neither Parker nor Stone is given writing credit, the movie is full of their trademark vulgar humour and for those not easily offended, there are some truly hilarious parts. At least a quarter of the jokes are too silly or crude to work (particularly the nude locker room scene) but the majority of gags hit home with some especially funny moments with Parker and Stone oblivious to mayhem happening in the background. The film misses the mark somewhat as a sporting satire though. As much fun as it is to have Robert Vaughn as a slimy, underhanded antagonist, it never really works to have Vaughn alone represent everything supposedly wrong with the sporting world as he wants players to switch teams and locations, wants to make a profit from sports merchandise, wants to manufacture the merchandise under child labour, and the list goes on. Ernest Borgnine's acting talents are also never quite maximised, though he does make the most of his half-senile, ageing team owner with one of the craziest video wills ever committed to screen! The film's big plus on the acting front is actually Parker and Stone. The repartee and chemistry between the pair is undeniable and they genuinely come off as overwhelmed by their newfound success and fame, much like they were experiencing in real life back then as 'South Park' found a bigger audience than either of them ever anticipated."

","Most of the jokes in here are of the stupid variety. It could have been a funny movie but this is more miss than hit.<br/><br/>It starts off well with a somewhat clever plot about then invention of a new game - a game of horse with baseball rules. Oh, and there is also the novelty of one player doing everything he can to psych the other player out, making him miss the target.<br/><br/>From then on it turns into a parody of the old plot of greed vs. the love of the game. It is a pretty easy target but like in the game, the director gets psyched out and misses. There are too much emphasis on the division of the two friends, Remer and Coop, played by two less than stellar actors, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.<br/><br/>I realise that I am probably in the minority here but just felt that the jokes fall flat too often, especially with Matt Stone, who plays his character as if he doesn't have a clue at all. Watch the reaction from Robert Vaughn whenever he tries to engage Stone in his shady deals. Peter Graves in Airplane said some pretty outrageous things too but it was played more straight. Stone comes off as a raving lunatic which I don't think was intentioned.<br/><br/>As for Parker, he may have the right look for a movie actor, but he seriously lacks the talent and he is basically the whole show here. The supporting cast are left looking like idiots, basically letting Parker push them around. Yasmine Bleeth is particularly out of her league as a comedienne which of course makes Parker look like a genius. Ernest Borgnine is again embarrassed in a supporting part that gives him nothing to do but look stupid. I haven't seen an Oscar-winning actor sink so low as he has done again and again, in movie after movie.<br/><br/>Do you think you will get a laugh? Maybe once or twice, but this is definitely a movie that should have been heavily rewritten and they should have replaced Parker and Stone."

","When you expect this much from a movie, you get disappointed. There's nothing seriously wrong with `BASEketball' (the blind kid, the drinking session before the operation, the SF team) but you have to expect more from the creators of South Park and the director of `Airplaine!' and `Naked Gun' movies. This is an ambitious project, and it falls flat at being ambitious. Perhaps Trey Parker and Matt Stone should have kept faithful at the formula used in `Orgazmo': simplicity and sheer mockery. 	The plot: two losers enroll in a new sport that combines Baseball and Basketball (hence the title) and make it to the big leagues, and are seen as the ultimate sport heroes in a world where money and greed are in charge. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) are owners of that sport's most successful team, and have to fight against the evil in tempts of tycoon Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn). Meanwhile Cooper falls for social assistant (?) Jenna Reed (Yasmine Bleeth). Meanwhile Cain manages to corrupt Remer and Cooper is on his own to keep the sport genuine.<br/><br/>	Overall, it's not without his charm; there are some funny scenes, and famous faces roll up every time (which makes one wonder how some movie makers have so many friends and others don't)  but the final result leaves a bad taste in one's mouth."

","Baseketball starts out pretty well, with some funny gags, and I had high hopes for it for perhaps the first 10 minutes.  But 20 minutes in I was just feeling bored.  It would get a few good laughs in, then there'd be a dead spot for a few minutes, then some other funny stuff.  After half an hour I thought I'd see what people had said here, and people said it was sick and hilarious and outrageous, so I thought, maybe the sick outrageous stuff is just around the corner, and watched another 40 unexceptional minutes.  Then I gave up, even though there was less than half an hour left.  I just felt I was wasting my time.<br/><br/>Besides not being especially funny, this is also a very poorly conceived movie.  The baseketball premise isn't especially bad, but after showing the amusing process of creating it there's not really any place to go except the lame, purposely cliched plot that unfolds.  The movie is also a little too enamored of its stars.  Why are they the only ones able to do really creative psyche-outs?  There are no other clever practical jokers in the entire world except these two guys?  <br/><br/>This attempt at Airplane-style humour has about 40 minutes of material stretched out to an hour and a half.

These movies skewered the status quo with a full frontal assault on the popular culture.  Their brand of potty humor hadn't been seen before and it was a great guilty pleasure to watch.

There are a few laughs, but only a few."
"elshikh4","1","2","6","19 February 2009"," The American Hamburger when it Catches The Mad Cow Disease !
","Supposedly (David Zucker) is one of my favorites. His name was over so many so good comedies whether as a writer, director, or producer, such as (Airplane! - 1980), (Top Secret! - 1984), (The Naked Gun's series - 1988, 1991, 1994), (Brain Donors - 1992), or even (High School High - 1996). But the fact of him being the writer, director and producer of (BASEketball - 1998) is totally a disaster; it's the worst of him till 1998!<br/><br/>The basic factor to make you laugh here was the assumption that all the characters is gay, sexually gay. Look closer to understand the very easy method; starting from (Ernest Borgnine), to the silly sidekick, ending with the 2 leads themselves having a sickening kiss (even the cameo of Robert Stack!). This tone isn't the only truly nasty thing. In fact, the whole movie tries to be as die-hard dirty as it can be. And I just can't get it. Why to be dirty in the first place? Why addressing the animalistic side in the human, enjoying showing perverted people and matters, smashing art, ethics, and good taste all at once? These comedies assure something rotten with the moviemakers, and bring no less rottenness to the culture. At any rate, I don't accept dumping their trash into my brain!<br/><br/>The sad matter is not my own annoyance out of the name of a gifted artist being on detestable work like this, but also because the main idea was so smart in its core. The BASEketball sport could've been something creative, especially with the witty satire against the media or the sport industry, but the movie was dead set to not think at all while it deals with thoughtful issues. It was a good idea, however everything else was way lower. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be exactly: a buddy-comedy in the era of post-(Dumb & Dumber - 1994), a cartoony farce, a satire about the sport world. It managed eventually to be something too zany to stand, and too nasty to be droll.<br/><br/>Save (Robert Vaughn), who I've never imagined that I would like him one day and through a comedy, the performance was totally obnoxious. For little example, (Dian Bachar) as (Squeak) was unbearable to the extent that I hated every second he was in. (Trey Parker) looks terrible in this long yellow hair, and (Matt Stone) seems repugnant more than funny to say the least; actually, both as the leads were between weak and average. (Yasmine Bleeth) looked stray; they didn't try to make a laugh out of her ever. I think she's one of the real stars that were never given the chance to be a ""real star"", and she'll live the rest of her life appearing in TV movies, shows, or idiot movies like this one. It gets on your nerve badly when you watch the movie's posters, and find no presence for her at all. They put (Jenny McCarthy) instead??!!<br/><br/>Overall, there is a hilarious spirit, but the comedy doesn't hit the mark much. The real good parts are few and swift. The details in the background, like (Airplane) previously, weren't well-made, or made in the first place, it's some sign that this comedy was brain-dead itself. If the main point was making a vulgar, squalid, and emetic comedy, then (Zucker) succeeded. Here's what I wrote right after the viewing: ""This is paltry, crazy, and sick like a hamburger that caught the mad cow disease""!"

It seems to me that the only reason they would do it is so they could swear on the big screen. Trey Parker and Matt Stone may have some talents but acting cetainly isn't one of them. They should stick to their show South Park which I find hilarious. They have practically no screen presence. All in all the movie, although it does provide a few laughs, is a total waste of time.

Robert Vaughn seems a little constrained as the menacing rich guy, and Jenny McCarthy's first(?)attempt at film acting was pretty weak. The cameos--Bob Costas,Al Michaels,Pat O'Brien, Kenny Mayne,Dan Patrick and Reggie Jackson in particular--were quite excellent. To me, the determining crux to whether or not you enjoy this film is whether or not you can appreciate ""South Park"" because it,like this movie, very much bear the quirks of their stars/creators. In other words, if you don't care much for the antics of South Park or only like it in the usual,pedestrian manner that I've heard some enjoy that show, you probably won't care for this movie.

Nothing really too interesting happens and we are left with junior high-type antics that will only interest those with nothing on their minds and even less on their would-be busy schedules. 2 stars out of 5."

","You would expect more from the creators of South Park. This just smells lame American sports comedy, but of course with a twist. The sarcasm often used in South Park is a bit lighter and when they start bringing in their own characters voices in the film it feels like a cheap way of getting the South Park fans to laugh, like me.<br/><br/>But I still think it has some fun jokes and a pretty odd plot which makes a bit unique but it's still hard to like it when it's this glorifying, I can't find a better word for it. Things going in slow motion and orchestra music to make it pompous when it shouldn't. Rubbish. But pretty good rubbish."

","The term 'guilty pleasure' is one that definitely applies to ""BASEketball"". While I'll readily admit that the film is very stupid, juvenile and gross at times, it's also, in a VERY low-brow way, entertaining. So my advice is just turn off your brain and enjoy.<br/><br/>The film is set in the very near future. The premise is that pro sports have folded, as the players have become bigger and bigger egomaniacs--so much so that the fans have abandoned the games and the franchises have all folded. Two losers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the guys behind ""South Park""), create a game they play in their driveway. And, against the odds (and all common sense), it soon becomes so popular that pro sports are reborn in the form of BASEketball--a dopey game that defies description. Can these two lovable losers somehow manage to keep this new league from becoming just like the sports of old--commercial and cheap? The film abounds with disgusting an inappropriate material. You'll see Matt Stone shooting milk from his man nipples, animals becoming road kill (don't worry, they are NOT real animals), an amazing nude scene with Parker and Stone and some of the most disgusting and awesome kissing in film history. This is NOT a film for little kids, nuns or your mother!! By the way, pay attention for the very oddly specific music as Parker drives his VW. You'll know what I mean...."

","Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) are two likable slacker losers, who always thought they would have an better future for themselves. When they go to the 10 year anniversary of their high-school Reunion. They invited an game on the spot, which they called it BASEketball by playing Basketball with Baseball rules! When their unusual game has become popular on their neighborhood, an creative millionaire Ted Denslow (Oscar-Winner:Ernest Borgnine) wants to make BASEketball an real official game. Which Cooper takes Denslow's offer on the spot. Which Denslow promises the rules to be restricted with every player is payed the same amount of money and no players will be traded. Five years has passed and Denslow still kept his promise until Denslow dies on choking on a Hot-Dog! Which Cooper receives the ownership rights of the team on Denslow's will. Cooper does everything he could by making the rules strict as he can until his team-mate/best friend Remer is been listening to an sport businessman Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn). Which Cain tries to convinced Remer by taking an big money deal if he could convinced his best-friend Cooper by changing the official rules of BASEketball. Once the rules are changed, like any big Sports games like Baseball, Football, Hockey and others. The magic of the sport of BASEketball is gone and Cooper tries to bring the magic back into the game.<br/><br/>Directed by David Zucker (The Naked Gun Part 1 & 2, Scary Movie Part 3 & 4, My Boss's Daughter) made an entertaining, often funny comedy with some big laughs. Parker and Stone gives good comedic performances in this underrated film. Which Parker and Stone are best known for creating the hilarious TV Series ""South Park"". This film turned an major box office disappointment in the summer of 1998. Which it was badly marketed by the studio and not many people knew Parker and Stone. Which these two actors/filmmakers are much more known now than they were back in 1998. This film has an fine comedic supporting cast like Dian Bachar, Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy, Bob Costas as himself and Al Michaels as himself.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an featurette, music video, original theatrical trailer and more. Although VHS Version had funny outtakes after the end credits, which they are not in the DVD! This film has some solid laughs, a few memorable gross-out gags but it's Bachar as the tortured BASEketball player Kenny has the better laughs in the movie. The film turns somewhat flat in the third act. Many real-life Game Players in different sports appears in amusing cameos. This film will appeal to die-hard fans of Zucker's work and as well for fans creators of ""South Park"". This would have been an better movie if Parker & Stone had they hands on the screenplay but sadly they didn't. It is still an good if under-appreciated comedy. Written by Zucker, Robert LoCash (Naked Gun 33 1/3:The Final Insult, High School High), Lewis Friedman and Jeff Wright. (*** Â½/*****)."

","This movie is one of my favorites for many reasons including the ability of Trey Parker and Matt Stone to tackle any subject and present it in such a juvenile way that you can't help but laugh and say ""it's true."" It's only made better by the cameos in this movie made by big name stars like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Reggie Jackson, Bob Costas, Al Michaels, the list goes on and on. There is absolutely no down time in this movie. The is no scene that is strictly serious.

","Now I'm someone who isn't really big with the American comedies, I find them nowhere as good as the English comedies, their just not as smart and witty. This film is no exception, it is what I would consider to be dumb comedy with very little laughs, I may have found one or two scene's with a slight bit of humour but in all the story was very basic and there were no out of this world laughs. As stupid as South Park was I'll admit that it is still pretty damn funny, this is not as funny. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go out and buy it, it's just a bit of fun. The characters were very well created and almost made you want to be like those two idiots, until you remember that those two idiots with barely any money are actually multi- millionares. Kenny was a very well created character, how he is a small person so he is treated like a small person very poorly and he kind of take's it. In conclusion BASEketball is not anything i'd go out of my way to see but I suppose if your at a friends house and your offered to watch it with your friend you may as well but if your anything like me then don't expect anything special."
"Lt_Coffey_182","8","1","3","30 December 2005"," Absolutely Hilarious
","BASEketball is simply one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of South Park so I always knew that Trey Parker and Matt Stone would once again, have me in stitches. On the other hand, I didn't think they were going to make me laugh so hard that I couldn't breathe! It's obvious that David Zucker wrote the film with Parker and Stone's audience in mind as the plot and gags are very immature, but they are also very observant and true. The American Football celebrations for instance, ring true across many other sports and in this film are simply exaggerated. The plot as a whole is actually quite good. The idea of a game made up on someone's driveway becoming a professional sport is almost inspiring and the storyline between Coop (Parker) and Remer (Stone) is done extremely well. It isn't one of the most complicated or demanding of stories but you're not expecting Shakespeare when you watch this!<br/><br/>The acting is anything but strong in this film but it really doesn't matter. Parker and Stone aren't bad actors, not great either but they knew what to do in this film and it works. Robert Vaughn is definitely not at his best in this film but otherwise, effective as an obstacle character. Jenny McCarthy and Yasmine Bleeth are both pretty terrible in this film but they're both in due to their looks than anything else. The best acting accolade has to go to Dian Bachar. He is quite brilliant as the guy who's the brunt of all the jokes and gets ridiculed by commentators and interviewers. The jokes are visual rather than spoken so the acting made little difference in how funny the film is.<br/><br/>The jokes are mainly 'gross out' comedy, especially in the psych-out scenes which are all fantastic. I'm not always impressed by 'gross out' humour but it is done very well in this film as it is very original but not too disgusting to put the audience off from watching. There is also a fair amount of slapstick involved which is a lot more intelligent than someone simply walking in to things and having things drop on their head. What this film benefits from is the mixture of humour it provides. Everybody should be able to laugh at this film even if it's only a bit of the film.<br/><br/>Whilst not the most mature offering the world has ever witnessed, BASEketball is a hilariously funny, well written and fast paced film that entertains very easily. It is of course an acquired taste but anyone who likes comedy and doesn't take films too seriously will absolutely love this film."

","The world of sport has lost its meaning. Sports stars have lost joy and love of the game; caring more about the big bucks and the dealerships from companies. Its not until two friends; Coop and Remer create a new game that takes the world by storm. It baseball crossed with basketball; BASEketball. We have come to the end of the fifth Denslow cup and the Beers; Coop and Remer's team, have lost the game. Making it worse their owner how made Baseketball huge; Ted Denslow has died, chocked on a hot-dog. In Denslow's will the team goes to Coop; instead of Denslow's new wife Yvette. But the team reverts to Yvette if the Beers lose this season. Baxter Cain wants to change BASEkeball so that teams can earn more money, but Coop wont change the ideals of the game; where members cant switch team and they all earn the same amount of money. So Baxter and Yvette join together to make the Beers lose.<br/><br/>This movie has that great Zucker comedy to it; which made the naked gun movies so great. What makes this movie good is that there is this satire on the sports world; fickleness of fans, themed sports night - free range chicken night is just a brilliant idea. But the opening sequence has so much truth to it. Many sports lately have become more about the money and the spectacle of winning; it has lost the honor and dignity that use to make sports great, but now all the morals have gone.<br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone fit perfectly into their roles, its just tailor made for them. But that said the acting is nothing special, its so over acted, but thats the charm to it. The comedy runs at such an even pace, its constantly punching out great one liners and sick humor. Its just a riot some of the situations that arise; and the psyche outs are just awesome, some are so wrong.<br/><br/>This is a great comedy on the world of sports, though the satire isn't completely explored, its still makes you think about sports today."

There is not a great deal to comment about on this movie, apart from that if you're into comedy then this is a must see, David Zucker does a brilliant job of pushing the subtle and slapstick humour of Trey and Stone to the limit.

","When a sport played in front of their garage is picked up as a national sport Coup and Doug become professional sportsmen in a league where professionals mix with less professional.  When the owners of the Beers dies he leaves the team to Coup if he can win the next season.  TV executive wishes to gain control of the team and make the sport fully professional and more profitable and begins to work to cause the team to lose. This effort from the creators of South Park is a pretty hit and miss affair - unfortunately it's mostly misses.  I find South Park very funny and I thought the movie they did was great, similarly I love the Airplane and Naked Gun style of humour that David Zucker does so well.  So I assumed that I would easily like this.  The plot is unimportant in all these type of things - here it something about keeping ownership of a team in a meaningless sport - but it's the jokes that matter. Unfortunately many fall flat.  There are some good lines and some funny background jokes but the majority of it isn't very funny.  It's a shame because the funny bits are very good but I forgot them because the majority of the jokes are lame.  The best stuff are the background stuff like the team names (The Miami Dealers!) and a lot of the stuff that goes on in away from the plot such as commentators' comments etc.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty pointless in these spoofs, but Parker and Stone do alright with mostly poor material.  Ernest Bourgine doesn't do himself any favours and looks a bit stupid (I'm too sexy!) but some of the other cameos are good.  Robert Vaughn has a great role and gets plenty of funny jokes, in fact he appears to have got the best role of the film.  Robert Stack, so great as Kramer in Airplane, again has several good scenes.  The rest of the cast is filled out by beautiful women, Yasmin Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy etc, who don't really have anything to do.  Unfortunately at times the most interesting performances are those of the beautiful, scantily dressed cheerleaders at the baseketball matches! Overall a disappointment which is a shame given the comedy talents involved. Most jokes are mediocre with only a hatful of real belly laughs.  Worth watching - but even South Park and Airplane fans will be disappointed with this."

Yet for the uninitiated let me say this movie has it all as far as low- brow comedy. Solid gross-out humor, goofy sight-gags and a lot of locker room insults largely lobbed on Dian Bachar's diminutive character Squeak. Director David Zucker actually invented the game of Baseketball years ago and attached Parker and Stone by telling them they're going to make a Hollywood movie out of the stupidest idea he could think of. The ridiculousness of the story and the exaggerated relationships between the characters keep the rollicking laughs at an even pace which helps even the most cynical of filmgoers to overlook the film's shortcomings.

","BASEketball (1998): Dir: David Zucker / Cast: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy: Interesting idea from the creators of South Park. Vulgar comedy could have been a dreary sequel to Mighty Ducks or Major League. It regards a driveway sport where a basketball is aimed at a net and the opponent must psyche out the player to make him miss the shot. Trey Parker and Matt Stone render the game famous and play against other teams. Effective plot boils down to formula but its title suggests a combination of ideas and talents. David Zucker directs with fine comic inspiration but it is not in the same league as his Top Secret or Airplane. Surprisingly good performances from Stone and Parker who embark upon the pleasures and illusions of fame. We know where this is headed and their French kiss embrace wasn't needed. Dian Bachar as Squeak seems very funny but it is a cardboard role played as a dart board for insults. Yasmine Bleeth plays a sleazy female, which is about the height of her contribution. She is not interesting nor likable. Jenny McCarthy seems like fitting casting but even she cannot make her airhead character interesting. The film is surprisingly well made but not nearly as witty as its premise suggests. Satiric view of professional sports with colourful sets and a story that doesn't hit a home run but it crosses the finish line. Score: 6 / 10"
"RustyShacklefordd","7","0","1","3 February 2015"," Enjoyable Underrated Slapstick Comedy
","If you are a fan of South Park and Slapstick Comedies, you'll enjoy this movie. It makes for perfect viewing material for a night when you are looking for a simple comedy to watch if your friends. Trey Parker and Matt Stone aren't the greatest actors, but they share enough chemistry with each other that they make the film work. They bring their trademark raunchy humor that made South Park famous combined with the slapstick comedy of Zuckerman's comedies. Not all of the jokes work, but the majority of them do. As sophomoric as the humor is, the film actually is a pretty clever satire on sports culture. It's not as clever as Parker and Stone's other works, but it should be noted that they didn't director or write this film and remains their only work to date in which they haven't. With that said, the satirical element works fine.<br/><br/>If you are expecting something as brilliant and witty as South Park or Team America, you will be disappointed. But, if you are a fan of the duo's humor and other slapstick comedies, this is certainly worth a look."

Cannibal the Musical was a really funny movie even though it was obviously a very cheaply done movie. Also Orgazmo was obviously kind of a dirty movie with a lot of sex humor in it but it was still very funny and I liked it.

","This was a decently funny movie, but whether you'd like it would depend on your tastes due to the rather raunchy humor prevalent throughout the movie, though that was part of the fun. This movie deals with two losers who create a game-a hybrid of basketball and baseball-in their driveway, and it becomes a national sensation. Ernest Borgnine has a hilarious brief role in it. This movie is worth checking out if you like comedies and the stars and original ideas. I sort of liked it. Not for the easily offended though. I like the leads and Yasmine Bleeth.

Some of the jokes I do feel where pointless and had no reason to be in the movie. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone (Creators of South Park) do a good job of moving the story along smoothly and in the end bring you a decent story. It is a little vulgar and the language is mild.

"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","14 October 2011"," This is one simply bizarre movie
","Considering the makers of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are the stars of this movie, one can expect it to be quite sick and twisted. In fact it is as the humour ranges from foul toilet humour to absolute stupidity, which is the expertise of David Zucker, the maker of the Naked Gun series and similar movies. Unlike the Naked Gun movies, it isn't simply a payout of similar types of movies with bizarre happenings in the movie, it actually has more of a firmer plot, but it is still quite funny.<br/><br/>The main characters are basically losers who have amounted to nothing while all of their high school buddies are successful. Then they reveal to them a game that they play in their driveway, and soon more and more people become interested in it and it suddenly becomes a national phenomena. The one thing is that it is never to become like the other sports, controlled by money and sponsorship, but rather it is to be completely independent and played for the sake of playing a sport. The plot that emerges is rather simple, but it is simply there to tie the movie, and the farce that it makes towards professional sports, together.<br/><br/>Basketball is practically a payout of professional sports. The complex rules mimic all of the rules of the professional sports, and it makes a hard hitting comment about the commercialism of sport. It pays it out at the beginning and does the same at the end as well, especially when Trey Parker sells out and becomes a sponsored goon.<br/><br/>The movie itself is quite shallow and the theme very blatant, but what it does it that it shows us straight out the patheticness that sport has become. Unlike other movies, it doesn't pussyfoot around with subtle messages, but is very blatant and open about it. In the end though, it is simply an hilarious farce."

","OK, I'm sure this may not be every middle aged person's brand of vodka due to the fact that they may consider it childish and lacking a depth in the plot. However, for those of us who were born in the early 90s this film is the best comedy you will ever see. No clichés, no forced morals just straight up, legit humor. Sure some actors may seem a little out of place (Yasmine Bleeth), but what do you care? As long as there are consistent solid (South Park-esquire) jokes in every scene and wordplay so perfectly funny that will make you fall from whatever you' re sitting on. All in all this is the greatest comedy of all time. Not just worth a rent, worth a buy, and I can undoubtedly say that this is better than South Park. I 100 % guarantee that you will not get bored watching this movie as happens with many South Park episodes. It's just so excellent. It delivers 100 % what it promises, comedy, comedy, comedy."

"kevin_crighton","8","0","2","26 March 2008"," An almost forgotten, but very funny movie.
","David Zucker has made some funny movies in the past. Naked Gun and Airplane being the funniest. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are responsible for South Park, which at it's best is very funny. Putting them together, and you get one of the funniest sports parody movies ever!<br/><br/>The plot, and that's not really important is as follows : Two slackers (Parker and Stone) invent a new sport called Baseketball, a combination of Basketball and Baseball (naturally!). With rules involving psyching out your opponents by any means possible, it soon catches on through-out the country. When an unscrupulous owner of another club (Robert Vaughan) tries to change the rules, it's left to Parker and Stone to save the day.<br/><br/>The plot however, is merely an excuse for one of the funniest movies I've seen. Zucker, as he did when co-writing Airplane and The Naked Gun series, simply crams the movie with gag after gag. Some are visual, in the background while something more serious might be happening near the camera, or simply in the dialog which is hysterical. He also directs the material well.<br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone as Cooper and Remer acquit themselves well in the main roles. The supporting cast, led by Vaughan, are all good, getting the performances spot on. Special mention must go to Dian Bachar as Kenny 'Squeak' Scolari. The abuse he suffers during the movie gets a lot of laughs. I wonder if naming him Kenny was Parker and Stone's idea. After all, look what another Kenny goes through in South Park!<br/><br/>What makes this work, unlike Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Date Movie and such, is that it's not movie specific. Baseketball targets the sport movie genre, then crams in as many jokes as it can. Recent so-called parody movies seem to think selecting one movie to spoof, then adding other things in will work. It doesn't. Of course it also helps if you can get writers to make your movie funny too!<br/><br/>Baseketball seems to have become a forgotten movie. I can't understand why. It's funnier than more recent parodies, and shows how good Parker and Stone can be in front of the camera.<br/><br/>It's a very funny movie and one that deserves to more well-known!"

I was right. Although it's not a smart movie, it fulfills the main purpose of a comedy film; make people laugh. Every time a psyche-out would occur during the games, I thought I'd laugh so hard that I'd crap my pants. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have some of the greatest comedic timing of any duo on screen. It's ashame that the guy who played Squiek isn't in more films, because I thought he was a riot. I watch this movie at least once a day, and I still find it hilarious."

","I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor."

At times, the humor is *too* stupid, and just plain annoying. Every one of the scenes without Matt and Trey suck, and you have to wonder how funny any of it would have been, if they had chosen not to participate at all.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are still a lot of funny parts in this dumb comedy. The drinking of the liposuctioned fat, the ridiculous music, the roadkill special, and ""Squeak"" were all great.

This movie is great for non sports lovers too, probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting).

Never have I seen some many background jokes going on while the characters are telling theirs up close to the camera. One of my favorites is of groundkeepers chasing chickens on the field after a game on promotional ""Free-Range Chicken Night.""

","While many older viewers may struggle to see the humour in many of Trey Parker and Matt Stones low brow jokes in BASEketball, it is most definitely a laugh out loud movie for those blessed (or cursed) with a similar sense of humour to the South Park creators. The story is well designed to suit the combination of slapstick and toilet humour the movie presents, with the Baseketball sport the two leads Cooper and Remer create offering great opportunities for the best gags in the movie with the 'psyche outs' involving ridiculous and hilarious antics to try and make the opposition players miss their shots. In between is the token love story and a best friends have a huge rift then become best friends again twist, but despite using many cliches of the genre they are done in such a way that will have you in stitches, the make up of the two friends at the end of the film is one you will never forget, that's for sure. While a few of the jokes may leave you wondering what the two were on when making this movie, for the vast majority of the film the jokes hit the spot, and hit it hard. A great comedy from two very talented comedians."

How easily critics seem to forget that twenty years ago, tasteless stuff like ANIMAL HOUSE and CADDYSHACK were making them laugh.  In my opinion, BASEketball is funnier and more clever then those movies will ever be, it just lacks the pedigree.  Let's take a look at it.  Does it have gross-out humor?  Yes, very much yes.  Are there jokes about vomit, flatulence, various bodily fluids?  Yes indeedy.  But is it funny?  It sure is.  That's what critics seem to overlook.  The two leads, while uncouth, are appealing and have a great reparte with one another.  The film boasts some clever takes on the sports movie, including some great production design and some inspired moments of manic slapstick.

","Trey Parker and Matt Stone + David Zucker<br/><br/>The film is the story of two slackers going nowhere (shown in the opening credits at a high school reunion party). The sports world is at an all time low (also shown hilariously pre-credits) and the two slackers, Joe ""Coop"" Cooper (Trey) and Doug Remer (Matt) create a new game on the spur of the moment, BASEketball, using the rules of Baseball on a basketball court in an effort to win $50.<br/><br/>Over the course of 10 mins, we see how the game becomes increasingly popular-the first half of the film a metaphor (perhaps unintentionally) for Trey & Matt's shoot to sucess with South Park. Also features the line ""Now you're so popular you're gonna act in a Hollywood film? Sellout..."", an in-joke of course.<br/><br/>The game features the opportunity for some great gags-while the opponant takes their shot, the defense can PSYCHE OUT the opponant by doing pretty much whatever they want-the best involve a pair of pliers and ""Got Milk?"" (my favourite though was an audiobook of the Horse Whisperer, which sends the opponant into a coma...)<br/><br/>The film is good natured, well acted and very very funny. Although the film features many of the background gags that David Zucker's known for (it's very much one of his films), Trey and Matt's great performances makes the film. They are only credited as actors, but their improvisational humour is felt throughout the film.

"mar9","7","0","2","21 November 2001"," Live action ""South Park"" and it works
","Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br/><br/>If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since ""Bullitt"" and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br/><br/>For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone's rampaging pair of Cartmans.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the ""Naked Gun/Airplane"" formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film. America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge."

I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film.  However I'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the UK.  Sort it out boys!<br/><br/>I am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits, and occasionally snorting into my lager.

However I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices."

","David Zucker once again delivers a film worth a thousand laughs. This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  One reason it was so funny was because they decided to take the risky path and go for an ""R"" rating.  You do not see many ""R"" rated comedies anymore because everyone is trying to make money.  They do not care if the jokes are lame (ala Mafia!), they just do not want to rate it ""R"" because they will be limiting their audience.  I respect David Zucker for bringing us a movie with crude humor not meant for children.  Sure the movie won't make as much as it would if it would have been PG-13, but it sure keeps you laughing the whole time.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job in the film considering this is their first big acting jobs.  Nobody else could have played these parts except those two.  They work extremely well onscreen together and keep you laughing.  Between the cheerleaders, the cameos, the team names, the sight gags, etc. this film will keep you laughing and never let up.

Part of the humor of this movie *is* their character's stupidity, but it's not the old Beavis and Butthead stupidity, where the characters don't even know they're stupid.  BASEketball's characters seem like insightful, intelligent people who revel in wackiness with a witty edge.  Their spark of charisma gives a sense of awareness to their gags that makes them funny--they know some people will think their sense of humor is dumb and crude, but they don't care, they do it anyway.  It's not humor in terms of, ""ha ha, he cussed!""  It's how, when, and why they do it that makes the movie work.

","The only problem with BASEketball is it tries to mix in the standard ""We will overcome our temptations and tribulations"" plot that dots so many other movies.  The exposition is actually the slowest part of the movie. Fortunately, that aspect is so by the numbers, only minimal time is spent advancing the story, figuring the audience can fill in the rest.  That frees up more screen time for the hilarious gags.  The psyche-outs by the Beers are hilarious, and the constant riffs on the faux purity of modern sports will draw anyone in.  The sport actually celebrates poor sportsmanship.  The cheerleaders don't lead cheers, but act as open-air coochie girls.  The team from Dallas, recalling the extracurricular trouble players get into, is called the Fellons.

","The creators of South Park, bring us this lively and utterly hilarious comedy about two losers who invent a driveway game which soon becomes a national sporting event.<br/><br/>Trey Parker and Matt Stone play best friends Coop and Remer who's imaginative little game catches the attention of the U.S.<br/><br/>When the original team's owner dies, he leaves the team to Coop, who let's his team, The Beers in on ownership. However, the two friends must overcome the fame and infamy when their merchandising deals go awry.<br/><br/>This movie is orignal and funny. Plus, there's always something going on in the background to make it funnier.<br/><br/>Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy also join the BASEketball craziness, while other cameos include: Ernest Borgnine, Reggie Jackson, Robert Stack and Victoria Silvstedt.<br/><br/>Each and every scene is thought out and carried out well, but the highlights are the hospital scene, Robert Stack and the inventine ""psyche outs"". 9/10"

","I don't care if many (ok, most) of the jokes were raunchy and politically incorrect, this movie was laugh-out-loud hysterical.  Parker and Stone prove to be as efficient an on-screen duo as they are a writing team, even going so far as to crack a joke (more or less an insult) against themselves.  They were great in their roles because they are two genuinely likeable guys, even if their characters are immature and a little on the rude side.  This is a very funny movie for anyone who can handle a little good-natured grossing-out."
