","From an anime nonetheless.<br/><br/>Much has been said about this great animation and most of it is true.
It is beautiful, tender, modern (watch the film and you will understand) and makes human love interesting again.<br/><br/>With that said, it is too bad that Hollywood has picked this up. Not that I will be watching that remake, but I cringe already at the thought of Hollywood hack and remake specialist giving this an American swirl. All the cliches of bad remaking and safe corporate changes will be applied. Aaaarrrggghh"

","In a world dominated by stupid sequels, prequels and remakes it is film/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.<br/><br/>Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevant message. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.<br/><br/>Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa."

","Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out.

With that said this is quite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywood remake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie.

","Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It's a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years. <br/><br/>Director Makoto Shinkai's artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never ""just eye candy"". They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you're not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there's an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There's a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I'm pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me. <br/><br/>Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters' relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking. <br/><br/>Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There's rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.<br/><br/>Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It's so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn't even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece. <br/><br/>I know I sound like I'm fanboying, but as a film student and anime fan for many years, I'm being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10"

","I went in to see Kimi no Na ha without knowing anything about the movie. I had simply been intrigued by the movie poster with the comet as a background to two high school students living in wildly different environments - and the excellent reviews on its Friday release convinced me to see it just the day after.<br/><br/>Not knowing anything about the movie made me relish every single moment of it. The two main characters would, it seems, never have the occasion to meet each other, but through a mysterious circumstance are led to share some of their waking hours with each other. At first, the movie struck a compelling, funny and nostalgic view at high school life in Japan, love, friendship, puberty, teenage angst and some elements of mysticism. It felt like a very fresh and charming sentimental love comedy with a dash of depth and teenage angst. And it already utterly captured me at that point.<br/><br/>Yet midway, the movie veers resolutely into dramatic, and more mystical territory, while managing to keep the lighthearted tone it had reached during the first half at just the right moments. Together with one of the main characters, I was shocked and powerless upon learning of one aspect that had eluded both protagonists, as well as the audience. At the same time, a trope often used in science-fiction got thrown into the mix and the stakes suddenly get much higher, making me look back to the first half of the movie and thinking ""wwwooooowww I get it now"", while following the paths of the protagonists, which, just like the Kumi Himo (thread making?) that Miyamizu Shrine makes, represent time itself. Meeting, diverging, tangling, getting cut, doubling back. The second half of the film is a perfect adventure, full of suspense, humor, hope, and yes, tears. And at some points, it gets close to tragedy (one scene in a train left a huge lump in my throat). In some respect it reminded me of Spirited Away (my long time favorite animation movie), in which both main characters grow thanks to the other, and whose paths had crossed and would cross again, beyond memory or reality.<br/><br/>Saying more would spoil the movie, so I have been very, very vague. Suffice it to say the movie made me laugh, cry, get the goosebumps, and got me to the edge of my seat at some points. It really had great storytelling, pacing, characters, and emotions throughout. I loved it.<br/><br/>The visuals were also gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Tokyo is more real than the real Tokyo, and the director, animators, background artists, and computer artists seem to have devilish fun playing with lighting and getting some of the most beautiful scenes and moments I can recall in an animation movie.<br/><br/>I should mention the music as well, which was very, very good. I know RADWIMPS (I went to see them live a couple of years back), but was surprised at the tone they achieved, and how well it fit with the movie - the music, along with the visuals, really help in getting a full immersion into the story.<br/><br/>However, some of the most hilarious jokes in the movie seem to be untranslatable to English - in particular the ""dialects"" of the main characters, as well as a specific moment that makes use of several of the ways that Japanese people use to refer to themselves, depending on context and sex (watashi, watakushi, boku, ore). So I'm looking forward to seeing how those scenes will be handled in the translation!<br/><br/>I have since seen the movie one more time, bought the OST, and bought and read the novelization (which is almost like the movie, but does give more insight into each character's thoughts and thought processes.). Highly recommended!"

","In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.<br/><br/>And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.<br/><br/>This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.<br/><br/>It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).<br/><br/>I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.<br/><br/>All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other. <br/><br/>I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form."

But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: ""Why? Why aren't you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?"" Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?<br/><br/>This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before.

","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word ""city"" described all around him.

Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.<br/><br/>This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.<br/><br/>Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.<br/><br/>Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied.

This is a huge compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's' stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never forgotten.<br/><br/>The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.<br/><br/>Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with no qualms.<br/><br/>In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered for years to come.

"mushroompaper","10","93","136","9 September 2016"," It clutched my heart the entire way
","This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like a stereotypical ""boy meets girl, etc."" story... but from the beginning to the end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, only proving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie - giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. The chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing, animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own caliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, and imaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa was cleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical, balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","10","70","101","27 November 2016"," Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful.
","It's been a while since I've seen something outside of Studio Ghibli, being the most recent When Marnie Was There. I'm not familiar with Makoto Shinkai's work but this certainly encourages me to watch the rest of his catalog. <br/><br/>I knew nothing about the film until only the day before seeing it, instantly attracted to the poster and the mini synopsis of two high school teens from opposite sides of the country, who periodically switch in their dreams. <br/><br/>Gladly I didn't read anymore into it and just went to watch it as there's so much more to the intriguing story at face value. It's a little confusing at times bouncing between the two characters, but that doesn't deter the enjoyment and wonderment of the film. <br/><br/>We follow quiet country school girl Mitsuha voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, going about her daily chores and traditions in a village shrouded by folklore and superstition with mayor-elect pushing for advancement. All this while we also follow rough-and-ready city boy, Taki, voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki, who is no stranger to voice acting, starring in Spirited Away at the age of eight and later in Howl's Moving Castle. <br/><br/>The two become celestially bound to one another without fully understanding how, or even knowing who each other are, which leads them both on an adventure of discovery, comical annoyance and eventual romance. It's perfectly balanced between the two even with a number of interesting side characters, each adding something to the intricacies of the plot and supplying a lot of the light-hearted comedy. <br/><br/>The scenery and animation is stunning, vibrant and beautifully breathtaking; with blinding lens flares and gorgeous landscapes that fill the entirely screen. It's superbly paced, perfectly edited so not to make a mess of the constant jumps. <br/><br/>The score by the Japanese rock band, Radwimps is simply amazing, perfect for the film with a mixture of teeny pop/rock and pleasant instrumentals, with surprising tracks like ""Kataware Doki"" using soft pianos and strings. It's a score Final Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu would be proud of. <br/><br/>There are some films that are not meant to be for live action, showcasing the stunning craftsmanship and elegant talent of the skilled animators and artists, this being one of those films.

"boclani","10","44","69","8 December 2016"," why YOUR NAME is the best animated movie of the last five years
","Your Name is a journey about growth and having the ability to bounce back when thrown against overpowering hardships. It's a journey that focuses on human emotion that are larger than time and space. It's a journey of where we watch our protagonists struggle again and again against destiny. And it's one of the greatest animated journeys you will ever experience.<br/><br/>Watch the review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7v32c900F4 and / or read along here<br/><br/>Your Name follows a girl from the country and a boy from the city who have never met that switch bodies when they dream. <br/><br/>This movie may seem like your romantic-comedy body-swap situation. But it will surprise you how in depth the gets. The storytelling here is top notch, because you understand everything, but when you think about it, the concept gets quite confusing, but because of the brilliant direction my Shinkai, he somehow makes it understandable. <br/><br/>The two protagonists are the driving force of the film instead of Shinkai's normal eye candy visual sell outs. Within the great writing are actually some very funny and memorable conversations. The comedy works well to add another layer to the great chemistry between the protagonists. Props to the actors.<br/><br/>It was just so fun watching the dynamic feelings of these two and I loved how the two genders figured each other out while inhabiting the others' body. <br/><br/>I was a little confused when a lot of the first act is dedicated to the girl, without really seeing the movie from the boy she's swapping with, his view. But the movie surprised me when something happened to the girl and we see the boy for most of the rest of the movie. So actually the screen time for both protagonists were quite similar. That blew me away.<br/><br/>If you delve deep into his work Shinkai tends to break the forth wall often in the way he portrays emotions. He, in a way, makes you reflect upon your own life, and all his movies are really, really relatable. He makes you look back on dark times, times you don't really want to think about again and he says a different messages every movie. <br/><br/>A big part of the film was it's editing and sound design. This all helped with the immersion. Every scene is dripping with hidden details covered in immense beauty sugar coated with an outstanding soundtrack played by Radwimps.<br/><br/>And although the end is predictable, it did what 5 Centimetres Per Second didn't do. It left me satisfied. <br/><br/>What seemed like a stupid idea turned into Your Name. And it's not just another Japanese animation. <br/><br/>There are so many scenes where it feels like the Shinkai just pulls the rug from underneath you, like the movie doesn't always follow the normal routine. I felt so many emotions in this movie.<br/><br/>It grips you in that way and shows that every second in the movie and in life is important.<br/><br/>This movie takes every awesome element that Shinkai has ever used in his films and are all constrained into this movie. This film has jaw dropping photo-realistic visuals with beautiful Japanese voice work, great cinematography, laugh out loud comedy, gripping story, insane twists, looming soundtrack, heart racing action, unforgettable quotes.<br/><br/>But the best part about this movie is that it has very few mistakes. Everything is in the film for a reason. <br/><br/>Still, I don't feel like I've covered most of the points of why this movie was so good without spoiling anything. <br/><br/>But I can say that when I watched it, it was something special. Looking around at other reviews and forums, I have a feeling, that this will be regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made.<br/><br/>A+<br/><br/>10 / 10<br/><br/>Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA"

"imoosachi","7","36","57","11 November 2017"," A visually pleasing film with depth, but with little weight
","As an avid follower of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film had much to live up to, especially considering its deeper themes and the exploration of a different, more subtle sort of romance between two individuals separated by time and space. Unfortunately, this film turned out exactly as I expected and feared, with an interesting storyline and basis, yet the characters, dialogue, and overall crafting of the story itself detracted from the overall quality. I will focus mainly on the negatives in this review, as there are a plethora of other reviews that seem to only focus on the highlights.<br/><br/>The main issue that I had with Your Name was the script. Having seen it both in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and also dubbed (on my second viewing) with the English voice actors, I was really hoping for the proper brevity and gravity that Studio Ghibli so constantly delivers. However, I was met with the characters stuck in an endless loop of telling viewers what they were feeling, and especially in the more intimate moments of the film, where this could have been left more to the viewers deduction – if someone is crying for a particular reason, it is often best left for the viewers to decide why; the character does not always need to vocalise their feeling in order to convey them. For this reason, I felt that I had very little attachment to the characters in a setting where attachment to the characters was vital.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I believe that very little of the humour in this movie worked for the better. As I stated before, in a movie as heartfelt and intimate as this, the dialogue and the humour should be handled with the utmost care, and most of the time throughout the movie, I felt as if it took you away from the story – by all means, there certainly would be moments of humour when a boy switches bodies with a girl and vice versa, but humour was not the purpose of this movie, and this should have been respected.<br/><br/>One last, and slightly more subjective gripe, but I found the music choices to often be contradictory and 'annoying,' to say the least. I understand that the montage sequence, set to an upbeat pop/rock song is a common event in the world of anime, and having seen many anime outside of Studio Ghibli myself, I understand and respect this. However, with a movie such as your name, I found it only broke apart the emotional storyline, and in many ways, lost some of the viewers investment in the story. The piano sequence (the main theme, I believe?) was beautiful; why not exclusively keep the orchestral/piano score throughout the entire movie? Overall, Your Name was a very solid attempt at a very difficult premise, with beautiful visuals, a poorly handled storyline, and not much else. 7/10"

There are always flaws in every story, if we keep nitpicking the plot hole, they will never come to appreciate what a movie could offer to them.<br/><br/>People seems to forget the reason to watch a movie - to escape from our reality. This movie does deliver a moment for the audience to get along this amazing journey of Mitsuha and Taki. My wife and I try to solve the puzzle when the story continue to unfold, there were a few moment that we were able to put pieces together and see if the story goes as we thought. There were also moment we doubted whether the event will be different than it originally was. We hold our breath to see how the story will end, I was crossing my finger that the ending will be at least in some form of closure.

"kraytdragon-sean","10","27","42","7 April 2017"," Your Name Please!
","Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece."
"patrickbuiter","7","23","35","6 March 2017"," A beautiful piece of art, but the quality of the story is held back by Makoto Shinkai's ability to take that extra step,
","I think most of us can safely say that as far as pure direction and art go, Makoto Shinkai's popular new movie called ""Your Name"" has taken the world by storm. As of now, it has won several large prizes and it's praised by casual watchers and critics alike.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this is in fact one of Makoto Shinkai's most beautiful pieces of art as far as pure visual fidelity goes. That, in combination with its engrossing soundtrack just allows the movie to speak to the heart directly. This often means that people will refrain from criticising this movie, and i find myself being a lone bird flying in the opposite direction of all the others when it comes to this movie.<br/><br/>The issue i have with this movie doesn't lie in its art, or in its direction. It more lies within the lack of depth in the story itself. Makoto Shinkai is known for using repetitive settings in his movies, as they do tend to sell well.<br/><br/>I just wish Makoto Shinkai would have been a bit more creative in his writing, rather than making me think ""oh, it's this again. Not very original."" The story is confusing, but once i figured it out it didn't leave me lost in thought and i was honestly disappointed. <br/><br/>That being said, Your Name is still a solid movie with stunning animation and I'd recommend you try watching it yourself. It's not very long and it's definitely worth a watch purely because it looks stunning."

"pyrocitor","9","12","17","29 August 2017"," Hold onto that feeling
","Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy... <br/><br/>No, wait. Hear me out. <br/><br/>Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really. <br/><br/>But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary. <br/><br/>More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so. <br/><br/>If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances. <br/><br/>Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did. <br/><br/>-9.5/10"

"hcarljohan","10","10","14","29 January 2018"," Everything I want a movie to be
","I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of anime. Not in the sense that I particularily dislike it but rather in the sense that I haven't seen that many anime shows or movies. Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime? <br/><br/>And the answer was a thousand times yes! Your Name contains everything you could ask for out of any movie, not just animated ones. Romance, heart, passion, visual splendor, suspense, humour and much more. Many of these things have been lacking in most recent Hollywood movies as they seem to be getting more and more transparent in how safe they're playing it and how unpassionate their films are. I never thought to look to a whole other culture to find all these things that I've wanted more of for so long, but here we are! <br/><br/>Your Name is beautiful in every sense of the word. Firstly from a visual standpoint. By now I've seen quite a few Shinkai movies and they all look really great, but man does he outdo himself here! Every movement looks fluent, every colour is expressive and vibrant, every expression on the faces of the characters looks natural. The whole movies is gorgeous because of all of these things, but the final act is where it really pops thanks to the grand epic scale of what is happening on screen. But perfect visuals are nothing without a good story, and thankfully Your Name has it. You've probably heard that the premise is that a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha start switching bodies inexplicably. I think you should watch this movies with a clear mind, so I won't say anymore, just know that there's more to it than that, and the film takes many unexpected twists and turns. <br/><br/>Also I need to touch on the fantastic soundtrack by RADWIMPS. I wasn't sure if their music would work well together with this rather dramatic and lofty premise, but the music is such a perfect fit for the visuals and it always seems to exactly match the emotion that is being created by the scene. I have all the songs on my playlists now and I listen to them practically every day during my spare time, it's that good!<br/><br/>By the end of the film I felt like I had had such a complete experience. I had been laughing, I had been moved deeply by the dramatic scenes and I had been gasping at the visual spectacle. I really do not know how anybody could watch this film and end up finding nothing to like, it really does feel like there is something here for everyone. What I ask most of all out of any movie, is to entertain me and to move me, and Your Name did that better than most movies I have ever seen. It really did give me everything I could possibly want!"

"grossvisier","10","13","20","20 June 2017"," Close to perfection
","Let me say first that this piece of art is so impressive to me that I doubt that my words would be sufficient to describe how I feel and think about it. Therefore I will try to use an analogy, so bear with me. <br/><br/>But beforehand let me quickly mention that the formal and technical sides of this movie are very good - nothing to complain. There should not be any doubt about that. The drawings are beautiful, the animation is fluid, the colors are well chosen, the music is composed and played gorgeous.<br/><br/>Now regarding the content: To me personally it is nothing less than a masterpiece; no way around it. It is not merely a movie it is a piece of art like a poem, like a (metaphysical) parable. It is one of the movies that are enjoyable to think about because they are complete, because they are whole - like a an organism. If a regular narrative is a line this movie is a circle. (not circular)<br/><br/>The experiential aspect I can only describe by means of an analogy: like the tongue distinguishes a handful of tastes the soul distinguishes a handful of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, surprise and so on. Something could feel sad like something can taste sweet but that does not say anything about the complex quality behind that sweetness. Just because chocolate and bananas are both sweet does not mean they taste the same. Are you following?<br/><br/>Likewise not every sad movie is sad in the same way. It does not have always the sadness of the same kind, it can be of a well composed kind of sadness or of a cheap and poor kind. They taste different. <br/><br/>So applied to the movie I can say, without exaggeration, that I have never tasted such rich and well-composed emotions, feelings and thoughts in one movie. Such an exotic taste. Partially this move has something of a myth, it gives you a glimpse of the indescribable. In this case, in ""your name"", time and first love plays a role but again: in an exotic way I have never encountered before. <br/><br/>In conclusion: Any adjectives like ""beautiful"" or ""brilliant"" would only cause insufficient associations that wont do justice to that artwork. Just like you wouldn't ever be able to feel the taste of an exotic food or fruit by the mere description you got you cannot even conceptualize how this movies ""tastes"". <br/><br/>My recommendation is - taste and see that your name is good!"

","I overall enjoyed this movie, but after hearing great things it fell flat. Even if I hadn't had any previous knowledge of this movie I still would find it underwhelming.<br/><br/>PROS: A decent anime film for people that don't have anything better to compare it too. It's inoffensive/family friendly and enjoyable enough. The natural backgrounds and cityscapes in the film were gorgeous. Once you watch it you won't have to wonder what all the hype is about.<br/><br/>CONS: Some of the ideas in the movie presented themselves as if they'd be really complex and interesting, but everything played out in an uninspired way. The two main characters were supposed to be in love, yet there was barely any development there. We never really saw them get to know each other or understood why they even felt anything for one another. There are ways this movie could've done the soulmate trope without making the relationship feel under developed. Also I found the character design to be unappealing, and the random breaks within the narrative to deliver mini music videos seemed like a weird editing choice.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fresh emotional movie with complex characters and an interesting love story this is not it. Watch ""A Silent Voice"" instead. Or any Hayao Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>TL;DR: just okay, kinda nice but lacks real heart."
"titanicfusion","10","10","15","15 October 2016"," Great little film to watch if you want an emotionally engaging experience
","#Spoiler Free This film could very well be Makoto Shinkai's best film to date. The films excels in creating heartfelt smiles that can turn to tears at the drop of a hat and back again. Similarly to many of his previous works his stories may seem a bit generic and lacking, however this allows the viewer to really focus on the characters and the emotions between them, rather than being caught up in a twisting plot. We are also gifted with Shinkai's train metaphor, however this time unlike 5 cm per second, they show the protagonist journey diverging down separate routes and coming back together all while moving in the same direction to the eventual end of the line.<br/><br/>The two protagonists are Taki, a boy from urban Tokyo, and Mitsuha, a girl from a rural Japanese village. Shinkai takes to dull husks and embellishes them into a pair of protagonists with personalities and traits that make them relate able and lovable. The characters chemistry is extremely entertaining and really grows throughout the film<br/><br/>The beginning of the film succeeds in quickly establishing the characters and there morals, all while creating an attachment between characters and the audience. The films also succeeds in changing pace and direction as soon as things start to get repetitive, allowing the viewers attention to always be grasped and leaving them wanting more. The films fantasy spin keeps things fresh and prevents the film falling into generic slice of life clichés.<br/><br/>The art like all of Shinkai's other works it breathtaking, making the film stick in the minds of the audience for long after the films over. Thanks to the detailed artwork the locations and backgrounds are well fleshed out and eye catching making it seem like real life location and not a poor imitation. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is done by Radwimps, a Japanese alt rock band, that breathes life and emotion into scenes due to their wide range of styles and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Overall i enjoyed the film thoroughly. The fantasy spin really clicked with my tastes and caused me to be engaged and entertain throughout. I also quickly fell in love with the characters and their chemistry together and due to being a similar age related to them both. Thanks to it being one of Shinkai's more happier works i'm now left with a strong desire to watch it again."

","""Your Name"" took a while to get an American release but so anticipation for this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!<br/><br/>The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose lives are closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students who wake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and in their appreciation for each other by living their lives. <br/><br/>By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story and beautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keep its audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losing itself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautiful story that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud (considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy make this piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well as undeniably enjoyable. <br/><br/>The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen the trailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivating animation from the very first shot. <br/><br/>Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering it truly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been a part of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind of movie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity. Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe a bit older kids)!"

","THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE STORY. EVERYTHING ELSE (ART, SECONDARY CHARACTERS, ATMOSPHERE) IS GREAT.<br/><br/>A boy and a girl discover that some days, their lives are swapped, which they only remember as dreams afterwards.<br/><br/>You see the love story coming between those two ? Color me naive, but I didn't.<br/><br/>First, it's one of the most contrived premises you could have for a love story. Second, there's like a million stories you could tell with such a premise, why take the less original ? Of all the funny, awkward, insightful etc. things that could happen to two people who exchange lives, why go for the most clichéd ?<br/><br/>But OK, let's accept that they fall in love with each other. After all, a lot of the emotional impact of the second half of the movie hinges on their being infatuated with each other. But we're never shown that happen ! The most we're shown for Mitsuha (the girl) is that she takes an interest in Taki's (the boy) life. I guess it could count as both reason and show of her growing fondness for him. As limited as it is, at least it's a small hint that something's happening.<br/><br/>We're not so lucky with Taki.<br/><br/>After his date with his female coworker, she guesses that he's recently fallen for another woman. At that point I thought she guessed wrong, because nothing we see supports that idea. But I'm more and more convinced that she's conveying the message of the authors : at that moment, they're flatly informing us that Taki is falling for Mitsuha.<br/><br/>What do they say again in storytelling school ? ""Show, don't tell."" Well, it's a typical example of telling, not showing.<br/><br/>It's like the movie is trolling us : ""Oh, btw, Taki's totally into Mitsuha now ! A lot of stuff happened, but we didn't think it was worth showing, even though ALL we're showing you are those 2 very characters. U mad ?""<br/><br/>Just to be clear, I'm not saying that he has no reason for falling in love. He has plenty ! If you've seen the movie, here's a quick quiz. Taki falls in love with Mitsuha because :<br/><br/>a) he's attracted by her looks<br/><br/>b) he's impressed by her skills<br/><br/>c) he's thankful for her help<br/><br/>d) he remembers their first encounter in the subway<br/><br/>e) they're soulmates<br/><br/>f) any of the other bazillion possible reasons ?<br/><br/>You don't know ? Nobody does ! Because we don't see their love bloom.<br/><br/>As it is, this love story misses its core, its pivotal moment. It's a love story without romance.<br/><br/>Little annoyances :<br/><br/>Memories and messages appear and disappear so as to fit the plot's needs so perfectly that we have left the lands of Plot Convenience to enter the realm of Plot Laziness.<br/><br/>The second part is so clichéd that at any point you can safely guess what happens in the next 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Mitsuha convinces her father at the end in a deeply moving and insightful argument. Well, I guess, because we're TOLD, NOT SHOWN (uuuuugh)"
"luan_pettersson","10","12","19","14 April 2017"," Must watch for both anime and non anime fans.
","So I just had the pleasure of enjoying ""Your Name"" in the cinema and though I could share some thoughts.<br/><br/>(May contain very minor spoilers)<br/><br/>I've seen many movies trying to pull off the ""two people mysteriously change body with one another"", but I've never seen a movie doing a good job with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's ""Your Name (Kimi no na wa)"" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of all time, ""Your Name"" delivers us anything we could ask from it:<br/><br/>A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, with beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack; the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and mesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply touching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters are extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to the story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch of non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh while crying The movie's perspective constantly changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and it's not something you see very often.<br/><br/>For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for non anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!"
"lutman-david","10","12","19","19 January 2017"," I feel like I'm always searching for someone, or something.
","I might have found it.<br/><br/>I can only describe You Name as masterpiece a term that have only used for a small handful of films that I have watched throughout my life.<br/><br/>I've seen Shinkai's previous films which I really enjoyed but this is his greatest work so far. Forget the comparisons to Miyazaki because although Your Name is beautifully animated, has a wonderful score and weaves a engrossing tale it has little in common with Miyazaki's work other than the media - that's not to say it's any lesser piece of work.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer you'll probably think that this won't will be much different to other body swap films or anime that you might have seen, however Your Name is much more than that and deftly mixes various genres to make a very satisfying whole and everything about this film is pitch perfect.<br/><br/>The first act sets up the body swap scenario and this section is sweet, funny and charming. It really helps the audience to get to know and care about the characters while it also mostly sidesteps many of the clichés as the body swap is less about gender and more about city vs countryside, modern vs tradition, dreams vs reality and of course distance.<br/><br/>However as the first act comes to a close - just when you think you know where the film is going Miyazaki pulls the rug from under your feet with a twist that you won't see coming (despite some hints). Unlike most films where the 'big twist' seems tacked on or used in an attempt to make something seem clever, the twist in Your Name feels completely organic and deserved.<br/><br/>It's here where the tone changes and that kind of shift is really hard to pull off however Miyazaki handles it brilliantly, as the tone shift never jars against the first act it actually compliments it!. The rest of Your Name has an utterly beautiful sense of melancholy and longing which most films would find hard to equal.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal any more about the film as you really need to experience for yourself. Needless to say that the films visuals are gorgeous but special mentions for the editing which I thought was amazing and the score and songs by Radwimps which really helped the film find it's heart.<br/><br/>I don't often cry at films especially if it feels they are attempting to force an emotion from me. Beauty or genus tend to make me cry and for the last 15-20 minutes of Your Name tears streamed down my face.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, a must see! You don't have to be an Anime fan to enjoy this!"
"ctowyi","9","12","19","21 November 2016"," Watch this like your life depended on it
","For two whole weeks my students have been telling me about this anime, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), begging me to check it out. Over the grapevine I also learned that it is the first non-Ghibli non-series based anime movie to earn over 10 billion yen. So last night we did and I have to say it is truly one amazing entertainer with intelligence to boot. It was so good we felt so lost what to see next and so we didn't. We wanted nothing to ruin the unique experience. <br/><br/>I will spare everyone the synopsis and plot details because the experience of going into this totally blind is roller-coaster-fantastic. What I will just say is writer-director Makoto Shinkai took some great risks with the narrative and it pays huge dividends in terms of storytelling. This is not something you can sit back and let the story do all the work; you will need to constantly think about what you are seeing, as well as where and when it is all taking place. I love it when a director respects the viewers and brings the game to me. After the electric pace gender bending opening act I have no doubt that like me your mind will throw up the direction of what the narrative will take. You and I would be so wrong. I was gobsmacked at every twist and turn the narrative takes which subverts all my expectations. Shinkai also does a monster mishmash of so many genres that I didn't see when the romantic euphoria ended and when the detective procedural began. He even embeds an element of horror and melancholia. All through this widely imaginative ride he knows where the beating heart is - the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers separated by time and space. <br/><br/>Above everything else, the anime captures something so elusive so beautifully. By elusive I mean the temporal seconds you were waking up from a sweet dream, your entire being is still consumed by last night's dream and the memory of it immediately dissipates as you step into the waking world. However, the essence of the dream continues to envelope you throughout the entire day like a cocoon; you will try to hold on to the remnants unsuccessfully. Name one film that got that magical quality spot-on. Shinkai's Kimi No Na Wa got this right many times over. Everyone needs to grab your loved ones and watch this like all your lives depended on it."

"RoysR123","6","36","70","4 October 2016"," An entertaining film with gorgeous visual but mediocre plot with flaws.
","'kimi no na wa' is the recent addition to Shinkai collection which is a phenomenal success overnight but box office collection doesn't decide the quality of the film, the film like twilight earned in tons. Is it overrated?Yes,highly. Is it masterpiece?HAHAHHA,only if twilight is your favorite love story,on serious note just average.<br/><br/>STORY-First of all the plot isn't original, to begin with,I could relate a lot of work that gives close resemblance. Let's start with ""Ditto"" a Korean film where two people living twenty-one years apart in time able to contact each other through radio or ""Lake House"" an American film with the same concept but the time difference is two years and mean of communication is through letters. Bringing another work to notice, 'It's a Boy Girl Thing"" Where two individuals swapped bodies,adapted to their surroundings and over time fall in love. How does it sound? Finally mixed it up with Japanese settings and some unexplainable science fiction stuff,here comes the idea of masterminded plot for ""Kimi no na wa""<br/><br/>SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS IN SHORT-<br/><br/>SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS- (*) Promising start,entertaining to watch but nothing explain why they were swapping,they didn't even check the dates nor contacted each other for real,you didn't even care to look for the place where the girl is in neither the girl care to look for the boy. Plot convenience. (*)A strange girl gave you braided cord in train and you don't even know her,why care to keep it for three years?Plot convenience. (*)The relationship between the main characters were so vague,I know this is Shinkai's usual style but for a change I thought he'll give us something more but it turn out another cliché romance,I wonder if the use of word ""romance"" is right or not. Neither of them knows each other for real,just share the empty shell and experience each other lifestyle,suddenly feeling started to burst out from where? WOW. (*)The way he time travel back to save her,the way he convinced the friends in her bodies,the final execution to evacuate the village all feel so foolish and out of the line. (*)confusion of different timeline- It's the most complicated part,Mitsuha's timeline was parallel to Taki's timeline of three years ago,she eventually died over there. But the taki that had the body swapping and all the interaction with her is the one in the future three years ahead,so when he realized that he fall in despair and tried one last time to change the past and he succeeds in the most unrealistic way ever,anyway the thing is that what happen to two different timelines,did they merge or separated?we never got an explanation of that,it's like thing happens so let move on and observe the emotion not the logic behind it. If we bring the first couple of minutes in the film,we get a clear image what trigger the emptiness inside them,the feeling of missing something important in their life,it was since the day meteor pass by. -Taki in the current timeline never had the feeling before he interacted with her and even he had no knowledge of the meteor and stuff,he wakes up with vague memories in the mountain after the effort to save her whereas taki's of the different timeline was shown to have all the knowledge of the incident and even had the empty feeling ever since that day. For mitsuha,she might have more reference to what happen as in the ending,when taki asked her ""if they ever met"",the way mitsuha reacted to give a good idea of that. The emotions aspect can never overshadow such part. MUSIC AND ANIMATION-Stunning visual with shivering music by ""RADWIMPS"",literally the combination of this two somewhat make the the film enjoyable overshadowing the weak plot.<br/><br/>ENJOYMENT-I got a mixed feeling about this,I thought it'll make me laugh,cry and would be a whole different experience for me,I did enjoy in the in the first half but as soon it progresses,It felt like the plot was trying too hard and with all those illogical stuff going on,nothing much to say.<br/><br/>OVERALL-A decent film with pretty colors, the execution was good too but no near perfect, just above average.<br/><br/>STOP LETTING YOUR EMOTION GET THE BEST OF YOU AND JUDGE LOGICALLY."

They were quiet, save for a few ""wows!"" at the beauty and detail of the art in this film. <br/><br/>When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watched the credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back to their busy lives and schedules.

","Oh, and gorgeously animated.<br/><br/>I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.<br/><br/>Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.<br/><br/>Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.<br/><br/>Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name."

","The best way I can describe the quality of this anime is that, halfway into the view, I had to watch the end to make sure it wasn't a 5mm/sec thing. First: we find a perfect integration with the previous works, in a very gentle way. I jumped up when I saw the name of the Italian restaurant, for example, or the teacher... a zen garden of references. Second: it covers all emotions within the human spectrum of feelings. From funny to desperate to hatred. Amazing how the characters, and the plot, move so naturally from one state of mind to another. Nothing dramatic has to happen: it's all so natural. Third: the plot is original and unpredictable. ""You never know what you are gonna get next"". Fourth: sometimes it's not the devil, hiding into details, but perfection. This is it, I could go on for hours. This anime shocked me in a very positive way. Work of genius."

""Your Name"" is a feature film Japanese anime so it's for those who can tolerate foreign films and animation. And by animation I mean painstakingly breath-taking animation that goes from encapsulating almost photo-realistically vibrant sunsets to the slightest twitch in expression giving soul to the characters before us.<br/><br/>I'm not one to judge anime but I'll say this: of the little I've watched, never have I seen such detailed artwork, animation so real and voice acting so fitting that the characters are so alive that you genuinely wish that they were. The consistent top-notch animation, artwork, soundtrack, directing and even the voice acting was clearly done with love and care to the point that the finished film looks and feels like a passion project without a deadline striving for perfection.<br/><br/>Oh and it's not just looks too it's got brains as well.

The switching places plot device didn't seem too original, reminding me of movies like Freaky Friday, and was often just a basis for silliness. However, once the plot progressed past the cheap fun part, the plot gained some intrigue. It didn't quite live up to its potential in that regard, resorting to clumsily layered cleverness and random departures to create a feeling of ingenuity, when this was really more style than substance. Still, did make it fairly interesting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is a whole lot of trite schmalziness and empty sentimentality too, probably because the movie is aimed at the teenage market.

If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!<br/><br/>The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.<br/><br/>Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them."

","The animation in this movie was absolutely amazing ! Even though people may discount the movie since it's animated but I really recommended everyone to watch. Some parts were humorous, other parts mysterious but the connection that forms is so beautiful and unreal.

","When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. <br/><br/>The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used. <br/><br/>The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young."
"SquigglyCrunch","10","10","16","13 April 2017"," What Begins as a Cute Movie Evolves into Something Much More
","Your Name. follows a boy and girl who randomly begin to switch bodies, and how their relationship develops through that. <br/><br/>There's a lot more to this movie than I can say, because around the halfway point everything changes and it becomes much more than a simple feel good movie. And that's what it is for the first third. It's quirky, fun, cute, all that. It's not great, but it's really enjoyable.<br/><br/>The second that aspect of the movie ends the movie begins its quick ascent to one of the best movies I've ever seen. It builds the characters and their relationship well and by this time we're already attached to them well enough, but then something happens. There's a huge plot twist in this movie that, put simply, blew my mind. And moreover, made me tear up a little. From there on it just gets better and better, writing-wise. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't just have a great story though. For starters, the animation is beautiful. And it isn't just pretty paintings and scenery (though there are), the imagery is also unique in some scenes, where what is being shown isn't completely natural but it looks cool anyway. At the same time, it isn't just mindless artsy- fartsy crap, it actually has relevance and symbolism and stuff. <br/><br/>The movie's soundtrack proves to be quite good too. A song plays every once in a while, and all of them are well-suited to the movie and just sound nice. I don't think I'd listen to them outside of the movie, but I like them nonetheless.<br/><br/>Something that really stood out to me was how realistic it could be. Sure, it feeds off of plenty of things that would only happen in an anime world, but it doesn't rely on those. The characters act in realistic ways and say things you'd expect them to say, all without removing the anime charm entirely. <br/><br/>I always think it's cool to see a movie with a few confusing scenes, then see everything come together at the end, making all those scenes make sense. Your Name. has plenty of those. There are scenes that you kind of just forget about but then they come up again later and you realize that this was all thought out well before the movie was made, and it really shows just how much effort was put into the movie in the first place. It's clear that it's trying to be something more. It's trying to be complex, and it actually is. The movie isn't too terribly hard to understand, but it does require you to think at least a little to fully get it. <br/><br/>Overall Your Name. is an anime that excels in every aspect of it. The writing is fantastic, the characters are fun and lovable yet realistic, the soundtrack is well-suited, it's beautiful to look at, and it makes you think just enough that it isn't overly confusing, but enough to still make it complex. In the end this isn't just one of the best anime films, this is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to just about anyone."

"AlanGomezB","10","4","5","19 June 2018"," Your Name: An Animated Masterpiece
","Makoto Shinkai's Your Name is my third favourite animated movie of all time, only being surpassed by Kaufman's Anomalisa and Miyazaki's Spirited Away. It is a masterfully crafted film that tells a simple story that manages to be fresh, intriguing, and beautiful throughout the entirety of its hour and fifty-two minute runtime. Shinkai somehow takes an idea that has been done a million times and gives it a fresh, new take that hasn't been done before. Some people will call his films melodramatic or petty, but what some people see as pretentious, I see as a stroke of pure genius. I am not only going to discuss why I believe that Your Name is masterclass filmmaking, but why Makoto Shinkai is a legend in the works. Firstly, I am going to go over my history with the film, and my initial reaction to seeing it. <br/><br/>The first time I heard of Your Name was back in late 2016. I watched a movie review on the flick from one of my personal favourite film critics, Chris Stuckmann. I've always respected him and trusted his opinion, as we share the same fondness for movies and have a similar taste in film. I was quite surprised when he gave Your Name his highest score, an A+, and recommended it highly. I was very intrigued by his synopsis of the film and immediately sought it out. To my dismay however, I could not find the screening for the movie anywhere. Since I couldn't go see it in a theatre, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the movie, which was in April. I put it on my IMDB watchlist and patiently waited until I got my hands on the film and got to finally watch it. I didn't know much about the film going into it, although I was excited to see it, I deliberately kept myself as far from marketing and discussions on the film as I prefer to go into a movie as blind as possible. When I did get to see it, not only did Your Name meet my expectations and live up to the praise, but it did something more. Something else I didn't expect it to do. It wasn't only a good film, it was a phenomenal one. My hopes for the movie were quite high, and it still managed to be even better than I originally thought.<br/><br/>Your Name starts with a fantastic scene that hooks the audience immediately after the movie starts. It's a scene that on first watch doesn't really make any sense, but upon revisiting, the movie, it is foreshadowing for the twist and end of the movie; the end is in the beginning. The next scene follows a girl going through her daily life, but everything seems off. Even though you've never seen this character, you still understand that there is something strange happening from hints from other characters and the girl's reaction to them. Shinkai puts the viewer inside of the shoes of this girl, in which we are in the same confused state as this girl. This makes the first scene feel like a dream which I am pretty sure is what he intended. The same scene is repeated, but instead it is a boy. We eventually learn that the boy (Taki) and the girl (Mitsuha) are actually swapping bodies, and they try to live their lives as the other person would want them to but there are conflicts. This makes for some really inventive and unique humour that gives the film levity. Later in the flick, the plot twist is revealed and it really works since it is not only creative and unexpected, but as handled really well. You feel the impact of those events on the characters, as well as the audience itself. On paper, this film has been done before, but execution-wise, this movie really nails it. <br/><br/>Your Name is an idea that we have seen time and time again, but thanks to Shinkai, it has been done fantastically. Everything about this movie is great, from the animation to the cinematography. I'm going to go over why these things and are as great as they are. Firstly, the animation. This one is pretty self-explanatory once you see the movie. Every single shot is drawn gorgeously, especially the scenery. Shinkai is proven time and time again that he knows how to make some great looking backgrounds, and this film is no exception. This movie uses both hand-drawn and CG animation, and they are both used expertly. There isn't a single frame where I thought they were being lazy or not trying, the animation is on par with something like Studio Ghibli. Everything from the character designs to the scenery, looks phenomenal. Secondly, the story. I've already gone through it, so I won't say much other than it could have been a terrible movie, but thanks to Shinkai, it doesn't suck total balls. Next, the cinematography. The cinematography was pretty good in this movie. Even if it didn't blow me away, it was still really good looking. There were a lot of interesting shots in the film that weren't just for show, but actually had some meaning behind them. I really enjoy when directors add those few extra layers for film fans to dissect. That brings me to my next topic--the hidden meanings in the movie. As a big movie fan I love having more to chew on after the movie is over, and having to rewatch it to get everything. Some of my favourite movies are The Holy Mountain and Synecdoche New York, films that have tons of symbolism and need multiple watches to get everything. However, you can still enjoy these movies even if you don't understand everything, which is why I love them so much. Your Name may not be as deep as these movies and have as many layers as those movies, but it still has enough that analysing the movie is still a fun task. Finally, the score and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking in this movie. This is one of my favourite japanese musical compositions in a movie since Hausu. I adore the music used in this movie and listen to it constantly. The music was done by a group called Radwimps, and although I haven't listened to their other music, I definitely want to check them out at some point. Those are the best parts of the movie. I didn't cover everything like the voice acting or characters, but that's because, though they were also good, they weren't as great as the other aspects of the movie. Nevertheless, there is still one more thing I would like to cover, that being the man behind the camera, Makoto Shinkai.<br/><br/>Makoto Shinkai is an absolute madman. He went from making short films by himself to directing feature-length movies in the span of just two years. For comparison's sake, Hayao Miyazaki worked in the business for almost 20 years before his first feature. Shinkai isn't just really lucky, but also very talented and creative. All of his work that I have seen of his been pretty outstanding, even though I haven't seen all of his work. I really enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, but I especially really liked both 5 Centimeters per Second and The Garden of Words. I still have yet to check out The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, but they are really high up on my IMDB watchlist and I am really looking forward to watching them. People say that Shinkai could be the next Miyazaki, and to that I say, ""Yeah, maybe."" Even though he's not currently working on a new project, I seriously can't wait to see what Shinkai cooks up next.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece in terms of film making and if anyone other than the man himself crowned the director's chair, it probably wouldn't be nearly as good as it was. In short, Makoto Shinkai is a goddamn legend."
"ryan-wackyraces","10","4","5","3 May 2018"," Might be the greatest film I've ever seen
","(this is my review originally from myanimelist.com)<br/><br/>Having never really seen any Anime before watching this movie (except from Pokemon and Dinosaur King when I younger), I didn't really have any expectations going into this. My family have a subscription to Amazon prime, and 'Your Name' was on there for free. Expecting at least a decent watch, what i saw instead was a Masterpiece in cinema, that I'll no doubt continue to love more and more as the years go on as I re-watch it.<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>The story starts out as a typical 'Slice of Life' kind of thing, except the main 2 characters from separate areas of Japan start swapping bodies with each other. Anyone who sees a DVD or Blu-ray of this movie knows this. But, something unexpected happens which tips the story on it's head and drives up the suspense and mystery. Don't read up anything about the plot. It leaves a lot of questioning and wonder which makes for an engrossing plot leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>Art:<br/><br/>The art style is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. As an artist myself, I love seeing beautiful art, no matter what the medium is. The colors are vibrant, there is a lot of contrast in light and dark shades, the light sources are very realistic, which makes everything shine and glisten. The character designs are among the best I've ever seen, as they are simplistic, yet still contain plenty of detail so the viewer is never left wondering what a certain object is. The animation is very fluid, but can also become very rigid when it needs to.<br/><br/>Characters: <br/><br/>This is probably my favorite aspect of 'Your Name'. I fell in love and related with the characters so much and if anything tense or bad happened to them, I felt their pain and wanted nothing more than to see them pull through and come out the other end fine. Never in any kind of movie (live action, animated) have I ever felt this way about any of the characters, and that really says a lot of about the writing and voice acting. These aren't even physical people on the screen, and I'm getting worked up about them like I've known them for years<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>I've been listening to the music quite a lot recently, and it's really beautiful. Mesmerizing piano melodies, soulful string sections, with even some playful chords and melodies to match the more lighthearted and playful parts of the movie. It even has 2 original J-Pop songs that I've been really enjoying as of recently.<br/><br/>Enjoyment:<br/><br/>As you can probably already tell, I'm in love with this movie. I've never loved a movie's characters and plot as much as this. The plot takes many twists and turns, but never strays away from the true message of the film, and keeps you on your toes and keeps you hooked and in love with the whole package<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema and rightfully deserves all the awards it's received. This is a movie that has nothing wrong with it. No flaws or things I wish they'd done differently or better. I'm looking forward to more re-watches of the movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","4","5","12 March 2018"," Wistful, poignant and ultimately uplifting; beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive.
","There's a distinct and slightly jarring protagonist switch just far enough in for you to really notice it, but it's a testament to 'Your Name (2016)' that - though it could have been ironed out relatively easily with some structural smoothing or a slightly simpler two-handed approach - this is perhaps its only real issue and it isn't even all that detrimental, considering that it allows us to develop a proper emotional connection to both leads from an internal perspective, actually mirroring the fantastical conceit driving the beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive narrative. The piece is a joy to watch and takes a number of turns that are genuinely unexpected. It's a wistful, soulful and poignant experience that's also an entertaining and, ultimately, uplifting one. It does seem to say something quite profound while always managing to delight and mystify with its deftly handled story and properly stirring themes. 8/10"

Although I watched the Spanish dubbed version, the dialogues kept the main essence of the story and the characters delivered a wonderful performance.

It's certainly overrated. Sadly, it's a total waste of visual resources. Hadn't it been for its popularity, I would already have forgotten about it.

"themadmovieman","8","12","21","28 September 2016"," A beautiful experience with an astonishing finale
","This is a very good film, but it takes a while to reach that level. Although providing an entertaining fantasy first act revolving around the pair's body-swapping, it takes a good fifty minutes for the film to develop into something truly great. Moving from enjoyment to stunning emotion, Your Name is ultimately an enthralling and powerful tale, one told with great visual beauty from Makoto Shinkai.<br/><br/>Shinkai, the director and writer of the likes of The Garden Of Words and 5 Centimeters Per Second is being dubbed as 'the new Hayao Miyazaki' by his third fantastic outing with Your Name. Undoubtedly, Shinkai is on a very similar level to Miyazaki when it comes to his visual style. Mixing the images of classic landscape paintings with some exceptional photo-realistic macro-focus shots, there's no doubt that Shinkai is a master of anime when it comes to pulling off pure visual beauty.<br/><br/>Also, the second half of the film is evocative of a great Miyazaki picture. I'll get into the specifics of the latter half in a minute, but suffice to say at this point that Shinkai definitely has the ability to match the likes of the great Miyazaki when it comes to bringing across both blissful and devastating human emotion, something that's always even more powerful in animation.<br/><br/>Before I get into that, however, I want to talk about the first fifty minutes of Your Name. Initially, the film shows real promise with the way it handles the body-swapping genre. Rather than solely making silly comedy out of the situation, it's full of some fascinating and brilliantly original ideas, cleverly blurring the line between the teenagers' dreams and anxieties and the real world.<br/><br/>When the film is more dramatic and thoughtful, it's always engrossing, testament to Shinkai's expert writing. Unfortunately, there are moments that really stick out like a sore thumb, and prove the reason why Shinkai isn't yet quite up to Miyazaki's level.<br/><br/>For one, there are some striking tonal inconsistencies throughout this film, particularly around the half-hour mark. Frustratingly, there are about two or three musical montages throughout that make the film feel like a TV movie, and each time they appear, they're more and more jarring, proving a hugely disappointing break in the film's generally impressive elegance.<br/><br/>I understand that Shinkai has his own style, but his previous films haven't ever used so many of these montages. They're frustrating to see, and as they're all book-ended by awkward fades to black, they are undoubtedly the worst moments of the entire film. Happy, lightweight and enjoyable they may be, and they would definitely work in another movie, however they prove so inconsistent with the film's best tone that it really sticks in your mind.<br/><br/>Despite that, the following hour or so is spectacular. Stepping up from an interesting but not always emotionally riveting first act, Shinkai dramatically turns the film into an emotionally stunning and powerful experience, with so much poetic elegance and sheer unpredictability that you can't look away from the screen.<br/><br/>It's difficult to discuss the second half without spoilers, but the way that the film manages to grab you so much by taking such a drastic turn, moving away from the fantasy of the body-swap to an incredibly human and tender story, Your Name is definitely worth the wait to get to the best bit.<br/><br/>Overall, I was hugely impressed by this film. It may not have the most consistent opening act, but the way that the film does provide some amazingly thoughtful and ultimately emotionally powerful moments is truly spectacular. Coupled with Makoto Shinkai's incredible visual style, Your Name is a fantastic movie, and one that definitely reaches near the legendary heights of Studio Ghibli."

","After years of browsing this site, I finally broke down and registered so I can share my opinions with strangers who probably won't care about or even read what I write. But then again, in the past I've used these reviews to help make a decision whether to watch or pass on certain movies. As the best movie I've seen in years, Your Name seemed like the right one to start with. I'm not going to attempt a technical, elitist analysis, as I'd probably just end up sounding like a pretentious moron. I'll just try to hit some key points.<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, there's only about 3 directors that I consider myself a fan of, and Makoto Shinkai is one of them. I've seen all his films and enjoyed them to various extents. Your Name is different from all his other movies and, I would say, is his most complete film. The most notable difference is the tone. Whereas most of his works are much more somber, this one has a lighter, comical side that offsets the deeply emotional moments making it more accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>To be fair, this movie has some flaws. There's a few logical gaps that you just have to ignore for the movie to work. The main characters aren't overly interesting in their own right, and few, if any, of the side characters are developed throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, what this movie does well, it does exceptionally well. It is definitely a story-driven piece and the story is deep, interesting, and well-told. I'm not going to mention anything approaching a spoiler. I went in with almost no knowledge of the plot and had a more rewarding experience because of it. I will say, though, that if the first 30 minutes or so seem a bit silly for your taste, stick with it. It gets better.<br/><br/>For those wary about getting into anime, this is a good one to test the waters with. It's absolutely nothing like the bits of Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z you may have accidentally glimpsed over the years. I've seen both the Japanese version with subtitles and the English dubbed version. If possible, it's always better to watch a movie in it's original language, but I know not everyone can handle subtitles. The voice acting for the English dubbing is passable. It's not perfect, but it probably won't ruin the experience for you.<br/><br/>I tried to be as objective as I could in rating this movie, but there's really no such thing as true objectivity with something so emotionally driven as the film industry. This movie is a personal 10, but I feel that 8.5 stars (rounded up to 9) is an accurate rating. <br/><br/>So, anyone reading this who is on the fence about watching this movie, here's one more random person urging you to give it a try."

I hadn't so some of the stuff came as a surprise but there is a lightness at the beginning of it, which switches or changes gear throughout the movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""forget Disney"". There's a different audience and a different feel to this movie for sure, why not have both? Instead of viewing something negatively take in the positive.<br/><br/>Animation is not everyones cup of tea, but if you have no issues with it, this is quite the ride with two characters and a lot of fantasy and drama thrown into the mix. It really is something and the repurcussions are felt ... and heavy"

","When I first saw Your Name, I enjoyed it for the most part. I thought the pop music montages and dialogue were pretty cringey, but overall the film was visually and atmospherically impressive enough for me to fall for it.<br/><br/>After a recent rewatch, I was actually shocked at how emotionally manipulative and utterly devoid of substance this movie really is. I'll break everything down for this:<br/><br/>The body swapping is a fairly generic idea, but they could have done a lot with it. Unfortunately it fails on so many levels to further cement the idea of the two protagonists exploring each other's lives and personalities, and instead the movie tricks the viewer into thinking that this actually happens. The two leads never learn about each other's lives from swapping bodies on any emotional level, instead those cringey montages that I mentioned before gloss over this important aspect that should have been more properly handled. This is also extremely problematic since we're supposed to believe that Taki and Mitsuha actually fall in love with each other, but we never find out why. They don't learn anything from living as the opposite gender either, in fact the story relies on breakage of character for comical effect. For example, the normally androgynously behaved and chilled-out Taki acts like a sporty, aggressive, manly-man while in Mitsuha's body.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The second half of the movie is just as disastrous as the disaster it depicted. Not only does it abruptly drop the comedic tone of the first half of the movie, but it handles disaster and loss rather badly too. It relies far too heavily on the protagonists making dumb decisions, wasting time complaining about nothing, retardedly running around for no reason, and idiotically forgetting each other's names. All this is made even more unbearable by yet another wave of godawful pop music montages and cringey dialogue. <br/><br/>In the end there's no emotional loss in Your Name. There's no sacrifice, no learning from your mistakes, because in the end the protagonists just reverse the timeline and save the day. But now they've forgotten about each other forever? Surely there's a bittersweet ending? Nope, they get reunited and live happily ever after in the end, that's what happens. That time wasting ordeal of running around and forgetting each other's names meant nothing in the end.<br/><br/>Even though there are also many MANY plot holes that I didn't mention, Your Name's number one issue boils down to the atrocious writing and badly thought out story and characters. I still adore the film's visuals and immersive atmosphere, but it simply falls flat as a story."

","A comet is approaching. Mitsuha Miyamizu is a 17 year old high school girl in the small town of Itomori. Her dad is the mayor and she's tired of her small town life. Her friends complain about her behavior the day before but she doesn't remember. She wishes to be reborn as a boy in the big city. Her wish comes true as she wakes up in the body of high school student and part time waiter Taki. It's like a dream as they inhabit each other's body.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful. The story is imaginative. The characters are lovely and compelling. There is magical realism to the movie. The plot does get a little jumpy which does fit the style. I would be more interested if it's cleared up a bit more. The movie climaxes at the impact and it drags out the ending a bit. Taki should have encountered Mitsuha at that point. Her father could be dead and she would be on top of the hill tending his grave. The searching in Tokyo is poetic for a little while but at some point, I just wanted it to end the movie and the ending is never in doubt."

I've watched so many different genres of movies in my life, and I could say even out of all those genres's greatest, this movie stands out! The feels, chills, and excitement just flowed right through my heart! And if you measly rate this 8 out of 10, most probably you don't appreciate the fantasy created and you live in a world where you need facts and data. Well I pity you. Blends perfectly with everything! The music, the timing, characters, scenery, outstanding and beautiful characters, story line is perfect. Everything, at its best! The details and well versed story made it even greater. Feels so realistic at the same time, since the fantasy used isn't much different from the society we know today. Time is a very complex, labyrinthine concept. And which we humans do not understand all of it. This story just showed us everything is possible through time. Very astonishing, indeed."
"dewiedolan","5","14","28","8 December 2017"," Regularly entertaining
","I am very conflicted with this film. <br/><br/>On one hand I liked the technical aspects of it: it's music, color, scenery and amazing animation. All of that is good. <br/><br/>On the other, I didn't liked the story, for me it was too forced and melodramatic. Of course not all of it is bad, the characters were OK and some moments were entertaining. But when I look back at the film, the bad moments overshadow the good ones. <br/><br/>I think that my main problem is that the ""fantastic"" aspect of it was used as a plot device. It gave the movie a good premise but it also took a lot of fun from it. For me, it felt that it didn't had rules, that the movie was just inventing something new all the time and improvising its own plot. They didn't even gave an explanation for many of the things in the film.<br/><br/>Another think I didn't liked is that it feels like this movie is manipulating you into crying. Of course, every movie manipulates us in a certain way. But here it is very obvious, this is proved by its use of very melodramatic music and constant uses of over dramatic monologues. <br/><br/>I didn't hated this movie, I just thought that it wasn't as good as it could have been. Kimi no na wa had an interesting premise but its story is what holds it from being good. Maybe if it was told another way, for example like a mystery, it could have been better."

Makoto combine sci-fi and drama to bring affection, love, tension, and thrill. By its form YN is incredibly complex. It plays the plot forth and back and connect it slowly but surprisingly impetuous.

","To be sure, ""Your Name"" is now at a domestic B.O. of $140 million among the 50 most successful traditionally animated films of all time, it establishes Makoto Shinkai firmly as the new great hope of animated film, and it does feature the most brilliant lighting effects ever produced. If you don't know any previous works by Shinkai and his company Comics Wave, chances are you'll be blown away. If you are, however, familiar with his work, you may catch yourself wondering what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>There isn't anything new here - the intertwined time-lines were the main feat of his ""5 Centimeters per Second"" (2007), and the asteroids and fantastic themes dominated his debut feature ""The Place promised in our early Days"" (2004), which I personally hold to be his best work.<br/><br/>Why then this sudden enormous success? Well, Miyazaki has stopped directing, and Ghibli has been on hiatus for two years. The equally brilliant Mamoru Hosoda's films have topics more domestic to Japan, and because of this his latest film ""The Boy and the Beast"" had only a limited US release. I'd still say that his ""Wolf Children"" (2012) and ""The Girl who leapt through Time"" (2006) are far superior to Shinkai because of their complex story lines, and because you can watch those over and over again. His style is also more reminiscent of Miyazaki.<br/><br/>But right now, it's Shinkai's hour, and to be sure, it's well deserved that he finally gets so much international exposure. Only I very much doubt that he will be able to replicate this success, because the novelty first-time viewers may experience now will surely wear off if he sticks to his well-established themes."
"remyjaudoin","5","11","22","9 January 2020"," I have to say it
","I don't think ""Your Name"" is a bad movie. But for the life of me, I never understood how it has become so popular. As it grew in popularity, it became more and more frustrating for me everytime I say I didn't like it because it felt like I needed to defend my opinion. ""How could you not like this movie?"" Well I'm not sure, I only saw it once and I couldn't force myself to watch it a second time to better understand the reasons of my dislike. I remember the gist of the story. And I remember my overall feeling of disappointment after seeing it. I thought it was clichÃ©, stereotypical, predictible and sometimes nonsensical (I'm not talking about the fantasy elements, just some of the characters reactions that felt absurd). I remember shaking my head many times throughout the movie. Of course, the animation is gorgeous, but i found nothing really poetic about the story and the jokes didn't land for me. I thought the characters were too one-dimensional (which I think was exactly the opposite of what the movie was going for, especially in terms of gender norms). But in the end, I wouldn't be able to pinpoint and tell you exactly what I didn't like about it, first because I don't remember it that well, and second because I feel like sometimes you just don't like things for no obvious reason.<br/><br/>That said, I don't have anything against it, I just feel left out from everyone who absolutely loved this movie, to the point of crying while watching it. I really enjoy well-done traditional animation too, so I wanted to love this movie. Makoto Shinkai had been sold to me as the ""new Miyazaki"", which I think is a weird connection to make (and I think even Shinkai agreed in an interview that it was absurd to call him that).<br/><br/>In the end, I hope I'll have the strength to rewatch this movie one day, and maybe either change my opinion of it, or find out more specifically what I didn't like about it."

","I, like a good number of others, went into this expecting, not only from the look and feel, but also from the story portrayed in trailers, a similarity to certain other romantic works in terms of style (5 Centimeters per Second, Clannad). And on this account I was not disappointed. The artwork, animations, backgrounds, and lighting effects hold up to all of those other works. For the beauty alone it is worth the watch.<br/><br/>The romance aspect did not quite hit the highs of these other works. I felt the characters didn't have enough time to develop their relationship. To the point of asking myself why they even liked each other in the first place. This was due to another failing in the film;<br/><br/>The science fiction plot felt weak and under developed as well. Which is a shame because I feel like this is a good way to please a wider variety of audience. *SPOILER* The body swapping and the time travel aspect were fine, if not a little confusing, and added for some good comedic moments as well as a genuine shock of realization. The comet story line felt unnecessary, weak, and worst of all took away from the true meat of the romance. I feel like the story would have been better without it. *SPOILER*<br/><br/>Overall this is a highly enjoyable movie, for a wide variety of audiences, but it lacks certain plot developments and focus to have it stand with some of the true greats. It is beautiful and I recommend a watch if for nothing else, but the effort and work dedicated to the visuals."
"RileyOnFilm","8","5","8","21 November 2017"," Very touching love story with sci fi elements.
","I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an anime fan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse to the subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch and really get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some of the most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The concept draws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flow and flow and what a fun ride it is.<br/><br/>It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime really helps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, I forgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.<br/><br/>I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of an anime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice. This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in love for the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/young adult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.<br/><br/>If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am not new at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic. The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of the special effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however they did it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.<br/><br/>Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you really have no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fi elements and you will not regret it."

","I don't usually write reviews, but I feel like I need to say something about this film, even if the majority of reviews will be overwhelmingly positive. And I'm pretty terrible with these things b/c I don't have a photographic memory.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it's a story of boy and girl switching bodies after a cosmic event involving a comet that's never really explained. This happens a few times each week, much to the chagrin of each of our main characters and amusing fun for the supporting cast. I don't want to say much else beyond that without giving away plot details. Needless to say, they start to fall in love with each other as they're living each other's lives.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film. There's one particular sequence in the middle that I absolutely loved visually.<br/><br/>The movie started to fall apart towards the last 30-45 minutes once it rushes to resolve a problem introduced in the latter half of the film. It feels like the film needed a bit more running time to avoid this. There's also a bunch of suspension of disbelief required...I mean I guess this is to be expected, but for me, a films starts to lose me once there's too much serendipity involved to resolve everything.<br/><br/>Also, I think the film would've gotten better mileage if it had gone down the bittersweet route when rushing to its end.<br/><br/>I left the theater liking the film, but it's not like it's the most amazing film I've ever seen (even if it broke the box office record in Japan), nor did it really leave me with tingly happy feelings like after watching some Studio Ghibli films."
"robiu013","5","28","68","22 September 2016"," If sappy love stories with magical realism are your thing
","With ""Your Name"" storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. With so many people agreeing, that it's a masterpiece, it has to be good, right? Well turns out I didn't enjoy it quite as much the majority of MAL users.<br/><br/>Plot: The story starts fair enough. Our main character suffers from ""Disney princess syndrome""; she's not satisfied with the surroundings she was born in and wants to see the world, that is so much bigger than what she knows. Luckily for her, magical realism is a thing in her world as well. Out of nowhere she gets the chance to live out her dreams by switching bodies with a boy from Tokyo every now and then. The boy, turns out to be the other main character. This sounds like the basic story, in which our lead learns, that ""every place is beautiful, but home is still best"" or that everybody has troubles in their life, no matter where they come from. The set up definitely has some potential, since the main characters parallel each other in an interesting way and they're pretty well characterized. But that doesn't turn out to be the case with ""Your Name"". The writer was far more ambitious than to just recycle the classic body switch plot. About halfway the movie switches into a pretty convoluted romance story, that just doesn't work, because the whole second half is built around wanting to give the audience the ""feels"". Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance or a good tragedy as much as anyone else, but if it all feels as contrived and transparent as in this movie's case, I won't be able to jump on the feel train. The climax was a pretty interesting idea, but was pretty inconsistently build up, where things worked out way too conveniently to be believable.<br/><br/>Characters: I've already addressed it in the previous section, that I found the characterization of the characters pretty good. With the exception of the self-absorbed and ambitious father almost all felt pretty lively. Unfortunately characters can at time's be only as good as the plot allows them to be. This shows especially with the side characters, who at times just conveniently join into the plot, even if it doesn't make much sense. Same goes for our leads, they're pretty fun at first, but as soon as the plot starts becoming contrived and convoluted, I no longer found them as likable.<br/><br/>Art: The art and animation were pretty good, but it was pretty standard in terms of style.<br/><br/>Sound: Just like the plot the sound was also heavy into making you feel stuff and to be fair it did resonate with me somewhat. Interestingly there were a lot of pop songs instead of the more typical choice of instrumentals. <br/><br/>Plot: 50% (4/10) Characters: 30% (6/10) Art: 10% (8/10) Soundtrack: 10% (8/10)<br/><br/>Score: 5/10"

"framptonhollis","7","3","4","1 April 2018"," a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film
","From the crystal clear, beautifully crafted animation to the likability of the two protagonists to the tense drama to the light humor, this semi-love-story is lighthearted and very moving to the point of now being one of the most acclaimed films of recent years. And perhaps one of the most acclaimed films of all time. I had a couple of little problems w/it, thus making me avoid any statements about the film's status among cinema's finest efforts as they'd be rather hyperbolic coming from me, as well as simply just not genuine. Instead, however, I will happily praise the film on various levels. 
 As a technical achievement, it is stunning. The animation is spectacularly done in every scene, the characters are really alive, the scenery is beautiful, in general it is just a really fun movie to look at. There were a few surprisingly surreal and borderline psychedelic moments here and there in the film and they worked not only to further the plot but also to simply show off the massive tons of talent pouring itself into basically every shot of this movie. 
 Story-wise, it is also stunning. It's a mixture of a few genres. At first, it almost feels like some light slice-of-life type comedy w/a magical-realist twist, but eventually it becomes something much more emotional and dramatic than that. It becomes a film featuring multiple dimensions and complicated situations these two leads who I genuinely grew to adore and care for had to trudge their tense ways through. It is a supernatural drama and a love story on top, and a very unconventional love story at that (the way the romance of the film is handled is unlike almost any other romance I have seen; it is clear these two are in love, but they never express it openly at all). It really felt like the writer really matured over the course of writing this, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse, b/c it does mean that the film improves heavily w/every scene, but it also means that the beginning and early middle of this film are no where near as great as what follows. And, do not get me wrong, there's some super fun stuff in this roughly-first-half of the movie, but there's also a few eye rolling scenes and weird incorporations of pop songs and overtly expository dialogue and non-endearingly cheesy moments that I just could not get into. Thus, my score drops down by a single point. It is still, obviously, a wonderful movie, and sort of a must see for lovers of animation and world cinema in general."

I admit that I was skeptical at first, but it wasn't long into the movie where I had really gotten into it. There's also a lot of information to take in, so I would suggest when watching you pay full attention so you don't miss anything (not that you'd want to).
I was also very pleased with the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but i know how much a bad ending can ruin an entire film, so I'll just say that you'll be satisfied.

","Suffice to say I used to hate anime, I couldn't get on board with it. Now that I feel I've grown as an aspiring film critic, I can appreciate the delicate art of Japanese animation. With Hayao Miyazaki retired, is the genre deceased? Far from it. Your Name is just as good as any Miyazaki production. Two teenagers unexpectedly switch lives, forging a connection that is both unexplainable and unforgettable. Having figured out what's happening, the two attempt to meet...but not everything in life is that simple. A gorgeous juxtaposition of culture and gender. A country girl and a city boy. A tranquil and picturesque rural town against a bustling and modernised Tokyo. Contrasting the difference in mannerisms and punctuality, not just in lifestyles, but in gender. How a girl and a boy interact with others differently. Two lives being thrown into a foreign environment. The sheer complexity and magnitude that the narrative conveys is nothing short of genius. The introductory title song plays and BAM...I was captivated instantaneously. The animation...the animation!? It was like watching art move right before my eyes. Anime has never looked so beautiful. The glistening water, fast moving transport, hallucinogenic comets against a starry backdrop...wow. Wooooow! I can't. It's too much. I think my eyes are bleeding, someone pass me a tissue. Shinkai's direction was utterly creative. The story moves along at a swift pace and the inclusion of time-bending realities just makes it that much more intriguing. It's a love story. How love can traverse both space and time. Honestly, it was beautiful to watch. To create a pure relationship from two souls switching bodies is...well damn difficult. Shinkai made it look easy. Some of the time-bending narrative shifts can be confusing and you may not necessarily understand it in one viewing (heck, I didn't completely) but the film is that good, that you will want to watch it again...and again...and again. Aside from some exposition, Your Name is masterful."

","YOUR NAME proves to be much more than a generic coming-of-age love

overlapped, to achieve a rendezvous for the two protagonists. Secondly,
the animation and music are so exquisitely used to accentuate the
general aesthetics of the film, that it keeps the viewers' gazes glued
to the screen. <br/><br/>The movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I hadn't expected to
be blown away the way I did. The film is a clever mix of core romance
and subtle comedy, with a tint of highly bizarre storytelling which
keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. I believe, above
everything else, the script and storytelling rocks it for Your Name.
The crucial importance of culture and heritage, the metaphorical use of
'twisted braids' as time, and the contrast between the Tokyo life and
Itomori life, are undebatable winners in this one. <br/><br/>I had said YOUR NAME is not a 'Generic coming-of-age love story'. No
its definitely not. Rather its a modern Love story unfolding with
transcending limits and emotions."

"Tweekums","10","3","4","10 November 2017"," Your Name
","This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.<br/><br/>Anybody who has seen previous films from director Makoto Shinkai will immediately recognise the beautiful style of the artwork, with incredibly detailed backgrounds. Of course a good film must do more than 'look good' and this succeeds there too; the first half is a fun introduction to the characters and their situation. This is done with plenty of humour; the fact that they find themselves in bodies of the opposite gender is quickly handled in an amusing but not a crude manner. There are lots of delightful details such as while swapped they talk in different dialects and Taki talks like a girl of course this is better appreciated if you speak Japanese but is explained so non-Japanese speakers (like me) can realise that it is happening. The events that take place half way through the film come as quite a surprise and suddenly change to tone of the film. As Taki tries to find a way to save Mitsuha and her village it is far from obvious that he will be successful. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of good animation; the content isn't really unsuitably for younger viewers but it would probably be a bit confusing.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles; an English dub is also available on the DVD I bought."

","This is a movie that does not look like much at first; nothing fancy or groundbreaking, just the fantasy of a small town girl who wishes to change her life. And then, it just happens: seemingly at random, she shifts bodies with a teenage boy, and a relationship starts. As they get to know each other, the feelings show and something settles, until suddenly, it all stops. No more exchanges, and the boy starts forgetting. All that remains is a nagging feeling that he is looking for somebody, but does not remember her name... This movie is beautiful in its simplicity, and the emotions it brings up. It does not try to explain the why and the how, but rather to make the viewer feels. And it succeeds. While it could be considered slow at times, each moment contributes towards the evolution of the story and the ending. Very much worth a watch!"

","Your Name was a very intriguing experience. The film was based around a comet that destroyed a town near Japan's Hida Region, which is very mountainous. Our main character, Mitshua, is a teenage girl who is also the mayor's daughter removed from his custody. Meanwhile, our other main character, Taki, is a teenage boy living in Tokyo who works part- time at a Italian restaurant. However, a comet named Tiamat is approaching Earth and will happen during one of Mitshua's Family's festivals.<br/><br/>Your Name was released in Japan last August 2016 and reaching American shores in April 2017. In both countries, the film was universally acclaimed by critics for its splendid animation, story and music. My opinion on the film is that is almost a Ghibli anime.

"anonus-82923","6","4","6","25 August 2018"," Mainstream anime movie
","It's indeed a visually stunning movie that has a wonderful depiction of japanese landscapes and architectures, it's well directed as well and uses symbolism well. These are the strongest points that keep the movie from being mediocre.<br/><br/>My main issue with this movie comes from the fact that its fantasy aspect doesn't make any sense and falls apart as soon as you start thinking about it. I'm supposed to think that Taki, despite that he spent quite some time in the body of Mitsuha, having been to her school, having used her phone, never attempted to know or even noticed by mistake that he was in the past ?
Same goes for the name of the town, which he should have noticed at least accidentally, and should have remembered since a town being vaporized by a meteor is a national catastrophe. He could of course forget once he wakes up, like for her name, but this would mean that this rule only serves to artificially create conflict.<br/><br/>Makoto Shinkai wrote other similar scripts and doesn't seem very interested in more fleshed out love stories, it's often heavily based around a single feeling of lovelorn melancholy. This movie has indeed a taste to it but it's pretty naive and he's clearly not interested in creating a complexe story, even though he came up with a good premise. The problems with the script wouldn't be an issue with me at all if it was more than just convenient for the narrative, but it didn't create a lot of moments that gave depth or perspectives to the characters.<br/><br/>I'm giving a lot of crap to this movie here but apart from what I'm criticizing, the rest fits well altogether, it's a good movie but it doesn't take much risks, and I don't see how some can compare it to Eternal Sunshine or Satoshi Kon's movies..."

","The movie started with one simple idea: The feeling that you have when you met someone for the first time. Similar. Warm. Touching. Just like you have known each other for such a long time, and somehow, you was separated. And you know deep in your heart that you are still looking for that one every single day, you will know right away when you met each other. With that simple idea Makoto Shinkai have developed and built a master piece have in the name: Your name. Taki is a city boy. Mitsuha is a country girl. They have different life, not to mention totally opposite. But by a mystic power, they are connected to each other, through space, time. A lot of thing happened for various reasons, and they have forgot each other. But deep inside, they both feel a gap, a hole which cannot be filled. They neither understand nor explain, but they know that they are looking for each other. It might take months, years, lives but they know they will recognize each other immediately... I have to mention again: the movie is such a masterpiece. The story is touching and meaningful. It is magical yet it is familiar with everyone of us. The animation is beautiful. Story telling is good and logical. The music in the movie is something special. It is not just matching and touching, it is also affected the movie itself. If you read the book, you will find out that even before they met, RADWIMPS and Makoto had the same thought about the original idea. A lot of thing in the story had been changed according to the lyrics. If you have enjoyed other movie of Makoto like 5cm per seconds, you will enjoy this movie too.

","""Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.""<br/><br/>Wow, that was actually really good. Even when watching it at 1am in the morning at my Japanese friend's place, it was really exceptional. I hadn't watched anime in a long while, so when she suggested turning this movie on (which I had heard of in advertisements before this cuz of it's endless popularity), I happily accepted, despite the early hours of the morning. <br/><br/>When I watched it, I realised that despite having loved anime in the past, I'd never actually watched an anime movie before. But ultimately, it really wasn't too different in style from TV shows. They managed to capture all the traditional anime elements (school life, dates, part-time jobs, festivals, etc.), yet put an original spin on all of it. And, like most anime, it has a completely weird premise and dark plot twists. Funny thing with anime is that I can never really tell how it'll end, cuz so many anime in the past have had the craziest kind of endings. I can never really be sure. I'll always be in doubt until the very last scene.<br/><br/>The Japanese-style scenery and animation was spot-on. The soundtrack was really good (as is always with anime). Look, pretty much, this movie's great all round - just give it a watch.<br/><br/>Actually, I almost forgot to mention that it's also good on the emotional side of things, so much so that I glimpsed tears in my friend's eyes towards the ending...<br/><br/>Pretty much infinite praise for this anime.

","(NO SPOILERS IN THESE THREE PARAGRAPHS) The sweet love story(?) about a boy and a girl who wished to be someone else, and the wish did come true... but he has to save her first. Or something like that. The only problem is, they don't actually know each other, except by actually BEING each other in what they consider to be only episodic dreams-- I found this concept quite interesting.<br/><br/>The art and animation were amazing, a lot was said about this already, and the guy (Makoto Shinkai) is a master in this, so I'll skip most of it; but I specially digged the final landscape scenes with pastel- colored skies and the trippy transportation scene. Amazing. <br/><br/>Now for the plot. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm reading too much into this, and maybe this movie was purposely made without much care for the actual plot in order to emphasize the amazing animation and crazy sci-fi elements, but I'm gonna give my honest impression:<br/><br/>(-----SPOILERS AHEAD-----) I was very disappointed once I watched it and realized that all the hype for ""best animated movie of all times"" was actually very untrue plotwise. It's just a collection of clichés and typical anime-like shoujo (un)romance. Wait, there were also several big plot drivers, all of them unnecessarily mashed together and none of them fully explained: -Body-swap. -Memory loss. -Time travel. -Meteor destroying a whole city. I felt like it was too much to handle for a young love story, and all of that load created a bunch of plot holes and nonsense I couldn't just ignore, e.g.: -How did the characters not notice it was a different year? I don't know about other people, but I hardly ever spend a day without something reminding me what year I'm in. -""Oh, that huuuuuge incident of a freaking meteorite destroying a whole town and killing everyone in it? Yeah, we all in adjacent cities (or the rest of the country, for that matter) just completely forgot everything about it"". -It's not like they could have just exchanged e-mail addresses sooner or anything, just to check if it really happened, right? Seriously, the whole thing would have been solved way sooner. -The father incident? How nice was it solved! He discovered the true value of her daughter and started to care more for her... I think... did he? - And for that respect... Not gonna lie, even if I were a super caring father, I wouldn't believe what this brat is blabbering, mainly because NOBODY ELSE ever noticed. Not even astronomists or w/e are the people in charge of noticing that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Then, the characters were pretty normal, anime protagonists. Nothing too annoying or too special about them; that was good, I guess. Typical support characters. I would have liked a bit more love development before he went on to save her, it would have made me care more for his heroic adventure.<br/><br/>All in all it wasn't an annoying film. It was a pretty film, it just wasn't a great one. Maybe for younger, more easily awed audiences, this could be the ultimate work of art, but I have seen this plot elements done individually tons of times and dozens of times better executed."
"Harhaluulo54","5","14","32","26 July 2017"," Very typical and average story with a ripoff ending. Please read before downvoting.
","This time Makoto didn't even try to go with originality. Pretty art, cliché time travel romance, BGM which you will forget instantly after finishing the movie and characters whose specialty is capturing the characteristics of every Japanese school kid. Cherry on the cake is the lackluster ending which was the perfect way to finish average story with average conclusion. <br/><br/>If we talk about the greatest love stories ever told, we look into Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles manga. It had the same time travel love story concept, and one of its 4 simultaneously ending time lines had this exact same ending in the stairs. Except there it was done right and here it is just a cliché. Pretty sure Makoto has read that manga and ripped off this ending from there. I am not very impressed. When it comes to the gender swapping, I have seen better anime series about cross-dressing.<br/><br/>Kimi no Na Wa may please some casual anime fans or people who in generally are not connoisseur of entertainment and the art mediums related to TV, literature and games. After over 1000 anime series, 1500 manga series, 2000 movies and 150 games, I can say this is an average movie which tells the same story which has been told times and times again. This is nowhere near the most impressive capturing of the tale, it's just average, but well worth the watch anyway."

","Seeing how this movie quickly jumped to the top of MAL ratings, I just had to check it out. Last time that happened, it was with Erased and we all saw how overrated that one was. So, here I am watching the movie, wondering what could possibly be the reason it was rated so high, and why everybody calls it the best anime of all times, only to realize it's because it is exactly like Erased.<br/><br/>The first half is a typical school comedy in the likes of Kokoro Connect. A boy and a girl occasionally switch bodies and try to adjust to their new lifestyle. What caused this weird phenomenon? We are never told; it's the power of plot convenience. How did they accept this sudden change that would normally drive them insane, and instead managed to adjust to each other's timetable and occupations in a single day? Stop thinking about it, just enjoy the occasional naughty touches, such as the boy groping the breasts while in the female body, or the girl making a woman to fall in love with her while in the male body. It made no sense in how easily they went along with it, but it was fun seeing them affecting the lives of each other. Up until the midpoint, it was a nicely animated and safe pass timer I would easily score a bit above average.<br/><br/>And then the second half begins and everything stops making sense. They are not simply switching bodies, they are also traveling in time. Something they didn't realize for many weeks because they never attempted to communicate with each other via phones or the internet. Also, apparently nobody ever mentions the year or talks about recent events in this setting.<br/><br/>Although they exist in different time lines, they still manage to meet with each other. First physically by complete accident inside a train, where the boy completely forgets about her, although he was constantly in her body for weeks. And then they meet again in spirit form, thanks to the power of plot convenience. Both meetings had zero purpose to the plot, other than hinting the two of them are in love, although they never exchanged a single word face to face without forgetting it a few seconds later. Because we apparently didn't have enough bull yet, we need to add amnesia to the mix.<br/><br/>As it happens in all stories about time travel, the characters are eventually trying to change history. More specifically, to prevent the deaths of hundreds of people by a passing comet, an event that devastated the country and became the most tragic comet disaster in recorded history. But apparently that wasn't important enough for the boy to remember, since he somehow never heard about it.<br/><br/>And none of that matter since the girl manages to convince her own father to evacuate the people in time, all of which happens out of screen since there is no way they could show it in a way that makes sense. Thus the tragedy is prevented and it somehow doesn't cause a time paradox for the boy, because plot convenience. Some years later, the two of them accidentally meet each other once again, and magically remember everything thanks to the power of bullshit. Then the movie ends and you are free to kill yourself.<br/><br/>That was terrible. The movie is abusing every lazy plot convenience there is without ever trying to explain or excuse anything. Everything is beautifully animated in order to maximize the feels without having a speck of logic in whatever is going on. You are supposed to shut your brain because of the pretty colors, laugh while they are groping breasts, cry when the girl is running in the woods, and don't give a fart about the plot.<br/><br/>Yet another example of why modern anime are nothing more than pretty boxes with nothing inside. Time resets, amnesia, and zero explanations, because who the hell is watching anime for quality? It's all trash entertainment for people who want to escape reality."

They simply could not be expected to follow the plot, as the film is complex and clearly designed for teens and adults. <br/><br/>As to the story, for some time it's a tad confusing.and that's okay as it will eventually all come together. It seems that Mitsuha and Taki are somehow psychically linked. When Taki goes to sleep, he finds himself as Mitsuha.which is a bit embarrassing for him since he is a teenage guy and Mitsuha is a teenage girl! But why.why is he experiencing Mitsuha's life? And, the strange part is that he soon learns that what he's experiencing happened several years ago!! And what does a comet have to do with this as well? How can Taki's strange dreams possibly save Mitusha and her small village? I'd say more, but don't want to reveal too much about the story. <br/><br/>The quality of this film is very, very nice. I would not say that the animation is quite as good as a typical Ghibli picture, but it is close. But what makes this a delightful film are that it never tries to be cute or formulaic.it's a wholly unique viewing experience. It also is very well written and kept my interesteven though I was suffering jetlag! I saw the film in Japanese with subtitles, though the theater and many others are showing an English dubbed version as well. So, in this case, I actually had the choice which I wanted to seewhich was very unusual."

","The story being with a girl and a boy. One in the countryside and the other in the city. both are connected through their dreams and they are exchanging bodies and of course a bond is made. Then the story changes its path and you cannot feel but drawn into it without second thoughts.<br/><br/>Not only the story is brilliant and really, really, emotional, but the characters are really simple, ones that you can feel yourself identified with no matter how old you are. Then there is the music, which is the cause of your almost dehydration but remember, once in a while is good to clean your eyes. Nothing to say about the animation, as this is an anime, and as an anime is simply perfect. It is good to see some brilliant anime movie that is not from master Miyazaki, because personally, is the best movie from 2016 that I have watched so far. You have romance, you have drama, you have laughs, you have fantasy, you have science fiction the perfect combination all together, which is easy to say but not so easy to make.<br/><br/>""Your Name"" is a movie that spell-bounds you since the first minute, or second. It starts like other movies that have played with the connection between two people via dreams, but in this case more than dreams it looks like they are exchanging bodies. Yes, it's not the first time that this concept is approached but still at the beginning of the movie there is something different, a change in the story that you don't see coming because it is too early in the movie for""that"" to happen! And from that moment on you cannot wait to see what is going to happen and before you realize it the movie is over (almost 2 hours of your time well spent!)."

The film's story line evolves from a devastating catastrophe caused by meteor shower, but out of it emerges compassion, courage and strength.

","Unlike his previous movies Makoto Shinkai adds a supernatural aspect to the movie, which is experienced only by Taki and Mitsuha. Otherwise the action takes place in very realistic today's Tokyo and a mountainous village, where they live. Shinkai stitches these two aspects of the plot, but some serious plot holes remain which are the biggest minus for this otherwise beautiful and astounding movie.<br/><br/>* Spoilers ahead * <br/><br/>For the story to unwind Taki and Mitsuha cannot meet each other in real life. They both try and both fail for the reason of a 3-year gap between the events. Their experiences are not aligned in time. But it is hard to buy that they don't realise it earlier: they both use mobile phones on which the date is boldly displayed, they use calendars, they listen to radio and TV broadcasts. Yet they are somehow unaware that then they switch each other's places they are 3 years off. The same holds for space. Taki makes a great effort to locate Mitsuha's village, he remembers the exact landscape of the village and is able to draw it precisely, but seems not to remember the name of the village written on railway station name, announced during mayoral elections, or simply GPS coordinates on Mitsuha's smartphone.<br/><br/>Taki has selective memory loss about Mitsuha's name, hence the title. When he learns that the village has been destroyed 3 years ago he has no problems finding her name on the victim list. Sometime later he is unable to remember her name anymore, and he never comes back to the list. None of the two when switching places tries to tell their true name to others, e.g. grandma or friends.<br/><br/>Up to the half of the movie it is more or less clear for the spectators what is possible in the world of Kimi no na wa, and what is not. But then the two try to fight against the fate and the plot starts to look much like Back to the Future: they come back in time to undo the events and rescue the village. So suddenly there is a full-blown time travel and changing of the past events.<br/><br/>Problems with this arise in the scene of their meeting above the village: Mitsuha in the body of Taki awakes in the shrine and Taki in MItsuha's body arrives there on a bicycle. But both events are separated by 3 years. Taki arrives on the day of comet strike, and Mitsuha 3 years afterwards. All the vegetation, ground shouldn't look the same. But the scene is as if they were there together. If Shinkai wanted to show them together in front of the distant view of the village he would need to choose either a village before the catastrophe or a destroyed village and a crater. He chose not to show either by covering everything what lies below with clouds. These clouds are one of these plot stitches which don't hold."

","""Kimi No Na Wa"" is one of those few things that you remember for the remainder of your life. The Anime opens with a smooth introduction that ignites interest from the get-go. It actually takes 5 minutes to be inundated into the wonderful existence of the Designated Characters.<br/><br/>The story is entirely basic as to begin with, however, as you advance you figure out how multi-layered this film truly is. <br/><br/>The anime demonstrates the sheer acumen of the human personality. <br/><br/>The anime engulfs the immaculate and theoretical speculations about time and space and associates them in a way that any individual would find breath-taking.<br/><br/>The characters of the anime are exceptionally well-built which is extremely hard to reach in such a limited capacity of time. <br/><br/>However the reason for its significant prevalence was the bittersweet moments inoculated into the anime,<br/><br/>These moments show us that regardless of how hard we attempt, there are hurdles which accompany the progression of life and can only be removed by the flow of time. ""Peace of Mind"" is one of those things.<br/><br/>It is not entirely a sentimental anime, however beyond any doubt pulls on one's heart strings. <br/><br/>I trust the alacrity and energetic promptness which was incorporated into Mizunha's character was one the many reasons behind its brilliance. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a story which is both thrilling and vibrant then ""Kimi No Na Wa"" is for you. Until next time, Fellow Earthly Beings!"

","Your name was truly a surprise to me, I would say that it is the best anime movie that I have watched. Though many have been of great enjoyment I have never felt such emotional depth in any of the other anime movies out there. Your name starts off at quite a slow pace featuring the main characters swapping bodies which is quite enjoyable with some comedic elements, but what is truly astonishing is probably in the second and third act of this film. The art and music of this film is amazing too.<br/><br/>What I felt was a very amazing feat that the film managed to achieve is to take such clichéd ideas (romance, time travel) and to play it out on such a way that makes it just feel so different and original. The film had a very steady rhythm as we gradually build up to the reveal of the identities of our main characters. Another thing that was done well, the pacing.<br/><br/>This film managed to give its audience a sense of emptiness, watching the film and following the main characters as they struggle to remember the names of each other can really be hard to watch at times as they have done such a great job making us emotionally invested in these characters. From them having to write their names on each others hands, to after the time gap when the characters themselves are feeling this sense of dread and searching for something just creates such a hollow and glum atmosphere. <br/><br/>After watching this movie I felt that the ending could be a point of controversy, perhaps a minor flaw. About the finale, those who rooted for the 'happy ending' got a somewhat happy ending with the couple meeting each other, but for those who rooted for an film to continue the artistic approach of having this idea of emptiness also got their ending since we never know what happens after the couple have met. I personally liked this ending, at one point of the movie when the two basically walk pass each other I thought that would be the end, however it wasn't and after seeing the actual ending I think that though that could've been an impactful end I do like the 'not so extreme' approach that the film chose to go by. Another flaw could be it's rewatchability, after seeing all the mysteries play out I don't think that this first time experience can be recreated, though I doubt that I wouldn't enjoy a second watch it would never be the same. A small issue I have but some may even argue that this is why it is so great.<br/><br/>So overall, high praise to this film, one of the greatest drawings in an anime film. It was visually stunning to behold, the music was great completed with great lyrics and managed to make those key scenes so much more. The plot was original and very interesting. Finally the emotions, this sense of emptiness that the film builds up and makes its audience fee was really an experience like none other."

","Among all the other works of Makoto Shinkai, I must say that this is undoubtedly my favorite. <br/><br/>This is not as slow as 5C/S. It has the rhythm that perfectly blends with the lighthearted music. I must also mention how I love the random quick frames and some more symmetrical shots. Aside from the animation, the movie's plot and tone offer such an engaging story. I like this Shinkai's story-telling style. It is not rushed. He takes his time to reasonably develop all the characters and every situation. He makes animated romantic stories not an isolating genre to watch. Although, again perhaps the love story is just but a secondary part of the whole story. <br/><br/>While it is categorized as sci-fi fantasy, it is also sprinkled with a slice of life touch and that's another thing I enjoy watching in some Shinkai's movies. It is unpretentious. The mundanity is not torturing but it is something that you savor and love. <br/><br/>Everyone should see this. It's a perfect movie for fall. It's lovely!"

"bob the moo","Null","3","5","12 November 2017"," Perfectly balances all the elements, providing plenty in all of them (SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS)
","I came to Your Name only knowing that it was a body-swap film, and that it was supposed to be good. Beyond that I did not know much at all. I cannot remember if I was told it was a comedy, or merely assumed it was a comedy on the basis that all bodyswap films seem to play that element to the maximum. Regardless, I did not know much about it.<br/><br/>The film opens very much in the genre that I expected, and we spend the first half of the film in this vein; two teenagers in different parts of Japan swap bodies every so often – a boy and girl. After a while it becomes a routine, and they leave each other notes on their telephones to help the visitor play out the lives correctly. In this half the film is lively, funny, sweet, and enjoyable for what it does with the characters in terms of establishing them but also swapping them around. The middle of the film sees a change to this direction, and instead the root of the jumping, and more detail of the situation, is laid out. At this point there is much more mystery, urgency, and drama to the story as it unfolds. It does this in a way that in no way discards what has gone before, but uses our charmed investment to make the second half work even better. It does this all the way to an ending which seems like nothing to describe it, but yet left me with tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>The character creation and the spot-on judgment of tone are two key elements in making it work, but of course not only. Animation is great throughout and the music, although a little corny perhaps, plays off the emotions in the story well – again a factor in me having something in my eye at the end. I'm not sure a second watch will have quite the same impact on me as the first time did, but I will watch it again. It is a great little film – worthy of the praise it received on release in Europe, and worth watching even if you have zero interest in subtitled or animated films."

"lasttimeisaw","8","3","5","4 August 2017"," A mega-hit anime not produced by the named Studio Ghibli
","A mega-hit anime not produced by the named Studio Ghibli, the up-and-coming animator Makoto Shinkai's fifth feature-length film, YOUR NAME is Japanese box office champion in 2016, grossed Â¥23 billion (circa US$190 million), the fourth largest in the history ever. <br/><br/>It starts as a gender-swapping yarn in the present day, Mitsuha, a motherless high school girl from a mountainous region, who lives with her grandma and a younger sister in their family shrine whereas her estranged father is running for the mayor of the town, grouses about her stagnant rural life and dreams of being a boy living in the big city, when a mysterious comet strikes across the firmament, it seems her wish is granted, she wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo, and vice versa, the swapping alternates on a daily basis and rebounds to both despite the initial confusion and the side effect of fading memories, Mitsuha becomes popular in the school with Taki takes over her body whilst Miki, the co-worker whom Taki has a crush on, starts to feel closer to him thanks to Mitsuha's feminine intervention. Laden with generic but scintillating humor (Mitsuha's habitual gazing and fondling of her boobs when her body is inhabited by Taki, but ostensibly not the other way around), zippy editing rhythm and hooky J-Pop anthems, the chucklesome paragraph reaches a halt when one day, Taki finds out that the swapping stops, and what follows are his dogged endeavor to looking for Mitsuha's village whose name eludes him with a bolt from the blue waiting down the line. <br/><br/>Apparently and inexplicably, their temporalities are not uniform, but separated by three years, and Shinkai's savvy script circumspectly introduces the time-warp into the plot, which evolves into a touching and urgent past-changing undertaking for Mitsuha, facilitated by the numinous power of the traditional mouth-chewed sake and interlaced with a transcendent vis-Ã -vis in the twilight hour during which the two nearly have time to write down their names. The cataclysm cannot be averted but at least many lives are saved, yet, hampered by the fading memories of each other's names, will they be reunited in the same universe? You bet! Although the ending has a strained elation blatantly turning a blind on the odds of two individuals actually pass by each other randomly in a metropolis like Tokyo. <br/><br/>Shinkai's virtuosity of devising picturesque scenery is an extraordinary feat to be reckoned with, a spate of celestial splendor and awe-inspiring landscape are scenery porn to hungry eyes, sometimes spiffed up by flashy juxtapositions of memories and hand-written sketches. Nevertheless, being someone who hasn't been versed in the realm of anime, one might wantonly hazard that the human character is a weak link in the process, their looks are invariably pedestrian and shy of memorable distinctions, perhaps it is an intrinsic defect in the animation where the niceties of facial expressions are still quite a challenge to visualize in technique terms. However, nothing can deny that YOUR NAME is a massive success and an infallible testimony of Shinkai's faculty to carry on the anime torch from royalties like Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata."
"Skaigear","9","3","5","4 July 2017"," This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance.
","Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of PokÃ©mon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy- handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying. <br/><br/>Mitsuha and Taki, our two leads are very charming and funny. The main hook is you hardly see them as themselves, instead they are mostly in each other's bodies. Because of this, we see their characters develop as they literally walk in each other's shoes.The first act to my surprise was candidly funny. I found myself laughing out loud at the fish out of water and situational jokes. There is a running gag where every time Taki would wake up in Mitsuha's body, he would feel her boobs to make sure he is not in his own body, this is when Mitsuha's little sister would burst in the room and see her ""sister"" touching herself. Comedy like this is perfect, because it is within character, situational and not forced.<br/><br/>I am going to avoid all spoilers for the second act onwards because I went in the movie knowing very little, and I wish for anyone watching this film to do the same.I will say there is an obstacle in the third act that is suspenseful and tension-filled but not in a Hitchcockian way. Instead, you just want to see the characters succeed and achieve the impossible so much, that when an obstacle stands between them, you cannot help but to be on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for them because I was emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha as human beings, and I care about them, and genuinely want a happy ending for them.<br/><br/>Having some time to think about the movie after seeing it not too long ago, I felt Your Name connected with me on in intimate level few films have done before. Ever since I was young I was a romanticist, always believing the meeting with the love of my life is bound by some sort of fate and destiny since the beginning of time, and I simply have not found her. The movie explores this subject, what if you are tied to a person by a string? You two through thick and thin, chaos and peace, no matter the time difference, spatial difference, are destined to meet? A story of this kind would have touched my heart regardless of the quality of the actual film, but thankfully, besides having an excellently written script, the movie's supplemental elements like animation and music do not lag behind.<br/><br/>The hand-drawn animation in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen. Every frame was perfectly crafted and colors are rich and vibrant. I especially appreciated the little details like water droplets on a spider web during the raining scene and of course, the deliciously animated food throughout. The movie was truly like a painting coming to life and rivals with even some of Ghibli's best. Another thing I need to mention is the music, composed by Japanese rock band, Radwimps. It was simply fantastic, amazing, incredible, heart- warming, heart-wrenching and every adjective that is associated with the word ""nostalgic."" Funny how a piece of music you have only heard for the first time recently can give you the feeling of nostalgia, but that is the power of this film's soundtrack. My favorite piece is Date that plays during Taki's date with his co-worker. The track accompanying the sunset imagery and Tokyo cafÃ© evokes a poignant, bittersweet sentiment within me, and I absolutely loved it. It makes me think back of times in my life where I was in a similar situation as Taki, and the feelings I had then, the moment, the sunset, the yearning of days gone by.<br/><br/>Your Name is a brilliant, heart-felt animated film about two different people's absolute desire to meet one another despite being separated by space and time. Taki and Mitsuha's conviction that leads them to the end of this emotional journey should be viewed by everyone, no matter if they like anime or not. This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed."

The film is interesting showing the difference between a Tokyo boy and a girl living in the countryside, highlighting the difference of sex and in lifestyle but still being very structured, each having its sequences. The film takes on a very interesting dramatic appearance when the boy (Taki) looks for the girl (Mitsuha) and realizes that 3 years separates them as they ""exchange"" at the same time and the film becomes even more interesting, the whole completed by music of great art. So I can only note this film 9, at the limit of the 10, so much beautiful it is. A masterpiece of Mr. Makoto Shinkai!"

"hobbessakuga","1","34","111","8 December 2016"," A serious let down
","The film reminds me of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. It's also a teenage, slice of life, romance with supernatural/sci-fi elements. In Your Name, a teenage boy and girl begin mysteriously swapping bodies at random. They end up using this power to help each other, leaving messages on each other's bodies Memento style to communicate. The girl has confidence issues but the guy finds it easy to be confident in her body. The boy can't talk to girls (well one girl) but the girl finds this easy in his body. It's an interesting idea that gets dropped 30 minutes in for a weirdly disconnected plot.<br/><br/>The art design was an issue for me. The film opens with a TV anime style opening, with a bland J-pop song and visuals straight out of any generic Naruto or Bleach OP. It's people running and reaching out for stars with eyes that do that little wobble thing. The character designs are too generic. They're almost devoid of personality- made to be purely attractive. Even the backgrounds are distractingly garish. While often detailed, they sap the atmosphere from scenes as they just try to look pretty at odds with the usually dramatic tone.<br/><br/>The characterisation is just as bland. The boy puts his hand behind his head and closes his eyes while he talks to girls and- well that's it as far as his personality goes. I don't know what motivates him for most of the film, his likes, or his dislikes. He works at a restaurant and that's about it. I don't even remember his name. The girl has breasts (which the movie likes to highlight) and she's also a bit nervous. It's weird trying to talk about these characters when they don't have any defining traits, they just do things. They say anime stuff like baka and oneechan and all that Jazz. Tropes just feel shoved into the characters in place of a personality. It's especially jarring when I've heard the director compared to Hosoda and Miyazaki, directors known for strong characters.<br/><br/>Instead Your Name tries to be more plot focused. To properly explain my feelings, I have to go into spoilers. The body swapping mechanic, as I mentioned earlier, mostly just happens in the first 30 minutes of the film. This accomplishes some small improvements in each character's lives even though their personalities are still one- dimensional. Suddenly, the girl dies in an unforeseen meteor crash. We see this happen but the next 20 minutes of the movie are the boy figuring this out. This is despite the fact that he knew the meteor crash was going to happen and it's frustrating that it takes him so long. Nothing happens in these 20 minutes to establish any personality or connection with any characters. It felt like wasted time and I was confused why they abandoned their most interesting plot device. The boy then realises, because of blatant foreshadowing earlier in the film, that he can time travel to tell the girl about the meteor and he does that. Then she tries to get people out of her town but it doesn't work. But then we find out that it did work. We're also told that the boy and the girl are in love. A few other things happen, then it ends.<br/><br/>Although I love the animation process I'm not interested in watching most anime. It's not that most of them are generic, that's the case with every type of media from Hollywood films to video games. It's the pornographic power fantasy aspect in so many of them that makes them feel immature and amateurish. Once again, in Your Name a personality-less guy and a personality-less girl with bouncy boobs get together. There's no humanity in this. It's just vacuous but pretty plot events happening in a row. Not that I don't like movies that are about spectacle but this is a drama- I should at least have a reason to care about the main characters.<br/><br/>The movie did nothing to make me care about them. In a 2-minute montage to another bad J-pop song they mention that the boy and girl invented an elaborate system to communicate with each other while body swapping. That sounded cool and I wish we'd seen them developing this instead of just telling us it happened. It's literal telling instead of showing. The bigger issue is that these small scenes are the only time these characters go through any development. These minor issues facing the boy and girl are solved less than halfway through the movie. The movie then just invents unconnected problems, solutions, and plot points to fill the other hour of its run time. The climax, where the girl warns the townspeople about the comet, was more engaging. The animation's good and it was more exciting. But the flat characters and direction held it back far too much.<br/><br/>I'll compare it to Hosoda's The Girl Who Leapt Through Time which is similar in terms of plot, but far better (Spoiler alert for the movie). In TGWLTT (at least Your Name has a shorter title) the movie constantly hints at a romance between the main character and one of her friends. It's presented as comedic so we don't take it seriously though. The girl's personality is established early on and we see that she's generally nice but unlike her peers she just wants to mess around and doesn't take life seriously. This is relatable and it's fun to watch her play around with time. This makes the reveal that the romance was serious and that her time travelling destroyed their chance for a relationship tragic and engaging. There's nothing this emotionally engaging in Your Name. Things just happen that are not set up or paid off well at all. There wasn't anything or anyone I could relate to. It's straight up bad film making.<br/><br/>Rated 1 star to lower the ridiculously high rating."
"851222","8","4","8","17 August 2017"," Great story
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Your Name"" (2016) surprised me more then i thought it will do. It has a lot of going on here, with some school student problems at the beginning, body swapping story later and then some more - i won't spoil it. The story here was great, if a bit maybe to complex down the road. Music was beautiful as well as voice acting and animation. Script was very involving. ""Your Name"" is also a very beautiful love story.<br/><br/>Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was a bit lost near the end. While the story is great and not one dimensional one, it was a bit to complex for my taste. Yet second viewing would be required. All in all ""Your Name"" (and what a beautiful title) is surely not to be missed one by anyone who loves great stories beautiful told."
"howard.schumann","10","4","8","28 May 2017"," Deeply moving story of teenage love
","""Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along"" â€“ Rumi.<br/><br/>To the surprise of many, Your Name, a Japanese anime directed by Makato Shinkai (Children Who Chase Lost Voices) has become not only the top box-office hit of 2016 in Japan, but the highest-grossing animated feature of all time, surpassing Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Its popularity should not be a surprise to anyone who has seen it, however. It is a physically gorgeous and spiritually alive comedy/drama with stunning music by Radwimps and a deeply moving story of teenage love. Oh yes, it also has time travel and sci-fi elements that give the film an enchanting otherworldly feeling even if the plot does get a bit convoluted. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to follow it, but it might help.<br/><br/>In any event, the story is the least important part of this highly entertaining and, dare I say, inspiring film. Based on Shinkai's own novel of the same name, the film takes place in a fictional Japanese small town called Itomori where teenager Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) lives with her grandmother (Estuko Ichihara) and younger sister (Kanon Tani). Her father (Masaki Terasoma), who left religion after the death of his wife, is now the mayor of the city. When Mitsuha complains about small town life and exclaims to whoever is listening, ""Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!"" her wish is granted the next day, when she wakes up in the body of Taki (voice of RyÃ»nosuke Kamiki), a real-life handsome boy who is in high school in Tokyo. Mitsuha must now must adjust to a new life which involves completing Taki's studies and working at an Italian restaurant.<br/><br/>Yes, the body switching happens on both ends. Taki is now a teenage girl in Itomori and must struggle to fit into small town life and to accept that he has breasts which he takes pleasure in fondling. The swap lasts for a day, and afterwards, neither party can remember what happened. Body swapping begins to take place on a regular basis, however, and the two (who do not know each other) must learn to adjust to radically different lives than they are accustomed to, with Mitsuha making a somewhat better adjustment. The two learn the meaning of empathy and are now able to help each other by leaving memos on each other's smartphone. Each makes the other's life better in some way, and there's a lingering feeling that they should meet.<br/><br/>Back in his own body, Taki travels to Itomori but finds that she died three years ago when a comet hit Itomori and decimated the city, killing one-third of its inhabitants, a reminder of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Now with the help of a magic drink, he travels back three years to help Mitsuha confront her intransigent father and warn the town of the impending disaster. Your Name is grounded in the Sufi concept of Musubi. As told to Mitsuha by her grandmother, ""Musubi is the old way of calling the local guardian God. This world has profound meaning. Tying thread is Musubi. Connecting people is Musubi. The flow of time is Musubi. These are all the God's power.<br/><br/>So the braided cords that we make are the God's art and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break, then connect again. Musubi â€“ knotting. That is time."" It is also about impermanence. Like a dream, memories of Taki's and Mitsuha's life in the other's body fade and are quickly forgotten. As Buddhism declares, in this world nothing is fixed and permanent. Existence is a flux and always becoming. What persists, however, are the braided cords that tie one to another and the love that transcends the artificial boundaries of space and time. Shinkai has been compared to the great Miyazaki, but this wondrous film is his and his alone."

","The movie is simply amazing, I watched it several times by the way. The story is nice and the change of sequences are perfect.

"drkdsm-1","10","4","8","14 May 2017"," A pure visual, auditory, mentally-satisfying, spiritual, magical, spell-binding extravaganza
","The ""anime"" form has a limited niche of audience may be due to the fact that computer-generated animation appears to be an eye-candy! Well these were my thoughts before I watched this movie (in Japanese). And boy, I was so wrong! I had watched Spirited Away in English a long time back due to its such rave reviews but somehow i felt that I missed something in that movie that others could see and I could not. And that was the end of my 'anime' career. Fast forward 4 years and here I was going through a rough patch of time as I beginning to think that good movies are not being made anymore and that I have watched everything there is to watch and that creativity has limits too! Well you can always be denounced wrong if you have directors like Mr Makoto Shinkai. Hats off to this great director and the music composers Mr Youjirou Noda and the Radwumps band!!! They have produced a masterpiece. A gem of a gem! What sweet romantic love story, a perfect romcoms! Also many praises to the editor of the movie that is again Mr Shinkai... The chemistry between the two lead characters is so strong and intense that you will be spell-bound. First half was a ""feel-good"" part that made me thought is this what the people all raving about? True even in first half, some of the scenes with the background song ZenZenZense were absolutely stunning like the scene with sunrise in the city and sunset in the rural area. Both are shot with absolute precision. Then the second half starts and you ate really caught off-guard. Now you will be really into the story that what is going on and what will happen further! I was on the verge of tears at 3 points in the movie and simultaneously I was pitching for the two protagonists. The comet scene with the song SPARKLE in the background provided a breath-stopping view of the beauty of the scenery. End of the movie was mentally satisfying when you are so much into the characters that any more tragedy might have made me crying my heart out. <br/><br/>Now I admit that it took me 3 viewings to fully understand the story due to its complex plot but when you think you have seen every good story in the world then such a refreshing original story is really a big welcome. <br/><br/>Now something about the background score and music! When you are watching a foreign language movie and there are no lyrics for the background music and even then you are perfectly in sync with the music, you get to know that the music composers, lyricist and singer have achieved a feat. Music is absolutely lovely. The end score ""Nande mo naiya"" was so ear-candy that I heard it like 15 times before closing this movie off! I immediately bought the Japanese original soundtrack and kept on listening (with English lyrics of course) to it for next 2 days. Only then I got to know that there is an English version of the movie and English version of songs. And now I am writing this review I am listening to the English version of the song ""Sparkle"". I am glad that I watched the movie in Japanese. May be if I would have watched the movie ""Spirited Away"" in its original language then I might have connected it to better. <br/><br/>I am looking forward to watching more anime movies and I am really thankful to God that I got to see this movie in this lifetime. I have recommended this movie to more than 100 people till now and still counting. Please give yourself a treat, a peaceful heart-touching rest by watching this movie with your loved one. May be if you are going through a rough patch of time in your relationship then this movie might just be the thing that will rejuvenate your love! Again I can just go on boasting about this movie for eternity but before that watch it yourself and prove me correct. <br/><br/>P.S. - The plot of this movie has a bit of resemblance with the Bollywood movie ""Haunted 3D"" which was India's first 3D in-home production, a horror zoner. Indian viewers who liked that movie would feel an instant connection with this movie. This movie is remembered more for its sweet love story and melodious music rather than for acting skills or overall storyline. Watch it at your leisure for the sweet horror love story and songs that you will keep on lipping for years to come."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","4","8","1 May 2017"," A Rare Gem, Beautiful on the Inside and the Outside
","Gorgeous anime in which a big-city teenage boy and small-town teenage girl swap places at night and affect change in each other's personal lives (just as soon as they've finished exploring their new bodies). The plot starts out fairly generic, but takes a twist in the middle that rescues it from ho-hum mediocrity and transforms it into something greater. It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest."
"RforFilm","10","4","8","27 April 2017"," For a romantic body swap story, Your Name is possibly one of the most beautiful, best anime features ever made
","What makes love hard to define is the connection that it develops between people. Think about the people that your with everyday. We think about friendship, love, lust, and companionship when your with those friends or lovers. The lines are drawn, but it can be blurred based on the invisible connection that you have with them. Even if you don't see them that day, you still feel their presence in your daily lives, as they feel the same in return. Not only is it metaphysical, but it's also feels like destiny when two lovers can feel that passion when their miles away. I've heard about these kinds of stories done in film and television, but I haven't seen it done in animation. I'm not talking about the countless Disney animated features that have the princess meet her man and their in love in three days; I mean a genuine romance that dives into to relationship and connection that two people have that's hard to explain. I'm thankful that a company like Funimation is willing to release such a film here in America with an English dubbing. So let's see how far a film like Your Name can push this idea. <br/><br/>In the small lake/mountain town of Itomori, a teenage girl Mitsuha is board of country life and wishes that she were a boy living in Tokyo. The next morning, she wakes up in an unfamiliar room. She goes along with it, assuming it's a dream, and finds out that the body belongs to Taki, a Tokyo-based teenage boy who is quiet and works as a waiter. When she wakes up the next day, she's back in her body, but finds out that her body swap was not a dream as her friends tell her she was acting weird the other day. It turns out that Taki had her body vice versa. <br/><br/>Trough a trust, Mitsuha and Taki make a set a rules on what to do when their body swaps happen. Taki ends up making Mitsuha more popular in school while Mitsuha improves Taki's relationships with his friends and boss at the restaurant. The two start to develop romantic feelings for each other, but after Taki fails to call her, the body swaps stop. Taki then uses his drawings of that mountain town to try and find it to hopefully find Mitsuha.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like much of a story, but I cannot give anymore of Your Name away as the majority of it is how much you don't know. It's a rare movie that not only has two twists, but is also a beautiful story of love. The script understands that true love happens over time, and the voice actors channel a lot of that emotion. Again, without spoiling it, the movie turns into an engaging mystery that made me want to see if the two would end up with each other. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about a romantic movie.<br/><br/>For a movie that didn't really need to be animated, Your Name looks amazing. When I think of good anime, I think of Studio Ghibli. This was produced by an independent studio that may just rival Ghibli. The animation is heavily detailed and uses it's style to it's advantage to tell the story of time-crossed lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if the production had started years ago, as I cannot imagine this being done quickly. <br/><br/>I'm sorry that I can't give more information on what kind of story this is, but if you knew, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did. Even after it ended, I told myself that I would go see this againÂ… which I will.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten comets out of ten. Though the summer season hasn't started, Your Name may already be my favorite movie of the year. It may be also one of the greatest anime features I've seen, up on the same levels as Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies. It's poetic, Shakespearian, philosophical, beautiful and engaging. I definitely recommend that you see this, in theaters if possible. If the stars can align and more people can see this, we can get more stories like this."

So here's my review, AS a movie fans.<br/><br/>It's anime. Some stereotype person who actually doesn't like animation movie might not interested to watch this, especially this is from Japan. I'm not naive, some people still think Hollywood animation is the best so they won't watch Japan animation movie. But seriously, change that thought guys. Watch animation movie from Ghibli Studio (recommeded: Howl's Moving Castel & Sprited Away. Disney even distributed them to the world). I'll say, those movie will literally blow your mind, as well as this movie. (period)<br/><br/>Story. Not going to spoiler but fans of fantasy, drama, and romantic as well as comedic movie will truly love this. 'Your Name' has really fresh story line (never read or watch story like this before, anywhere). A bit complicated but seriously outstanding. You have to keep focus to find some clues for the next moment to happen. But if you just want to enjoy it without guessing any moment, I tell you, you'll get goosebumps many many times.<br/><br/>And I think this movie will be nominated in Oscar next year ðŸ˜ƒ"

I can only remember vague things like how would one prepare a meal or how would other frown over my misbehaviour. These thoughts makes me feel sad and a little bit lost.
I followed this train of thought when i watched this movie. Japanese movies and animes usually follow these kinds of uncanny but strong sentiments and when done right(not too streched thin like in long-running animes), it is bullseye. Those men now how to manipulate my feelings. I have felt seperation and forgetting something i longed for.

Music is amazing throughout the movie and it massively adds on tension. I give music choice 10+ <br/><br/>Animation is done surprisingly well. Dancing parts are top notch. Running, talking. Everything looks so smooth and amazingly done. Characters are quite believable and you'll love every single one of them. Even the side ones that show only for a few seconds. Their dialog is neat for as much as i could understand it. 10 for animation and characters. <br/><br/>Now the story. It reminded me of Life Is Strange, which is probably my favorite game of all time ( even the music choice was similar ) because it has so much story and character involvement. And this movie succeeded in every aspect of character development, but i must say that story was redundant at some points. I dig sci-fi parts of it, but movie could've ended sooner than it was the run time and it would still be an amazing movie. It's like they needed some scenes just to fill the run time. NOW, don't get me wrong, story was excellent, it keeps you rooting for protagonist/s all the time. You'll feel sad at the time, you'll laugh, you'll be mad at some points.. there'll also be some ex-machina-ing. But overall, i give 9.5 for story. <br/><br/>Overall 10/10.

Everything in the movie was brilliant, the animation, the scenery and most of all the plot. The themes through the movie were strong, such as the talk of the threads of time or the ribbon, and much of the plot that at the time didn't seem very relevant came back in a way to remind the viewer. The ending was elusive too, I wished that they would remember each other and meet but weather they would or not remained uncertain.
I won't spoil what happened but I can confidently say its one of the best animated movies I've ever watched and I've watched several. Many of the themes felt similar to 5 Centimeters Per Second and if you liked that movie you'll definitely like this one."

"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","3","18 February 2018"," A big success in terms of visuals, audio and story
","""Kimi no na wa."" or ""Your Name"" is a Japanese anime movie that premiered in 2016 already and it took until now, early 2018, to make it to Germany, but the waiting was worth it. Writer and director here is Makoto Shinkai and this was his 5th full feature movie I believe and judging from the quality, I am not surprised that he is considered the next Miyazaki by many, even without the contribution of Studio Ghibli here. This was really a beautiful watch. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and takes us into the lives of a Japanese male teenager living in Tokyo and a female teenager living in the countryside. With a comet approaching Planet Earth, these two seem to be switching mind and bodies as a consequence of their dreams. This results in some pretty funny moments early on, but adds considerable gravity to the whole story the longer the film goes on, at least starting that very moment when we find out how they are not living during the exact same time. So it is a definitely a drama movie, even if Shinkai did really fine in using several established approaches to get in comedy too like the recurring boob humor that is executed so thoughtfully that it works very well and never feels cheesy or even offensive, then the scenes in which we see how female characters can get interested in something so enthusiastically or also thought process of recent mentions in a way you see on Family Guy, but in anime style of course.<br/><br/>But now about the more crucial factors here. I watched the German dub and I thought the voice actors did a really good job. The music was really beautiful to listen to most of the time and the soundtrack added a great deal of class to the film and many individual scenes. And in terms of the plot, the twist towards the darker, more dramatic side the film takes around the one-hour mark is one that worked incredibly well too while before that it was more entertaining for the sweetness, funny mannerisms of the characters and just the exploration of the whole situation. The element of death that is included afterward is one that will have you glued to the screen as it also adds a great deal in terms of character development. The eternal parallel between beauty and destruction was one that was mesmerizing. The moment the comet eventually hit the place and we were nearby to see it not knowing how many died and how many survived was one of the best of the entire film year to me. But this parallel I just mentioned also applies in terms of the subject of dreams, a very crucial one in here. As quickly as your memories are irrevocably destroyed, as sweet and breathtaking and special may your dreams be. There is no way to keep them though as the memory fades quickly and this is something I experienced so many times in real life too, which is why the film made an even bigger impact on me from that perspective. It was not a perfect film, but all criticisms I have with it are just minor really and probably entirely subjective, so I won't mention them in detail, so that you won't recognize them even perhaps from your standpoint. What else? Oh yes, all the characters are really likable and fun to watch and there is great charm to this movie in my opinion, lots of magic. It is also a film I am sure where you will see something new every time regardless of it being the second time you see it or the 20th time. I don't think that how much I liked it has to do here with my preference for anime or Japanese films and Japan in general, so you can also enjoy it without these preferences, but it obviously helps. The ending was slightly predictable that the film stops the moment they meet in real life for the very first time, but that does not make it bad. There were 2 or 3 moments before that too when the film could have ended and it would have been as good, maybe even better, but the actual ending is very good nonetheless. Overall, this was a touching, sweet, shocking, funny movie and it was really all I could hope for. I am really glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen as this is where it is far more effective than on a small laptop or television screen I'm sure. Still it is better seeing it there too than not seeing it at all. A definite contender for best animated feature from 2016 and boo to the Oscars and all the other awards bodies not showing it any love. This movie is a true thing of beauty and I highly highly recommend seeing it. And yes, it is an animated movie that is more for grown-ups than for kids for sure. Don't miss out here."

","What a beautiful movie and what an amazing story very minimal yet so complexe ( some christopher nolan animated shit lol), I am so pumped, first time an animation movie makes me wanna visit a country lol this film is an epopé, it explores different deep themes that we can't explore in one review , it's an epopé about our search for meaning, the signification of loveand identity; a movie about that deep longing for something or someone you can't quite grasp, the yearning that haunts you and leads you to find the remedy for the hole in your heart and find love or meaning, I guess that's what the movie is about. I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!"

"Raptorclaw155","6","1","1","9 May 2020"," I'm Still Not Convinced
","The film isn't incompetently made but I found it incredibly difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief with this one.<br/><br/>The body swapping is fine but I don't understand how sabotaging the other's life while acting as them somehow leads to romance between them. There are two possible scenarios this film offers in terms of the fate of Mitsuha and her hometown: either the comet destroyed it and everyone died or she managed to save everyone from the beginning. Either way, the whole sequence where Taki travels the ruins of her hometown is entirely unnecessary. My biggest fear is that they manage to change the course of history which is the only thing that could give the whole sequence of Taki looking for Mitsuha's hometown purpose but that would only make it worse for me. Ideally the film should have ended with Mitsuha's death or, to compromise, she had always survived the incident and they had both completely forgotten each other and it ends in a scene where they walk past each other completely oblivious to the other.<br/><br/>The magical aspects of films like this are what make Your Name so frustrating for me. Everything about the writing makes the film feel like the God of the Machine can force their bidding so that the outcome remains the same regardless of the circumstances.<br/><br/>Despite the litany of issues I have with the writing of the film, I will say that it is a good looking one almost seamlessly marrying 2D animation with CG animation. I also found some of the gags related to the body swapping plot device to be humorous though there is one particular one that's a bit overplayed.<br/><br/>I don't see where the romance comes from this. The two characters live each other's lives as the other so wouldn't it make more sense if romance happened between them and one of the other characters they met while being the other? I see the emotion and the voice acting is superb but I don't understand why these characters feel so strongly for the other.<br/><br/>I feel like this film could have gone in to more interesting directions than where it did and having given it another chance I'm still not convinced that this is the masterpiece so many others say it is. There's another film that is live action which is very similar to this one that came out the same year which, I think, managed to execute its variation of this kind of story much more effectively with considerably less.<br/><br/>The film is alright in my opinion but I'm in the minority. Most believe that it is a masterwork and I believe that, despite my difference of opinion, it deserves a fair shot for anyone curious about it. Don't necessarily take my word for it, see it for yourself and come to your own conclusion."

The body switching doesn't make sense, especially how she has a family history of this. The romance doesn't feel believable and isn't explained well.<br/><br/>Things I like: I really like the art style, especially how a contrast between city versus rural. The music is quite fitting.

The characters, especially the two mains are perfect, great design, great personality, and great voice acting. The art work is phenomenal some of the best animation I have ever seen in my life.
The really beauty of this movie is in the story, at first it may seem a little stale and cliche but oh boy, does it really get filled with flavor, mainly in the 2nd and 3rd acts, which are nearly flawless.
No matter who you are, give this move a chance. I stumbled upon this movie as an accident and almost didn't watch it, but I can confidently say it's the best movie I've watched in a long time and would easily place it in my top 25 movies of all time."

"TheOny13","10","1","1","25 August 2019"," Haven't been touched so much by an anime movie since Spirited Away!
","Going into this film I knew the last scene. And that was because a problem I had with a subtitle so I had to check the last phrase of dialogue to make sure it was fully synchronized. Even though having that in my mind I cried 3 times while watching this movie. I can honestly say it was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had in my life. I haven't been so moved (at least by an anime movie) ever since I saw Spirited Away.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is pretty simple and the movie lets you know it from the first minute. Having said that there is so much going on and the pacing of the movie was so good, that the 1 hour and 46 minutes flew by without even noticing it. The first act was a bit more funny as the two tried to find balance within this weird situation. The second and third act however were where things begin to fall apart and quite fantastic things happen that move you, inspire you, touch you, surprise you and maybe even shock you. The funny thing about watching this movie and about my experience watching this movie is that about two years ago I've read a very interesting book about relationships and how to have a good relationship (I mean as a couple). One of the main things that stood out to me from that book was this thing: ""Love your future partner even before you met him"". And I don't know why, but while I was watching this movie I was reminded of that. For me this movie reminded me of the fact that even though you might not yet have found THAT partner, It will come and when it comes be ready to already love him and pursue that dream of being with him/her.<br/><br/>As for technical aspects of the movie, I was astonished with how good was the animation even though it was hand made, at times some shots looked like a short real video. Absolutely stunning animation. The music was also incredible with an amazing soundtrack (musical score) and also songs with voice that were hart breaking especially due to the fact that the scenes they were in were superb as well.<br/><br/>I can't find a single flaw with this movie. The only thing that bugged me a little was the complexity of the story especially from the second to third act. Aside from that this movie was superb in every way and it is the kind of movie that reminds us about beautiful things in life and how we can achieve those things if we pursue them and love them. 10/10"

","Makoto Shinkai's YOUR NAME achieved what would arguably be a most improbable feat: it dethroned Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away to become Japan's most successful film. And what a movie it is! Heartfelt, hilarious, moving, thrilling, and enthralling, this movie cleverly mixes together the central idea from Disney's FREAKY FRIDAY with a bit of BACK TO THE FUTURE for good measure.<br/><br/>It's about two teens -- Taki and Mitsuha -- who somehow find themselves switching places in their bodies periodically. (A running gag involves Taki waking up in Mitsuha's place noticing ""his"" breasts.) Stakes get higher in the latter half when the two star-crossed strangers use that connection to avert a tragedy. Sounds like a bizarre story for an animated film, doesn't it? But it works. The first half in particular, where we see the difficulties that Taki and Mitsuha experience during their supernatural ""body swapping"" episodes, is hysterically funny. It's only in the second half when things get a little slower, but even then, Shinkai manages to maintain a lot of interest for the viewers, notably in the form of a stylized ""time travel"" sequence and of course the chemistry between the leads.<br/><br/>The dubbing is very well done as well, as per usual by NYAV Post. Both Mike Sinterniklaas and Stephanie Sheh voice the lead characters (and apparently directed each other as well), and turn in great performances. The show stealer, though, is young Catie Harvey as Mitsuha's little sister Yotsuha, who arguably gets the best lines in the film: ""I see you're not touching your boobies today!"" she snarks at her sister.<br/><br/>YOUR NAME is more of a story for teenagers and adults, but kids might enjoy watching it, too, for aside from the occasional sexual innuendo (which is mostly played for laughs and frankly, is tame compared to what you would see in raunchier Anime), there's little else to offend."

The story and themes are very interesting and I found the film kept me engaged with shifts in tone / plot that felt natural and paced well.<br/><br/>Additionally the animation is gorgeous and a lot of the music was achingly beautiful.<br/><br/>However, some of the music (mainly the poorly timed pop ballads) felt out of place and actually served to draw me out of the experience as a whole. Some of the ballads worked but I felt the orchestral music alone would did a great job on the emotional cue's of the film. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I think the characters were slightly two-dimensional (or not as individualised as they could have been) and the story falls into a familiar and rather cheesy conclusion, but it fit the tone of the film overall, it just wasn't entirely believable. <br/><br/>Other than that it's a great watch and I'd happily watch again, it's a lovely film and does a great job at sucking you into its world.<br/><br/>4/5"

","Your Name is another great demonstration of Japan's great power in the field of animation. This movie is a great and deep emotional fantasy film that explores traits in Japanese culture few other animes have toyed with. The making of a certain form of sake is turned into an important 'beat' for the movie in a rather clever way and it's all to do with the lives of two teenagers: Itomori-resident girl named Mitsuha, and Tokyo-living boy called Taki.<br/><br/>This story encompasses the themes of time, intertwining lives and the implications of one's wishes to live a different life. For such a small-scaled fantasy adventure it sure covers some massive themes relating to the lives teenagers lead in this world. Is it alright to take anything for granted, or take advantage of one's life? <br/><br/>Makoto Shinkai does a good job answering these questions and building one of the most memorable love stories for our time. Your Name is a triumph in Japanese animation; and a surefire hit for children in the future."

","The movie shows the story of two teenagers that are complete strangers but they have a very weird connection. There are days that they wake up and suddenly they realize that they've swapped bodies. The movie shows how they learn to live with this strange connection but there's something more to it, something that I won't spoil.<br/><br/>I can't decide if the movie is fantasy, romantic, comedy or drama because it has a little bit of every one of those. The movie looks beautiful and is very unique, I haven't seen a movie like it in my entire life. The movie is very funny, I was at the theater (almost full) and everyone was laughing a lot at the parts where the movie wanted us to laugh. And it doesn't have a problem to find a balance between comedy and seriousness throughout all of its run time.<br/><br/>The two main characters, Mitsuha and Taki, are just two normal teenagers that go to school and hang out with their friends but you care about them and because of this you feel invested in the story. You can feel a lot of emotions throughout the movie and for me, when a movie does that, is the best thing in the world. Honestly, I couldn't find a single flaw with the movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie you can't miss. Even if you are not a fan of anime you can enjoy this movie. I enjoy anime but I almost don't watch it but I really loved this movie."
"tdl288","10","3","6","13 July 2017"," A film is very great!
","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","6","25 June 2017"," At its heart a love story yet managing to encompass so much more
","I was not familiar with Makoto Shinkai prior to this film, but having watched it I want to go and explore everything he has ever made. Because this film is easily on par with the best I've ever seen from Japan. The visuals, the characters, the depth of storytelling, the outlandishness of the central idea.<br/><br/>The story goes that two Japanese teenagers, one a country girl longing for Tokyo and the other a city boy searching for a direction in life, start to exchange places as they go to sleep. The girl inhabits the boy's body for a day and vice versa. And as they try to solve and understand this mystery, the oddest possible long distance romance starts to bloom.<br/><br/>And if that was all, it would be a lovely movie in its own right. The characters of Mitsuha and Taki are both excellently realized. They both act and react to this amazing situation very realistically and are both filled with personality. And it's not romance at first glance. How could it be? They clash, they argue, they mess with each other's lives. But from that fire an understanding starts to emerge and in the end you totally buy that these two would be perfect for one another. One of the best on-screen romances I've ever seen.<br/><br/>But the thing is, the movie is so much more than that. It's about the life in the rural Japan versus that in the city. It's about being young and undecided. It's about friendships and those long summers before a major shift in your life. They even throw in a great action mystery towards the end, without it in any way taking away from the central story. Quite the opposite in fact. The mystery actually explains and solves many of the seeming inconsistencies in the story.<br/><br/>Plus the visuals, the score, all the technicals. Superb, grand, majestic. Studio Ghibli will always be my favourite for its old time charm and the beauty of its hand-drawn craft, but Shinkai comes as close to that impossible standard as it is possible to come with computers.<br/><br/>Though, if I had to nitpick, I would wonder why the film needs a pop song number in the middle of it. But that's the only crack the film has. The only one.<br/><br/>Your Name is a wonderful film. It takes numerous strings, plots and characters and seemingly without effort weaves from them a story that is as true and will remain as true as the life it's imitating. Highly recommended for all."
"MrDHWong","9","3","6","21 June 2017"," Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places
","Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5 Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Garden of Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film once again showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignant story while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.<br/><br/>In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreams of a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy. One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (in Taki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least until the day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually can periodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does as him happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories of these events quickly fade away with time.<br/><br/>Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, Your Name is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director Makoto Shinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell such a carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film is very reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Friday and Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by the hands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybody delivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling without seeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbed version, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"
"patrik-esk","10","3","6","1 June 2017"," Well executed tropes, ingenuity and visual porn
","Who would have know... This gem took a while to cross the oceans into western audiences cinemas, and it was worth every minute! It is a signature Makoto Shinkai piece, the visuals are just beautiful, the dedication to representing modern Tokyo and the Japan country-side is mesmerizing, a work of art which carries intensity and uses all at its disposal to provide a truly cinematic experience, including a great soundtrack! Story wise I can't praise enough the well executed tropes from the genre, and the appropriately quick pacing which respects the audience capacity to follow the flow. Plot wise there's no overly complicated setups (altough some would argue the plot is complicated...), the hooks are fantastically delivered and more than delights the viewer with their conclusions. The main character relationships are always on the forefront, and the secondary characters are well fleshed out, the audience grows to love them.<br/><br/>Can't recommend enough Kimi no Na wa doesn't revolutionize, but neither does it have to, it is plain simply excellent. 9.8/10"
"valen060","9","3","6","27 April 2017"," A Compelling and Captivating Journey
","I went to see 'Your Name' (Kimi no na wa) at an art house theater and when I did, I was left compelled and in awe of how such a story really grew on me. The thematic material felt remarkably similar to Hayao Miyazaki's way of storytelling that it makes director Makoto Shinkai look like he now follows in the same ranks as the renowned filmmaker (even if Shinkai himself humbly says it's an ""overestimation"" when being compared to Miyazaki).<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a teen named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, who have never met and live in opposite sides of Japan. For some unknown circumstance, they randomly switch bodies back and forth while they sleep and live each other's daily lives. During that time, they learn more about their likes, dislikes, activities, the people they know, and places they go to up until they reach a point of understanding one another on an emotional level that they must meet in person.<br/><br/>Shinkai definitely unveiled such a setup with vibrant settings of both Japan's countryside and its traditional customs. Likewise for the overwhelming, yet lively urban city of Tokyo and especially the assortment of likable characters that it had a great balance of both good humor and touching moments. Although the motif of switching bodies has been done numerous times in past films or shows for years, this however provided a deeper sense of atmospheric warmth and compassion occurring between both Taki and Mitsuha. Not to mention the use of the proverbial Red String of Fate used as a metaphor to emphasize their connection. I acknowledge that Shinkai admitted in one interview that he wanted to keep expanding on the movie's mythos and pathos, but couldn't for studio-related reasons. As for me, I felt that perhaps there could've been more done as well (namely on the film's epilogue), but nevertheless it's a movie that flowed seamlessly well with an interesting blend of music done by J-rock band Radwimps that I wasn't left bored in the least.<br/><br/>Moral: Trust your heart by running down the uncertain path and see that you'll feel this sense of yearning you never knew you had.<br/><br/>I certainly did."

"aguerrazzi","10","3","6","10 March 2017"," Best Film, Animated and Not, I have seen in years.
","Disclaimer: This review is spoiler free and for the lazy reader, I will give ratings based on main categories: <br/><br/>Story:9<br/><br/>Art:10 <br/><br/>Sound:10<br/><br/>Character:9 <br/><br/>Enjoyment:10 <br/><br/>Overall:10.<br/><br/>Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I want to give my personal opinion on the film, with a rather unconventional review:<br/><br/>What is beauty? Is it the sound of the sea during a storm? Is it the sound of grasshoppers on a humid summer's day? Is it determined by any one single dominant element, or the fusion of several threads that come together, interconnecting, to form a myriad of colors in a tapestry?<br/><br/>What is a masterpiece? Is it a magnum opus? Is it something that fills us with pathos, until we are at the brink of tears, be they of joy or of sadness? <br/><br/>But more importantly, I ask you, reading this, how do you decide what constitutes a masterpiece and what doesn't?<br/><br/>Makoto Shinkai's latest work, Kimi No Na Wa, is all that and more. Setting the bar very high for following works, it sits comfortably among the greats in animation, if not filmmaking in general. He (Shinkai) has earned his place among the great directors of our time, and western animation could learn a lot about storytelling by example. I recently went to see this expecting to see your average slice of life/romance anime, and had my doubts, figuring it would have had all the usual clichÃ¨s, boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc at least, that is what the trailers would lead you to believe. But this film is anything but average, moreso I wouldn't even call it a film, but an almost two hour experience. A delight for all the senses it satisfies from the beginning to the end and it has a completeness to it that few other films may boast, not only among anime but among films in general.<br/><br/>That being said, this film is not perfect. In fact it very well may have several imperfections, mainly characters and storytelling (though it was a completely new topos for me); imperfections which more likely than not have been discussed at length by other people. All I can suggest to the reader, is to see it and decide for themselves. Anything else would do you, the reader, and the film quite an injustice.<br/><br/>Art, being human, is, by definition, imperfect in itself. But does that make the emotions that it evokes in us any more or less valid? A painting may have corrections, and a book may have errors. Are those works of art any more or less masterpieces just because they aren't perfect?<br/><br/>The truth is, nothing is perfect, nor will it ever be, not while created by imperfect beings. But why does that matter? Why strive for objective perfection, when we perceive imperfect things to be perfect?<br/><br/>It isn't a perfect film, but it is, possibly more importantly, a perfect experience.<br/><br/>What really else matters?"

"sidyadav2009","10","3","6","7 January 2017"," Indian guy fell in love with this movie...the most awesome romantic movie there is
","One of the major drawback of being an otaku in India is that anime is still part of a small subculture and so getting to watch anime by legit sources is difficult. You can't buy DVDs because they are not available, Funimation and Crunchyroll aren't active in India and few people get animax on their TVs and these few of those few people realise its worth. So, I started watching anime with pokemon in 2002 when i was four, followed it with Cyborg 009 and Dragon ball z. At a point, I had to stream Dragon ball z in 2009 at really slow speeds. I got 20mbps now but getting to watch anime is still a difficult task. Getting to watch Your Name(Kimi no Na wa) too was difficult but trust me it was worth it.<br/><br/>So, this story is about a countryside girl, Mitsuha and a city boy, Taki(that's an awkward sentence) who switch their bodies while they think they are dreaming but the truth is something else...<br/><br/>I didn't even read the plot before watching the movie due to the amazing critical reception and highly positive word-of-mouth. I mean that's what Indians do. But it is more than safe to say that this movie has surpassed my expectations. Silver Linings Playbook is not my favorite romantic movie anymore. This movie has outpaced major Indian romantic movies by miles.<br/><br/>What makes it so special is the original and highly compelling story line. There is good character development, especially the main characters, Mitsuha and Taki. I can't decide who I like more, Mitsuha or Taki. There is no mistake in the movie that can be seen by the naked eye and even if there was one, this movie's emotional aspect is so strong that it would have overshadowed the mistakes. I can't comment about voice acting here because i don't really understand Japanese. Subtitles are still my best friends. The visuals are striking and beautiful, especially Itomori ones. The degree of the fantasy angle is just right. It leaves people wanting more. Expect many gasps and sighs. The characters do get familiar with each other's lives but there always remains a sense of awkwardness and alien nature of each other's lives. The chemistry between the main characters is very good and it's the way they handle each other's lives that makes audience praise it and write reviews. Tear jerkers please keep tissues at your side. You will need them. Watch this one with your partner even if he/she is not into anime."

Makoto Shinkai somehow manages to make you feel close to the character and somewhat relate to them, so much that I ended up being really happy, really sad, tearing up a little for both those reasons, or thinking to myself ""Please don't end now, please don't end now"" in a lot of situations. The drawings are amazing, I had shivers just from looking at the sceneries. The music also is really good, the artists did a really amazing job with that whole aspect, props to them. Shinkai also made the movie seem longer than it actually is even if, in the end, it feels like it's been the longest and shortest 1 hour and 46 minutes ever.

","Let me start by stating that this film contains the most beautiful animation ever seen in a Japanese cartoon, hence the 3/10 score.<br/><br/>That being said, cinematography can only account for so much in a movie. In this case, the rest is simply a train wreck.<br/><br/>The movie is aimed at children aged 8-16 at most. The dialogue is a cringe-fest, characters are unbelievable and the story is boring. There is no suspense, no anticipation and no character development. <br/><br/>The typical anime character are present here and everyone is expendable to the story, which is a mess. The intrigue is without substance and won't entice a shred of interest on behalf of the viewer. This is a rare instance where my biggest anticipation was for it to be all over. <br/><br/>If you've seen ""Only God Forgives"", expect the same kind of filmmaking: all the efforts went into the visual side of the movie. The rest is horrible. It needs a special level of immaturity to be enjoyed. Adults cannot be entertained by this.<br/><br/>The definition of over-hyped."

","Had high expectations due to the hype and I liked Shinkai's previous works, but was disappointed that it really wasn't special. The plot is bland and predictable, the mystery not quite so mysterious, and you're expected to suspend disbelief but then one would expect an incredible journey that makes it all worthwhile when in reality it's all rather pedestrian of the usual teenage pulp romance genre. <br/><br/>The implausible we are asked to believe thus becomes rather irritating - when the great unraveling of the ""mystery"" is anything but.<br/><br/>I far prefer Studio Ghibli's wistfulness and sensitivity in their approach - there's something magical and enthralling in their hinting at young romance. Even in the realm of the impossible, eg Arietty, the story-telling is compelling enough to make the deeper currents palpable.<br/><br/>Oh well, different strokes and all that..."

Name and address of the person could use your body isn't something worth noting down so what is worth enough?) <br/><br/>5.

","Warning: A very warm movie with a scent of contagious nostalgia.<br/><br/>Like other notable Studio Ghibli movies, the director Makoto Shinkai widely uses realism to touch the minds and hearts of his audience. From the beginning, the breathe-taking and very realistic imagery pushes you to keep watching the movie. Immediately, we are introduced to the two main character's backgrounds: high school student Taki who lives in Tokyo and is distracted by his studies and part-time job, and Mitsuha, a young girl who lives in an isolated town and daydreams of going to Tokyo. One day, Mitsuha wishes with all her heart to have a life in Tokyo and somehow awakens the ancient Japanese Gods who allow her to switch lives and bodies with Taki.(Freaky Friday, much?) However, what is most interesting in this case, is the theme of being unsatisfied with the present, and longing to be in another area or period of time, even.<br/><br/>Though we are focused on Mitsuha, the turning point in the movie is focused on Taki's realization that Mitsuha has been writing his diary entries for him. Taki is really the main character who has to juggle with the much harsher repercussions of realizing that someone has been swapping lives with him and how they're effecting his job and daily life. At this point, Taki is bewildered but infinitely curious about who this person is. Then, he decides to call Mitsuha with the phone number she has provided. Yet, he can't reach her phone, which we realize is because she does not exist, not in his world, at least. So, Mitsuha is imaginary in Taki's world, and Taki is imaginary in hers. On both ends of the spectrum, Mitsuha and Taki are different periods of time, one where (Mitsuha's) country (or town) still exists and one where it doesn't. Connection to nature, in this case, Mitsuha, is nonexistent in Taki's world. In fact, the loss of connection to spirit and nature is quite a conventional theme of films directed by Japanese animation directors such as Miyazaki and Shinkai (just to name a few). This theme is not coincidentally used in the majority of Japanese-produced (animation) films (see: metaphors in Spirited Away), but reflects the conflict of many, if not, the majority of working Japanese middle-class, who convey a large percentage of Japan's population. Many of these people are completely immersed into their work, thus gradually missing a spiritual connection to their ""religion"" and home. (Notice: the shrine is an important symbol for home) A great amount of Japanese people leave their hometown ""the countryside"" to move to a bigger, more ""successful"" city, in this case, Tokyo. It can be suggested, then, that the movie has attracted the majority who face this conflict daily, which could explain how it became a box office hit in Japanese theaters. This leaves me to presume that Taki and Mitsuha are moving metaphors of City versus Country, of Modernity versus Tradition. Both of these metaphors are moving towards each other. City yearns for the country, while modernity yearns for tradition. This reflects the sad state of Japanese society (and other societies as well): the feeling of artificiality in the materialism of city life. The feeling of ""something missing"" or emptiness in the working nonstop 24/7 life. Indeed, the most beautiful moment in the movie is in its final scene, when Taki and Mitsuha reunite after 8 years and realize who they are and what they mean to each other. After all those years, Mitsuha (and Taki) realizes that Taki still needs his ""country"". ""Country,"" or more specifically, home, will always come back to remind you where you came from. Absolutely loved this movie and 10/10 recommend."
"jasmineleitch","5","8","28","14 February 2017"," I think this is overrated.
","I have watched a lot of Anime films, and have heard recently that Your Name is very popular, an amazing film, heartfelt, top seller, etc. <br/><br/>However, I feel Most Ghibli films and other anime films such as Wolf Children to be much better (sorry for the comparison). But, me watching so many of these kinds of films and reading a lot of manga similar to it; seemed very cliché.<br/><br/>It didn't really felt like the plot had a message to convey, though I did really enjoy the plot. I personally love the swap body plot-line in manga. But I feel, it is not really original and some aspects over-used. I felt a strong resemblance to 5mm per second. <br/><br/>What mainly spoilt the film for me was the singing. It was the same song and was used around 4 times over the course of the whole film. This got annoying and I went straight to turning the film off as soon as it went on credits. Which I don't do in other films I really enjoy. Though it is personal preference on the song used, I think it's a bit too much to use the same song 4 times in a film. Actually, I don't see any need to use it more than once!<br/><br/>I also didn't feel any heart strings pull like other anime films for me. <br/><br/>Although, I would say the art is outstanding and really pretty. (though I do wish when characters cry in anime, they make it more realistic with the face, too much perfection.)<br/><br/>All this is just my opinion though. I would not say ""Don't watch it because it's crap"", I just think it's overrated."
"WandererinS","Null","23","104","11 September 2016"," Really disappointing
","I really watch the film with high expectation,but rather than the gorgeous animation I can't find anything else to talk about,the music was impressive but that's not something to put higher. The story and the characters were so mixed up and felt out of place,in the beginning, i enjoy a bit but as soon it progressed,everything was out of logic and I was like what I'm supposed to enjoy in this,I agree there was some force emotional moment but that doesn't make my outlook for the story any different,in short, it begin with comedic way turn into an illogical roller coastal and ended in the same manner. The characters weren't even developed. Doesn't matter how good is the animation,it can never have the upper hand over something vital like the main story."
"RobLuvsTheMountains","5","4","11","7 October 2018"," stunning visual effects but that's all
","This movie has drop dead gorgeous/ stunning visual effects, however the plot is confusing and the ""teenageyness"" was just too annoying. The scenes where the characters become aware of their different gender parts is really strange, not amusing, just weird. There's not enough plot. I felt completely drowned by the visuals and the music. (I actually paused the movie in order to search for an option to silence the music and only hear the dialogue, to no avail. Perhaps I would have liked the movie more if I could have accomplished this.) I was desperate for meaningful dialogue and deeper character development. If you are interested in anime you'd be better served to watch the following: Ponyo, A Letter to Momo, When Marnie Was Here, The Secret World of Arrietty, Vampire Hunter, Howls Moving Castle, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro; to name a few."
"chrisyanin-22311","10","2","4","1 February 2020"," Inevitable
","Have you ever watched a movie for the first time and thought it was 'just good', but once you rewatch it, you finally realize that it's not just good, but near perfection. That's what happened when I watched Your Name. At first I just liked it because I had to constantly read the subtitles and understand the plot. But later on, I watched it for a second time, and started paying attention to certain details, like the animation, the performance of the voice actors, the likable characters, Japanese culture, but the best and most impressive one of all is the music by Radwimps. Their songs go so well in every scene in this movie, especially ""Sparkle"" in the final moments of the film. And that is one of the main reasons as to why this movie is a ""Masterpiece"" in my eyes. This movie is without a doubt the best animated film of all time, with Spirited Away a close second. It's such a shame that pathetic, lazy people from Hollywood just take ideas like this and start making their own versions. In the end, it doesn't matter, Disney will always be in the shadows of Japanese Anime. 10/10"
"MidnightSerpent","9","2","4","28 November 2019"," Your Name is a fantastic escape into a dreamlike world that shows us the beauty of our own
","Ever since its conception, storytelling has been used as a means of escapism. With its characters and settings brought to life in another reality, we are able to be transported from our everyday lives into something more spectacular. At its core, Your Name is all about this idea of escape. From its whimsical storyline to its otherworldly atmosphere, the entire movie feels like a fantastical dream. And an absolutely incredible one at that.<br/><br/>STORY - 8.2/10<br/><br/>While it takes place in the very real setting of modern-day Japan, the story is packed with supernatural elements. Just like a dream, you start off not really knowing what's going on. But soon enough everything starts to naturally unfold, managing to consistently maintain interest in its entire 2 hour runtime. There are also some really well done plot twists and moments of tension littered throughout, which I honestly wasn't expecting from a high school romance movie. On top of all that, there's a solid layer of depth that explores our connections with the world and the people around us. There are of course some minor flaws, like how explanations for the supernatural elements are mostly brushed over. But while it's nothing groundbreaking, Your Name's storyline is definitely a fascinating one from beginning to end.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS - 6.5/10<br/><br/>If there's a weak link in this movie, it'd have to be the characters. They aren't bad; in fact the personalities and interests of the two leads Mitsuha and Taki are explored quite well in the beginning of the movie. But there's really not much depth to those personalities, which leads to some shallow character development from both. Similarly, the supporting characters feel just like supporting characters - nothing much more than devices to move the plot forward. Having said all that, the movie somehow manages to really make us care about its characters. It's tons of fun to see them go through dreamlike journeys of their own, much like the audience's own dreamlike experience when watching. Their feelings start to become your feelings. Their desires become your desires. This was especially true for me near the end of the movie, where I wished with every fiber of my being for a happy ending for the characters.<br/><br/>ART - 9.8/10<br/><br/>Though its story is largely supernatural, through its visuals is where Your Name truly leaves the boundaries of reality to become something else. The hand-drawn art is stunning, and every single frame of the movie is more than wallpaper worthy. The animation is buttery smooth, with everything flowing, bouncing, or panning in the most satisfying way possible. The cinematography is breathtaking, utilizing ultra wide shots to create a massive sense of scope and beauty. And the movie is filled with visual symbolism in every nook and cranny, adding even more meaning to an already rich story. All of these aspects combine together in the best way possible to create a dreamlike atmosphere nothing short of ethereal.<br/><br/>SOUND - 8.7/10<br/><br/>The soundtrack only helps add to the atmosphere, beautifully complimenting every scene that its used in. Some tracks that particularly stand out are ""Sparkle"", ""Zenzenzense"", and ""Again to Goshintai"", all of which give me chills on demand. A minor complaint is that the soundtrack mostly just sounds pretty without adding much meaning to the story or its characters, but its still plenty enough to elevate the entire movie to a higher level of emotion. There are also some great sound effects that really help add to certain scenes, like a dramatic bell or a chorus of wailing whales. There's a particularly amazing scene which uses complete silence to turn something already spectacular into a borderline masterpiece. And as you'd expect from a fairly high budget movie like this, the voice acting is on point and does not at all detract from the immersion.<br/><br/>OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9.2/10<br/><br/>I've said it before and I'll say it again, this movie feels exactly like a beautiful dream. Every time I watch it, I feel truly disconnected from the real world and absorbed into one more beautiful, innocent, and happy. And at the end of the day, that's exactly why I watch anime, go to movies, listen to music, or consume any type of media - to feel a sense of happiness that I can't get from reality. And in this sense, Your Name is an overwhelming success."

Yet, when the movie goes on, you are presented with a way more complex, intriguing, breath taking moments, not to mention the last 20 minutes, which literally will have your heart pounding and probably crying
The characters are extremely well developed, the scenarios are excellently drawn, animated, the soundtrack for the most comic/dramatic events...everything is just excellent.

"solahuddeen","10","2","4","17 May 2017"," An experience everyone has been longing for!!
","This is a film that starts off as a rom-com and later develops into one of the greatest film I've ever seen in my life. Some people might think the plot is complex while some might think otherwise. However, I believe that this film shows how director Makoto Shinkai really trusts his audience in putting the pieces together themselves thus proving how mature this film is, spiritually speaking (u'll get it once u watch it).<br/><br/>Besides, the filmmaking technique is masterful and extraordinary. If compared to his (Makoto Shinkai) other films, this is definitely the fastest in terms of pacing. Some viewers might not manage to keep up so there is definitely reasons to re watch this film too many times. LOL. The editing really keeps the audience grounded, yet so free dreaming in the fantastical experience that one does not realize that they have been longing for since a long time ago. This is surely a legendary journey that one should not possibly miss so don't forget to buy it on Blu-ray!<br/><br/>Oh, and the animation, FREAKIN GORGEOUS!<br/><br/>***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Moving on to to the romantic aspect of this 112-minute long film, the feelings that developed between the main characters are shown quite subtly before reaching the climax. I have to praise how director Makoto Shinkai exploits the body-swapping element by making it happen to characters who are almost impossible to meet thus making the experience of knowing each other much more interesting."

The way this film presents the story and incorporates themes of love, time, and wonder was phenomenal. The way everything weaved together was interesting to watch from beginning to end, and ultimately served for a greatly enjoyable and at times very emotional experience.<br/><br/>There were humorous moments, there were sad moments, and other moments of adrenaline and suspense. The main characters themselves were interesting and instantly relatable for me, causing me to identify with and care about them as the story progressed. The way that their relationship with one another develops and the journey they embark as everything unfolds is well-done and quite memorable.<br/><br/>There are a few twists and turns, and even though many people would have an idea of how things would play out the film nonetheless does a masterful job of gripping the viewer and making them enjoy every second of it. The twists that occurred were thought-provoking, as was the entire concept and what the film was trying to say in general.

Likewise, Your Name is one of those movies whose plot repeatedly defies expectations and whose premise the audience will not likely pin down until the credits are rolling.<br/><br/>Written with love and captivatingly delivered, Makoto Shinkai has written a story that would be done a disservice were it described only as a Slice of Life; a genre that Japanese animated and live cinema have already redefined. It is a love story, an Epic, a coming of age story and a comedy. Above all Your Name is quintessentially Japanese. Shinkai effortlessly synthesises life in rural, traditional Japan with the Westernised cityscape of Tokyo, draws on shared tragedy and explores the dual natures of progress and the loss of one's history. Your Name also bridges the gap between mythology and science-fiction. The effect of this blend is not to contrive the plot or overshadow the characters but rather serve to help realise both."

Other movies such as Spirited Away, are better than Kimi No Na Wa, but ""Garden of words"" one of my favorite Makoto movies has also been included in some scenes of the movie, so overall I can say Makoto has worked hard on this movie and he deserves every award he gets.

","FIrst off let me start by saying I'm not familiar with any works of this legendary Ghibli and their works, nor Shinkai Makoto's previous work to compare this to any of that product. I'll simply write this review as someone who has seen the movie and find it enjoyable.<br/><br/>As someone who has seen some Japanese animated works, I can say that Kimi no Na Wa is very well done. It is not your usual cartoon, there're so much dynamics in the picture and note that the landscape are very beautifully drawn and it really has very gorgeous scenes from time to time.<br/><br/>The voice actors were brilliant, and I strongly suggest you see the sub version rather than the dub (I don't know how the dub will be done but the Japanese voice actors is nothing sort of amazing, especially considering that they have to voice a boyish/normal girl and a girlish/normal boy throughout the movie).<br/><br/>The plot is relatively simple, but some twist make it very special. While it's true that this theme of girl and boy swapping bodies is not entirely new, Kimi no Na Wa elaborate it more: showing the anxiety and enjoyment that the two have without abusing it's sexual aspects and in turns build a unique bonds between the main protagonists which make their struggle to find each other more meaningful.<br/><br/>The feeling of Japanese culture can be felt throughout the movies, with traditional symbols, such as ceremonies, braided cord, the shrine, forest, and also with dialogues, but it never felt boring as they are very beautifully paced.<br/><br/>The music are well composed, and well timed. They bring so much emotions to the scenes. I have never heard anything from RADWIMPS before but they were brilliant on all singles they have on this movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a very enjoyable ride, and satisfying experience for me. It's a pity I have never got the chance to see it the 2nd time. If they release a blue ray, I would try to get my hand on it. Also, I'll recommend anyone who watch this search for the novel as well, it describes some of the characters' thought that the movie can't show.<br/><br/>It's not really 'perfect'. There are some part of the plot that seems questionable, but for all it is, Kimi no Na Wa is a beautiful and enjoyable emotional ride, it will enchant you through it's 100 minutes duration."

A well balanced mix of Tokyo, and Japanese countryside -Heartwarming, and gorgeous. A story about a boy and a girl connected through their dreams, and the impact they make in each other's lives via the dream connection.

"gercs","9","2","4","10 December 2016"," Shinkai's gem at par with Studio Ghibli's best
","Given that Studio Ghibli is in hiatus in creating its own production (it has collaborated in the film ""The Red Turtle"" this year 2016), I thought that it will take time before we see another animation gem from Japan. Well, it's refreshing to find out that we soon have another animation on a level at least at par with one of Studio Ghibli's best outings.<br/><br/>It didn't really get my attention at first since it seems that it's like your typical teen movie about young love or another so-so film with outrageous story-line -- taking note of the body swap plot. The first part is apparently absurd because what just happened is that they have swapped bodies, which might be just another layer of a character's dream or might be the actual thing that is happening in the story. That ""absurdity"" made me curious; and given the edgy editing, interesting characters, and funny dialogue, I was immediately hooked until I get even more intrigued because it seems predictable but at the same time it seems exactly the opposite. Well, I'm happy to tell everyone that it did impress logically and creatively speaking. The welcomed confusion from the beginning was totally paid off by a transcendental revelation, making the whole experience -- with the sky, the comet, the thread of time, the music, the tragedy -- like a dream in itself. After that high point, I didn't really bother how it is going to end because I found myself cheering already on how did things unfold with substantial originality.<br/><br/>Although I find the ending conventional and a bit melodramatic for me, and also the first half quite uneven in style, I think I have found another animation gem just like the first time I discovered Studio Ghibli's gems in the past. This film reminds me of Studio Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart"" combined with the creativity of ""Inception"", and the sophisticated plot of ""Interstellar"". We might not see another full-length feature from Hayao Miyazaki anymore, but cheer up because we might see another one from Makoto Shinkai. Hopefully he will rise in the same heights as Miyazaki, and he doesn't have to be the next Miyazaki, really, because ""Your Name"", as Shinkai's breakthrough at new heights, is something different and compelling in a different way."

The theme songs, background music are just perfect. Great drawings, attention to details.<br/><br/>Please try to stick to the Japanese version (I have heard that they are matching it with an English soundtrack), and avoid any spoiler, even the brief introduction of the movie, it's the best way to learn the whole thing.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a movie that great in years, strongly recommended. Just hope that the same thing will happen to me! Please help me god!!"
"bhsaga","Null","2","4","6 November 2016"," A wonderful film
","Makoto Shinkai's latest film is wonderful. <br/><br/>It has a superb soundtrack, amazing animation and an intriguing plot. <br/><br/>The characters are well developed throughout the film as the viewpoint switches between them in an novel way. <br/><br/>The way the ending was resolved was satisfying and appropriate. <br/><br/>Most probably my favourite film of 2016.<br/><br/>* major spoilers *<br/><br/>The comet that destroys the girl's town could be taken to represent the Fukushima/Tohoku disaster and ways to prepare for such events in the future. <br/><br/>The film mixes serious parts such as the town getting destroyed with light hearted comedy. Some these jokes rely on which words are used by each gender. In one example the girl as the boy uses Watashi (which is taken to be effeminate), she then tries to use different versions of I until she gets the right version, I am curious how they will handle in this in the English dub."

","I must say I though it would have been hard to find a director who could hold a candle to master Miyazaki but here comes Makoto Shinkai with this tender and soft yet profound story.<br/><br/>What really hit me hard, besides the artistic direction which was stunning, was the unexpected plot twist that gets the story really interesting driving it from a funny and light teen-based comedy to a really remarkable reflection about time, space and the interconnectivity through all things.
The only ""bad"" note I can make is about the soundtrack. Not as in it wasn't good, but in the way that I didn't quite like all songs; but maybe I'm just too used to the highest Joe Hisaishi standards.<br/><br/>In conclusion I can't really believe I waited all these years to finally enjoy this touching story and if by any chance you're reading this, don't waste any more time and jump into this beautiful tale and get lost in it like I did."

","Oh man did I like this movie! It has everything I look for in a movie: an interesting plot, deep relatable characters, and an atmosphere that leaves a lasting impression for a long time.<br/><br/>I heard about this movie a long time ago but the summery didn't sound interesting enough for me. I'm not a big fan of romance nor drama. I decided to eventually give it a try due to the quarantine, and it exceeded my expectations greatly.<br/><br/>My only issue with the movie is that it starts slow and gives the impression of a simple romantic drama. I didn't mind much since it drew me more into the story and the character's life, but my husband was extremely bored, so I suppose it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>But the plot twist in the middle! Wow! I didn't see it coming. I was at the end of my chair until the movie ended. I especially noticed that they kept the characters reactions not over the top like it's done in so many Animes, it gave a more realistic feeling and felt more like watching a movie and not a cartoon.
Also, the animation is amazing.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece. It's not often that I watch a movie and then still keep thinking about it a few hours later. Too bad you can't see this kind of depth in Hollywood movies that have a much bigger budget."
"w-71474","6","0","0","25 April 2020"," I don't like it very much, the plot is very common
","There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called ""your name"" is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. ""Qian and Qianxun"" also talked about ""your name"". Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of ""who am I"". And ""Your Name"" doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in ""Sky City"", Little White Dragon and Chihiro in ""Thousand and Thousand Seeking"", ""Hall's Moving Castle"" and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with ""Little Forest"", it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as ""The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space"". The flirty sentence ""I am waiting for you in the future"" is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as ""My Girls' Generation"", at least hearty, sweet and sweet. ""Your Name"" used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch ""Listening to the Ear"" a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme ""I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name"", it's better than a hodgepodge in the end."

","It may be a fantasy, it may be animated, but this is both beautiful and brilliantly entertaining. Mitsuha lives in a small idyllic Japanese town, but dreams of something bigger. Being a teenager, being the mayors daughter, she wants out. Taki lives in Tokyo, goes to school, works in a restaurant. When they go to sleep and dream, they switch places. They don't know why, but as they begin to understand what's happening they leave messages for one another to try to navigate each other through lives. Mitsuha seems to enjoy the excitement of Taki's life in the big city. Taki though finds her a meddling influence in what should be his life. There's a suggested spirituality to all this, with Mitsuha's grandmother explaining the concepts of connections, strings through time, through worlds. Despite this, it does occasionally have the tone of an American teen comedy, but it's far too gorgeous to be so one dimensional. On numerous occasions my breath away is taken away by the level of detail, not just in the animation, but the cutting and the plot. It's lovingly crafted with a staggering amount of patience. It doesn't really create a fantasy world in the way that so many Studio Ghibli films do, it's seems more interested in inserting a fantasy element into an otherwise normal everyday world. Then, just as it begins to feel normal, the switches stop and Taki sets out to find Mitsuha. The comet shower that appears to have been linked to the connection, turns out to have destroyed Mitsuha's village 3 years before she ever met Taki. Are they dreaming through time, is she a ghost? It does get a bit complicated, especially when reading subs and it's very sentimental, but I really enjoyed it. Mitsuha and Taki are connected through space and time, a bond that cannot be broken and delivers a fantastic finale that had me gripped! Comets, out of body experiences, an engaging love story and it really does look gorgeous too."

","At first I was enjoying watching this animation, it really appeals to your eye but not your brain. There are some ridiculous mistakes. How doesn't boy know the name of the place even though he can exactly draw the village? or how don't they know the time difference even though they use their phones quite a lot. Please not try to defend them like ""They were dreaming"". After realizing they are switching their bodies, they kinda gain their consciousness and they are even trying to not harm each other's lives and spending several days in each other's bodies. You must be dumb to not know the name of place you had been living for several days in someone's body or not realizing you shifted 3 years back and forth."

","This has grown to be one of my favorite movies of all time and I never get tired of it. One particular thing I noticed in the movie is how different the first half of the movie is compared to the second. Almost like two stories in the same universe, which implies on how detailed, satisfying and important the animation, music and every line in the movie are. It is an astonishing experience and, surprisingly, in only 1.5 hours. This is very intriguing because the movie feels much more than that.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely beautiful and lovely to the naked eye. The music drags the viewers into something that is indescribable, something so deep and benevolent that it's hard to pinpoint where this feeling exactly emerges from. The movie connects the fundamentals of this world to the edge of our current time. Somewhere between the beauty in Japanese lakes, forests, mountains, ancient traditions and myths all the way to the breathtaking cityscapes of Tokyo, a love bond between a city-boy Taki and country-girl Mitsuha defines how powerful and important love could be, and how the beauty of our nature needs to be protected."

"Koma-Mo","8","0","0","4 September 2019"," A beautiful film with a band blasting their music into your ears.
","Probably due to how lame and unentertaining these types of movies are, I tend to avoid movies that involve body swaps like a plague. What Shinkai Makoto did here with the story really was impressive as he added a bit of a twist to it and making a very cohesive and entertaining story. Makoto has a very unique style from the other current Japanese animators by providing films that are absolutely beautiful to look at, such as the landscapes and sceneries. He mixed these beautiful scenes with a surprisingly interesting story by having two interesting characters and for us to see them experience what is going on as they constantly swap bodies back and forth. I liked how the movie doesn't focus on certain tropes and used the comedic moments effectively. You understand who they are and end up liking both of them by the end of the film. Also, the twist that I've mentioned earlier is surprising and introduces a stake for these characters to overcome. This is where the emotional part hits extremely well as you end up cheering for them and you hope that everything will work out with them in the end.<br/><br/>The voice acting was surprisingly good, especially as the actors who voiced the main roles are not professionally trained voice actors. Both Kamiki Ryunosuka and Kamishiraishi Mone gave so much personality to their characters and were able to act emotional and funny when it was needed.<br/><br/>Not everything I have to say is positive as there were a few things that did have me not enjoy as much as other people have. First off, as much as I liked the characters, after a certain point, the movie takes a comedic route by going into a montage and the film skips over a few consequences or ends subplots that were introduced at the beginning of the film so quickly to the point where it felt like it wasn't necessary. I wanted to see more of a conclusion, instead of a quick scene to show to know that some problems are resolved and will never come back.<br/><br/>One of the major complaints is that parts of the film felt like I am sitting at a park, enjoying the scenery with someone dear to me, when suddenly, a band pops out of the bushes and starts singing their songs a couple of centimeters away from me. The band, Radwimps, did a great job and made a good soundtrack. However, just like in a lot of Japanese films and dramas, they tend to go very melodramatic and they add the music at the right time to sell their soundtrack, along with forcing people to feel a certain emotion. I instantly got annoyed when they started the movie with an anime style opening and would blast up their music so high that I couldn't focus or hear what the characters were saying. This would happen constantly throughout the film to the point that it got distracting and I wanted to plug my ears until the song had finished.<br/><br/>Despite what I said, I'm pretty sure there are people out there that don't mind those kind of things and they would enjoy the movie more. I personally don't like and still enjoyed it overall. I'm glad this movie was a big hit as we will be able to see more top quality animation from Makoto."

"Carrzinho","9","0","0","8 August 2019"," A wondrous experience.
","Your Name (2016)
At its heart it's a Japanese body swap comedy drama, but there's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Our boy Taki lives in Tokyo and girl Mitsuha hails from a rural village. There are genuine moments of humour as the two teenagers wake up in each other bodies for a day at a time, a couple of times a week. They return to ""themselves"" after going asleep with no memory and they try and piece together the previous day with notes left of each others phones and tales recounted by friends.
All in all seemingly a slight twist on a conventional premise but the plot becomes layered by celestial occurrences, time disparities and tragedy. What sounds complicated is wonderfully drip fed and tangible and makes for a compelling tale. The characters and friends have a warmth to them and you'll care about them.
As good as everything sounds so far the most enthralling thing is the animation. It's is right up there with the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. The village and surrounds are exquisite. The details are remarkable. The bustle and movement of Tokyo are magnificently rendered. It genuinely blurs the lines of animation and reality.
This movie is worthy of every acclaim and to be as outstandingly successful as it was in it's homeland. NINE"

"adrianlindeberg-82908","10","0","0","23 February 2019"," My favourite movie of all time
","Animated movies don't get much better than this.<br/><br/>STORY & MAIN CHARACTERS<br/><br/>In ""Your name"" we follow Mitsuha and Taki on a romantic adventure straight out of your own imagination.<br/><br/>When young Mitsuha and Taki start exchanging bodies, everything in their lifes would change. The viewer follows them on a exciting adventure of love, school life and growing into an adult.<br/><br/>Taki is a young boy from Tokyo living his life while going to school and working a part-time job. He's a compelling main character, someone who's easy to follow as the degenerate that I am.<br/><br/>Mitsuha on the other hand is a country girl. She lives out in the country, going to school and performing ceremonies with her family since they take care of the town shrine. She's an energetic girl, with dreams about moving to Tokyo and leaving her town. The viewer has an easy time relating to a girl in the same situation as her.<br/><br/>ART & MUSIC<br/><br/>My favourite part about this movie is not the characters or the story. It's the art and music. The art is excellent with wonderful colours and vibrant animations. There's not a single moment in this movie that isn't wallpaper friendly. Just screen cap any moment that you like and you got yourself a new wallpaper.<br/><br/>The music is also incredible. It's all produced by the band ""Radwimps"" and you can find the tracks on Youtube but also Spotify. It's some of the best music I've ever heard in an anime.<br/><br/>RATING & RECOMMENDATION<br/><br/>For me this movie is a clear 10/10. I watched it at home at first but then later went to my local cinema in Sweden since they actually had a screening there. In total, since it's release in Sweden. I believe I've watched it 5-10 times. Everytime it gets better! Would highly recommend to anyone interested in anime, Japan or just a fun and heartwarming movie! Be ready for some feels though!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading!"

For stories as exciting and full of feeling as this is that I really appreciate Japanese animation. It takes us to the story of two strangers with completely different lives who are destined to find themselves following the already known Legend of the Red Thread with the only drawback that without prior notice, both change their bodies, which forces them to live in each other's personal lives and they can not remember the other's name and their threads are intertwined with time. I was left with my mouth open with its animation so polished, with the warm landscapes and how real the characters feel. Without falling short, explore this concept passionately, as Miyazaki Movies has us so accustomed. I have cried, I have smiled and I have learned that true love waits. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and try not to be filled with tears like I did."

","This is a really sweet film. This anime has one of the most vibrant color palettes I have ever seen on screen and its animation clearly was worked on with a lot of hard work. To top it, the plot is really sappy and kind of melodramatic, but I don't think this necessarily hurts the film. People who love slice-of-life/romantic animes will get a kick out of this film, but I can't promise others that they will appreciate it as much since the third act does drag on and the use of music is a bit excessive creating a feeling of disingenuous drama.<br/><br/>For me, I did tear up a bit. The hand-painted cells are just amazing and I can be a sucker for sappy romance. And the plot does give something to the audience member to engage on. If I was a bigger fan of anime and was more tolerable of the ""Anime Music Video"" vibes I was getting from this film, I might have rated it higher.

","It was in the middle of my first semester in college when I got the chance to watch this film. It was a nasty and gross winter day. I expected the usual melancholy love story which Shinkai had did in his prior works. However, after watching this film I felt joy and happiness resonating in me and in a way enlightened my day (I watched it in the middle of the day).<br/><br/>This film's joy is routed in its soundtrack, story, and visuals. The film's soundtrack done by Radwimps, fits the tone and setting of the story so well. It has a nice mix of rock and classical music within soundtrack. The story is also very well done. I found the story even though basic at its roots to be very dynamic. The visuals, like usual, are stunning in this film. The backgrounds especially are truly breathtaking. Also, the character designs are a lot better than in his prior works. They are not great but they are better. Another interesting aspect of the film was its tone. The tone was really light heated compared to the rest of Shinaki's works that I have watched.<br/><br/>Some issues I had with the film is that the characters could have been more developed. I did enjoy the characters, but characters like Taki are given little character development and feel some what run of the mill. Another huge problem is the film's plot holes. A minor, but not too noticeable issue, is the pacing. During points in the film the pacing felt a bit odd.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film might not be masterpiece, but I still think it is a great watch. It is definitely the best of Shinaki's films (so far) and is personally one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching this film."

","Being an admirer of Studio Ghibli's films, particularly the sometimes overlooked quieter films like ""Whisper of the Heart"" or ""Ocean Waves"", I had high expectations of ""Your Name"". Rather than being disappointed, I was blown away.<br/><br/>It feels a lot different from Ghibli's works or even more recent animes but it didn't take long to be drawn into both style and story, as they go together perfectly. Yes, there's this touch of naivety and gullibility in ""Your Name"" as much as in many animes but I appreciate that. It's part of a creative and hopeful world of it's own powerful enough to make you take it for real for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>From setting to character design and also pacing and writing - there's nothing that could be criticized if you let yourself in for the world Makoto Shinkai and his likewise talented team is creating.

Spectacularly drawn visuals, specially the fictional natural landscape of itomori town. The chemistry between the lead characters is just owwww, which surpasses the barrier of time and space.

","Watching the trailer I thought this is going to be like Voices of a Distant Star or the myriad of similar anime since. Same nice scenery, piano music, long space and time communication , the touching of two people's souls (of course, high school boy and girl). And it was! Up until half of the movie. Then the original idea of the script kicked in and saved the story. I have to say that for people who have never watched Japanese anime this should be quite beautiful, but for long time fans it touches all the right buttons in a sort of mechanical and predictable way.<br/><br/>It is a very beautiful romantic fantasy, but it sure felt very derivative. I know nothing is truly original, but as the movie ended (in a quite predictable manner), I wanted a little more - I don't know what. Perhaps more than the cardboard characters or the dusk lit countryside scenery with the piano music. The only interesting character for me was the senior waitress from where Taki worked. The rest were all the childish Japanese cliches that you see in all the anime."

","""The disease which humans are last affected is ""hope"".""
This quote originated from Saint-Exupéry, the French author of ""The Little Prince"", is one of the sales copies of this film.<br/><br/>Blockbuster films always reflect an atmosphere of the era.<br/><br/>Once in Japan, in exchange for the energetic economy having drastically arisen by the recovery from the WWII, people had lost the relationship with others. Recently, they also released their economic advantages to other countries which has been their last resort. Moreover, tossed about by social network services targeting each person's approval desire, human relationships acceleratingly have become vacant. Nowadays, a sense of stagnation is spreading throughout the country.<br/><br/>Through this process, the chronic disease gradually infected people and several levels of their communities including nation, companies, men, women, young, elderly, and even children. The name of the disease is ""hopeless"".<br/><br/>In this film, a boy and a girl face the impatience that is not easily accessible to each other, quite typical in orthodox romance stories. Unlike the other ones, this irritating situation is highlighted by contrasting the spatiotemporal distance between them, and also the distance between this world and the other world derived from a Buddhism concept. This distance as best blend of these scientific and religious descriptions is the straightforward metaphor of the desperate gap between hope and hopeless in our reality.<br/><br/>Body switching, Sci-Fi, young romance, beautiful CGs, catchy songs, etc.... Crowd pullers are smartly packed into this film though, outstanding was its title. ""Your"" is the most equal word for everybody. Definitely this word sense gave sympathy to any generation, even to the elderly, thereby reminding of their own experiences: ""whenever and wherever in your life, fortune can be (or could have been) encountered."" This universal message could touch one's too dry mind like an oasis in a desert.<br/><br/>About sixty years ago just after the WWII, exactly the same titled film was also the blockbuster in Japan, when people had surely the hope to reconstruction supported by firm human relationships nevertheless in poverty. On reflection, since today's people are living in the era of a digital visualization of everything, they may retrospectively desire such an analog type of ""hope""."

","This is one of the best animes to come out of Japan.<br/><br/>It is such a beautiful anime with scenes that are actually based on real-life Tokyo. Not only that, but it has a really interesting storyline that is quite spiritual and makes you think about the difference between a body and soul (or a person's personality that is beyond the physical). It is all tied-in with the lives of two people who live far from one another, but have a destiny to meet.<br/><br/>I love it when the media of anime is combined with mature themes that can be enjoyed by the whole family.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended for anime fans.

"aliensbishop","2","15","64","11 January 2017"," A Sad Attempt at Channelling Donnie Darko
","Your Name has nice animation.<br/><br/>It is also a very soulless rehash of the much more entertaining story found in the film Donnie Darko. A catastrophe occurs and time travel/science magic makes a story possible. Only in Your Name, the story will be filled with painfully predictable and empty characters who end up succumbing to only-very-slightly-refined (if that) anime tropes. <br/><br/>I don't remember the character's names so I'll just say boy and girl. They switch bodies for some reason. The girl becomes the boy and vice versa. However, it becomes a series of gags. Enjoy.<br/><br/>In Donnie Darko, a plane engine crashes to earth and the main character, Donnie, is killed. However, the story of Donnie Darko actually takes us on a mind-bending journey that shows how this comes about. Your Name does not even attempt this. <br/><br/>Tokyo is a dirty city. Your Name does not show the dirty side of Tokyo. Viewers will be given glistening and idyllic views of train stations that torment the life out of millions of people everyday. This is no Blade Runner; you will not see a speck of filth. <br/><br/>Completely confused as to why this animated film is given any respect. Sure, Ghibli films are filled with the same idyllic scenery, but there is (almost) always something more to appreciate *cough* storytelling *cough* .<br/><br/>2/10 out of respect for the poor souls who had to render such sparkling scenes in spite of knowing they were bull****."

Eg. After the girl goes inside the boy's body she helps him ask his dream girl out.<br/><br/>Second half - tedious. The love story. After the 50 minute mark it all boils down to some clichéd love story. And worst of all is it drags on and on. Audience are forced to sit through 40 minutes of teenage love where one person is chasing the other relentlessly and with great desperation. I nearly stood up and yelled out ""Just STFU and move on you stupid cow!""!!!!<br/><br/>90% of the audience were Asian teens. During the film I heard a lot of laughter at jokes that were outrageously unfunny. There was a part where some cute dog appeared on the big wide silver screen and from the audience came this overbearing ""awwwwwwww' and in this I could detect the shrill voices of teenage females and males who wish to impress. That is not a problem, I am not trying to be mean in ANY sense. But these people might be the INTENDED TARGET AUDIENCE and where the majority of the reviews are coming from. This is worth keeping in mind."

","In this animated film, Mitsuha is a teenage girl living in a rural mountainous area of Japan. Taki is a teenage boy living in Tokyo. At various times, the two switch bodies.<br/><br/>The animation in this film is beautiful and there are clever moments in the film as well. When the story is comprehensible, it can be engaging. The trouble, as just implied, is that it is often difficult to understand. It's not always easy to know when each character is their real self or whether they are possessed by the other. To make matters even more difficult, the exchange is happening in different time lines three years apart.<br/><br/>I might have used the excuse that I'm not that familiar with Japanese Anime films but that won't work as I've probably seen at least a half-dozen of them. My favourite is ""Only Yesterday"" (1991) which happened to have no supernatural elements. Among those with magical content, I have great admiration for ""Spirited Away"" (2001) and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (1988).<br/><br/>The two latter films had special universes that were bizarre but fascinating. Most importantly, they were always understandable and consistent - characteristics that are missing in ""Your Name""."

","While I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what in the world I was watching. t was so complex and fast that I couldn't follow it. I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie. A girl and a boy is constantly switching bodies and I couldn't tell if the girl was herself or if she was the boy in her body.<br/><br/>Now, I do not like complex, intense coming-of-age stories like this so I was worried I wouldn't like it but I decided to try it since a lot of people thought it was excellent but I didn't know it would be a coming-of-age story. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I was still pretty disappointed. It was pretty iffy. It had a fairly interesting story because I like stories that focus on two characters with two different plots and I like the whole switching bodies thing but I just couldn't find myself relating to any of the characters. The characters can be rude and Mitsuha was also cloying. Taki was okay, but not great. I guess he was the only relatively interesting character out of this bunch.<br/><br/>The movie had too much crying in it. The only solid thing about this movie was the animation and the voice acting, they were pretty lovely. Most of the music sounded good. But the writing and the directing just wasn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>The end was predictable, the girl and the boy cross paths and they are shown as grown-up. I did not get how they were able to cross paths.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be highly overrated and do not get why people praise this movie so highly."

By the time i was half way through the movie, my world of imagination and consciousness was turned upside down being totally engrossed in this art. Having a fondness towards anime series but an inclination to shun any kind of anime movie, I couldn't be more satisfied and contented with the decision of watching this sensational work of Makoto Shinkai, the writer and director.The way both the characters develop is so brilliantly constructed that it makes you ship for their union irresistibly. The plot was suffice enough for an Oscar nomination but i wonder why it wasn't. If you add up the animations, the plot twist. voice dub, and yes especially the music!

It really suits with the scenario and with the characters as well making it the real beauty that it is.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with animated movies or more precisely to say Japanese anime.

After watching this movie I really honestly consider animation (anime or not) to be the superior storytelling platform, and again I cannot stress this enough I Don't LIKE ANIME. This movie is beyond anything I had ever seen before and it took days to recover from the emotional destruction it brought me"
"Reno-Rangan","8","2","5","24 April 2017"," They're no strangers, yet they've never met.
","Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.<br/><br/>We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).<br/><br/>The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.<br/><br/>For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.<br/><br/>❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞<br/><br/>Unlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.<br/><br/>The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.<br/><br/>In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.<br/><br/>Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.<br/><br/>Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.<br/><br/>8/10"

But wait for the story-line emerges you for the exact feeling of the main character. I feel like a lot more stories can be told but Shinkai tried hard to give a shorter version.

It features time warp and body switch, which is very much science fiction. However, the tone of the film remains down to earth and innocent, so the science fiction element is at the background.

However, in the hands of a lesser director this could have been really messy and jumbled. Instead, the themes of the film were always clear and its heart was always shining through. The screenplay effectively develops its main characters and you become incredibly emotionally invested in them, in a surprisingly large way that I myself didn't expect. It's a great film and it's only another example of how 2016 has proved to be a great year for animation."

","After releasing a gradually improving set of animations including 5 centimetres per second Shinkai has really compressed everything great about his style and fixed many of the things which troubled his previous work. Make no mistake this is the type of anime able to rival such renowned Studio Ghibli titles as ""My Neighbour Toro"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle"". No doubt this will soon go down as a classic. Without getting into spoilers ""Your Name"" is a compelling immersive anime experience with Shinkai making many, albeit risky, decisions none more rewarding than choosing one of his favourite bands RADWIMPS to act as the soundtrack. The artwork is detailed, beautiful and crisp whilst losing nothing in the natural movements of characters. This is the animation to show people new to anime. Its universal appeal lying in the themes of young love as well as tasteful amounts of science fiction. Whilst the writing and montage scenes may at times seem out of place the films ever-changing and expanding plot makes this a film viewers will easily connect with. <br/><br/>A truly wonderful film, and a gem amongst other anime movies in the last 5 years.

Yes the animation is beautiful but it can't tell the story. ""Your Name."" is just a bad taste anime to entertain the audience, and show how Makoto lost his own vision and style to made a popular popcorn movie (like Michael Bay did). The thing I can't stand the most is how the people keep hyping this movie (even Makoto told people do not go to the theater watch this movie). <br/><br/>The main characters are empty. They didn't have a real interaction, I cannot understand why the people think this is emotional. Okay maybe the emotion doesn't really need to be rational but I hardly feel the characters' mind. At the end, the story cannot express any feeling (the music is not suitable for the mood too).<br/><br/>In conclude, the whole anime is disappointing.

"Martinlindved","5","1","2","30 January 2020"," Touching breasts
","I chose this title because that is as close of a relationship the two characters have. Even in after a dramatic reveal the film refuses to let go of this gag.
The pacing is off: at first, it spends a lot of time showing the two main characters and seemingly allows the viewer to understand what's happening, bit then the film slaps the point in your face, grabs your arm and pulls you through 2 minutes of thick exposition that could've explored their unique relationship. It then reaches a reveal and a realization it undercuts with awkward humor and continues to focus on the teenage romance while keeping an inevitable and horrible natural disaster as a sub-plot as if two teenagers who never meet until the very end and doesn't know each other is more important for the targeted audience - the juxtaposition is comedic!
While the animation is beautiful as seen in for examples with apparent usage of rotoscope and the twilight-meeting, the awkward pacing and opening of the film makes me feel as if I'm watching a short-series cut into being a film. The forced music doesn't help as it gives me the impression this was cynically included for commercial success without making it contextualized and it even makes segments feel like music videos or AMVs.
Overall: good idea I wish had a clearer and more ""streamlined"" execution."

","Seriously, if you are interested in Anime but have never given it a try, this is THE one to go to first.
I have re-watched this countless times, and it still blows my mind. There are multiple plot twists to get through, and it is a slice-of-life, heartwarming, story of life and the things that separate us and bring us together with a supernatural twist. As a hopeless romantic, I can't help but have a full heart after watching this, and crying a little bit. There is nothing about this that doesn't go above and beyond. If anything, I wish they would make a sequel."

So I start this movie, it's going nice and fun. Peppy and cute but slowly it moves forward and it blows my mind. Don't want to spoil this for anyone at any cost but my heart sank after a long long time. I think I resonated a lot with the characters. Their agony, their pan and helplessness. It broke something in me. I loved this movie. The characters were written perfectly and yes not that clichÃ©. It wad lovable and pretty and I don't know about others but I really really connected with the plot. I have lost my true love so I know what it means to feel that pain.

","Not as magical as hayao miyazaki's other masterpieces.<br/><br/>It's just an animated, scifi & romcom version of j-drama I'd a say. I used to be a j-drama fan but people move on to k-dramas which makes better tv series & also films compare to japan nowadays.<br/><br/>1 thing I'm impressed of the hero or typical japan hero's journey, they'd do anything against all odds to achieve the goals for the loved ones. Like the tragic death of lalaru from anime ""now and then, here and there"" after shu trying so hard to save her. This movie did the same & the hero rewrites history, luckily the boy in the girl's body didn't cry wolf to save them all. It's kind of weird nobody heard of the town hit by the asteroid #plottwist<br/><br/>Why i watched this movie? I was single & longed for ala j-drama love story.<br/><br/>Why i kinda hate it? I was in japan, not as fun as watching j-drama & that time neighbors next to a bnb i booked wasn't available, the old guy said ""i cannot understand English"". The ending like spirited away's ending the dragon kid, haku... What became of of the haku??? Now this movie, taki & mitsuha??? They finally got to meet face-to-face (happily ever after) & it's up to us to make up their next story?????<br/><br/>Why i kinda like it?

"evankatsogiannis","10","1","2","9 March 2019"," ""Your Name"": A Masterclass in Animation
","""Your Name"" is the latest film of Japanese writer-director Makoto Shinkai. This is definitely the greatest anime of all time, and to earn that title it had to beat other superb films, for example ""Wolf Children"". This movie is addictively compelling the whole way through due to the storyline's constant direction change and thematical elements.<br/><br/>The story begins with Mitsuha, a girl living in a small Japanese town. She finds life miserable there, so on one night she wishes to swap bodies with a handsome Tokyo boy. The following day, that very thing happens inexplicably with a boy named Taki.<br/><br/>The animation in this film is just simply beautiful. You could see that with every frame, the animators articulately put everything on screen with such care that it felt almost as if it were in real life. There's also a time lapse scene, which would've been really difficult to execute, but the way it is shown it's as if the animators did it with ease. The storyline is one of the best in movie history; completely unpredictable, clever and you could really invest in the characters it documented. The whole way through the story gets better and better, to the point where you're lusting for more. And the ending beautifully concludes the rest of this excellent film due to its shock and emotion.<br/><br/>""Your Name"" is the ultimate animated film ans shows anime at its true best. It's a spectacle everybody needs to see, even if you don't like anime. Incredible animation, excellent soundtrack and a near-flawless script make ""Your Name"" a masterclass in animation.<br/><br/>Rating: 9.7/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","Fascinating story. At first, it gives you an impression that this is yet another story on switch of bodies while time traveling (like ""17 again"" or ""13 going on 30""), but it is so much more! ""Your name"" is objectively one of the greatest educative (!) stories about love.
By using the Musubi legend and the worldwide favorite ""red rope"" theory, the movie teaches that the right person is settled in your mind much earlier before you actually meet, probably from your birth, and you'll feel the lack of his/her presence on daily basis until the day you finally meet. The story teaches us that no matter what, the unvisible red rope (well, the visible one in this anime) will unite you one day and you will understand that this is the ONE by one simple glance.
The most significant lesson that beautiful story teaches us is to hear your heart and trust those magical visions, which are sent to you from the Universe through dreams in the past or stories you've heard once and which are stuck in your head for no reason.
But the reason always exists! Wait for that special person."

It's so rare to find an anime with these two so perfectly combined that it alone made me want to cry from happiness.<br/><br/>This movie is one heck of a ride. It instantly grabs your interest and the story has some very, VERY well done twists. I honestly can't find any fault with this one - stunning visuals, well written characters, exquisite storyline...

Never have I ever seen or read anything that made me feel the characters' pain, and joy, and frustration like this. This movie (and saying that this is simply a ""movie"" feels like I'm comparing the Mona Lisa to a toddler's fingerpainting) made me feel so much raw emotion that I was literally shaking (and occasionally crying) throughout every amazing second of it.

"Hellmant","8","1","2","30 November 2017"," Not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film.
","'YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The blockbuster Japanese animated fantasy drama, about a high school girl, in rural Japan, and a high school boy, in Tokyo, that switch bodies. The film was written and directed by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Makoto Shinkai. It's gotten almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also broken Box Office records all around the world (including becoming the 4th highest grossing film in Japan's history). I enjoyed the film as well.<br/><br/>Mitsuha (Stephanie Sheh) is a high school student that lives in Itomori, a rural town in the mountains of Japan. She is very unhappy with small town life, and dreams of moving to Tokyo. Taki (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a high school student living in Tokyo, that also works at a local Italian restaurant (part-time). He aspires to become an architect. One day the two magically switch places, thinking it's just a dream, and their lives are never the same again. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film. I can definitely see why it's such a huge hit at the Box Office too, and with critics, and not just in Japan. Of course they're already planning an American remake as well (with J.J. Abrams producing). The switching bodies story gimmick has been done many times before, but the body swapping of a male and female high school student seems somewhat fresh and original. Where the filmmakers take the story is also interesting and involving. There's of course some silly coming-of-age humor in it too, and it's far from a perfect movie, but it's definitely a well made and entertaining one (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"
"donahueb-81565","3","2","7","9 August 2018"," Overrated
","Your Name is one of those movies/shows where I just don't understand the ridiculous praise it gets. Yes, the concept of body swapping is interesting and well executed in the first half. But then it starts to become full of extremely vague or completely unexplained plot points that break immersion and leaves the viewer unsatisfied. It's a complete mess. The ending is also dumb and negates the entire point of the movie."
"lucianomarzo92","5","2","7","22 April 2018"," Disappointing
","Disclaimer: I am not a fan of anime. I like Studio Ghibli, but only because their films can be enjoyed and even loved by people who don't typically like anime. Having said that, the animation in this movie is flat-out amazing. Every frame is a work of art, demonstrating unbelievable mastery of the film medium. Though a visual masterpiece, Your Name's flaws are, unfortunately, wide-ranging and deep. In fact, the movie's convoluted plot, poor choice of songs, unappealing characters, and off-putting, melodramatic tone make it a chore to sit through. I realize anime is not for everyone, but this movie really didn't connect with me. And it's not just because it's an anime film. It's because it's a movie whose plot and characters fail to engage the viewer in any meaningful way, whose soundtrack, tone, and overall style actively resist any attempt made by the viewer to enjoy the movie. If you decide to watch this movie, I hope you like it more than I did. Visually, there is a lot to appreciate. The movie is so good visually, I regret that I am not able to leave it a better review."

","Breathtakingly beautiful film with amazing animation, story line and music..however I have one complaint and trust me when I say I've seen many films..I had bought over a 1000 DVDs and gone to cinema for many films and I've watched a crazy amount of films/series and anime on TV and online so I really do have big experience with films and I do write short novels myself so let me explain it as simple as I can,The problem with this film is that the author tried to play with time but failed at it..had he found another way around it would've been perfect so here's the problem:<br/><br/>1)During their body swaps it was clearly stated that they were the same age. <br/><br/>2)Being the same age but her dying 3 years before he started switching bodies with her means that there was a time thing where the past her swapped bodies with the present him. <br/><br/>3)At some point she decided to go see him but he didn't know who she were because it was in the past before he started seeing his dreams however she gone to see him and he was the same age in the past when he should've been 3 years younger as he confirmed he kept her hair tie for 3 years and being so young a 3 years difference he should've looked younger. <br/><br/>4)The way she stayed alive is that they changed the past for her to live but at that time when she didn't die she would be around 16 years old I believe which means she never died and by the time Taki started having his dreams, 3 years in her world would've passed already which makes her 3 years older than him in the actual time meaning that when he finally found her at the end she should be older than him which I doubt it was thought of.<br/><br/>That is all and other than that the film was amazing and I've watched it few times and I still love it!"
"peterredding-79-955199","4","2","8","9 March 2019"," Poorly edited - visually disappointing
","I am a great anime fan and bought the BluRay edition of this film on the strength of the strong reviews on this and other sites. Having been spoilt by the visual quality of the studio Ghibli films, I assumed 'Your Name' would be of the same standard.<br/><br/>Was I disappointed! I found Your Name to be unwatchable 10 minutes in. I persevered and watched it right to the end. I ended up feeling irritated with the visual imprecision, annoyed with myself that I bought it, wondered if this was a defective copy. I don't like scene after scene with blurry, unfocussed edges and centre focus only, I don't like washed out colours, faded clarity of line, image looking like it's been filmed though gauze, use of what appear to be incomplete drafts rather than completed images. Part of the enjoyment of watching individual cell animation is the precision and colours that you simply don't get with 'real film'. Don't expect that here.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews here are of the storyline, and comment on the visuals, if at all, in general terms. Film is a visual medium. No amount of brilliant story line can compensate for inferior visuals. And in this day and age there is no longer any excuse for poor visuals.<br/><br/>I'm most disappointed in this film, I really expected a highly competent visual performance to justify an interesting story. I give it 4 stars of the basis of the few brief undistorted visuals which made it past the editing process. If you're not Into visuals, close your eyes and let it run as the story has interesting moments. If you are into visuals, probably give it a miss."

","I'm not too familiar with Japanese anime movies, but this movie was very enjoyable. It honestly grew on me, after having had some time to think about the movie. The movie has a well thought-out plot, with good characters that are easy to empathise with. Some of the scenes were beautifully animated, adding 3D elements, with big differences and foreground and background focus, making it often feel as though you are watching a normal film, instead of an animation. I did however feel that the female character's voice was a bit whiny at times, and it made me think I was watching a baby toddler having a tantrum instead of a teenager, but this may be more to Japanese taste than mine. Overall an enjoyable watch, would recommend it if you are into animations."

","Yesterday I decided to finally get round and watch this movie. I have to say it was pretty decent for what it was but it could have been better if it wasn't so long and confusing.
Like how was one head ribbon making the boy and the girl switch places?
Why was the girls father a massive douche bag by just yelling at her for not walking properly. All of this time travel and them forgetting there names were just confusing. <br/><br/>Why did the boy write ""I love you"" on the girls hand instead of his name? The two main characters barely had chemistry or development with one another as they were rarely seen together.<br/><br/>However the voice acting and animation to the movie was pretty good.
Even though there are a few dodgy scenes in the movie. Including a scene when the girl vomits rice in a bowl and when the boy drinks the girls spit. <br/><br/>It should have been 1 hour 30 minutes instead and watching a video of a bulldog summarises this whole movie in 13 seconds. <br/><br/>Not saying Your Name is a bad movie or anything but it's definitely not an award winning either. I don't hate the movie I am just indiffrent to it. Good day!"
"bimlanders","7","1","3","3 September 2017"," Beautiful images and...
","Is the cinema a vehicle for beautiful images independent of the narrative purpose of the film? Your Name is one of the most stunningly animated features I have ever seen, but the level of emotional resonance is somewhat far south of my favorite Studio Ghibli Films which this film purports to surpass (or equal.) What is the ultimate point of this movie? The body swapping story is obviously old-hat, but I felt it would lead to something grand, eventually. But (spoilers- don't read reviews when you don't want spoilers!) when the comet angle surfaced, I thought that things might finally get interesting. But instead, the film built up to a climax with basically a Get out of Jail Free Card idea. (I note that Taki summarily rejects a sexpot who is a great person from all evidence, and makes him look like an asshole in the process.) I recall that Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday was supposed to be a merely ""good"" animation from Studio Ghibli. Disney wouldn't even release it due to a frank discussion about female periods. But that film made me cry, and several times on a repeat viewing. Now, in that film's quiet, realistic, and understated style, why did I find such deep resonance, but a love story where a comet (spoilers!!!) wipes out an entire town cannot? I have to spread the blame around to all in Creative.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a very good animated film from Japan, but I have to say it doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a bit too emo and heavy handed. There are many parts where the lead characters scream out each other's name. There's no subtlety at all. Me thinks that the amazing images fool people when married to a heavy handed approach to presenting emotional content. Another refresher if you want an awesome coming of age story from Japanese masters, check out Whisper of the Heart. There's nothing in Your Name that matches the awe of Shizuku discovering the antique shop for the first time, and meeting the Baron... (sigh) This, without even bringing up Spirited Away."

","Only graphic and music in this anime are good. Storyline are good, but Meh. Not many other character had screen time, the story just focuses on Taki, Taki, Taki, Taki, Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha. And i feel the romance is very forced. I don't know, but i prefer 5cm/s rather than Kimi No Nawa. It's just my opinion, calm down"
"dave-mcclain","7","2","11","13 April 2017"," ""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie.
","Sit back, relax and let me tell you what I think of Your Name. No, not your name (that would be way too personal) I'm talking about the Japanese anime fantasy feature film ""Your Name"" (PG, 1:46). Now, if you're not familiar with Your Name, you should be. In the first place, who doesn't know their own name? (Okay, enough bad puns.) The MOVIE ""Your Name"" opened in U.S. theaters on April 7, 2017, a little over seven months after its release in Japan. Before it even reached the U.S., the film had become the fourth biggest film ever at the Japanese box office, their top-grossing film of 2016 AND the #1 anime worldwide to date! Based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Makota Shinkai (who also wrote and directed the screen adaptation), there is much to distinguish this film from previous anime features.<br/><br/>The film's roots are a combination of the traditional and the contemporary, as it forged a fresh path both in Japan and beyond. This is the first anime not directed by Hayao Miyazaki to make over $100 million (about 10 billion Yen) in Japan. ""Your Name"" also became the highest-grossing Japanese release in China and was the first Japanese film in a dozen years to attain the top box office spot in South Korea. Not bad, for a film that is singularly Japanese. One of the reasons given for the film's success is the soundtrack, which includes songs from Yojiro Noda, lead singer for the Japanese rock band Radwimps. Critics and audiences have also praised the film's animation, as well as the plot and its emotional impact. According to Wikipedia, ""Inspiration for the story came from works including Shūzō Oshimi's 'Inside Mari', 'Ranma ½', the Heian period novel 'Torikaebaya Monogatari', and Greg Egan's short story 'The Safe-Deposit Box'."" The film's main location, a town called Itomori, is fictional, but the buildings and landscape are based on Japan's Gifu Prefecture. Itomori is where the central character in this story lives.<br/><br/>Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi in the Japanese version and by Stephanie Sheh in the dubbed English-language version) is a high school student who wants more out of life than what her tiny hometown has to offer. She's not very self-confident, she doesn't have many friends, she cares little for tradition and is even less enthusiastic about being the daughter of the town's mayor. While her tough, traditionalist widowed father is busy mayoring, Mitsuha and her young sister are being raised by her traditional, but kind grandmother. All of Mitsuha's frustrations boil over one day when she shouts into the sky that, instead of a meek country girl, she wishes she were a handsome boy living in Tokyo.<br/><br/>Then it happened – Mitsuha wakes up one morning to discover she has mysteriously switched bodies with just such a young man named Taki Tachibana (Ryunosuke Kamiki / Michael Sinterniklaas). Both high schoolers are understandably disoriented and upset by finding themselves in the body of someone of the other gender, in a house with a family and going to a strange school in a different place and with friends whom they don't know. Mitsuha and Taki each believe they're dreaming, so they just get by as well as they can and wait to wake up. When they do each wake up the next morning, back in their own beds, they're relieved until their family and friends comment on how strange they've been acting.<br/><br/>These body swaps continue happening, about every other day, but the memories of what Mitsuha and Taki each do in the other's body quickly fade, much like a dream. To keep track of what's going on, the two teens start leaving each other notes, first in paper notebooks, and then on their smartphones – and they start intervening in each other's lives. Mitsuha, as Taki, helps Taki start a romantic relationship with his supervisor at the restaurant where he works part-time, and Taki, as Mitsuha, helps her become more popular. When their body swaps suddenly and inexplicably stop, Taki tries to make contact with Mitsuha in real time, but cannot reach her by cell phone. He takes a train to her district, armed with sketchy and fading memories from his days as Mitsuha, and learns something which affects him profoundly and causes both he and Mitsuha to embark on separate, but parallel and highly significant tasks.<br/><br/>""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie. The animation features especially vibrant colors and it is creative and skilled, often giving the impression of depth, even as a 2-D production. The movie also provides an interesting window into the world of modern Japan, through the juxtaposition of urban and rural environments. The main characters and supporting players are likable and fun to watch, but sometimes act illogically. More problematic, however, are dealing with the movie's plot holes and keeping track of who is who, when, and what is happening during some of the body swaps. But all of that aside, ""Your Name"" features an interesting story, which includes elements of humor, excitement and even suspense and charms its audience. It combines influences from many sources, but still feels fresh, creative and vital. This film is ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""The Lake House"", with the look of an updated ""Spirited Away"", and it's visually and emotionally pleasing in spite of its shortcomings. ""B+"""

","THREE REASONS THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FILM: <br/><br/>1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY
2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS
3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL<br/><br/>1. QUALITY OF ANIMATION/CINEMATOGRAPHY - I cannot remember the last time I gasped at how beautiful the background art was in a film. Some scenes are downright amazing to look at and left me with the feeling of awe.<br/><br/>2. EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND PLOT TWISTS - Starts off at a funny romantic comedy then unexpected plot twists move the film and audience into such deep emotions at the same level as ""The pursuit of Happiness"" or ""Lion"" Themes of deep, painful longing, abandonment, hope and love. I was moved to tears. <br/><br/>3. ATTENTION TO DETAIL - I am astounded at how every little detail all ties together in the end. The plot was so complex and yet, when I watched it a second time, I saw so many clues and signs that hinted at the dramatic changes. Incredible attention to detail. <br/><br/>If there's any fault to the movie, it is a lack of story with Taki's character who probably deserved a little more screen time on his history. I thought the ending also took too long to resolve. I don't want to spoil it so I'll just leave it at that. <br/><br/>Such amazing and moving story telling. One of my favorite films of all time."

","See the thing I hate most about people who review movies is that all the good movies that have a plot and an actual story get the bad ratings and reviews, and then there's this movie. Let me start off by saying I'm currently watching this movie while writing this because I have already lost complete interest in this. Why did I lose interest in this?? Because the plot and screenplay is complete garbage, everything about the timeline of this movie is horrible put together and makes no sense unless you google it. What I don't understand is how
This movie has great ratings because honestly this movie is just plain bad. I've never written a review before and I was hoping this movie would resolve itself but it still hasn't and i doubt it will. I decided to give this movie a chance because I grew up watching and loving every single one of Hayao miyazakis movies and I thought why not I'll give this a shot. But here I am regretting this movie. The only thing I like about this movie is the animation which is beautiful. It looks like they spent 95% of their efforts on the animation and just gave up with the plot, but to each their own I guess. I was hoping this would've been better."

","YOUR NAME is another expertly-made anime that hails from Japan and is similar to the high quality of other recent animated drama from that country. The story is about two teenagers, one male and one female, who randomly find themselves swapping bodies on one fateful date and must subsequently investigate their bizarre circumstances. It sounds like a cheesy body-swap romance and indeed I've seen it described as such, but that description doesn't do the film justice. Body-swapping plays a part and there's even some high school tenderness, but this wide-reaching picture also explores themes of disaster, loss, tragedy, family, mythology, and long-distance relationships. It's been made in an exemplary fashion with perfect animation and voice acting, so it's very difficult to criticise it overall."

Even if the idea of change genre rolls was really exploited by differents movies in the last decade, the exploration around the cultural life between the city and town is an element that plays in favor to the history.

They are so different to the Hollywood films.<br/><br/>This film is loaded with emotional depth and creativity. Although it is never explained how the characters managed to switch places, it really becomes immaterial once you follow the story. Around the halfway mark the film shocks us with an unexpected natural disaster that I never saw coming. From there on the film reverses, going back before the disaster, but this is when the film becomes more interesting. Since we are now aware of the impending doom, everything has more meaning.<br/><br/>'Your Name.' is a sad, beautiful, uplifting film you have to experience at least once."

Now I thought the voice acting was great too, which may be hard to believe (cuz I prefer dub), but I'm serious, they did a good job. The story is also pretty interesting.

But try reading my review!<br/><br/>This is the story depicting the meeting of two Japanese, Taki and Mitsuha. Taki lives in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. In other hands, Mitsuha lives in Nagano, one of the most rural area of Japan. One they, both wake up to notice that there body has exchanged. Through this event, they know each other. As they know each other in depth, they come to meet in direct. In this process, Taki found that Mitsuha dies three years ago because of meteor strikes. Taki and Mitsuha use ""Musubi"", connection between them, to save Mitsuha and her villages' people.<br/><br/>This is the overall of this film.(I think you should refer Wikipedia )<br/><br/>What makes this film special one (to me) are musics, graphics and of course this unforgettable story.
Four inserted songs by Radwips makes me more emotional than any other films. In Particular, the scene of ""Nandemonaiya"" makes me cry every time. I thank for staffs of this films that enable us to see the meeting of Mitsuha and Taki.
Graphics is awesome. In Shinkai' films we can see the beauty of nature, cities and people. They search our ourld deeply and express exactly what they see. ""Miyamizu Shrine"", Tokyo, The lives of Taki and Mitsuha, and so on, Everything is beautiful.<br/><br/>I really appreciate this film. One of my favorite. Thanks."

Once again Shinkai is concerned with distance and connection. Here, two young people keep switching bodies and living bits of one another's lives. Much of the first half of the film is a light comedy about the wackiness of such a life, but the story deepens and the movie becomes wonderfully suspenseful and touching.<br/><br/>At this point, Shinkai has complete control of his craft. Visually the movie is utterly stunning, with absolutely breathtaking moments. The story draws you in slowly and believably.

","""Your Name"" (2016) is an anime about love, Japanese culture, and... body-swapping? It is great, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie requires a few things from you as a viewer, although mainly in two different ways. The first half spends most of it's time in a Japanese village, where certain traditions, rituals and items are presented - such as Kuchikamizake and the concept of braiding and twilight. The more insight one has about these things, the more complete do they seem inside the plot, as their themes correlate exquisitely to the movie's main theme. The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable without above-average knowledge about these things.<br/><br/>The second half goes pretty plot-heavy. This is where attention to the first half pays off, as the complexity opens a whole different layer of emotional and intellectual satisfaction. Don't stress if you don't get everything at once, instead rejoice over a great film that rewards you for additional viewings. With Your Name, you don't pay attention - you invest it.<br/><br/>A small footnote that should be mentioned is that some of the humor is a bit over-the-top adolescent, and there are a few jokes about breasts and crotch areas. Sensitive watchers might find this a bit annoying, but it could also be argued that it plays well into the charms of the movie.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least, this movie is breathtakingly gorgeous. The shots are pure bliss and the beauty presented is all too rare. The light, colors, and surroundings beg for as many inches of a screen as you can get hold of. If you don't own a Blu-ray player, movies like this makes the price worth it.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a phenomenal 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","Your Name was already released in cinema in 2016 but I knew and watched it in 2017. The genre of this movie is romance, but it combines with mystery, supernatural, and little bit comedy. The romantic scenes that shown in this movie is not too excessive, but can make the viewers fall in love with it, like me.<br/><br/>The movie shows some places in Tokyo that the main character named Taki lives. Those places are made as similar as in real Tokyo. The movie also never forget to add Japan cultures in the story. It just like the girl named Mitsuha do. In her village culture, she must make an alcohol kuchikami-zake. The fireworks festival that annually held in Japan is shown in this movie.<br/><br/>This anime movie gives a big emotional impact to the viewers. For you who have not watch this movie before, you should prepare your heart. Because in the middle until the end of the story, you will get some scenes that can drain your emotion. Even some viewers are crying when they watch it. The sound effect is also make this movie feel alive. The soundtracks are success to bring more emotional feeling to viewers by the instrument and the meaning of the songs that have a deep meaning.<br/><br/>The mystery and supernatural side of this movie has shown with how the body of Mitsuha and Taki can be switched despite different place and time. On the comedy side is when they do their activities with that switched body. This movie success to beat other movies that had popular before such as Spirited Away, 5cm per Second and many more. Overall this is the most emotional movie anime I've ever seen! And actually after I watch this movie, I can't move on to other movies until now!"

","Often it seems like a good Lovestory is all about the world the couple lives in...but what if the world they live in, isn't the same? (not to mention, this isn't a romance movie most of the time. Hah, got you.)
The answer is, the most beautiful film I have seen since I was a child. It starts with the lovely characters and ends with the amazing animation that will guide you through a perfect story for anyone who loves a bit of a twist in the storyline. I think the movie deserves a metaphorical approach: It's like a star in the universe only you and your loved one can see, no matter how far apart the loving souls are."

","Your Name is serving as something of a breakout for it's director Makoto Shinkai and while I don't personally consider it his masterpiece (that honour goes to five centimetres per second), it's certainly an excellent intro to his body of work.<br/><br/>The film follows two teenagers, a city boy named Taki and a rural village girl named Mitsuha. These two teenagers find their fates to be intertwined, when they suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies.Both teenagers scramble to figure out why this is happening, and begin to gain a deep understanding of each other and their respective lives.This premise could be seen as banal and uninteresting, but there are several unexpected and rather clever twists to the story that elevate the material considerably. Taki and Mitsuha are both very likeable protagonists, with relatable and interesting personal conflicts as well as a charming and at times quite funny relationship. The movie itself is surprisingly funny at times, with one recurring gag involving Taki waking up in Mitsuha's body never failing to make me chuckle.<br/><br/>However the main draw of the film is it's breathtaking animation, which does not disappoint.Their are several 'wow' moments and setpieces that took my breath away with their stunning detail, especially as I was lucky enough to see the film in imax. But even the smaller, more atmospheric environmental shots have a calming and lifelike beauty to them. You can tell how much effort went into designing and animating these beautiful scenes, and the love poured into every shot and cel.<br/><br/>One complaint I have with the film is that there are several musical montages set to japanese pop-rock peppered throughout the film and they feel quite out of place, like someone edited an AMV into the film without anyone noticing. There is one showing our two leads acclimating to their situation and figuring out how to communicate with each other that feels fitting, but the rest are extremely jarring.
It's still an excuse to watch some more beautiful animation, so I can't be too harsh. Another issue (and an admittedly minor one) is that Mitsuha's dad feels like a generic 'strict parent' archetype, despite actually having a slightly more sympathetic backstory in the light novel 'Another Side-Earthbound'.<br/><br/>To conclude, Your Name is an excellent film and a brilliant intro to anime for people not familiar to the medium. Absolutely worth a watch, and a rewatch. Bring tissues."
"meeshoffmanns","9","0","1","15 March 2019"," A Gorgeous and Moving Tale, with Complex Yet Powerful Ideas
","This movie was to me one of the biggest surprises of my life; when I heard that the story was about body-swapping, I never expected it to be original or even remotely entertaining. Then I listened to Chris Stuckmann's review of it on youtube, who gave such high praise that I couldn't help but be curious enough to check it out. I was absolutely mesmerized by the end, and am still quite convinced that this is the best animated movie I have ever seen! And I have seen quite a few.<br/><br/>Voice Acting:
Both RyÃ»nosuke Kamiki and Mone Kamishiraishi are excellent. I only watched the original version, and although they are not that different from most Japanese voice actors, they still do a very good job in conveying both frustration and longing and grief. The supporting cast is hardly noteworthy, aside from doing fine in the voice department. Mostly because pretty much all the focus is on the two main protagonists.<br/><br/>Animation:
This movie. Is absolutely gorgeous. Before this, I had never seen such a realistic depiction of our world in anime as this one. The modern town of Tokio looks fantastic and you'd want to book a flight immediately to just walk there in awe. The level of detail is just stunning. The same goes for the lighting, making excellent use of different stages of the sun over the day for beautiful sunsets and lensflares, painting the characters and backgrounds. The characters themselves are also very impressive, particulary how their movements and subtle gestures portray their emotional states.<br/><br/>Music:
It's surprising how little music actually is in this movie, but the few cues that come up are very effective and add a lot of immediate weight.<br/><br/>Plot:
This is perhaps the best aspect about this movie. Without spoiling anything, this movie pulls several twists and turns on the body-swap storyline that you absolutely wouldn't expect, but if you already know, you'd be amazed at how tricky the writing and crafting is that went into this picture. Information is revealed at the right moments to make the most shocking revelations for both the protagonists and the audience the most impactful. The ending is a bit wonky because of how sudden things are established after the conflict, but the final shot will possibly leave you with tears.<br/><br/>Tone:
Another reason why this movie works so well. The direction is pretty subtle and allows for breathing room to attach to the characters in certain emotional moments. Sudden silence is often used to great effect, as well as montages. At a certain point, you want everything that these characters are chasing after, and you are in despair when they are when they find that it is pretty much impossible. It is incredibly effective storytelling and direction.<br/><br/>General concensus:
Looking back at what I wrote, initially there doesn't appear to be much that makes this worthy of being the best animated movie of all time. But this is a gradual process, and by the time the credits role, the brilliance of it is solidly established. It is very grounded and fantastical at the same time, looks gorgeous, and becomes incredibly compelling. 8.7/10"

"demadrigal","10","0","1","27 February 2019"," Highly original, creative, and emotionally effective
","Your Name. starts off treading familiar romantic comedy grounds with a slight magical realism twist that anime fans would also find familiar. But the lighthearted love story that it promises takes a second-act left turn into Kafkaesque territory with sudden plot twists and reveals that create incredible emotional weight and dramatic tension. The characters are well developed, the story is sophisticated, and the themes of gender, trust, and love as a connective force are handled deftly if sometimes unsubtly. It's weird enough that it won't win over anime skeptics and others might criticize the way it plays with narrative structure, but it deserves consideration as the best film of 2016."

","Just finished watching it for the first time, and I wish and feel I am still immersed in it. Emotion took a wild ride and now I am trapped somewhere between the movie and reality.<br/><br/>It was beautifully made and very descriptive. It reminded me of my stay in Kyoto when I was younger: peaceful, quiet and pleasant. Also my memories from visiting Tokyo too;it was very busy, full of high rises and everyone were minding their own issues. The level of details from many scenes were breathtaking, having done a little bit of animation really make me appreciate the amount of hard work the artists put into this anime.<br/><br/>Then were was the story, starts off as cute and lighthearted, then deeper, and more pure, it takes you on a roller coaster ride, and before you know it, the movie ends.<br/><br/>I wish there is more after the ending, but then it wouldn't be a masterpiece. I can only put this beautiful memory from watching the movie in a safe place in the heart and treasure it, watch it again to re live it."

","When I first watched the film, I was bawling my eyes out even 40 minutes after the movie had come to its end. To my surprise, second round of this movie didn't awake any emotion in me at all.<br/><br/>I think a movie succeeds if it manages to evoke emotion even after watching it several times. With Kimi no na wa I was actually more invested in the visual side and the soundtrack of the movie during the second time. Those things really are worth mentioning, because the movie's visuals are absolutely stunning. Def worth watching in HD if you just get the chance.<br/><br/>However, the plot is kinda vague and I even got frustrated waiting for the end result. The movie felt like it was trying to go on - as if they were forcefully dragging the film to its end.<br/><br/>It's still a solid eight, because when I first saw this film, I thought it had hit the jackpot."

","Your Name is yet another example of an animated film being able to transcend the typical boundaries of the genre. Just as Pixar has done several times over, Your Name constructs a gorgeous looking 90 minutes of animation, all while making a movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults. The best part is that this film goes way more layers deep than any romantic animation film I have seen, at least in quite some time. It deal with themes of death, freewill, and how time is not exactly something you can explain so easily.

"classicsoncall","7","0","2","7 April 2018"," ""It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it?""
","This anime film had an interesting premise with it's fantasy, time-travel concept, and in a way I was reminded of the 1980 Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour movie, ""Somewhere in Time"". It starts out a little more complicated because it leaves the viewer somewhat confused until the characters themselves reveal what's going on, perhaps even more so through the dialog of their friends questioning the behavior of the principals. I will concede that the picture is rendered beautifully and the animation is exquisite. However the tenor of the film is geared in my estimation to a younger viewing audience, as so many anime films appear to be. That's not a negative, it's just that senior citizens like myself relate very little if at all to the characters in the story. However I found myself thinking that the same basic premise of the story would provide an exceptional opportunity for a live action film. I think the story would be easier to follow if the viewer could relate to live actors in real locations, as the animated nature of the picture tends to take one outside the boundaries of real life situations. Even so, I was entertained by the picture once I figured out what was going on with the body swapping and time dissonance. It's not hard to understand why this would have a wide appeal to a much younger audience."
"jonathan-harris17","7","0","4","16 January 2018"," Eye-catcher
","Japanese hand-drawn anime featuring a slightly unusual take on the freaky-friday-esque body swapping trope.<br/><br/>In a continuous string of well-drawn dualities on one hand you have Mitsuha, a girl from a small town engrossed in a traditional Shinto upbringing; on the other you have Taki a boy from ultra-modern Tokyo working part-time as a waiter.<br/><br/>The small town is realised with a soft, dreamy sunshine-streaked palette; Tokyo as near photo-realist and futuristic - in both cases, the visuals are handled with real care & attention and quite noticeable: it's a visual treat.<br/><br/>The plot follows 3 main stages, of the 2 main characters realising their predicament, developing each others lives in some way and eventually Taki's efforts to find Mitsuha in the 'real' world. (they can't remember each other's names, hence the title)<br/><br/>Some unexpected turns are found and it really ramps up the tension for a thriller of a denouement.
The voice work here (dubbed into English) is standard fare, and the sound track super poppy which for whatever reason I found faintly amusing.<br/><br/>Very engaging overall and a nice compact running time, recommended."
