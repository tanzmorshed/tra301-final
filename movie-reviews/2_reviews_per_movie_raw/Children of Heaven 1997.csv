","Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...<br/><br/>This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.<br/><br/>We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.<br/><br/>There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.<br/><br/>Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.<br/><br/>The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.<br/><br/>Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.<br/><br/>I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Ollie"
"Buddy-51","Null","113","118","4 January 2000"," a work of art
","The wonderful Iranian film ""Children of Heaven"" and its companion piece, ""The White Balloon"", remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's (""The Shop on Main Street,"" ""Loves of a Blonde,"" etc.) in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.<br/><br/>""Children of Heaven"" has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier ""The White Balloon"" but the original Italian classic, ""The Bicycle Thief."" In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.<br/><br/>The actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.<br/><br/>""Children of Heaven"" brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss ""Children of Heaven""! It is a richly rewarding experience."
"timffoster","Null","136","146","13 November 2003"," Solid, moving. There should be more movies like this!
","This movie quietly puts to shame the majority of junk spewing out of Hollywood. A fat wad of cash thrown at big names and special effects cannot move the human soul like the innocence and sincerety displayed by Majidi's cast and direction. It's a shame that there are not more movies like this.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, the actors sincere and the tone spot-on. This movie works because we're drawn into the world of Ali, his life and his surrounding. Kudos to Majidi's craftsmanship. Ali's plight, though simple (if not trivial to most of us), becomes his obsession because of his love and respect for his sister and his family. We would do well to be so moved! The climax of the movie is brilliant! Ali's grueling determination to win a race and get shoes for his sister results in an unwanted triumph! (Sorry - no spoilers here. You'll have to see the movie). I must be getting older, because I'm moved with emotions just describing the movie -- and it's been months since I've seen it!<br/><br/>The redemption of Ali's resulting emotion and confusion will be lost on an innatentive viewer, so *PAY CLOSE ATTENTION* to the last 10 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Beauty doesn't have to forcibly blow you away. This movie is simply beautiful, and it will blow you away."

","I find it most difficult and awkward to make comment on films that I personally do not like. That is why I could talk for days about this wonderful Oscar Submission!<br/><br/>Children Of Heaven is one of those rare films that not only I want to talk about, but everyone else who has seen it seems to be raving about. This tender and triumphant little jewel of a film had every head turning at the recent 1999 Nortel Palm Springs International Film Festival, January 7th-18th. After it's first showing at the festival, people were indeed talking!<br/><br/>""Did you see that film from Iran?"" ""No, any good?"" ""Just wait, go see it, we'll talk later!""<br/><br/>The Children Of Heaven follows the relationship between an impoverished brother and sister, Ali and Zahra, who are thrust into a difficult circumstance all revolving around a pair of sneakers. How they choose to solve their problem themselves, without telling their parents, is what makes the story so heart-warming and unique. What follows is a tender, moving tale of compassion, determination, and deep family love.<br/><br/>Bravo writer/director Majid Majidi!"
"Gordon-11","Null","63","67","9 March 2003"," Wonderfully heartwarming
","Wow, what can I say? Every bit of this film is so warm! It really looked at the world from a child's perspective. Every single scene is inundated with sweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoes was amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!"
"KissEnglishPasto","10","34","36","25 October 2013"," This Film So Overwhelmed Me With Joy, I Feel Obligated to Share My Emotion With All Who Would Listen!
","............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>It's easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! <br/><br/>After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines, regrettably, seem rather empty, almost laughable in comparison. <br/><br/>The fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review such as this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. <br/><br/>I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed, more often than not, as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate. <br/><br/>Some have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.<br/><br/>10*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!<br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com"

","What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of)."
"MollieEternity","10","63","70","28 July 2004"," Majid Majidi is a genius
","Majid Majidi is a genius. He is a director and actor of great talent. This film presents a sweet story of a brother and sister, their bond and their unique solution to solving the problem of a pair of lost shoes. The child actors are adorable and utterly convincing and the production of the film is of such quality that you get lost in watching it. The story itself is humorous, at times, and inspiring. Though the premise may be simple, each scene is infused with such passion, beauty and emotion that the experience of viewing this film is anything but simple. To all who have yet to view the film, take note of the very last scene."
"ruby_fff","10","69","78","16 February 1999"," Wholesome 100% natural cinematic staple -- well-leavened and savory!
","This translates to MUST-SEE! It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.<br/><br/>The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.<br/><br/>It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.<br/><br/>This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.<br/><br/>The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.<br/><br/>I hope ""Children of Heaven"" will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.<br/><br/>Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978's ""The Tree of the Wooden Clogs"" by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's ""Bashu, The Little Stranger"", by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated."

","I just saw this film in South Korea at a church.  The film is spoken in Farsi, the subtitles were in Korean.  It didn't matter that I couldn't understand a single word, because the cinematography and the faces of the children, their parents and the other cast members did all the talking. A wonderful film that dispelled my notions of Tehran as a dark and forbidding place - actually it's quite beautiful!  We Americans have not seen Iran since 1979 and it is my hope that soon we can restore relations again.  I wouldn't mind visiting."
"g-bodyl","8","14","14","2 August 2014"," Very Talented Filmmaking!
","Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.<br/><br/>Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes, Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.<br/><br/>Overall, Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me, but there is no denying how powerful this film is. I rate this film 8/10."
"Sambd1","9","13","13","18 April 2009"," Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films
","Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films. Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience, but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents, the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures, languages, music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING: Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative. Now don't say I didn't warn you."
"butterfinger","Null","55","65","24 October 2004"," Extraordinary Movie-making
","Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven is such an extraordinary work of movie-making that it is in a realm of movies that are able to connect with anyone who remembers (or is amidst) their childhood, regardless of what country they come from. (Note: Films that have a universal appeal aren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people from one or two countries, but making a film with a universal appeal is no easy task.) A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sister Zahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell their father (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switching schedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chuckles-good writing and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though he milks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in that order) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) in a way I would not dream of revealing."
"chgrbolt-1","Null","9","9","17 October 2003"," Includes Summary (Spoiler) and Review
","One of my favorite movies is ""Children of Heaven,"" written and directed by Majid Majidi, an Iranian film from 1997.  The film industry in Iran is very different from the industry in America.  In this film, you will not find any special effects, marketing tactics, or expensive sets.  The movie is told in a very simple real fashion using camera work, acting, and real life streets and scenery, giving the film a realistic documentary feel.  This characteristic of Iranian film draws us in to the story and gives us the ability to relate closely with the children in a way American films does not.  The approach gives the film an honest character and believable reality. This subtitled film humanizes Iran for the American viewer.  You realize that people are people no mater where they live, all have the same feelings and emotions.    Ali The story is told through the children and their experiences.  Children of Heaven takes you into the hearts and lives of a young boy, Ali (played by Amir Farrokh Hashemian), and his sister, Zhara (played by Bahare Sediqi), capturing the life of a family living in poverty in Iran.  After watching this movie, seeing a story where a pair of lost shoes can be so important, you realize that we are very lucky to live in a time and country where most people never go without such basic items as shoes.  This film shows us a place where people may not have much, but they have what they need most of all, each other.  The family bond is strong, that can often be lost in the fast paced and transient society that America tends to be.  The father works hard but is basically unskilled.  He also has the burden of is caring for a sick wife and a baby as well.  The children have to help out in many ways, which further bonds the family.  The family lives in a small apartment with only one room. The movie begins as 9-year-old Ali goes out on errands, one of which is taking his sisters shoes to be repaired.  The shoes are very worn but are mended.  Afterwards he stops to buy some potatoes at the market, leaving the shoes and some other parcels at the front of the store.  While Ali is in the store a scrap collector comes along and takes the shoes along with the other bags he collects there.  When Ali comes out he finds the shoes missing. He frantically searches the fruit stand boxes, knocking down several in the process, and the storekeeper chases him away.  He has a difficult and tearful time telling his sister about the shoes being lost.  When Zhara realizes that they are truly gone, she wonders what she will wear to school. Ali knows that his family cannot afford to buy her shoes, and pleads with her to keep this a secret between then. Ali devises a plan and convinces Zhara to go along with it because their parents could not afford shoes at this time and it would only be a burden to tell them of the loss.  Ali talks Zhara into sharing his shoes, with Zhara wearing them to her school in the mornings and Ali the afternoons to his. Zhara is skeptical but agrees and suggests that they clean the dirty sneakers.  The kids find laughter in this experience as they play with soap bubbles and wash the shoes together.     When it rains that night, Zhara wakes Ali, who goes out in the rainstorm to move the shoes to a dry spot. We are hopeful that the plan will work out, but there is not enough time to make the switch without Ali being late to school each day.  Ali runs quickly to school and makes the best of the situation.  One social difference that you learn about in the film is the schooling where the boys and girls are in separate schools.  The schools are very regimented, teach discipline, and gender roles to the children.  The students do not speak to adults without raising their hands and waiting for permission. In once scene you see how the family interacts and the honesty that is taught in the home.  The father is working for the mosque breaking up a large piece of sugar into small lumps with a hand tool to be used for the tea at the prayer meeting.  As they prepare to have tea at home they realize that there is no sugar, but the father will not allow them to use even a small piece because the sugar does not belong to them, it belongs to the mosque.  This takes a lot of character when you are faced with doing without, and you have so much temptation right in front of you.  However, for them there is no question, you exercise self-control and honesty.<br/><br/>In one scene, the gravity of the situation continues to build its emotional picture when Zhara loses one of the sneakers in the gutter on her way home from school.  She runs down the street, desperate to catch the shoe.  It was very distressful when she sat crying near where the shoe finally stopped, but remained out of reach in a covered section of the gutter.  Fortunately a compassionate storekeeper helps Zhara retrieve the shoe and returns it to Zhara.  She doesn't have much time to explain as Ali rushes to put on the shoes, one wet and one dry, and runs off to his own classes.<br/><br/>Ali and Zhara are very touching as they support each other through the adventures with the sneakers.  There are several moments of humor as well, making this movie both sad and funny. Although Ali and Zhara are young they understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of not burdening the parents since they are already behind in rent and bills.  The children take on the burden of the lost shoes so that their parents won't have to deal with one more problem. Ali truly wants to make it up to Zhara for losing her shoes.  He gave her a pen he won for academic achievement, a simple gift that, although insignificant to you and I, is a generous and much appreciated gift between Ali and Zhara.  Ali tells Zhara about the opportunity to run in a race to win a pair of sneakers.  He promises Zhara he will win the sneakers for her. She is pleased and touched as Ali assures her he can win the shoes for her. The smile on her face is brilliant.  Ali is a fast runner and feels that he can win.  He has a tearful meeting with the coach and tries to convince him to try him out for the race.  Although he has missed the deadline, the coach decides to allow him to race after he sees how fast he can run.<br/><br/>Zhara sees a young girl in the school yard wearing her missing shoes, she befriends the girl after she and Ali follow her home and they see that she has a blind father, they realize that she needs them as much as they do. Zhara is reassured of the girls' honesty when she returns Zhara's pen, the gift from Ali, to her after she saw Zhara drop it in the street.<br/><br/>The race scene is suspenseful as we run along with Ali.  As he runs he envisions his sister going to school in his old shoes.  Ali is ahead in the race although he is running in the same worn shoes that he shares with Zhara each day.  Ali finds himself in 1st place as he comes toward the finish line.  He slows down and lets runners pass him by but finds that he is now in 4th place.  He struggles to regain his position and fate steps in again, causing Ali to finish in 1st place.  Ali cries because h has not won the shoes for Zhara.    Everyone is a little shocked that he is not excited to win 1st place with the prizes that it brings.  However, we know that although he wins the race, he lost the prize.  In his heart he has lost so much, he will continue to carry the burden until Zhara has shoes again.<br/><br/>At home, Ali soaks his sore and blistered feet in a fountain as gold fish swim around.  Fortunately, the children are not to be burdened for much longer, in the final scene we watch the father buying shoes for Zhara and Ali with money he eared doing side work as a gardener on the rich side of town.  My only disappointment is that we don't get to watch them receive the valuable gifts. This movie shows the simple, unquestioned love between a brother and sister. Instead of the lost shoes coming between them, they make the best of it and become closer by working things out together. You are taken back to the purity and innocence of your childhood through Ali and Zhara.  This movie is about much more than a lost pair of shoes, it is about how a family is defined by the things that they do and how they treat each other.  Their actions and their decisions make them who they are.  Those that try to do right by others and care about people will be rewarded in the end, just not always in the way you expect you can.  Its not always in your control."
"Peter_Young","9","13","14","1 March 2011"," Oh those golden childhood days...
","Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood.

"Nezz","Null","13","15","3 February 2004"," Excellent!
","I got the chance to watch this movie on a DVD for the first time 2 days ago.<br/><br/>
Children of Heaven is a very good movie. And coming from Iran, I was impressed. The storyline may be simple, and you may think that you may not have anything to cheer about or feel angry about, believe me when I say this movie will make you feel a variety of emotions, from shocked to sad to happiness, to disappointment. I credit all that to the simple, yet extremely powerful story, the excellent direction and the magnificent charisma of the two young leads. They shone and they will draw you into the story. My most favorite scene for this movie is the marathon scene. The fact that Ali had to beg and cried to get a place in the running team was heart wrenching, and when the camera focused on Ali running, we will cheer and cheer him on when he fell back. There was total silence except for his sister's voice of blaming him for losing her shoes and as he ran, he kept seeing his little sister, carrying her schoolbag running and running to rush him his pair of shoes so that he can go to school was sad. And he ran and ran and realized he was going to get first place and I screamed, ""Don't! 3rd place Ali!"" and Ali ran a little slower and counted, ""one, two"" and he was third until one young man passed him and he was fourth and he ran harder and harder without thinking. <br/><br/>In the end he won 1st place and got a free trip and his coach was overjoyed. But the tired Ali was silent and he was crying before the cameras. And when he went home, he couldn't say a word and his sister knew there was no shoes and she walked away disappointed and Ali sat by the fountain, with the goldfish in the pond nibbling at his blistered feet and he felt he had let his beloved sister down. That was the ending, but we all knew it will be a happy ending when his father comes home with the new pair of shoes, for both of them. And this was the success of this movie; you felt like you were Ali or Zahra and you will feel deeply for these characters.<br/><br/>
10/10. The best foreign language movie I have ever seen on any subject which I feel justifies the full marks."
"cartertw","9","5","5","20 February 2007"," The Simple Things in Life
","When I had heard that we were going to be watching an Iranian film in class, I was a bit apprehensive. I have experienced very little exposure to foreign films and was instantly put off by the subtitles. My trepidation was further reinforced when I was told to pay close attention to the pair of shoes in the beginning of the movie because they were a very integral part of the film. I couldn't imagine how something as trivial as a pair of shoes could keep me interested throughout the entire story. However, I am very happy to say that I was wrong in my preconceived notions. This film made me realize that the simple things in life truly are the most important.<br/><br/>The characters that were chosen for this film were not real actors. This choice helped to make the film appear real and keep it from becoming sensationalized because of the actors. The sets that were chosen helped to contrast the poor area of Iran and the more modernized and wealthy area that Ali and his father visited in search of work. An interview that I came across that Ross Anthony from Hollywood Report Card gave to Majid Majidi, stated that the cameras used in the film were hidden, even from the actors. This allowed for a more natural feel as well as decreased the inexperienced actor's apprehensions.<br/><br/>The surface theme of Children of Heaven is about Ali losing his younger sister, Zahra's, shoes and trying to make things right without the help of his parents. The family is extremely poor and Ali knows that his father is not in any position to buy another pair of shoes for Zahra. When looking further into this theme, I am amazed at the cultural differences in Middle Eastern and American lifestyles. I have no doubt that there are families in America facing extreme economic hardships that experience some of the sacrifices shown in this film. However, the United States is overall very materialistic and it is not often that we are exposed to families, especially children that are willing to make the sacrifices that the characters of this film made. Ali wanted to take direct responsibility for his sister and felt genuine remorse for the loss of her shoes. In most American films, the audience would be turned off by the main character, especially a boy, crying so often throughout the movie. In this case, Ali's love for his family is prevalent throughout the film and his strong emotions come across very heartfelt and sincere.<br/><br/>In American films, the extremity of violence and other shock factors has become necessary in order to appeal to a desensitized audience. However, the simplicity of Children of Heaven had an ironically similar effect. In our society, we often lose sight of the little things in life and base our happiness around the cost and quantity of what we have. This film made me experience more emotions than many American films that I have seen. The importance of the Muslim's belief in the will of Allah impacted the way that the characters interacted and handled their disappointments. In American society, we tend to blame others for their misfortunes and expect them to be accountable for their own suffering. In contrast, Muslims believe that everything that they experience is what God has intended. In that way, suffering and misfortune take on very different meanings because despite your disadvantages, you are coming closer to God by following his will.<br/><br/>Another difference in the cultural influences of this film is the importance of winning. In America, winning is everything and under no circumstances should you ever be content with losing. However, when Ali won the race he was completely disappointed that he had not finished third. Although the reason for his being upset is because he wanted to win the shoes for Zahra, for most Americans no circumstances would justify not wanting to come in first place. A large reason for this difference is again the importance of the will of God in the Muslim religion. <br/><br/>I was extremely impressed with Children of Heaven and moved by the simplistic and powerful effect the film had on me. The idea that more is always better is proved wrong by this film and the impact that it has made on so many viewers. The extremely low cost of the film, the inexperienced actors, and the lack of technological advancements and images, gives the wrong impression about the quality of the film. In fact, the success of this film shows that the simple things in life are often more important."
"piapia","9","5","5","10 April 2000"," A piece of neo-realism as moving as The Bicycle Thief
","Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered  masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy.  The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.  I have never seen a better motion picture from that part of the world."
"DICK STEEL","10","8","9","5 August 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Children of Heaven
","Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (not illegally of course, but from the library's collection), and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.<br/><br/>There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven, and basically, the children Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) and Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) who play the siblings, will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run, and coming from a poor family, that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it, given that both understand the predicament they're in, and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure, they devise an ingenious, somewhat mad hat plan, to share their shoes - Zahra goes to school in Ali's, before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go ""awww"", culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess, is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to, but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story, and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters, their banter being excellent, and at times, without a need for words. Truly, they are the stars of this film, and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear, but yet not out- of-reach fictional, as they are easily identifiable given that hey, these are the kind of sibling love, or blood being thicker than water, that almost everyone would have experience, or heard about.<br/><br/>Being my first Majid Majidi movie, I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values, and like any other foreign movie, opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family, how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house, and being sensible, well-liked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere, and if you haven't watch this, please do. It's definitely highly recommended stuff!"

"BottleGourdPlant","Null","13","17","22 December 2007"," CHILDREN OF HEAVEN and Eurocentrism
","Majid Majidi's CHILDREN OF HEAVEN (2002) exists in radical opposition to various media representations of Iran Western viewers are most familiar with. Subversive politics, oil, female repression, terrorism, and hostage-holding irrational crazy people are not displayed in the film, images that pop into the average consciousness of a Westerner (i.e. the masses) when thinking of Iran. Quite the opposite is displayed alongside refreshing realizations that Iran is not entirely what Western media organizations have etched into the collective Western social unconscious. The value of Majidi's film for such Western viewers is its assistance in the mental decolonization process that might enable viewers to experience Iran absent from damaging Eurocentric stereotypes.<br/><br/>CHILDREN OF HEAVEN is a beautifully simple film. Given the main characters are children, the film is set up from their perspective. Alongside Majidi's covert filming technique using hidden cameras to bring out the highest possible realism from his actors, the children are in an impoverished situation with the burden of acute familial responsibility that prematurely matures them. These children, although improvised, are not miserable as various media would suggest, but happy and contented. The narrative circles around a pair of lost shoes and the strive to attain a new pair that are sought not out of a materialistic need but a fundamental need reflectant of the culture's attitude towards possessions, an attitude different from the goals and desires of the spoiled, obscene American brat of Hollywood. Although the spoiled, obscene American brat might likewise be a stereotypical representation, within the context of discussing representations, it is significant to discern the contrast.<br/><br/>Ella Shohat and Robert Stam note in UNTHINKING EUROCENTRISM* that Eurocentrism (or the belief in the supremacy of European culture and values whilst demonizing non-European or non-Western cultures and values as subservient) is ""endemic in present-day thought and education (and) is naturalized as 'common sense.'"" From this limited perspective, it is common sense to believe that people of the ""Middle East"" (a Eurocentric term) are suffering, crawling through the dirt, looking for the remnants of their families that had been blown to bits in a terrorist attack as a blood-stained Koran looms in the background. One might not venture too far from a film such as THE EXORCIST (William Friedkin, 1973) where a demonic spirit spawns from an archaeological dig site in the Middle East, possesses a white American girl, then is repressed and conquered by means of a Catholic priest to understand Eurocentric representations in Western culture and view the Middle East as mystical, evil and worthy of fear.<br/><br/>What is scary, though, as Shohat and Stam note, these sentiments are accepted and normalized, etched into the fabric of the social unconscious. Just as the sky is blue and the grass is green, Eurocentricism elicits normalized depictions of Iran (or other countries in the Middle East) as a nation that births evil terrorists. But Ali and Zhara, the children of CHILDREN OF HEAVEN are anything but evil -- they are, rather, transcendent, ""of Heaven."" This is brought to fruition at the end of the film in the famous scene of the goldfish kissing Ali's feet in the circular communal pool in his village. Quite the opposite of a destroyer of peace, Ali IS peace.<br/><br/>This goldfish image serves as a powerful device within the narrative, but more importantly, for Western viewers, serves in the mental decolonization process, a process that must be engaged to replace negative perceptions of a culture with truer renderings. The goldfish leaves viewers in an extremely calm space, almost meditative, a malleable ending hinting that there is much more to Iranian culture versus the ugliness presented via various media -- there is even beauty, emotion, and harmony. Such intense emotion yields great enjoyment, and, in CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, great enjoyment (and liberation) is gleaned for the sake of a culture previously thought of as demonic and regressive.<br/><br/>While it is true Iran, like any country, has issues, it is important to remember these issues do not encompass the entirety of Iranian culture. When viewers focus only on what is bad, the beauty and value of Iran is forgotten, submerged beneath much negativity as unthinking Eurocentric beliefs are perpetuated and passed down to subsequent generations. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN reminds viewers of the unthinking thought-process Western minds so willingly accept -- the film helps humans realize there that the talking heads on their television sets might not be representative of absolute truth.<br/><br/>*Shohat, Ella & Stam, Robert.

","Already 91 reviews for this movie, so why am I writing one. You'll know the answer if you have watched it. Children of haven is the pinnacle of story telling. When we are bombarded with star-studded high budget sagas, there are very few movies which leave an impact like this one. And Hollywood, beware, because Asians can tell stories like no one else in the world. The movie is gripping throughout, especially the last 15 minutes. When Ali tells Zahra that he'll come third in the race to get her those sneakers, I literally had tears in my eyes. And there was no stopping them once the race began. No background music, no special effects, but you could still feel the excitement and anxiety of Ali running for the cause. At that moment I realized, they truly are the Children of Haven. Its amazing how two of the most beautiful foreign films of all times got nominated for Academy in the same year (and eventually Life is Beautiful got the reward). But I can say Children of Haven must have given it a close fight. In all, it was a complete pleasure to watch Children of Haven. Don't miss it for anything."

Your heart just completely opens and cheers on the two main characters, and I was really crying at the end. Only because it really touched my heart. I would have liked to have seen the ending a bit different.

","I lived in Iran when I was younger that the children depicted here. It was also a long time ago (Truman was president). Nevertheless, this was very nostalgic for me.<br/><br/>The plot is more than enough to carry this movie and entertain most adults and many pre-adolescents, but I wouldn't think anyone over 10 or under 30 would be riveted. Young Ali is like many a Hitchcock hero in that the unwanted circumstances he finds himself in are not his fault, but he doesn't really know that.<br/><br/>""Children"" reveals things most Americans think they already know about Iran: Strong patriarchal society, strange mix of high tech and ancient coexisting comfortably, certainly not diverse the way we perceive it. There are some unintended revelations that are refreshing. Strong scholastic discipline among the middle classes, sibling bonding altruism that outstrips natural sibling rivalry, family values that are the equal of any anywhere, but, most beautiful to me, the greenery of the country. This last is not showcased, but all the more surprising because it's taken for granted. This is a beautiful land.<br/><br/>This film should be mandatory viewing for all Department of State and Department of Defense employees and their bosses and their bosses' bosses."
"joshuamolson-1","10","4","4","12 February 2007"," Not so common social criticism
","Before I ever set eyes on Children of Heaven I was told that it was an Iranian film that contained a clandestine layer of social criticism. While I watched I searched all over for signs that could help reveal this to me. Hidden symbolism of a corrupt and immoral power, purposeful ignorance, even Michael Moore. I could find none of these things. Now I knew it would be difficult considering that the movie was made to pass the conservative censoring that was in place to prevent such criticism from being displayed. I was beginning to think that all the talk of criticism was fabricated by imaginative literature teachers and film critics to make the movie more interesting. After reading others reviews of the movie on the Internet I found that I was not the only one who had difficulty in finding any hidden agenda in the movie. While this made me feel slightly better I knew I had to keep trying to find this movie beneath the movie. <br/><br/>It came to me after a second screening of the movie, the title itself is a glaring sarcastic criticism of Iran. Calling Ali and Zhara the Children of Heaven is like naming a movie about modern day Iraq Uneventful Peaceful and Stable Nation. The fact that this name passed censors means that the decision must have been in the hands of a prideful, and arrogant censor.<br/><br/>The title was not the only thing that stuck out at me the second time around. Comparing attitudes between the children and adults in the film you could see that the children when faced with a problem took it upon themselves to solve it, while circumventing any adult inclusion. To include their parents in the problem at hand would mean getting beat, and among other things adding to mounting problems. What was interesting was that the parents, unaware of their children's predicament, cared less about rectifying their problems than the children did about rectifying theirs. It is thought to tell if the children recognize this, and are working to become less like their parents to improve their condition in life, or their motivation is purely not to get beaten. Either way this situation opens up some pretty interesting thoughts on how Iran deals with their problems. Are setbacks, and problems the will of god and something that is meant to be, or are they the will of Iran and dealt with only under threat of punishment? Could the younger generations understand that problems are there to fix and pursue rather than mark down as a way of life?<br/><br/>Overall I thought the film was very entertaining without the social commentary, and became transformed into a very meaningful, and surprising piece with the commentary."

Majidi does this with our young protagonist and his sister, and he does this, amazingly, with those with smaller roles. His technique for making the kids speak volumes (tho they are obviously not ""trained & accomplished"" actors) is the use of their facial expressions, Parviz Malekzaade's attractive cinematography, and the musical score. What captivated me most about the film was that the story was told so well.  It's hard to find a good story teller, and it seems that we can trust Majidi with this.

"Artêmis","8","8","10","29 September 1999"," One simple story that render a good drama
","The story of Children of Heaven can look fool and too simple to be a good one. But it's really good! <br/><br/>Majid Majidi did a film about one poor family where the little son (Ali) lost his sister's shoes. As the family is very poor, Ali tries to keep it as a secret with his sister and doing this he would save his father from paying for new ones. In fact he was afraid of being beaten by his father too.<br/><br/>
During almost one hour they show the pranks of the child. This part is very funny. Some scenes show Zarah (the sister) looking at other girls' shoes and then being shamefaced because his brother's were very large in her feet. One that is very beauty is when they are cleaning the shoes and they start to play with the bubbles. Then Ali discover that there will be a challenge where the third prize would be shoes. So, he enter in the challenge to get the third position. <br/><br/>As many other Iranian films it's a little bit slow and not audacious. But the best is that it show us Iran as it is and not as the USA want us to believe. Everybody know that they do a lot of things with the woman because of the religion but it's not so exaggerated as American films show. If you see 'Not without my daughter', an American film, you may think Iran is the poorest, ugliest and worst place to live in the world. But when you see Children of Heaven you only think that they live in a different culture, in different ways. Now that I saw it I only think that Iran is a country as many other. The unique difference is that woman have to hide their hair. Only this. (Extreme generalization!)<br/><br/>Watching Children of Heaven is a good and different experience. It's a delicate and ingenuous movie but it's touching in the same way."

Even the supporting performances of Ali's father and the-small-girl-in-school are quite commendable.<br/><br/>Losing something you're entrusted to, getting into trouble at home/school, asking your sibling/friend to cover up for you, sharing responsibilities when someone you care is sick, determination to win something with a larger goal in mind - these themes are so universal that a kid or adult from any place could easily relate to. The story might seem too linear and optimistic to some, but it portrays a world of love and selflessness. People, especially kids, with lesser means are often more selfless and helpful than their fellow beings with more riches; they appreciate and understand the value of even the simplest and smallest of things.<br/><br/>The incidents, the adventures, and the whole running around due to the missing pair of shoes teaches them a lot of things. All the running around eventually pays off when Ali gets selected into the school race team; we never really realize how we acquire certain talents.<br/><br/>Other than the brilliant acting, the artistically shot scenes and the remarkable background score add to the beauty and feel of the movie. The seven-minute kids' race sequence towards the and is quite craftily shot and directed. There are so many scenes which are memorable, and stay etched in your mind for a long time."

The one thing they never did, was give up.<br/><br/>I hope this ode to love of family, devotion to hope and having a forgiving heart will be one of my beacons, giving me direction towards light when the dark bleak nights of the soul smother me.<br/><br/>This work of motion picture art seems dedicated to all of us who don't have much left in the world except our human hearts.

The siblings decide to keep the predicament a secret from their parents, knowing that there is no money to buy a replacement pair and fearing that they will be punished.They devise a scheme to share Ali's sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and hand them off to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. This uncomfortable arrangement leads to one adventure after another as they attempt to hide the plan from their parents and teachers, attend to their schoolwork and errands, and acquire a new pair of shoes for Zahra. Zahra sees the shoes on a schoolmate's feet, and follows her home, but the two soon become friends.Ali enters a high-profile children's footrace in the hope of receiving the third prize of a new pair of sneakers. He accidentally places first and wins another prize instead.<br/><br/>The film ends with Zahra finding out that she will not get a new pair of shoes, but there is a quick shot of their father's bicycle at the end of the movie that shows what appears to be the red shoes Zahra had been focusing on earlier and another pair of white sneakers, presumably for Ali, whose old sneakers were torn from so much use. The film ends with the final shot showing blisters on Ali's feet.

"williamtinch","10","3","3","12 February 2007"," Zahra's Shoes
","Children of Heaven is a movie that strays away from the fast paced, action packed thriller that most Americans, like me, are familiar with. The editing and framing are done in compliance with Iranian rules about propriety. Men are never shot in the same scene with women that they are not married to or have a family orientation with, but children, as it is allowed by Iranian standards, are shown in any context with each other and any other adult. The pace of the movie is significantly slowed down from the Western motion picture custom and the scenes, as well as the people, are all real. This is to say, that there are no professional actors in the majority of the movie and the scenes are that of real Iranian cities, schools, and homes; there are no sets. The literary elements of the film are dealt with at a unique angle as well. The plot is based on the folly of Ali as it relates to his sister's cherished shoes, a ratty pair of children's shoes, and the pursuit, after they have been lost, of returning those shoes to Zahra: Ali's sister. The development of the story is slow but charming, in my opinion, as the journey to the regain the shoes is drawn out over the entirety of the film but treated with specificity while using allegory to point out struggles between traditional and modern day Iran in relation to the government of Iran and its impinges on the citizens therein. The characters and conflict are uncomplicated and delightful, seeing that they are simply about common people dealing with common problems. <br/><br/>The real impact of the film is shown in how these common people care for these common blunders that any of us are likely to make; dealing in courageous ways and in observance with honorable means to meet the objectives that each has set forth to accomplish. The social commentary is invisible to the untrained eye, but no less exists clearly within the context of the film to show how each sect of the Iranian society experiences the pleasures and obstacles that are present in modern Iranian life. One such example of this social commentary exists within the relationship of the school principal (symbolizing the government of Iran), Ali's teacher (symbolizing the educated middle class), and Ali himself (symbolizing the lower, working class citizens of Iran). Also, the use of water throughout the movie symbolizes the will of God and is done so with loving consideration, best represented at the end of the movie that closes with Ali's blistered feet resting in a pond (symbolizing that submission to God's will is the best place for anyone and their concern to be). <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film after I understood the context of which the story took place and of what purpose it set out to achieve. Children of Heaven gave me great insight into a society of which I was previously unfamiliar with. I highly recommend the film to anyone who wants to know more about Middle Eastern cultures, especially Iran. In the end, the film points out, rather nicely, the importance of an honorable journey to a principled end while explicating that coming in first, or having the most, are not the most essential pursuits in life. Children of Heaven is a charming story with a profound message that many of us fail to recognize and sometimes all it takes is a simple story about a simple pair of shoes to bring us back."

","When my college professor chose this film to show, I was a bit skeptical as to whether I would enjoy this movie. This was my first time watching an Iranian film. I was surprised to find myself feeling so many different emotions for Ali and his sister Zahra. This is the type of movie that brings happy tears in the end. This film provides you with a story of compassion and love for one another. In the Children of Heaven, a brother shows concern and guardianship for his little sister. This type of behavior towards siblings in the United States is less likely to happen. Therefore, I was surprised at how thoughtful people of Iran treat others they care for. After learning about the Middle East and their relationship with God, I was able to see the symbolisms that the director was portraying. The actors based outcomes in the movie as their belief that the will of God is more powerful than any other belief. Ali coming in first place in the race was a will of God. This might be why Zahra was not upset with him when he returned home empty handed. The director chose to capture the sense of being a child. His film angles were set low at a child's level so the audience could follow along with the kids and relate to them. In addition, the movie shows that the younger generation of Iran seems to be more in control with changes and are willing to change. The older generation of Iran seems to be set in their ways and change is not comfortable with them. This might be why you get the sense that the children are more knowledgeable and clever than their parents and elders. This film is a must see for anyone who is a sucker for tearful happy endings. If you appreciate different cultural beliefs and ideas, chances are Children of Heaven will make you smile."

While this might not be such a travesty in the USA, for these children, it's about the worse thing that can happen to them.  They understand their parent's circumstances and never tell them, almost knowing that it would add to their miserable financial circumstances. Watch the film to see how the boy tries to fix the situation.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, nicely acted, with a not-overly preachy message, it would be a good film for any self-indulgent teenager to see, the next time they argue with their parents over money for the newest or latest status symbols."

Through Majidi's artful directorship we get an intimate understanding of two children's (Ali & Zahra) thoughts, feelings, and intentions from start to end. C.O.H. highlights some very important basic (and increasingly more scarce) core values: courage, honesty, cooperation and faith (and others).<br/><br/>Hard work and co-existence... in a simple village within Tehran, a personal tragedy unfolds between 9-year-old boy (Ali), and his 7-year-old sister (Zahra). These children live with their parents in a bare-bones, one-room flat; the family is faced with a life of poverty and no perceivable future otherwise; each member takes part in doing everything he or she can to survive. The viewer has an opportunity to relate, even connect personally with the characters, thanks to the authenticity of plot, filming, and acting. <br/><br/>Humanity at it's best, the real deal.

"Jilqz","10","2","2","27 May 2019"," Bicycle Thieves meets Grave Of The Fireflies in a sensational Iranian masterpiece
","It was a rather peculiar experience to watch Children of Heaven again, on one hand it brought back a lot of the feelings that I had when I first watched it as a kid and how the lives of those two children resonated with me back then for so long, and on the other hand I can see now how masterfully this piece of art is crafted with my (rather) more experienced eye and so I decided to write my first review ever.
Children of Heaven is a very simple story about an -insignificant- event in the -not so important- life of two Iranian children, it is literally a story conceived with a pair of shoes in the center of it! and yet it succerds in what so many Hollywood blockbusters fail, that is speaking to its audience sincerely and creating characters that we really care for.
You don't need a tragic backstory about a psychologically traumatized childhood for your character or a first class celebrity to take the role in order to make the audience feel the character, it is much more subtle than that.. And Majidi shows us how it's done! (by the way I have to give a shout out to the little children that took the leading roles in the film for their outstanding and touching performances).
Like Grave of The Fireflies, Children of Heaven is about a brother-sister relationship in an environment that is not adequate for their innocence and yet they find meaning in the most insignificant of things, and like Bicycle Thieves, the father-son relationship faces difficulties but is never broken. It is the interpersonal relationships that give these characters a reason to fight the cruel lives they face and find meaning in it.
Children of Heaven, like its two coumterparts, are examples of storytelling at its best.. They don't force anything on you, they don't rely on schmaltzy music or melodramatic special effects, they respect the viewer as not to tell them how to feel at a particular moment, and they all depict ""real"" life no make-up or sugar on the top, just the plain life we all live and see.
I should also point out for the subtle social and economical criticism that Majidi displays in his film, showing us the big differences between the classes and yet not depicting the rich as evil and selfish or the poor as the persecuted heros.
In the end we're left with an ending that's the perfect metaphor for life itself, not a happy ending nor a sad one nor anything actually, it's just there.. This type of ending might as well be of impact on the Iranian cinema as another outstanding Iranian film, A Separation, had a similar type of ending.
In conclusion, Children of Heaven is the type of films that we should all watch from time to time to remind ourselves of life as it is not as it's presented through most of the media. simple but profound are the best words to describe it.
Stay well.."

"bigmoecrusader","10","2","2","11 February 2007"," Ali's struggle
","The movie, Children of Heaven, in many ways could be described as a struggle from within. During the entire movie, moral dilemmas were presented and these two children had to make a choice. The author seems to represent in the two children the openness to change. This could be seen in many cases during the movie. The author portrays the two children changing and adjusting to all the different situations. This shows that the children of Iran are more open to change and more able to change then the later generations. This could also represent Modernity vs. tradition.<br/><br/>Another main theme that was portrayed in the movie was sacrifice. Ali sacrificed many things throughout the movie, to try and find the shoes, and to make sure is his sister had shoes. Ali sacrificed getting kicked out of school for his sister. Ali's school began when his sister's school ended. And Ali would wait for his sister to switch out his school. Another sacrifice that Ali made was the sacrifice of his own shoes. After the race at the climax of the movie, Ali begins to take off his shoes. Not only are his feet covered in blisters, but his shoes are completely ruined from running the race. So the author portrays the fact that Ali was willing to ruin his own shoes in order for his sister to have shoes.<br/><br/>To comfort his sister while she waits to get her shoes back, Ali makes sacrifices and gives her his nice pencil, and his gold pin. Ali's desire to get his sister Zahra's shoes back eventually leads to lust to get her shoes back. Ali even sacrifices playing sports with his friends to go and help his dad work on his day off. Ali's struggle to get his sisters shoes back and his ability to change, shows the audience that the younger generations are more able to change and conform to the growing economy."

"kingm8","Null","3","4","21 February 2007"," levels of the film
","In the 1997 film, Children of Heaven, from director Majid Majidi, the audience is presented with a modern view of Iranian issues. The film portrays an allegorical story in which the current levels of Iranian social order are symbolized through children. The director also, inadvertently, discusses the role of Islam in the lives of Iranians. All of these issues are important to note because they assist the audience in fully understanding the film. I will provide the reader with a brief plot summary, followed by examples of significant symbolism, and finally discuss the director's motivations for portions of the film.<br/><br/>This interestingly creative commentary on the Iranian way of life begins by offering the audience with their first bit of symbolism in the opening scenes. The audience is shown a wide lends shot of a shoe cobbler fixing a decrepit, old shoe that looks as if it belongs to a young girl (which we are later shown is the case). It is apparent that the shoe carries great significance because it is the film's longest scene and is the object that keeps the plot in constant momentum. Once the shoe is fixed by the man it is given back to Ali, the film's main character who portrays the youth of Iran, and who also loses the shoe when he put it down at the market. He returns home without the shoe to tell his sister that it was lost but that he will find it. This is where the audience first sees their home and how poor they are, a common reality for a large number of Iranians. The plot of the film centralizes around Ali's determination to retrieve the lost shoes which appear to always be around the corner. This may be another comment from the director in regards to change in the lives of Iranians and how he thinks it is just around the corner.<br/><br/>The audience is presented with characters along Ali's journey that stand for things such as the Iranian government and citizens both impoverished and wealthy. The students of children's school are shown each day in the courtyard in straight rows where they all are directed to repeat after the teacher who is announcing rules through a megaphone. This is an apparent representation of the government's role and of the citizens'. The audience is also submerged with countless examples that represent the will of God or Allah; with the use of water which symbolizes purification, and through the different characters and settings. When we meet the little girl who is wearing Zahra's shoes and then is followed home by Zahra, we see that she is very poor also and her father is blind. But even though their situation is a rough one, one that is very similar to most Iranians, they are still very happy. I think this sums up what the director has in store for the future of Iranians.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I felt that the film was very moving and spoke about numerous issues such as poverty, the relationship between us and God, and the relationship between man and government. I think that the director's use of children to convey his message is very innovative and I feel it was a success. It is not hard to see why after viewing the film, that it was so popular among critics. Lastly, I believe that the director's choice of ending is meant to leave the audience with whatever they imagine as the importance because so many people have so many ideas of what the future has in store for Iran."

Not quite this movie!<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of Umberto D., a masterpiece by the ""Boss of All Bosses"", Vittorio De Sica.<br/><br/>It deserves a 10, but for a couple of scenes that were not fully convincing: One involving a dog, and another that involves an accident."

"faterson","7","2","3","13 November 2018"," A Nice (Partly Frightening) Movie, But I Don't Get All the Rave Reviews
","_Children of Heaven_ is pretty shocking in its depiction of poverty in modern-day Tehran. Well, ""modern-day"": for the first few dozens of minutes in the movie, you might as well be watching a story from centuries ago. The only aspect of contemporary life visible in the frame is a small, old-fashioned TV set; and a radio transistor, like those commonly used 50 years ago, perhaps. Only later in the movie, when the father and son, riding a bicycle, visit ""downtown, modern"" Tehran, does one clearly realize that the movie is, in fact, fully taking place in the present day, although it certainly doesn't look like it to a Western viewer.<br/><br/>I may be naive, but somehow one would expect a ""religious state"" to be better capable of taking care of its citizens, so that such extremes of poverty can be avoided. I mean, to shoot a movie in 1997 showing a pair of sneakers as the most precious imaginable possession is just sad. The illusion must be similar to what one used to expect from Communist countries - that they would eliminate sharp class divides within society. That's what Communists used to preach, in theory - but in practice, they failed miserably. Does Iran as a religious society wish to remove such sharp divides? I have no idea, but it was disappointing to see so clearly in the movie that they apparently still exist in Iran today.<br/><br/>After I finished watching the movie, I wasn't entirely satisfied. Basically, everything turned out right, as it typically does in fairy-tales. OK, but it also lends a ""phony"" aspect to the movie: the movie pretty much tells the viewers, ""Ah, it's not really as bad as it all initially seems. Just lay back and enjoy the movie - everything will sort itself out eventually, so there's no reason to get upset. You viewers can go ahead and live your comfortable lives just like before, and you can forget about everything you saw in this movie because, see, these folks are eventually capable of resolving all their problems by themselves.""<br/><br/>But is that true in real life? And is it a hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece to make viewers comfortable? To be honest, I'd rather expect the opposite effect from an outstanding work of art. _Children of Heaven_ appears to be soothing the viewers' bad conscience: ""We don't really care about all the terrible struggles these poor folks experience on a daily basis, but that's OK, because they can sort it all out by themselves at the end of the day.""<br/><br/>There's a fairytale-like atmosphere around _Children of Heaven_; the adults in this world appear threatening, but eventually, as it turns out, most are just kind-hearted folks. In the midst of the harshest conditions, people are, in their depth, mostly good. That's a nice, heart-warming theory, but is reality quite as simple? The movie makes it seem *too* simple and allows the viewers to conclude that no measures need to be undertaken to help those around the world who are currently suffering. That's a less elating, and one might almost say - a kitschy aspect of the movie: ""The good will prevail, it always does, so why should I worry or do anything about bad things that exist in this world?""<br/><br/>There's another kitschy aspect in _Children of Heaven_, as there often is with children's movies: the two children in the lead roles are just too cute. What if the two kids were ugly? Would there still be a movie?<br/><br/>Finally, the movie was a bit frightening to watch from a European perspective. I find even ""liberal"" European schools too suffocating for a free-thinking spirit, but that's nothing compared to how Iranian schools are depicted in _Children of Heaven_. One is reminded of army barracks rather than an educational institution. The ""uniforms"" worn by everyone except males in the movie (headwear by all women, the exact same clothing by all school kids...) strengthen the ""military"" impression generated by the movie. Uniform clothing - uniform thinking...<br/><br/>Does _Children of Heaven_ deserve its Oscar nomination? It's a very good movie, beautifully shot and apparently realistic, showing you both sides of Tehran as if you visited it in person, but the movie's praise is perhaps exaggerated. It's very much a movie in the spirit of De Sica's classic _Bicycle Thieves_, and it goes to the credit of _Children of Heaven_ that one can pronounce this comparison without blushing. Still, to me, it lacks the intensity and artistry of the classic - unlike here, I never for a second mistook _Bicycle Thieves_ for a fairy-tale while watching it."

","Being an ardent fan of realistic movies, Children of Heaven came as a perfect antidote to my fading belief in unadulterated love. The plot line, although rather simplistic has managed to collate multiple facets of growing up in financially decrepit circumstances. While Ali tries frantically to endure the month till his father can afford a new pair of shoes for Zehra, I was taken back to childhood days and I could feel the Ali wailing inside me, repenting for our mistakes and innocuously hiding them. My favourite moment in the movie was at the end where Ali ends up crying because he won the race and failed to come third, which would have given him a new pair of shoes as the prize money. We also get to see the reason why they are truly children of heaven, when Zehra decides to forgive her school friend whom she suspects has her stolen shoes, on finding out that her father was blind. Rarely do movies bring out such brilliant moments of human empathy. A must watch and it definitely goes into my list of all time favorites."

The spin-off events from the loss of the shoes and the adventures of the kids are quite entertaining. Also a great, warmth-filled reminder of life's simple pleasures and how things which may seem unimportant to one person in one culture and/or socio- economic sphere can be vitally important to someone with different circumstances.<br/><br/>Not particularly profound though. The movie doesn't really come up with much in the way of profundities or even a powerful conclusion (in fact, the conclusion is fairly weak).

","A masterwork of heartfelt grace, endless warmth & soulful compassion, Children of Heaven is an affectionately crafted, tenderly structured & wonderfully performed coming-of-age drama that not only paints a beautifully evocative portrait of siblings relationship but also offers a very captivating glimpse into the lives of lower-class Persian society.<br/><br/>Set in an impoverished neighbourhood in Tehran, Children of Heaven concerns a young boy whose routine is thrown off-balance after he misplaces a pair of shoes that belonged to his sister. Promising to make up for the loss and requesting her to not mention the incident to their parents, the two devise a scheme to solve the problems on their own in the meantime.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Majid Majidi, the film features a very simple premise which is then brought to life in a very humane & humble manner. Despite the poor neighbourhood setting, the story doesn't have an ounce of cynicism in it, for all Majidi is concerned with is illustrating the siblings bonding & their shared predicament after the shoes go missing. It's pure, kind-hearted & delightfully sweet.<br/><br/>Set pieces are kept to a minimum, plot is firmly rooted in reality, and there is a very naturalistic feel to how its events unfold. The two kids play their part very convincingly and are finely supported by the rest of the cast. Pacing is steady throughout its runtime, and keeps its childhood spirit alive till the very end. And its blissful tone & adorable quality is further amplified by its mesmerising score.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Children of Heaven is an exquisite, nostalgic & intimate cinema that captures the essence of childhood in full-fledged fashion and brims with heartwarming themes that reflect the goodness in humanity. An adorable, innocent & refreshing delight that begins on an arresting note and culminates on an emotional high, this Persian gem is absolutely worth your time & money. Thoroughly recommended."

","When reading up about the Iran New Wave (INW) one of the first titles I found out about was Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. Intrigued by the details,I was disappointed in being unable to track a good print of the movie down. Checking on what films were about to go from Netflix UK,I was thrilled to find an INW film,that I hoped would be heavenly viewing.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Going to get shopping for his family,Ali puts the new shoes his dad ordered for his sister Zahra on the side for a minute.Coming back with a shopping bag,Ali finds that the shoes have been taken. Thinking of the money issues facing the family,Ali tries to keep things hidden. Secretly talking to Zahra,the siblings make a deal of each taking it in turns to wear Ali's old sneakers between classes. Believing that this is the new path they must walk,Ali is thrilled to learn of a contest that might let him make things up to Zahra.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Keeping the camera at Ali and Zahra's level,writer/director Majid Majidi & cinematographer Parviz Malekzaade masterfully cut rustic INW Neo-Realism with the dramatic heft of the Sports Drama. Keeping costs as low as possible by shooting on location, Majidi gives the side streets of Tehran an earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing in the daily life of the family and small tracking shots getting beneath the busy streets of the town. Stepping into the ""sports movie"" Majidi balances the earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out the loud gasps from Ali in his desire to make up for his mistake.<br/><br/>Lacing a bond between brother and sister,the screenplay by Majidi gives an extraordinary richness in the daily lives of the family,as Majidi brings to light the smallest moments between the family,from Zahra and Ali writing less than secret notes to each other,to Ali having to run out in the rain to put his torn sneakers in the family shoe area. Joining Ali in putting running shoes on, Majidi wonderfully skips over Sport movie clichÃ©s by keeping Ali's contest firmly linked to the family troubles that give the film a touchingly poetic final note. Criss-crossing school runs under the noses of their mum and dad, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi give magnificent performances as Ali and Zahra,thanks to Seddiqi giving Zahra a taut sharpness, whilst Seddiqi gives Ali a nose to the grindstone determination to find some heavenly footwear."

","Older brother makes a mistake carrying out his duties that in effect involves the sharing of shoes with his little sister. The idea that a pair of shoes, simple shoes, can change a families life on levels of loss and aspiration are indelibly portrayed in this film. The children take it upon themselves to carry the burden to the extent of hiding their shared secret from parents. How this evolves through the story is nothing short of minimalist exposition with superb attention to detail. Acting is beyond anything Hollywood could imagine, story beyond what many can relate to. At the same time, the story sucks you in and takes you to a place you forgot. Memorable, heartfelt and involving ideas lost in western materialism. Watch it and feel your childhood. Certainly not a gender study, this film is about the personal perception of characters and their goals. Truly film-making at it's finer moments. Almost perfect.

When Ali loses his sister's shoes the duo decide to share Ali's in fear that his poverty ridden family will become upset. Ali then forms a plan to fix his mistake in secrecy. On his journey there are genuine scenes of action packed excitement, and moments of heartwarming love from people that hold little to their name. <br/><br/>One thing I thoroughly enjoyed about this film was that the director did an excellent job of showing the Muslim culture in a light not often seen by the western culture. The intimacy of the characters and families does a great deal in educating viewers of a culture other than their own. <br/><br/>This film puts Hollywood film making to shame, and truly shows that special effects are not necessary in making a film that is exciting and eventful.

Once after 20 minutes when I understood what the film would be about, I was astounded at the marvelous script. What makes this film superb is the fact that it is explores the nature of humans. All other things related to the film are simple but the characters are the fuel for the film which makes it the favorite for many. Human emotions are portrayed at their best. The acting by the cast has to be applauded. But the backbone of the film is two cute and innocent kids and a beautiful script. In my opinion the film teaches a lot of things with love as a sweetener. It conveys a lot of important messages. One important message imbibed in it is to never lose faith even when there are a lot of problems. I have always liked films which are on the path of changing the attitude of the people in the world. Because every character in the film is shown kind hearted and that is a positive wave missing these days in people. One such film was Kiki's Delivery Service, which also portrayed human struggle but also has shown that people in the world are not bad. To me, films like these are revolutionary and help in generating faith in people when everything is lost.

"kjvenkatraman","10","1","1","29 June 2012"," Simply Powerful and Classic!!!
","The movie starts with a cobbler mending a pair of shoes and this goes on for about a good 3 minutes. One wonders why the director would choose to show something like this for 3 mins. But this gave me a sense of assurance that I am gonna watch a gripping and a solid movie. And yes, it was more than what I'd expected. This is one movie that I don't miss mentioning in any discussion about movies among friends.<br/><br/>The movie's beauty is in its details, the mood set for the plot, the simplicity of its narration, the characterization and of course the performances. The story is simply this. Bro loses the pair of shoes of his kid sis. Disappointed sis agrees to share the pair of bro's sneakers fearing their father's reaction to the lost shoes / empathizing with father's helpless financial situation. Rest of the movie is just about how they manage with one pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>The movie would have been half as decent without the details delved in to in some of the simpler things - right from showing a typical day in the life of the boy, details of how impoverished the family is and the several hints / dialogues pointing to that, sis chasing a sneaker that fell in the gutter, camera tracking the sis and bro all the way from and to school every day showing the busy streets, the distance, etc., the sis looking at the shoes worn by other students during the prayer session at school and her mental preoccupation with the shoes while other kids have fun playing around. The director has taken every possible effort to totally impress upon the viewer a few things - the family's financial situation, the kids' camaraderie and their respect and love for each other, their ability to empathize and manage. Any shortfall in impressing these premises would have just not lead to such an impact from the movie.<br/><br/>About the performances. The kids' expressions speak volumes!! Right number of dialogues fitting the innocence and responsible nature of the kids. Emotions have been dealt with absolute clinical precision. Right mix of innocence, subservience, love, anger, empathy, frustration, etc. The change of moods in a split second whenever the kids' discuss the pair of shoes just brings goosebumps and tears. There are many occasions when the sis loses her temper over the bro for having lost her shoes and warns him about complaining to their dad. She however holds high regards for her bro (which she displays beautifully) and listens to him on why she should not do that. From fury it gradually mellows down to anger-with-respect to frustration to helplessness and to childish joy from reassuring comfort provided by bro. All in 1-2 mins. Any more or less dialogues than what they are would have just screwed it all up.<br/><br/>Background score does its bit judicially. It supports the screenplay and performances by not distracting the viewers with music everywhere just for the heck of it. Background is more of sounds of the world around.<br/><br/>Overall a must watch for every movie connoisseur and particularly for those who love family drama genre. Movies that come close in terms of impact created and brilliance in film making are bicycle thief, life is beautiful, pursuit of happiness, hachiko, shwaas (marathi), kanchivaram (tamil) and parts of colour of paradise (from the same director as children of heaven). I'd rate this 10 on any day!! Very glad I watched this movie."

","Until a fortnight ago I'd never seen an Iranian film and assumed any film from their would just be religious or political propaganda... perhaps there are films like that but having just watched this film and ""Offside"" it is clear that they also make fantastic character based films that are a delight to watch.<br/><br/>On the face of it a film about a poor boy losing his sister's only pair of shoes doesn't sound the basis for a film that is both interesting and a joy to watch but it works. With his mother too ill to work and his father in a low paid job young Ali promises his sister Zahra that he will get her shoes back if she doesn't tell their parents about the loss. When he fails to find them he offers to share his own footwear; an old pair of trainers. This means that as soon as her school is over Zahra must run through the narrow back streets to get the shoes to Ali so he can go to his school, even though he runs he is slightly late each day and is getting in trouble. <br/><br/>Director Majid Majidi did a great job getting such natural performances from his two stars, both of whom were young children. It is surprising that the children didn't go on to star in further films as they were both a joy to watch and made the viewer really care for their plight. The film might sound a bit boring and depressing but it isn't, there are a few sad scenes but for the most part it is a film that had me smiling from start to finish, I'll have to look out for more films from Iran."

","From Iran comes a wonderfully unique and family friendly film. Unique in the portrayals of it's children characters, children who act and feel like real children. Their acting is great and their emotions pull you right along with them. This film is a great example of simple storytelling that works in a grand way. This would be a great film for younger kids to see, much better for them and their young minds then some of the Hollywood trash that's pumped into their face. The subtitles are relatively easy to read and the story is simple and easy to follow. The camera work gives you a great feel for the area of Iran and it's people at the time. All said a unique and original film and in all the right ways."
"iterlongum","9","1","1","5 March 2007"," Beautiful Poetic Imagery
","Children of Heaven is a simple movie, but creative in its imagery and symbolism. The story is about a boy who loses his sister's shoes and his fierce determination to get his sister a replacement pair. The most poignant scene that illustrates the boy's desire to help his sister and bring her comfort is shown in the marathon race around the lake in a modern downtown city in Iran.<br/><br/>Ali enters a marathon race to win third prize, which is a new pair of sneakers, for his sister, Zahra. The race begins and Ali is in the middle of a pack of boys, all around his age. A few times, Ali trips and falls to the ground, causing him to fall behind the other boys in the race, losing his place. Every time he falls down, he picks himself back up with a look of fierce determination on his face and charges back into the race. He is breathing heavily and fatigue begins to show on his face, but he only thinks of his sister and his promise to get her a new pair of shoes. This show of fierce family loyalty is so moving, especially from one so young.<br/><br/>All around him there are birds chirping and trees moving past him, with a large lake behind Ali in every take. This reference to a garden, water, and Ali's promise are striking allusions to the Islamic religion on which this movie is based. The lake is an Islamic symbol for purification, alms, and the Will of God. Water is an unstoppable force that cannot be avoided just as God is an unstoppable force that is always affecting man's everyday lives. The trees and the sound of the birds singing is another allusion to God through nature. This nature is a representation of the Garden of Eden from which all of mankind derived and will one day re-enter.<br/><br/>This movie ties together to Islamic tradition of family helping one another in times of need and the will and power of God in their everyday lives. This is definitely a movie worth seeing if you love simple and beautiful imagery, straightforward story line, and the determination of man to overcome adversity."
"brendanjeffrey","9","1","1","14 February 2007"," The Portrayal of Poverty
","This film was something very different for me to view. Coming from an American movie watcher's point of view this movie had a very stark contrast to the usual films that I would see at movie theaters. This wasn't a bad thing it made the film that much more interesting because of the way the story was portrayed.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around a pair of shoes. These are the shoes of Zahra the sister of, and one of the main characters, Ali. After Ali has these shoes repaired he ends up losing them because a trash collector, thinking that they were garbage, picks them up. Throughout the movie Ali attempts to track down the shoes while having to share his shoes with Zahra. Their father cannot afford new shoes because they live in poverty. It is very interesting to see what happens while searching for the shoes.<br/><br/>This plot may seem kind of boring, but it the film took this seemingly boring story and actually made it very interesting, even for an American Audience base. Some of this was due in part to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the shoes. There was quite a bit of symbolism throughout the entire film. The idea that anytime water is flowing, or you see water, signifies the Will of God or just God himself comes to mind in the context of the Muslim faith. The Muslim faith believes that water symbolizes God and the Will of God. The way the film shoots the water scenes show that it is the will of God to not regain the shoes and in the end to accept that they have been lost. No matter how the children attempt to fight this it keeps coming back to them in new forms. Ali signifies rising up against injustice and even he, the one who will take a stand against oppression, cannot fight the Will of God.<br/><br/>The actors portrayed the roles very well. Even being children, without much acting experience, you believe the portrayal. Also the way in which the film was edited made it seem a bit slower than American films. As well as the camera work and lighting, the film had a feeling of poverty and being in the busy city while the characters sometimes felt out of place.<br/><br/>In the end Children of Heaven is a film which is something that most Americans may not understand, unless given some background. That set aside it is a very good movie. Without some cultural knowledge people may miss some of the symbolism, but the story will still come through to the people who aren't as cultured. The film portrays the struggles of poverty and everyday city life in Iran and puts the world in context. A pair of shoes is more important to these children than being to school on time, looking fashionable or even winning. Something that Americans would find to be trash is something that is cherished and loved by these children."
"GrowingMind","8","1","1","11 February 2007"," Children of Heaven (1997) Warms the Heart and Teaches Compassion
","This Iranian film depicts the love a young boy named Ali has for his younger sister named Zahra. Early in the film Ali loses his sister's most prized possession, a pair of shoes, and spends the remainder of the film doing his best to make it up to her. The fact that the family is extremely poor and the feared wrath of the father if he were to find out about the lost shoes add to the tension of the film.<br/><br/>One idea that helped me to appreciate what I have a little more, was the poverty portrayed in the film. The family is very poor. They live in one room apartment and shoes are the most prized possessions the children own. Even though this family is extremely poor, they still find it in themselves to give soup to a nearby family even worse off. Zahra desperately wants to find her missing shoes but when she finds the little girl who has them.... The disparate in living conditions from the poor areas to the big cities and higher class neighborhoods is very vividly pictured. I believe the director was also hoping to provoke a response of compassion in the middle and upper class citizens along with the government in Iran with the reality of poverty in some areas.<br/><br/>The director's use of settings and atmosphere pulled me into the story. The young actors did such a convincing job I could begin to feel the emotions they were portraying on the screen. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys foreign film or for anyone who would like to gain a slight bit of insight into middle eastern culture."
"morganhiatt","8","1","1","11 February 2007"," Children of Heaven
","The Children of Heaven is a great foreign film that follows these two children through all their ups and downs and journeys. I believe that this movie does a great job of symbolizing the ideas of modernity vs. tradition and the values of Islam.<br/><br/>For instance, the will of God was presented through out this movie and shown in a good light. In the movie Ali and Zahra were very effective in changing their lives and having an effect on what was going on and how they were going to do things. This was also done better than the parents because they were not shown in a very leading light like the children were but more in the background and shadows. This also demonstrates the idea that the younger generation is more open and willing to change than the older generation.<br/><br/>An example of this effect that the children have would be when Zahra finally finds her shoes. When the two of them chase down the girl and see her family and how they live they decide that it is not worth taking the shoes back since the family seemed to be much poorer than they were.<br/><br/>Another effect would be when Ali went with his father to find work in the uptown city; he showed more backbone than his father did. Ali found a way to ask others is they needed any gardeners and eventually he found someone they could work for. In this effect Ali was able to get his father the job which in turn earned them quite a bit of extra money. And in a round about way this money eventually gets the two children gifts that they would enjoy.<br/><br/>These are just a few of the examples throughout the movie that show a lot of effect from the children that from the parents. This is a great movie and it depicts a different culture in a very interesting light."
"queenofcrystals","8","1","1","10 February 2007"," A touching movie about belief in God and God's love
","""Children of Heaven"" is a very heartwarming movie. It is a Middle Eastern film from Iran and therefore is subtitled and very different from American movies. It does move rather slow and has many scenes with little or no talking. I believe this is good because it gives you time to think about and recognize what is going on in the movie without relying on the characters to tell you. Many things in the movie are implied rather than stated outright. Very few, if any, of the actors were professionals, however the cast is brilliant. The main character, the young boy Ali, is especially convincing. The movie has heavy Islamic themes which you should be able to easily pick out if you have knowledge of the religion. I believe the overall theme of the movie would be that God will always take care of you, even if he does it in a way you did not expect.<br/><br/>Ali is a young boy who accidentally lost his younger sister, Zahra's, shoes. Their family cannot afford to buy a new pair, so Ali and Zahra race back and forth from school to share one pair of sneakers. At the end of the movie, Ali participates in a race to win a pair of sneakers for his sister. He must come in third place to win the shoes, but through his determination he accidentally comes in first. He is very disappointed and extremely exhausted after the race. He goes home to Zahra knowing he has let her down. The movie then cuts to a scene of his father at the market and shows new shoes for Ali and Zahra on the back of his bike. Then it comes back to Ali and we watch as he soothes his tired, blistered feet in a pool of water.<br/><br/>Ali and Zahra worked very hard to share one pair of sneakers and to keep their parents from worrying about Zahra's lost shoes. Although it was hard, they worked together every day. Ali was very excited when the prospect of new sneakers came up. He knew he could win them and tried his hardest. But in the end, he did not get what he wanted. He felt like a failure and knew his sister was disappointed. However, the viewers see that everything is taken care of; both children will get new shoes. This clearly shows the author's belief that God will give his people what they need. He gives Ali a cool, refreshing pool to soak and cleanse his aching feet in. And even though He did not give Ali the shoes from the race, He still provided shoes; a pair for each child. So God provided even more than what was needed. So in the end, God will take care of you so long as you work hard and care about others."

And the best part was that all the moments that brings a smile on your face or the ones which make your heart sigh are so honest that when in the finale race ALI is gasping, you gape at his desperation and pray for him.<br/><br/>Linear storytelling, average cinematography, but then probably that was deliberate to give the movie,the simple feel that it had.

Unlucky for this film that it was nominated alongside the classic Life is Beautiful.

"mdm-11","9","1","1","4 October 2006"," Life's magic is in the simple things
","The simple story of a family's struggles with poverty is told through the eyes of children. A boy misplaces the worn out shoes of his little sister, and thus is forced to share his own pair of sneakers with her, taking turns attending school. Afraid to tell their parents, the siblings continue the deception for days.<br/><br/>The father is hard working, yet poorly paid, while the mother appears repeatedly disabled by a slip disc condition. It is heart breaking to hear the parents discuss their money problems, mainly the unpaid rent and other bills. When the wife suggests an operation to put an end to her constant back pains, the husband insists that the dangers of permanent damage would be too risky, better to put up with occasional attacks. The viewer can recognize the true issue of money.<br/><br/>There are few, but very sincere expressions of love. To see the boy's face light up when his father praises his abilities is beautiful. When the mother expresses how proud she is of the children for helping her at home, the little ones beam with happiness. There are also examples of charity and generosity, neighborly gestures of kindness, that are rare in most cultures, especially in lands of plenty. The final minutes of the film are both deeply touching and hopeful. The scene ends in the little boy's total hopelessness, while the viewer knows about the eminent ray of joy to enter the children's life.<br/><br/>For people of other cultural background it is very pleasant to see how children here are compelled to unquestioned obedience towards authority figures, asking permission to speak by raising their finger, never daring to interrupt or be disrespectful. School work is seen as an honor, and talent as a gift. Despite obvious economic disadvantages, the absence of rebellious youth in this culturally different society is unknown to Westerners, and it is certainly refreshing. <br/><br/>Winning many International Awards, ""Children Of Heaven"" was also the first ever entry from Iran to be nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar. Pure and innocent, a true example of the triumph of the human spirit. I can highly recommend this film, especially to children unaccustomed to extreme poverty. Even without the ability to keep up with fast paced subtitles, one can appreciate the magic of this cinema gem!"

"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","4","27 April 2010"," The Innocence of Childhood
","With sheer simplicity, passion, innocence and poetry, Majidi tells the story of a brother and his sister in 'Bacheha-Ye Aseman'. Here is another director who uses his film-making element to the minimal (with no special effects, lavish sets, extraordinary action scenes etc) and can create something so magnificent. Simply put, 'Bacheha-Ye Aseman' is a slice of life. Majidi is such a sincere and passionate storyteller that he easily captures reality in his films. His shots are simplistic yet detailed enough. The backdrop of poverty, the ravishing natural landscape and the city wonderfully juxtapose each other. The score flows brilliantly with the natural sounds. The pure glimpse of life that the viewer gets of these two siblings is handled with care and tenderness and portrayed effectively. It feels like one is watching these people in real life. Another thing Majidi beautifully demonstrates is how middle class people cherish the simple moments while others take them for granted. Little Ali only wants to make third place in the race (he doesn't want 1st or 2nd) just so that he can get his sister a new pair of shoes to replace the ones he had lost. There's another wonderful scene that shows what a mere smile on a parent's face can do for a child. Majidi has tackled such daily themes with Ã©lan. The entire cast, especially child actors, Mohammad Amir Naji and Bahare Seddiqi, perform outstandingly. Majidi has done an incredible job in extracting natural performances from these two young actors. It easily ranks among the finest examples of acting by children. 'Bacheha-Ye Aseman' is a unique cinematic experience. It's a treat to watch and an enchanting cinematic gem."

"dbogosian-1","8","2","4","26 January 2008"," Enjoyable, simple family movie with solid values
","This is a great movie especially for children: the plot is simple, there is no real villain, the main characters are children, and it's an excellent eye-opener about how life is lived in a very different society.<br/><br/>It suffers a bit because it is too simple, and doesn't have quite enough tension to keep adults fully interested; but since it is fairly short, it doesn't really drag either.<br/><br/>The story illustrates the story of a very poor family in which the brother (Ali) manages to lose the only pair of shoes that his sister (Zahra) has. To avoid the wrath of the father who is behind on rent and is unable to make ends meet, they work out a scheme whereby they take turns with Ali's sneakers: Zahra takes them to school in the morning, then Ali in the afternoon. Eventually Ali enrolls in a race hoping to bring home a new pair of sneakers as the prize.<br/><br/>There is much of great value in this film. The two children really shine: they are endearing, tender, kind, almost saintly. It's particularly touching to see Ali's concern for his little sister, knowing that it was his fault the shoes were lost, and how he does so many things to try and cushion the loss for her. The father is the one character with some depth or complexity. He's easily angered and gruff, yet he clearly loves his children and wife and is doing his best in spite of circumstances. <br/><br/>Another weakness of the movie was the ending, which left a lot to be inferred by the viewer and did not have the tidy, clear conclusion one would expect. Then again, the art of film-making lies in subtleness, but I thought this might have been too subtle.<br/><br/>This is an excellent didactic movie for children: it promotes decency and goodness and it teaches the value of self-sacrifice and caring for others in one's family; that even when one is poor, one can perform acts of charity towards others even less fortunate; that the greatest nobility in human character can be found among the poorest and most destitute, but also among the rich (e.g., the grandfather who hires Ali's father as gardener). These virtues and values are universal and transcend nationality and ethnicity and religion, which is why this movie has such a broad appeal."

","One of the new Iranian cinema's most accessible films, this is actually a very worthy movie, if a bit on the sentimental side (while Iranian movies have a strongly humanistic bent, they usually reject maudlin sentimentalism). Directed by Kiarostami's disciple Majidi, this story tells the tale of a brother and a sister from a poor neighborhood in Tehran. Problem comes when the boy, through no fault of his own, loses her sister's shoes. Since their family is too poor to buy a new pair of shoes, they have to share their shoes in secret, trading them off in a rush every day. The boy eventually comes up with a plan to solve this problem: entering into a race that gives a pair of shoes as a prize to the third-placed runner. The climactic race is a bit on the sentimental side, but the movie is very much worthwhile watching.

A boy loses his sister's shoes after he picks them up from the shoe repair shop and the rest of the movie consists of him and his sister trying to hide this from their parents. So, HOW does this merit a 9? Well, actually it came pretty close to a 10 (for that see the follow-up film The Color of Paradise)--it was that good. This is thanks to excellent acting by real people and a humanity about the film that crosses all cultures. Despite so many differences between the people of Iran and the United States, this film gave me a ray of hope due to characters' decency and sense of values.

","Its a short story like Vannadhasan's in Tamil. It's poetic in nature. The characters are all good people. Its a children movie. There are always arguments about showing 'what people are' and 'what people could be' in movies.  For this story there is no need to show people as they are. That would shadow the main point of the story-Love inspite of one's struggles. So far I have seen only this Iranian movie. But its wonderful. The director's view is exactly coinciding with a child's view. 'Bubbles', 'sneakers in the rain','girl looking at all shoes in the prayer', 'class room dialogue for football match between students' and 'giving the new pen gift to the sister' are typical of children. The film has much more. The 'poverty' is not stressed much. But that is also the reason for viewers enjoying the movie instead of feeling the social contrastness. As I see from a country like India I felt very closer to the Iranian people because their life style portrayed in this movie looks familiar and gave me the feeling that people are same everywhere. In India for the past decade since the Babri Majid demolition there has been ill opinions about the life style of Muslims (closed, religiously fanatic ,inhumane and possesive) spread by the fascist movements like RSS and BJP. Movies like these may help ordinary film goers in some way."

","The camera suddenly slowed down, and Ali's blue sweatshirt shook and swayed in the wind. His face was deformed due to nervousness, his head unsteadily swaying from side to side following his footsteps, and the sweat slipped unconsciously along the temples. In the silence, I could only hear the sound of ""tap"" and ""tap"" in the footsteps and their breathing which was thick and rapid due to lack of oxygen. When there was almost no energy, some words began to echo in his mind. ""How can I go to school without shoes?"" ""Come on, Sarah, hurry."" ""I will win the third place for you, definitely."" So I looked at He took a very tense step, surpassing the previous ones step by step. Step by step, as if desperately, tears dripped down.<br/><br/>It was a depression in Ali's heart. He owed his sister a pair of shoes, which he lost because of him. So he used all his energy to run, just want to get the third prize, a pair of sneakers. Five thousand kilometers is like a marathon to a 9-year-old child. He has never received any training or guidance and won the championship. It was the hard and pressing life condition on weekdays that created him, and the conviction given to him by deep love and responsibility turned into the strength of his persistence in the most difficult times.<br/><br/>Running, in the name of love. Life, in the name of love.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The tone of the film has always been calm and calm, clean, without excessive words and emotions, like the clear eyes of Iranian children. The life of the people at the bottom is bitter. A family with three children has been overwhelmed by the pressure of life. My mother was seriously ill and my father complained constantly. However, no one in this family has lost confidence in life and is not disoriented. They have the collective expression of poor people all over the world, cowardly, kind, and forbearing. They silently endured the difficulties of life, and silently released their inner strong nature. They won't crumble and collapse because of a little setback. Because resistance and struggle are actually not the subject of life. As long as they can afford it, they will definitely not break out. People at the bottom of life will always bear the humiliation most. However, this film is far from, or not intended to tell us all at all. Unlike many political films we have seen, it tells us that such deep-seated social causes. If you superficially speculate on the director's mind and wait to understand the real intention of the film, you will definitely be ashamed and feel sad for your institutionalized brain consciousness.<br/><br/>The film does not discuss equality, freedom, or simply does not want to be entangled in topics that are seriously concerned in the institutional sense. In front of life, the director only opened one eye, calm and objective. Yes, life is not fair. Even a seemingly equal long-distance race has a vicious hand pulling behind. But Ali got up again, he just wanted to run, and as long as he was running third, what a sad black humor.<br/><br/>Please remember that such a director, he may be very happy to be friends with people like Zhuangzi, thinking of high house building, freehand and ethereal, full of humanity, the glory of the naked child. He didn't want to tell us how cruel our lives were, or suggested that we resist all kinds of arrangements. He probably didn't want to tell us anything at all. He just showed us the peaceful and gentle side of humanity, shaming us, thinking deeply, and encouraging us."

But I think this is a good father, knowing to love his wife and children. He has always used what he has done to do his fatherhood and set an example for his children. I suddenly remembered my dad. He was the most taboo in his life to owe something to others, so if I borrow someone else 's money or things at school, he always quarrels with me: ""I do n't have enough money at home? As much as you want, we are not without it, we have to borrow it. "" I also have an older brother. Because of my marriage and buying a house, my parents' savings have been taken in. In the end, my mother borrowed tens of thousands. My mother knew that my dad would not want to go, so he went with his dad on his back. After all, the paper couldn't cover the fire. My dad knew that. I quarreled my mother first. After the quarrel, I went to work. I worked overtime every day and paid off the arrears in the coming year. In fact, when borrowing money, people who borrow money know that my parents are honest people, so they are happy to help us. Family education is really important. My dad's words and examples taught me to do things by myself now. So in the movie, Ali must have learned a lot of life knowledge from his father, and that can affect his whole life.<br/><br/>The second place is Ali's friendship with the rich brother. Only a few shots appeared in that segment, but it made me feel a lot. Let me talk a little bit off topic, I want to stand cp poor loyal dog attack & rich family vigorous. The child's mind is really simple, you play with me, you are a good friend, no matter how much. However, we have received more education and have grown more and more, but our friends have picked and picked, and finally complained that there are no real friends. Are we becoming more complicated, or is the world becoming more complicated?<br/><br/>In the end, I feel that the children inside are so beautiful and cute, the face value is very high, and the film is really warm, there is no bad person in it, all are ordinary people in our reality, precisely because of the existence of these kind of ordinary people, Still make me believe that the world is beautiful."

","The camera suddenly slows down, and ali's blue sweatshirt swings and swings in the wind. His face was distorted by the strain, his head was moving unconsciously from side to side as he followed his steps, and his sweat was slipping unconsciously down his temples. In the silence there was only the sound of pattering footsteps and their heavy, breathless breathing from lack of oxygen. Near the end of his strength, words began to reverberate in his mind: ""how can I go to school without shoes?"" 'come on, Sarah, come on.' ""I'll win third place for you, I will."" So I watched him take a very tense step, step by step ahead of the people. Step by step as if to fight, tears drop big drop down.<br/><br/>It was a knot in ali's heart that he owed his sister a pair of shoes he had thrown away. So he ran with all his strength, just to get the third prize, a pair of sneakers. The 5k is like a marathon for a 9-year-old, who won the race with no training or coaching. It was the daily hard and urgent state of life that made him, and the deep love and responsibility that gave him faith, which became the strength of his persistence in the most difficult times.<br/><br/>Run, in the name of love. Life, in the name of love.<br/><br/>9, childhood should be carefree life, just like ali in the rich area to see the child, with their own toy bear on cany chair swing swing looking at the blue sky, the poor family but ali prematurely to undertake the obligations of as a member of the family, but he also knows a family's most precious emotional connotation, is love and responsibility. He did not tell his parents that he had lost his sister's shoes, not because he was afraid of punishment, but because he knew that the family was in a bad situation and that his mother was seriously ill. He loves his parents and just wants them to worry less and worry less.<br/><br/>He had always felt guilty for his sister, Sarah ali, and he tried to make up for it. The excellent student got a golden automatic pencil, which he must have liked very much, as could be seen from the way he carefully took it out and held it in his hand. But he gave it to Sarah and smiled at his sister, and he smiled too. He has been poor at language expression will only silly smile, but the eyes are full of tenderness and love. This kind of tacit understanding and warm feelings between brother and sister, in the ordinary life is always ignored, in the difficult time is so let a person cherish. He loved his sister and just wanted her to be happier and happier.<br/><br/>Having only a pair of ali's sneakers, the two had to change for school. They exchanged them in a secluded corner, with Sarah running from school and ali changing shoes before running to school. Because of various delays during Sarah's journey, ali was late almost every time and was warned by his master. But he never said anything about Sarah. He loved his sister and would rather bear all the pressure and pain. When the director tried to throw him out of school for being too late, he could not explain himself but cried in silence. He suddenly did not know how to speak of the bitter twists and turns in it.<br/><br/>In the whole film, ali moved me the most, his carefulness and careful love for his sister, his understanding of his parents and his responsibility for his family, which is a feeling that has been lost in ordinary families. We see that the more difficult life is, the more sincere our love for each other is."

","Children of Heaven is a story about a family in Iran. The son of the family, Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian), manages to lose his sister's pink shoes due to an honest mistake. Unfortunately their family is very poor and their father cannot afford new shoes. Which is why the two kids go out of their way to hide the fact the shoes have been lost, while searching for ways to get them back or to purchase new ones.<br/><br/>It's a sweet story, no doubt about it. The two actors playing the children are very convincing and you definitely buy the sibling bond between them. I also like how humane they are. They act selfishly every now and then, but they also go to great lengths for their family in a way that feels real and believable.<br/><br/>The film is also a fascinating glimpse into a culture. The Iranian life is displayed fully in front of your eyes, with all its quirks and oddities. This film is a fine example of why you should watch movies that are not made in your country or even in your cultural stratosphere.<br/><br/>All that being said, the film is a bit of a slow burner. Especially the first act. Once you get into the groove of it and get used to how the story is told, it's fine, but the first half an hour or so feels like forever.<br/><br/>Still, very good film. Sweet, innocent, optimistic and thoughtful. Recommended."

","I have been on a ""family movie"" kick recently. An odd genre to delve into. And no, I am not a nostalgia addled twentysomething revisiting Disney. I'm talking anything that moves and talks and is inoffensive enough so that parents can let a screen babysit their munchkins for 2 hoursish. This genus of film shelters the lazy and has historically provided us with the most notorious specimens of hackery. Beyond the trash however, there exists children's movie that inspire wonder. It is these films, where creators did not compromise on their art, that feel as if they are abandoning me. I am inured, always on guard. Is simple innocuous sentimentality so unstomachable even when not squishy? I blame society. Children of Heaven is my only recent escape from this cultural conditioning.<br/><br/>Let's first address the most obvious possibility why Children of Heaven is an exception. Writer/Director Majid Majidi is from Iran and this is a Persian language film. Now any film veteran knows that flowery words can work beautifully as subtitles and be completely hollow when audible. This is a wrench in the works when reviewing foreign language films. So unless I learn Persian, I cannot say exactly how resilient I am to the syrup. I'll get right on that. So I am sure the unfamiliar tongue does lower my guard, but I am convinced that is not the deciding factor. The source of conflict is sublime. Children of Heaven is the story of how young boy Ali survives day to day life after misplacing his sister Zahra's shoes. There is a duality to this problem's scale. Even the smallest mishaps can be tragedies for children. Lost shoes seem like one such problem, yet Ali's family is poor. With the rent past due, Ali's father overworked, and his mother injured, even the smallest mishap can push a vulnerable family over the brink. With this and their father's potential ire in mind, the siblings choose to handle this problem on their own.<br/><br/>This seems a reasonable undertaking for a pair of elementary schoolers, but we forget how integral shoes are in everyday life. They are practical, but also convey style and status. So when Ali and Zahra share a pair of worn out tennies this arrangement colors their day to day life. Still, the loss is not a McGuffin driving a plot, but a perspective. Ali and Zahra live where school is run in shifts to maximize the use of the facilities. Zahra takes the shoes in the morning, dashes to a meeting place, Ali trades her sandals hopefully in time to get to school without being tardy. A reasonable arraignment, but imagine trying to get your sister to ware your beat up oversized shoes or wearing ugly ill-fitting boats to school. So no, plot lovers, this is not a story for you. Just life in the face of the tiny obstacles the size of the world. The dilemmas never seems forced our overly dramatized. The director knows the peril these narratives pose to our attention spans. The movie is not even 90 minutes long. Identical to the similar Bicycle Thieves. There is a climax to Children of Heaven, but it does not resolve the problem of the shoes. There are some hints, but Children does not have a slick Hollywood ending. This has and will continue to perturb some viewers, but I argue they missed the point. Majidi is a measured storyteller. Like the family, authenticity hangs on a delicate precipice. Heartwarming, but another dash of cuteness could send the film tumbling into an abyss that has claimed so many others. Children of Heaven finds the balance and a place in any beating heart."

","The film starts with Ali fetching his little sister Zahra's pink shoes after a cobbler has repaired them. He leaves them unattended to buy some potatoes. While he is pre-occupied, a homeless man picks up the shoes, hidden in a bag, thinking it was garbage and takes them away. Frantic to find them, the young boy thinking the shoes fell behind the crates knocks over plates of vegetables and is chased away by the grocer.<br/><br/>Ali's family lives in a poor South Tehran neighbourhood, and are having financial trouble, so he fears to tell his parents about the mishap. The landlord argues with Ali's mother because she is five months behind on the rent, and the grocer has not been paid in a while either. Ali tells Zahra about the shoes and begs her not to tell their mother; she agrees. That night, Ali's father scolds him for not helping his ill mother when she asked. While the siblings were doing their homework, they passed notes to each other discussing what to do. They devise a scheme to share Ali's Converse sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and return them to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. Ali does well on a test and his teacher awards him a gold-colored pen with the others in his class that got good grades; he gives it to Zahra to partially make up for losing her shoes. However, the uncomfortable arrangement between him and his sister leads to Ali being late three times in a row, no matter how hard he runs; the first time the principal ignores him, the second time he gives him a warning, the third time he tells Ali to leave and return with his father who is at work trying to make money. Ali's teacher noticing Ali's tears persuades the principal that Ali is at the top of his class and to give the boy one more chance and let him back into class."

","The film's poster has a bright, dream-like quality, as though it has been etched from a child's imagination itself. But the stories within are not daydreams, but real issues that a young brother and sister have to face at a much too early age. When Ali takes his sister's shoes to be mended, they are mistaken for trash (which tells you as much about their condition of living) and taken away. This would be a hard sell in a western setting; it seems inconceivable that such a mundane loss could propel a family into such desperation. We take the very material that protects our feet from the ground for granted. For Ali's family there is no such fortune. <br/><br/>When he returns home crestfallen, he can barely believe what he has allowed to happen and cannot face breaking the news to his sister. Zahra's anticipation is along the liens of the poster; her eyes are wide, bright, and innocent, and she has the type of face that is impossible to disappoint. He breaks it to her slowly, gently. They silently pass notes between each other because the father would beat them if he found out. But I think there is also another reason for this. We underestimate the feelings of children so often. They do so in secret because they have enough sensitivity and awareness that they do not want to heap yet another problem onto the pile for their parents. The film is full of moments which give them the opportunity to open up about their poverty and domestic issues. But they carry with them a fierce pride that prevents them from doing so. There is a very real and realised scene where their father explodes because of all their misfortune and the lack of control around it. Ali and Zahra see this and respond; they want to minimise, and they want to resolve this issue themselves. And later, there is the heartbreaking moment where they track down the user of Zahra's old shoes, but see the recipient's misfortune for themselves, and slowly shuffle away with this realisation. This is maturity beyond their years.<br/><br/>There are a few brief moments in which they are allowed the freedom to act their age. As the father toils hard in the garden, Ali is allowed to play with the similar aged son, and we are reminded of what a child should be doing. Their laughter is little more than gurgles, like a newborn baby. And when Zahra and he are afforded a moment to blow bubbles, the soundtrack, which has been strictly diegetic for almost the entirety of the film, chimes in with this soft, tinkling tune. It is an alien sequence, seemingly from another film with another subject matter. But it works because the audience and both Ali and Zahra are aware of the juxtaposition, and know how precious and fleeting the scene is. <br/><br/>Majidi crafts the film in the tradition of the great Italian neo-realist films, which prioritised authenticity and realism above all, and examined the plight of the working class. The camera observes like a fly on the wall, never quite staying still, with no audacious movements for aesthetics' sake. The soundtrack places us within the scene, and allows us to hear what the characters hear, the bustle of many families with their own struggles. Majidi makes what could be seen as contrived (bicycle brakes failing at a crucial moment) into something heart-stopping and fearful. We have invested so much into Ali's family that we understand that such a fall could ruin them beyond repair. <br/><br/>And yet Majidi does break this stylistic convention at the most pivotal of times. Besides neatly sidestepping the previous obstacle (the father is shown to be healthy and walking soon after), the narrative conveniently forgets about the substantial payment of the gardening job if only to heighten the tension of the cross country race. Majidi inserts garish and heavy-handed reminders of Ali's struggle as he huffs and puffs, as if he does not trust the audience enough to remember. The sound is muted and voice-over recalls what he is running for, and each step is magnified in the slow motion. These techniques belong in a lesser film. But there is a poetic sentiment about it; Ali wants to right his own wrongs, and Hashemian expresses every last spasm of regret in those eyes. The film gently assuages...that for today at least, he does not have to do it all himself."

A rare-made movie. I watch this movie with no volume at all because the TV position was too far from me. It's like i watch a silent movie but in color.

Not too much but not too small. Writing is the strong point of this movie beside the performances.<br/><br/>This is an underrated classic Iranian made by unknown director. In this movie, the director nearly pass the standard of Asghar Farhadi, the current Iranian famous director. I remember most people that sit near to me giving huge applause by the end of this movie.

","How far will you go to get something you badly want? What happens if there is only a pair of shoes between you and your sibling, and your family is not well-off at all? <br/><br/>It begins with Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) fetching his younger sister Zahra's (Bahare Seddiqi) pink shoes from a cobbler who had repaired them. While Ali gets some potatoes, a garbage man accidentally picked up the pair of shoes and took them away. Ali would knock over crates of vegetables while trying to get his younger sister's shoes and is chased away in the process.<br/><br/>With the financial situation of Ali's family, the landlord is arguing with Ali's mother (Fereshte Sarabandi) over being behind in paying the rent. As for the missing pair of shoes, the two began to devise a plan on what to do with it after Zahra had promised her brother not to tell their mother about it as they were doing their homework; while before that Ali's father (Reza Naji) had reprimanded Ali for not helping his ill mother when asked. The two siblings decided to share Ali's sneakers with Zahra wearing it in the morning to school before she returns it to her brother at midday so that he can wear it to class in the afternoon. This arrangement would see Ali being late for school three consecutive times with at the third time, the principal nearly wanted to send him away before Ali's teacher (Dariush Mokhtari) intervened.<br/><br/>Meanwhile once at the school's morning assembly, Zahra noticed her missing pair of pink shoes were on another student Roya's (Nafise Jafar-Mohammadi) feet. She would secretly follow Roya home and later brought her brother Ali along to try getting her shoes back, before both learned that Roya's father, who is actually the garbage man, is blind. Zahra would come to be very dismayed when her new friend Roya tell her that her father had threw away the pink shoes after Zahra noticed the new pair of purple shoes Roya was wearing as a result of doing well in her studies.<br/><br/>Ali and Zahra's father was anxious to earn extra money and decides to head for the rich suburbs of North Tehran to try his luck at being a gardener, with Ali accompanying his father. Not only that, Ali had learned in school of a long-distance footrace involving schools in the area and he noticed that the third prize is a one-week vacation camp and a pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is how the child actors played their parts, with their innocence shining through at various moments. The fear of simply not having a pair of shoe to wear, of Ali temporarily making up to his sister Zahra with the gold pen which he got after being in the top three in a class test, and especially personally for me, of where the siblings were blowing bubbles. Even despite the agony of losing a pair of shoes, such scenes still appear.<br/><br/>It may be something we take for granted in our daily lives, but Ali's determination of getting a pair of shoes for his sister after losing hers very early on is something to be admired, despite his age. It does remind us of what do we really treasure in our lives, and how despite the world we are living in, there are not many things in life which is as pure as childhood innocence as shown by the siblings in the film."

","Crafted with care and simplicity, Children of Heaven proves that less is more. Using children as its primary emotional reference point and motifs such as shoes and goldfish to convey deeper themes, this movie explores the range of human emotions as portrayed by one Iranian family struggling to economically and emotionally survive. While the need for shoes seems to drive the plot, this symbolizes the larger issue of poverty that the family faces and brilliantly allows the story to be told from the perspective of a child. The gravity of the themes discussed in this film are represented with style and simplicity--a girl envies another girl's shoes, a brother and sister use the same pair of shoes for school, a boy enters a race for which the second place prize is a pair of sneakers. The motive of basic necessities that drives the movie's plot evokes emotionally-charged performances from all of the actors, especially the children. Consequentially, Children of Heaven ranks among the most emotionally-moving films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>bitesizemoviereviews.blogspot.com"

","As the story opens, young Ali is picking up his sister's shoes from the repair shop. On the way home, the shoes are inadvertently lost and Ali must tell his little sister Zahra they are gone. The family has no money for new shoes and Ali fears they will both be beaten, so they don't tell their parents but come up with a plan: Zahra will wear Ali's shoes to school in the morning and he will wear them in the afternoon.<br/><br/>This Iranian film is absolutely charming. We see the world through the children's eyes...the harsh realities of their poverty and the contrasting luxury Ali sees when he helps his father as a gardener. Ali risks serious consequences by sticking with the plan and Zahra's heart longs for the beautiful shoes of her classmates. The children who play the leads are natural actors, completely believable and sympathetic; sadly, this was their only movie.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and the long-distance race at the end is really exciting. Highly recommended, but keep the tissues handy. (In Persian with English subtitles.)"

","Children of Heaven The main focus of this movie was on the children. The setting you see is what you would see as the child. (From a child's level) The adults are seen in the background, but have little to do with the action going on in the movie itself. Even when Ali is running through the alleys trying to hurry and get to school the camera is still at his level showing what he sees. The pace of the shots also depends completely on what the kids are doing. This movie does a great job of showing how a kid in this area lives.<br/><br/>I like how the film shows how close Ali and Zahra are. He feels terrible about losing her shoes and is determined to get her a new pair when he knows he'll never find her old ones. Zahra tries to threaten Ali by saying she is going to tell mom or dad, but he promises if she just gives him a little more time he will work it out. He allows her to borrow his shoes for school and meet him in the alley go exchange so he can make it to school. He is late multiple times because of the exchange, but still won't tell his parents he lost her shoes. He becomes determined to get into the race to win her a new pair of shoes that he cries and begs his teacher to let him try out even though it's past the try out date. He promises him he will win, but he doesn't mention he only wants to win third place. The whole movie revolves around the guilt Ali feels for losing the shoes and his determination to get her some new ones."

","Very few movies has the quality of tenderness without being sentimental. This one does. A very simple plot unfolds the entire story of present day life in Teheran. It is beautifully shot, very well acted and accomplishes with such simplicity what it intends. The sweetness with which the relationship between the two siblings is described is rare and their protection of their very poor parents is touching.<br/><br/>There is especially one scene that has stayed with me, where the brother secretly tries to explain that he has lost his sister's shoes on the way from the shoe maker. This takes place in the family's one-room home when the children are supposed to be doing their homework and they are writing notes back and forth. The girl's mounting frustration with her brother and his reluctance to take the entire blame is so right and so funny as they try to keep it a secret from their parents.<br/><br/>Every scene in the movie HAS to be there, nothing redundant, nothing superfluous. A pure delight. See it as soon as you get a chance."

","In a sea of beautiful masterpieces from Iran, somehow this piece of drek got snapped up for the kind of distribution and attention that dozens of other films deserved. It's the cliched story of a poor brother and sister who have to get by with one pair of beat-up old shoes between them. Direct references to Bicycle Thieves abound.<br/><br/>Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple, one of the greatest films of modern cinema, is still unavailable on video and has been seen by almost no one in the states. Until Kiarostami won the Palme D'Or for Taste of Cherry, his films were only seen by a handful of lucky individuals who made it to the right film festivals. Samira's father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose films make it to theaters but never with too much attention, and other great artists like Bahram Bayzai and Daryush Mehrju'i, are overshadowed in America, somehow, by Majidi. Despite having made what might be the most significant Iranian film in history, The Cow - shown at Venice in the early 70's and introducing the country's cinema to the world - Mehrju'i and Bayzai - considered to be their best by the Iranians themselves - collectively have fewer films available on video than does Majidi, in his relatively young career.<br/><br/>
Children of Heaven is the only Iranian film that I have seen which seems artificial. The performances are not good, the plot seems hackneyed and contrived, and it's sentimental - there's lot of crying and yelling. The children aren't real people, but little angels beset upon by this harsh life. The little boy hero is even the best student in his class AND a great athlete. <br/><br/>Jafar Panahi's The White Balloon and Abbas Kiarostami's Where Is The Friend's Home are both very similar storywise, but infinitely more touching, substantial and genuine."

","CHILDREN OF HEAVEN
Majid Majidi
 Iranian film marked with lot of classics from undisputable craft and theme which organized and conducted by some power packed legends including Abbas Kirostami, Majid Majidi, Asghar Farhadi, Jafer Panahi etc. These legends just show off something simple atmosphere and outlook that engaged with commons. There themes were so close with the ongoing simple aspects of human beings. Basically they are the subjects of things and beings. Their movies will also often open us to the marvelous world of unknown (but common) that we can read in daily press and in the streets. (So far from Bunuel's view about films).
 As far as, for me Majid Majidi looks astonishing about the depiction of downtrodden concepts and ideas. He just portrayed the basic plot of low class people around the Iranian outskirts. Children of Heaven mesmerized me because of the subtle representation of low class people. It is not about anything which marks calamities and atrocities mainly associate with common people, it's just a simple opening to the world of kids or children. This movie opens up to us two siblings of age around 11 or 12, a brother and a sister. We could understand their family appearance from the initial sequence of the movie when the title cards going on. A person repairs a shoe of a small girl. When we look close and analyze we can find out the shoe gets more damaged and there is no worth to repair it. Going back to home after it gets repaired Ali (the brother) lost the shoe and their turns up the beginning of the movie.
 Majidi's class can be seen at every course of the movie. He just put the camera to a brother and sister and captured their interactions in a candid way. In the initial part, because of the afraid of his father they both convey the absence of shoe and the consequences associate with them when they do not have a shoe and everything, they just scribbled through the notebook. They can't talk anything about the topic because their father will hear this. So while they are studying they just share their dialogues through writing which is so vast in its context. The audience gets to know more about their complex stage and the problem relate with them and everything through those writings."

","On the face of it, this is a gentle and warm hearted movie that so many reviewers have detailed already that I won't have to go into an explanation of what occurred. The young actor portraying Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) was quite incredible conveying the emotions involved with losing his sister's shoes, trying to explain the dilemma to her and dealing with the school principal who always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when Ali got to school late.<br/><br/>The sister (Bahare Seddiqui) was also quite good but not as accomplished as her sibling. I actually found the side story of Zahra dropping her pen and her new friend Roya returning it to be somewhat more compelling. The subject of the 'lost' shoes never came up between them, even though Zahra saw her wearing them, retrieved from the discarded material at the produce stand. One wonders why the subject never came up; one assumes Zahra was too shy or embarrassed to ask about them.<br/><br/>What I'm not understanding is why there wasn't more of a sense of closure for Ali and Zahra over the fate of the shoes. Granted, Ali went the extra mile by entering the race contest and winning, but in this case, it was the father who would inadvertently save the day with new shoes for both of them after earning a good day's pay. There is probably some meaning to be taken from the goldfish ending that eludes me, but it's something I won't dwell on. The film works as a feel good movie for the resolution of Ali and Zahra's plight, but I didn't get a sense of what was so extraordinary in the telling."

","Innocence and purity are the words that come to your mind after you have watched this movie. I got this movie from my local DVD library(God knows how they had such a masterpiece) and just to bide my time stared watching this movie. But what started as an innocuous plot finally turned out to be one of best movies I have ever watched. The story evolves around the brother and sister Ali and Zara.A bolt of bad luck causes Ali to loose Zaara's shoes, therefore the kids come up with a plan to share the only pair of sneakers that they have. What follows is then a heart warming tale of brother and sister trying there best to cope up with the situations that crop up and in the mean time keeping there secret. The plot of the movie is quite simple but is full of beautiful moments. These moments become more beautiful because of the great acting by the lead pair of brother and sister. Both the children have done extremely good acting and this itself is a tribute to the director of this movie. This movie is like a new born child, as you go along the movie you start sharing there emotions, feeling bad for there misfortune and hoping internally that everything turns out fine with them. The movie is full of positive energy and watching this movie leaves u with a hopeful and enthusiastic state of mind and heart. One other good aspect of this movie is the way in which it showcases Iran's culture. It shows quite boldly that Iran and other Arab countries are not just about Mullahs and hardliners and the people there are no different from the rest of the world. They also essentially share the same spirit of humanity. Overall a great movie and must watch for any avid cinema follower."
"korkmazhusem","9","1","2","2 April 2007"," innocence of childhood feelings...
","Children of Heaven is a 1997 made Iranian film that is directed by the famous director Majid Majidi. Later on, it was also nominated for academy awards. As most of the Iranian films, Children of Heaven mainly deals with the ordinary people's extraordinary feelings in a philosophical and psychological manner. The ""child"" figure is also an indispensible part of Iranian cinema and I think it is because of their innocence and purity of thoughts. <br/><br/>Children of Heaven seems to deal with a brother, a sister and their life in Iran but it has more in it. A number of political, ideological, psychological themes are dealt with in this film. Ethical values and their practical application are also referred in the film. <br/><br/>In the film, Ali takes Zahra's shoes to the shoemaker to get them repaired. But something unlucky happens and when he is on the way back home, he loses his sister's shoes. They decide to keep the event as a secret for some time as their father has no money to buy a new pair of shoes and as they know that they will be punished for this. They make a plan and they decide to share Ali's sneakers. Zahra wear them in the morning and they change the shoes for Ali's afternoon classes. This goes on for days with different adventures on the way home and on the way to school. One day, Ali hears about a running competition and decides to participate because, the third place award is a pair of shoes. However Ali comes the first in the race and wins the first place prize instead of a pair of new shoes. BEAUTY AND INNOCENCE When we carefully observe the characters in the film we can easily realize the purity of feelings in the film. Innocence and passion for life goes hand in hand during the whole film. When Ali loses his sister's shoes, he doesn't lose his hope and promises to find her the shoes. This is, in a way, a cultural reflection of Iran and Islam. Not to give up and not to lose your hope... Likewise, when Zahra learns that her only pair of shoes are lost, she gets very unhappy but she never betrays her brother. We can see the honesty, and loyalty in such behaviors as well. Obedience is another cultural theme in the film and it is frequently emphasized. For instance, when the mother asks Zahra to help with the housework we can see how obedient Zahra is. Moreover, when the students are in the morning ceremony, they say ""obedience to our leader"" all together and reflect the importance of obedience in this culture. Unlike most of the western countries, ""sharing"" is another important aspect of Iranian culture. The sibblings share their shoes while going to school, share their sadness while crying, share their father's poverty by not informing his about the lost shoes. In short, they share nearly every possible thing as if it is a must to be completed.<br/><br/>The role of woman in Iran is clearly illustrated in the Children of Heaven. She is always in a secondary position in the society and all her acts are dominated by man. Man is the chief in the family and in the society. Woman, on the other hand, has the right to obey... This causes her a hard challenge because of her gender and in such a culture she cannot even struggle against it. On the other hand, socio-economic class causes another big challenge for poor people. In the film, Ali and his father looks for work as gardeners and they go to the city together. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife. Such a huge difference also exist in the lives of people on different sides of the city. While Ali cries for a pair of old, lost shoes, the rich child in the city house owns everything a child should have. Another example to socio-economic classification is the attitude of the salesman in the bazaar. Ali wants to buy some potatoes but he only lets Ali to buy some from the small, half-rotten, old potatoes.<br/><br/>All those attitudes of people towards other people or culture towards people causes some psychological situations inevitably. The women in the society are ignored and suppressed. They most of the time, seem to be unhappy but have no chance apart from contenting themselves with what they have. They behave with fear and hesitation. The children, on the other hand, are also ignored because of the poverty and they also have to be content with what they have. When Ali wins the race, he is still not happy, because he doesn't have a new pair of shoes for her sister. This shows us that even the smiles of those innocent poor children are controlled by outside effects like poverty and culture. <br/><br/>To sum up, we can, at a glance, detect a variety of emotions and behaviors under the influence of the existing culture in this film. Children of Heaven is a successful mirror not only to the Iranian culture but also to the hearts of human beings..."
"mkaser21","7","1","2","12 February 2007"," Children of Heaven Film Review
","Ali and Zahra are two inspiring young actors in an Iranian film called Children of Heaven. Ali and Zahra are the two main characters in the movie. Furthermore, their father has a decent role and their mother is only seen in the house. The film takes place in an urban suburb of the city in Iran and is surrounded around the school and where they reside. Other scenes include a trip to the lavish and beautiful city to the rich neighborhoods. The pace of the movie is relatively slow, especially in the opening scene, but progresses at a decent and almost unnoticeable pace. The framework of the movie is taken straight from the streets of Iran, in an actual schoolyard, house, and city in Iran. In addition, there are no props used in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is surrounded by his sister's shoe that is lost. It doesn't seem like a great plot, but the true meaning of the shoe makes the movie relatively good. To Americans, it doesn't seem like a big deal about losing a shoe, but Ali's father cannot afford another shoe for his sister. The movies main conflict is Ali's struggle to make it to school because he cannot wear his slippers. In Iranian culture, the girls wear clothes that cover their bodies, or a hijab, and the only thing that differs between them is their shoes'. Ali's goal is to find his sisters shoes, but he must overcome obstacles to get them back. Much of the social commentary is between Ali and Zahra, with a short scene between Ali and his father. This movie can be heard in French or Persian, and can be read in subtitles.<br/><br/>This movie has a hidden image, and if you can determine it, it is a very good meaning. The water being the will of God is a theme in this movie that is shown quite nicely. The movie also displays themes of modernity versus tradition. As in most cases, the youth having the modernity and the elder's keeping their traditions. The movie does not display any religion or any views on government due to it being outlawed by the government. The scenery in the movie is excellent due to the fact it is taken straight from the streets of Iran and the plot, although different from a western film, is good and will keep the audience interested. Once you can get over the subtitles, unless you speak Persian or French, the movie is entertaining and fascinating."
"Shadow10262000","8","1","2","16 March 2006"," Children of Heaven Themes and Thoughts
","""There is beauty all around when there's love at home. There is joy in every sound when there's love at homeIn the cottage there is joy, hate and envy ne'er annoy Oh there's One who smiles on high, when there's love at home"" (LDS Hymn #294). When a brother and sister do not fight it brings joy to the parents. There is a sweet spirit that can be found with in the walls of that home when there is love. It does not matter if people are rich or poor, black or white, American or Iranian, what matters is the way people treat one another. Among children there is a certain loyalty to one another, especially when these children are siblings. There is nothing a brother wouldn't do to help his sister, keep her happy, and keep her safe. The portrayal of love, loyalty, and caring is wonderfully depicted in Children of Heaven. In a typical family you might expect to observe bickering, back biting, and children acting out against one another. At other times we see the total opposite of this example, a home filled with family members expressing compassion and sympathy in how they feel and act towards one another. In this fairly simple story Ali loses his sister's shoes, tries to find them and fails. He must then go home and tell his sister what has happened, and as children often do they try and hide from their parents the truth that they will be reprimanded for. After Ali tells his sister, Zahra, that he lost her shoes he pleads with her not to tell their father. There are two reasons I see for this fear, it could be because Ali fears he will be in trouble and will be punished for his carelessness, or it could be that he knows that the burden his parents have is already too great and that his family does not have the means to buy new shoes for Zahra. It is out of love rather than fear he does not tell his parents. The relationship that Ali has with his sister is more valuable than all the material things of this world. In effort to console or keep his sister quiet Ali gives her a new pencil and later a golden pen that he is awarded for doing well on a test. Ali shares his shoes with his sister until he can figure out how he will get her shoes back. This makes for some interesting action where they must quickly meet up to exchange shoes so Ali can try to make it to school on time, which he seems unable to do. He is caught a few times by a school administrator, yet even when Ali is in trouble, we see something that seems to be not so common in America anymore. A young child who is courteous and respectful to the elders he comes in contact with, always raising his hand to speak. In doing a little research on this foreign film the use of children actors in Iran is more than just showing innocence and child like love. In Iran there are rules in the film making about using adults. They cannot use a beautiful woman if she is over the age of nine she must cover her hair and womanly curves at all time and if there is a love scene with in the film they cannot touch or even kiss, unless in real life they are husband and wife. When using children they are able to still show these same ideas and are able to use the children in adult situations and give them the characteristics of adults. At the age of nine the father feels his son should be able to help support the family, and that he should be working as well, just like the father had done at his age. There is a tremendous pressure and responsibility put upon a young child, but it is only because of the love of the parents wanting to help prepare them for the rest of their life."

","At the Iranian film academy de Sica's ""Ladri di Biciclette"" as well as Ozu's early films like ""Tokyo no Yado"" have been studied closely. Not in all cases the results have been convincing.<br/><br/>In this film the allusions show the impact of the above-mentionned directors. But in this case the result has been excellent (though not superb). Unlike other Iranian films it is not depressing and sinister but tries to show the effects of poverty in a comical way without forgetting its disastrous effects on the human mind, thus reminding one of Chaplin's ""The Tramp"" (I think it is no accident that shoes plays such an important role).<br/><br/>The film does show the bitter reality of a large part of the Iranian population without compromise. Thus it unmasks the pretenses of the revolution which was fought in the name of the ""mostazafin"", the disinherited."

","The story is of a boy and girl, maybe 10 and 8, who cooperate not to disclose to their parents the loss of a pair of shoes. Supposedly this is to protect the ego of their father who will not have enough money to replace them until the end of the month -- rather than to avoid the beating they can BOTH expect if he finds out. Well, I guess my feelings about children being beaten, and about film-makers who present that atrocity without even a shred of condemnation, very much colored my response to this movie. I notice that IMDb has this listed as ""Comedy/Drama,"" but frankly I didn't find anything funny about it . The protagonists' family is poor in an affluent city, the father works constantly in a futile effort to make ends meet, and the mother shows no discontent at her utter subservience. These lovely bright children attend schools where conformity and obedience are the only traits rewarded, and have only each other to turn to for support and comfort. During the course of the film, every time an opportunity for progress arises, it is soon dashed, and even the State religion is not shown as offering any consolation. Look, I've probably known more than my share of good-hearted children, optimistic in the face of adversity, but even I found this pair hard to believe. Sorry."

","As much as I wanted to like Children of Heaven, it just didn't do it for me. I commend the child actors, as I can't blame them for a script that I felt lacked the urgency and grittiness of the living situation in which they found themselves.<br/><br/>Some parts were unnecessary or just outright silly. Some of the relationship between Ali and his father working seemed unconvincing and underdeveloped, and therefore expendable. Also, I was slightly offended at a scene where Ali, at a critical point in the film, cries in order to get his way. At best, I was left scratching my head confused and unconvinced. At worst, I got the message that whining is an OK way to get things done. I know the main character is a kid, and maybe it's too much to ask for someone that age to have a coherent conversation explaining the situation and asking for help in a mature manner. However, Ali does act fairly mature around his sister, so I guess I expected more out of a likable character.<br/><br/>Finally, the goldfish thing was a bit lost on me, but that might just be me and I'd appreciate any clarification. I would suggest A Separation instead for anyone wanting an introduction to Iranian cinema.<br/><br/>2 out 4 stars."
"gentendo","7","1","3","15 October 2007"," Theme: How is success defined?
","Examining the main theme of this film through the window of another culture showed me that the Iranian ideology is not fundamentally different from our own. In fact, the theme I extracted demonstrated that we share more in common with each other (in terms of the goals we are attempting to achieve as human participants of life) then not: Although adversity and other desperate circumstances seek to thwart man's journey to succeed, man is not only endowed with specific problem-solving capabilities but also the potential to triumph over any obstacle thrown his way.<br/><br/>Using the contextual tools in connection with this theme, I seek to examine the following question: How does the hero act in this story? The main character, Ali, is faced with many difficult situations which strongly motivate him to act and provide solutions for. After accidentally losing the shoes of his sister Zahra and realizing the poverty conditions of his family, Ali is challenged with solving how he and his sister are going to get to school with only one pair of shoes. His solution: They can both share a pair of sneakers. Once her day is done, she can rush home and give the sneakers to him. Unfortunately, she arrives too late and causes Ali to be late for his schoolthus creating another problem. Ali develops another solution: His love and care for his sister's welfare causes him to enter a foot race where the runner in third place receives a new pair of sneakers. Although both second and first place prizes are more lucrative, Ali only cares about the happiness of his sister. This was an interesting characteristic of the hero of this culture as contrasted to the hero of an American culture. American heroes are usually determined by how prestigious/strong their image iseven if it be at the expense of another. This particular culture depicted its hero as a weak (small and simple) boy whose primary concern was family. Traditionally speaking from an American perspective, the main character of this film, Ali, would not be considered necessarily a hero. Why? Because he doesn't win what he intended to win in the race. This led me to ask the next question: How is success or failure defined in the story? Success, as defined in the eyes of this culture's hero, is not success unless it benefits the whole rather than the individual. In other words, success is not something to be hoarded to oneself but rather shared equally with others. Ali wants to share his success with his sister by finishing in third place, thereby winning his sister's joy, but instead wins first place. The result of him not enjoying his ranking is terribly ironic when compared to how success is defined in an American cultureif you're not first you're nothing. Rather than benefiting the whole (Ali, his sister and family), Ali reluctantly benefits only himself. As stated in my theme, Ali had the potential to triumph over this particular obstacle but instead received an outcome that ran contrary to what he had desired/intended.<br/><br/>Overall, Ali is a unique and culturally diverse hero that demonstrates the tool of activism to help support the lives of his family members. Although he is young and helpless, this does not thwart him from helping and providing solutions to those around him who are also helpless. This idea is demonstrated in two specific scenes: when he helps his helpless father in promoting gardening services in the city, and, when he retrieves the sneakers from a rainstorm outside for his helpless sister who is frightened to retrieve them herself."

","Children of Heaven is an extremely symbolic movie. The exact purpose of the movie is not exactly clear until the final shot of Ali's battered feet in a sweet pond of innocent fish. It is not until then that the tenderness and irony in the movie regarding God come clear.<br/><br/>During the entire movie, the parents come off as having the typical ""if God wills it, it will happen"" attitude that really means ""I'm too lazy to do anything about my pathetic life"", at least in this case. Ali and Zahra are two young kids who physically and mentally drain themselves over a pair of shoes they've lost, and it's ridiculous they even have to worry about that. It's not ridiculous because I'm just a spoiled American lucky enough to never have worried about it, it's ridiculous because their parents wait until the rent is far past overdue to try to do anything about it. It isn't until then that the father finally goes into town to make ends meet. However this amazing father is sure not to do it alone, he has to bring is child along too.<br/><br/>The parents, or at least the father, is no doubt a loser, but the children are quite the opposite. There's something wrong if your 9-year-old son is better with talking to a person than you are, and in the case of going into town to get money, this is how it is. Ali certainly wins your heart over every time you see his little face getting teary-eyed because all he wants to do is win his sisters shoes back. You can clearly see that although he believes in God, he pours his heart out into that final race just to right his wrong. However, because if God wants it to happen a certain way, it will happen that way, he didn't get those shoes in that race that second, but he did get them.<br/><br/>Some may view the Dad getting shoes for the little girl in the final scene as a sign that it really is in God's control. However, I believe that it is indeed in God's control; however the extent of how fast the needy are willing to try is the key. God helps those who help themselves. Although it seemed like a long time, Ali's wish got answered fast in comparison to Ali's father's wish of God helping them out of their rough time. It should also be noted that it wasn't until after Ali's father went into town to really help his family out that God helped the man. It is indeed in God's hands, however that is no excuse to sit back and do nothing when things aren't going the way you want. The display of this belief makes the movie truly respectable."

","`Children of Heaven,' (1997) Directed by Majid Majidi, is the story of a young boy who accidentally loses his sister's newly repaired shoes.  They are a poor family and the lost pair happens to be her only pair.  The remainder of the film is spent with the two children trying to figure out how to replace them without their father (who job is serving tea) and mother (who is seriously ill) finding out.<br/><br/>The film is special in that every moment seems to add to a deeper understanding of the compassion and humanity of each character. Furthermore, it is impossible for me to imagine a Hollywood film coaxing performances out of its stable of actors in the way this director achieves with these amateur actors.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the family is dirt poor.  The father is of Turkish decent and works a menial job serving tea.  When he returns home from work, he shows the duplicity that makes us all human.  On the one hand he yells at his son, Ali, for not accomplishing his chores.  Ali offers no rebuttal, because to admit where he was would be to admit he has lost his sister's only shoes. He scolds Ali, `What are your duties in this house?! To eat, sleep and play?! You're not a kid anymore! You're nine years old!' he goes on to say that by Ali's age he was already working to support the family.  Then, within moments his softer side comes out.  `I serve tea all day at the company but Zahra's has a special taste.'  This makes his daughter beam with pride. <br/><br/>
The mom has a need for a surgery that they can't afford.  The dad knows he can't afford it so instead, he uses scare tactics to discourage her from hoping for the surgery.  He tells her he knows of other women who have been crippled by the surgery.  <br/><br/>The story later focuses on Ali's running ability.  There is going to be a race for children.  The third place prize is a new pair of sneakers.  Ali promises Zahra he will come in third and win her the shoes.<br/><br/>The suspense builds as he runs the race.  Just at the end, as he is jockeying for third position, another boy intentionally knocks him down. With Herculean effort and determination Ali gets up and bolts for the finish line.  He accidentally comes in first.  His coach and classmates cheer, but he cries (partly because his shabby shoes have caused numerous blisters and lesions on his feet, but mostly because he has won the wrong prize.<br/><br/>The father on the other hand, has been window shopping for shoes, and finally has the money to buy some for his children.  The film ends with Ali staggering into the shared courtyard where he lives.  He sticks his blistered feet in the central fountain with his head hung low, not knowing the father will be returning home with shoes for them. <br/><br/>
`The Color of Paradise' (1999) also directed by Majid Majidi, is a gorgeous film, both for the film's story and characters, as well as for the beautiful mountain scenery as a setting.  The story depicts the life of a blind 8-year-old boy.  His widowed father wants to get rid of him (because he doesn't fit into the father's plans for a new marriage.) Mohammad is brilliant boy; we figure this out just in the opening scenes. Just as in `Children of Heaven,' the director richly develops the characters.  Mohammad is loved by just about everyone, except for his father. The father sees the blind boy as a burdensome. But to everyone else, he is a gift, and provides insights hitherto unseen (as depicted in several scenes both to the sighted  as with his sister's classmates & teacher -- and to the unsighted, as with the blind carpenter with whom he is sent to apprentice.)   The film is a great tragedy though moments of the joys of life are well depicted.<br/><br/>Bear with me now.  Just as George C. Scott's character, Justin Playfair, in `They might be Giants' pulled clues out of thin air that may not have been actual, he nevertheless came to a conclusion.  So play Joanne Woodward's role and be Dr. Watson to my delusional fantasy for a moment.<br/><br/>In the films I have seen from Iran, I ask, `Why children as the actors?'  My instinct is that telling subtle stories through children means one is less likely to offend Government censors.  But if the story is about more than the beautiful drama and story on the surface, (which are worthy in their own right) then what are they about? <br/><br/>A little history and a few facts.  (Stop rolling your eyes.)  90% of all Muslims today are Sunni.  In Iran, the population is largely Shiite.  The majority of Iranians are Persians, not Arabs (this is part of the reasons behind the tension between Iran and Iraq.)  The Iranians speak Farsi and not Arabic.  Once upon a time, the Shiites were persecuted (they still are in Iraq and in some other Arab nations.)  To escape persecution the Shiite's adopted a practice called `tagiya' (concealment), hiding their beliefs. All this concealment changed in Persia in 1502 when the Safavids won control of Persia, and proclaimed Shiism as the state religion.  They invited all Shiites to move to Persia.  (Just for the record, what was left of the adherents of Zoroastrianism of Persia had already moved to India to avoid having to convert to Islam.)<br/><br/>The divisions between Sunni and Shiism immerged almost immediately following the Prophet Mohammed's death. Since Mohammed had no heir apparent, most of his followers sought to have an elective Caliph (successor).  Others (who became the Shiite sect) believed that his successor should be someone from Mohammed's bloodlines, and favored Mohammed's cousin Ali.  (I find this aspect of Islam fascinating considering Mohammed gave such specific instruction on wills, divorce and other aspects of life.  It seems strange that he left out instructions on succession.)<br/><br/>This 7th century question resulted in a bloody schism.  Ali was eventually elected Caliph, only to be murdered.  One of Ali's sons was ambushed an another poisoned.  This points to why martyrdom is admired in the Shiite tradition, being traceable back to the murders of the innocent son's of Ali.<br/><br/>In reference to this admiration of martyrdom, professor Thomas Magstadt states, `Similar motives led Iranian children to walk through the minefields ahead of soldiers during the war against Iraq: the Ayatollah Khomeini assured them that martyrdom in the jihad against Iraq would give them immediate entry into heaven.  (in his book ""Nations and Governments,"" italics added.)  I believe this is the key if there is a story hidden in the story.  Perhaps the children in Majid Majidi's movies are allegories for the children mentioned by Dr. Magstadt.<br/><br/>Consider the titles  Paradise & Heaven... the place where martyrs go.  Ali is fearful of his father's wrath.  Though fearful, he is willing to help his sister by using his feet in the foot race to help his sister get some shoes. The children who walked ahead of the soldiers must have been terrified. Perhaps not at first, but certainly after the first explosion from a mine perhaps tripped by a friend.  In the case of the Color of Paradise, it is a blind boy.  Perhaps his blindness signifies the fact that the children who walked these minefields were blind (innocent) to what their role was in the eight year long war between Iran and Iraq.<br/><br/>If this is so, do the father characters represent Khomeini?  He is a harsh man, but also (more in the Children of Heaven, than in Color of Paradise) is shown as a man who loves his children (this is not until the end in Color of Paradise when he is full of remorsful love.)   It's just my rank speculation but that passage from Magstadt will leave me a believer in the possibility of deeeper meaning in the films on Iranian Children."
"pricerw-1","7","1","6","21 February 2007"," Children of Heaven was good but nothing to rave about
","I'm not a huge fan of foreign films with subtitles. And I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but I didn't hate it either. The director had a commending approach while the story and setting was enchanting.<br/><br/>Children of Heaven follows Ali and Zahra, brother and sister in a poor Iranian family. When Ali loses his sisters only pair of shoes they must share his while keeping it a secret from their parents. This movie follows their adventurous dilemma and amazing relationship.<br/><br/>I don't believe that this is a movie for everybody. Personally, I didn't hate it, although I wouldn't put it in my top ten either. But it is a movie worth checking out. What I found most fascinating was the imagery. Since this movie was actually filmed in ""everyday"" Iran I was intrigued to see how the city actually looked and how people lived. There was such a contrast between the way poor families, such as Ali's lived, and the better off families near the city. And even though this isn't really my type of movie it was interesting and kept my attention, most of the time. The lack of music was well done, but something I'm not very use to and I caught myself dazing off a couple of times. When Ali joins the race the movie really picks up. The scene when Ali is running the race is my favorite, hands down. It didn't only have me on the edge of my seat but the way it was filmed was exceptionally done also. I really liked the way that the director chose to not put any music along with it but instead all that was heard was the boys gasping for air and the sound of their shoes pounding the pavement. I couldn't wait to see the result.<br/><br/>Overall, I would tell people to check it out. It's not a film that I would ever sit down and watch again or try to buy but it would definitely be worth someone's time to watch. It is interesting to see how people live and how films are told half-way around the world. Until watching this movie the only things I saw of Iran on TV was the cultures reactions to war and America. This will definitely broaden your view on the people and the country."
"jcookman","7","1","6","14 February 2007"," Movie about sneakers
","Children of Heaven (1997) is a great movie with an overarching theme about the will of God. The main character, Ali, attempts to challenge the will of God throughout the movie, and the will of God continues to prevail. The will of god dictates many of the events in the movie; the most important events being when Zahra's (Ali's sister) shoes are lost and the climatic race that Ali participates in. The general message in the movie, as depicted by these scenes, is that everyone is subject to god's will, and that if one has faith in God, he or she will have all their needs met.<br/><br/>The first example of God's will in the movie is when Ali loses Zahra's shoes. The shoes were accidentally taken by a trash collector, and this event is the launching point the movie's plot line. Ali blames himself for the loss of the shoes, and he spends the entire movie challenging God's will in an attempt to get the shoes back, or get new shoes. However, from the Muslim perspective, the loss of the shoes is God's will, and if Ali would just accept this and submit to God's will, his life would be better.<br/><br/>Water represents God's will, and the movie makes good use of this representation. Everyone should submit to God's will, and when Ali and Zahra do not by sharing shoes and not accepting that Zahra's shoes are gone forever, God's will interferes with the plan. Zahra drops a shoe in the water drain on the way home one day. Since the water is God's will, it could be assumed that God is making their lives difficult, so that they will give up and submit to the will of God like they should. However, Ali refuses to give up, and he decides to enter a race in order to win a new pair of shoes for Zahra.<br/><br/>The new pair of sneakers is the third place prize for the race that Ali enters. Ali promises Zahra that he will come in third in order to win the sneakers, and then he would trade them in for girl's shoes. The problem is that by doing this, Ali is continuing to challenge God's will. Nevertheless, Ali participates in the race and he wins first place, but in his mind, he did not win because he wanted third place for the shoes. When he goes home he does not even have to tell Zahra the he failed for her to know. The last scene is Ali soaking his feet in water, which is the will of God, and having his feet cleaned by goldfish. The goldfish could be seen as manifestation of God's will because they are part of the water. With this assumption, Ali's feet being cleaned by the goldfish could represent how God's will is going to take care of Ali now that he has submitted to it. It is also interesting how the scene prior to the last shows Ali's father buying new shoes for Ali and Zahra, but the last scene does not show Ali and Zahra getting the shoes. This shows that the most important part of life is trying ones hardest. It does not matter Ali failed in the quest to get his sister new shoes. What matters is that Ali tried his hardest, and that he finally accepts the fact that he cannot get Zahra some shoes. This unfulfilling final scene also shows that if one submits to will of god, his or her life will be better. This is scene by how everyone knows that Ali and Zahra will get those shoes their father bought now that they have submitted to the will of God. Overall, one message in this movie is that to have a good life, one must submit to the will of God."
"trochesset","5","1","15","2 November 2006"," Very good and sometimes moving
","I've just finished watching ""Children of Heaven"" for the first time, and in fact I think I can say that this is the first Iranian film that I have ever seen. Coming into the film I had not clue of what it was about other than the fact that it had something to do with shoes.<br/><br/>All around this was a good film, although there are things that keep it from greatness. Every aspect of the film was adequate, but I think that every aspect was missing something. The actors were good but at times, Ali revealed that he was acting to a camera and not living through the character, though I thought that the actress who played Zahra did very good. I felt that the camera work in the film was simply adequate, it didn't move enough and the compositions were not exceptional enough to make me forget about the camera's lack of movement. Of course there were exceptions in the film, moments of magic, but most of the time it lacked that certain spark. Also the plotting of the film, and some of the montage sequences don't work very well. The sequence where Ali goes with his father on a side job is one. I don't mind that this entire sequence, including the bad-luck ending, really had nothing to do with anything else that would seem to happen in the story; but the way it was put together just made it seem uninteresting most of the time, especially when Ali and the other boy are supposed to be 'playing' and having fun with each other, it just seemed so stale. I require more from my films. <br/><br/>A good film with good moments, but not great.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>Also, I'm not really sure what this film says to me. Ali, the main character lies throughout the film, and he never really suffers because of it-even when he was sent home he never gets in trouble and we never see if he has to bring his father to school with him, so he is never really confronted with having to tell the truth or accept a real punishment or beating for being late all of the time and being sent home. He is afraid to tell the truth for fear of punishment, and or hurting his own pride. Instead he cries and gets off easy. <br/><br/>Another thing, I know that this film was not made for a western audience, but some things are hard to understand fully. I wish I could have at least had a subtitle for the song being sung in the mosque while the father was making tea and began to weep. I want to better understand why he is weeping, is he full of joy in the power of God, or is he thinking about how bad his life is and is sad? I know that Iran is a very religious country, so I guess it is just understood that he would be very religious, but I wish that I could have seen more of that aspect of their lives.<br/><br/>Also, one last complaint/question. I have no clue how the school systems work in Iran, but I did not understand how Zahra could go to school for a while, and then come home and trade off shoes with Ali, and then when he came home it still seemed like it was the middle of the day. How long/short is a school day in Iran? Do different grades go in the morning while other grades go i the afternoon(even though he was in third grade, and she was in 4th or 5th-pretty close grades to be splitting like that). That part didn't make sense to me, and it was an integral part of the story, and it just confuses me to how this would work."

At first I thought ""Boy is this movie slow."" For the short time the movie is on, it is insanely slow. At first the conflict is apparent, there is a conflict there, but it is...not even a conflict. The resolution is so close, it doesn't even feel like there is something happening in the movie. There is no antagonist which makes me question my earlier statement about the conflict. If there is no protagonist nor antagonist then is there any conflict? not even in this story, but any story. Woah, this movie just raised a life-changing question to my mind.<br/><br/>The two young actors are fantastic. Kinda, from a guy looking at a child actor they were good. <br/><br/>The story isn't sad but the ending is so happy. I am giving this film a 7, slightly reluctantly.

","Children of Heaven (or Bacheha-ye Aseman) is a poignant human drama by the acclaimed Iranian director Majid Majidi. Majid Majidi's films are defined by their quiet flow, in the course of which tender human feelings, emotions and relationships are explored in an equally tender manner which rarely fail to touch the heart in a calm and soothing fashion. Children of Heaven is no exception to that.<br/><br/>The primary characters of this story are two young children – a young boy and his younger sister. The story is told mostly from their perspective – and those of who are past our childhoods are allowed a trip back into the world of children. A world in which a tiny problem can cast a much larger shadow and another bigger issue is unable to cast any shadow at all. Children live in their own world, with their own hopes and fears and Majidi lets us peek into the world of these two children for some time and perhaps, through them, into a world that was once our own as well. The protagonists are disarmingly innocent and captivate the viewer who watch their life unfold while in their shoes. Shoes, of course, are an integral part of the plot. To elaborate more would be meaningless, as, in the end, Children of Heaven is as much about shoes as Through the Looking Glass is about mirrors.<br/><br/>Majidi is dexterous at weaving stories around the small matters and joys in life. Children of Heaven is a classic example of how soft-spoken movies can move the heart, how a tiny drama can be more expressive than the grandest of magnum opuses and how simple joys are enough to fill a life and render it the deepest meaning and the most beautiful colors."

The film follows their adventures to hide the plan from their parents and teachers, keep up with school and errands and manage a way to gain a new pair of shoes for Zahra.

The rest of film follows Ali and Zahra on their adventures to find the shoes and living with only one pair shoes.<br/><br/>The things that Ali sacrifices and does in his relentless search for the shoes are very touching. His continued lateness to school, wearing wet shoes, and entering a 5KM run just to win a pair of shoes is amazing. Even with the lack of support from Zahra, Ali still trudges along to find those shoes. Since his family cannot afford another pair of shoes, Ali and Zahra must share Ali's shoes. Zahra must run from school to meet Ali to exchange the shoes and Ali must from there run across town to get to school. Ali even had to run in wet shoes after Zahra loses the shoe in a gutter. No matter how frustrated Zahra got or how tired he got, Ali did not waiver in this promise to find the shoes. The most heartwarming scene was during the race were Ali was beginning to fall behind and all he was thinking about was his continuing promise to find Zahra's shoes.<br/><br/>Outside of the overall themes, this film portrays a great brother-sister relationship between Ali and Zahra.

"strong_h","7","0","3","9 February 2007"," Ali and Zahra over coming obstacles and what the director did well and what didn't work
","""Children of Heaven"" is a movie that communicates many different ideas. It shows that even though you are small and don't think you have much you can make a difference. Because Ali's sister had no shoes, Ali and Zahra had to come up with a plan so that they both could go to school with one pair of shoes between them. The whole movie is built around the struggle of these children and the need for Zahra to have shoes but they make it work without the help of an adult. It's also a movie of hope, no matter what your situation looks like there will still come a light at the end of the tunnel. Ali and his family are very poor and Ali's father cannot catch a break. Ali and father go to the city and are able to make a significant amount of money. If it were not for Ali, Ali's father would have turned away and given up. This goes back to the idea of young Ali making a difference when an adult could not. Because Ali and his father made that money His father was able to but food, pay the rent and buy both Ali and Zahra shoes. Ali didn't expect to get shoes he was more concerned with his sister getting shoes but he was also rewarded. I believe there were many messages in the movie and symbolism with Muslim undertones that would not be clear if you are not familiar with that religion. Think the idea of faith in Allah to help you when you need it is one of the main ideas. Also, he may not help you when you would like him to but he will not leave you hung out to dry. I think it was good that the director used a Middle Eastern setting and cast. The movie was in the native Middle-eastern language and I think the culture was portrayed accurately. This movie was not an American film in the Middle East. This movie is an authentic Middle-Eastern movie that we Americans have the privilege off viewing. I think the director's decision to use a natural setting and culture for this movie mad it more real to the viewer.<br/><br/>There were some points in this movie I thought didn't work. There were some scenes that were too long, like the opening scene of the cobbler and the shoes or the children running back and forth to school or even Ali's race at the end. I kept expected something surprising to happen during these long scenes but it never came. It seemed like there was something the author wanted you to focus on but I never really figured out what that was. However, my views may be a product of the western cinema I am accustomed to.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie, I thought it was entertaining and had a simple plot. It reminded me of a children's cartoon, where one unexpected event snowballs into a series of unfortunate event and everything works out in the end. It is not an action packed movie, a thriller or a perplexing logical movie but it is insight into another culture that is commonly misunderstood by Americans."
