","People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. <br/><br/>The story can be clichéd, a big city race car driver goes to a small town, caused a ruck, hates the small town, get to know them and realises he was a jerk and so on and so forth. To me I like this movie. It has some nice atmosphere with the small town and the American dessert of the well- known route 66 with the animation and I do like the world of cars. The story is good too and even though its not in the bar of such great films like the Toy Story series and Monsters Inc. from Pixar, it's good recommendable movie for your kids."
"TheMovieMark","8","211","244","9 June 2006"," ""It's kind of nice to slow down every once in a while.""
","""Cars didn't ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time."" <br/><br/>It's not hard to make a successful movie. It's simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichéd message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.<br/><br/>Pretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.<br/><br/>I'll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation? <br/><br/>Yes, they could, and they did.<br/><br/>Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed.<br/><br/>Don't worry if you're not a racing fan; I assure you it's not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my '69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn't do it for me. That's another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.<br/><br/>Animation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can't be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it's getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.<br/><br/>But impressive visuals are little comfort if I'm not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you're the kind of person who loves to go ""awwwww"" at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn't greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.<br/><br/>It proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen's journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the ""slow down and enjoy the scenery"" message may seem a little routine, but it's a message I took to heart.<br/><br/>Immediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I'm now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That's all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.<br/><br/>See? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way."
"thejoshualee","10","297","347","10 June 2006"," This movie is great
","But WHY is it great?<br/><br/>1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America's Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn't realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn't made up of old car parts.<br/><br/>2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it's still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John's babies, I can't wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.<br/><br/>3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America's heartland with dolts, ""we don't like outsiders"" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It's funny how the gravel in Newman's voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson's distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.<br/><br/>4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race.<br/><br/>I give it a score of 10 out of 10. I can't wait to see it again."
"theblabbershow","10","318","385","24 May 2006"," Pixar has done it again.
","I had my doubts. I knew that Pixar would fail this time around. No way were they going to pull this off for a seventh time.<br/><br/>I was very, very wrong.<br/><br/>I went to see a special screening of ""Cars"" a few weeks ago, and this movie blew me away. The animation is gorgeous, the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. It definitely has that genuine Pixar ""heart"" that you rarely see in any other CGI film. At first I thought the movie would be centered around a lot of NASCAR-like racing, but it really wasn't, much to my surprise (and pleasure). This movie is definite Pixar gold. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>Although I don't want to give any spoilers away, I will say that my favorite scene would have to be when Mater drags McQueen out to do a bit of ""Tractor Tipping"". The whole theater was filled with laughter. Heck, it even got some laughs out of me, which is rare when it comes to a kid's movie.<br/><br/>Be there on opening night. This is movie is worth all of your time and money."
"tollini","10","211","274","31 May 2006"," Truly Moving Picture
","I saw this film on May 31st, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>The most famous streak in sports is probably Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak. The most famous hit streak in film entertainment is probably Pixar's feature film animation streak. With ""Cars"", it's seven in row for outstanding storytelling that is well executed and is (or will be) rewarded with blockbuster box office grosses. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""A Bug's Life"" are the other six gems.<br/><br/>The story is about Lightning McQueen a rookie NASCAR-type racer. Of course, he is a car and not a human; or, he is a human in the form of the car. Take your pick. Either way, he is not an attractive persona. He is selfish, unappreciative, greedy, two-faced and has no real friends. But, he is a great driver and is tied for The Piston (read Winston) Cup annual championship with two other drivers. On the way to the runoff race in California, he accidentally gets off in a sleepy and forgotten town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>In this hillbilly hell of a town, he is punished for speeding and tearing up the road by the sheriff. As he serves his sentence with community work, he discovers the town is inhabited by rejects and misfits, who all have hearts of gold. Can they change Lightning and make him over to have positive traits like honesty, integrity, respect, honor, sacrifice, humility, and compassion? That's the drama that unfolds. Lightning is a hard case, and the outcome is always in doubt.<br/><br/>The cars/people are incredible. Shortly into the movie you forget that the people are cars or the cars are people, you suspend disbelief, and you just begin to watch an engaging story about real people. The windshields are their eyes, and the grilles are their mouths, and they display emotions as well as any human actor. The story is serious and light-hearted at the same time. The puns are too numerous to catch. And this is a must-see-twice-to-get-it-all movie.<br/><br/>FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
"solsetimo","9","159","212","28 May 2006"," awesome movie
","I thought the story looked very lame from previews, and the concept didn't appeal to me. But when I saw an early screening I was surprised, it was well written and well executed. They didn't overload the movie with automotive jokes, which I think would have hurt the story and character development. Owen Wilson's voice is great for his role. Overall, it's on par with other Pixar films, even if it may not be their best so far. The animation is superb, definitely the best they've done. Giving something like cars distinct personality and characterization seems like it would be pretty tough, and they do a great job with it. See this movie the day it opens."
"Jay_Exiomo","8","96","125","8 June 2006"," Nice ride
","As usual, you've gotta hand it to Pixar.<br/><br/>In ""Cars,"" their latest film, they show why they are still the cream of the crop when it comes to the field they revolutionized more than a decade ago. Well, yeah, it doesn't have the sophistication and cleverness of ""The Incredibles,"" nor the universal appeal of both ""Toy Stories"" and ""Finding Nemo."" And I have to admit that the idea of animated cars was the least riveting as far as Pixar film premises are concerned. But as with its predecessors, beneath those excellently rendered 3D images is the soul that sets Pixar apart from what has become of most animated films nowadays.<br/><br/>Up-and-coming rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is about to win the prestigious Piston Cup. The championship ends with Lightning finishing in a tie with legendary ""The King"" (Richard Petty), who is in his final race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton); thus, a tie-breaking race is set in California.<br/><br/>But a road mishap leads Lightning to the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, a part of what was once Route 66, a place that once basked in glory, but has since been thrust into oblivion. There he meets an array of other cars - including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman!), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) - who teach him that ""life isn't about the destination but about the journey."" <br/><br/>First of all, Pixar's animation is first-rate. It's that sort of greatness among their artists I can only geek about and dream of grasping while in my 3D animation classes. The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering (man, the reflections!). The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Even the old, vintage car models have that chic look that brings some of the essential charm of this film. There are lots to be admired on this film just for the brilliance in animation. But among those that stand out are the race itself, and when Doc Hudson gets to bring back his good old days. Somehow, it's like watching NASCAR on IMAX again, albeit minus the über-big screen and the 3-D effect.<br/><br/>But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions. It still all boils down to the story and how it is told - the very essence of cinema. Granted, when it comes to the standards set by previous Pixar films, it isn't quite up there with it's predecessors; but considering how lofty the bar has reached and the mediocrity that has become of the genre in general, ""Cars"" more than gets the job done.<br/><br/>As for the voice cast, Wilson brings that sort of cockiness to the protagonist of the story and it fits with his smug humor. Larry the Cable Guy gives Mater an amusingly disoriented state without being irritatingly so. You can't help but care about him and arguably, he's the nicest member of the cast. Newman lends an authoritative quality to Doc Hudson. (During the end credits, there's an in-joke about John Ratzenberger, who has his voice featured in all Pixar films thus far.) However, ultimately, the cast is somewhat unmemorable and lacking in diversity. The rest of the voice talents are also underused. Keaton's Chick Hicks is a formulaic one-dimensional villain, which could have utilized his voice more with a little more motivation for the car's part. But then again, that may be beside the movie's point.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Cars"" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside. When it comes to the basis of their appeal, it doesn't keep up with the rest of Pixar films which have sped up far ahead and this may yet be their first underachiever. But for what it is and what it achieves, it's a nice ride."
"dirtygordy","Null","12","13","13 June 2006"," Cars is great!
","I'm a man (71). I took my son (40) and my granddaughter (10) to see ""Cars"". It was wonderful exciting entertainment for all our ages. I grew up with the old cars and have traveled Route 66 a few times so I was able to relate to the story and talk about the old times after the movie with the younger kids. My son and his daughter love NASCAR so they got a lot from the movie. The scenery though computer modified and generated was beautiful and true to the area portrayed. There is so much going on that this is one movie I want to see again. I have more grandkids, I think I'll have a valid excuse to go once more. Please!, if you see this movie remain seated until the very end of the credits, you are in for a treat."
"greeneyedangel08","9","119","162","27 May 2006"," Charming story, vivid animation, wonderful characters
","I went to the premier of ""Cars"" last night at the Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concorde and was delighted to find that the hours of traffic were worth it. <br/><br/>The story has a clear point and the message of friendship is easily understood by kids and adults alike. The variety of humor suits all generations, too, making this the first ""summer must see"" for the family.<br/><br/>Being an artist I was struck by the vibrancy of the animation. The colors were rich and beautiful, and there was such diverse vocal talent that the entire experience made it a treat for the crowd's eyes and ears. I've never been to a movie with more than a few hundred people in the theater, but let me assure you that all 30,000+ attendees at the Speedway last night applauded during the credits and for some very, very good reasons."
"ahuffman_2000","8","101","145","27 May 2006"," Pixar and Disney did it again!
","Without giving away any of the story, here's my take. I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the ""original"", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the ""Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies"" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so."
"av6637","8","12","14","28 June 2006"," Pixar does it again
","Pixar just keeps hitting them out of the park. Larry the cable guy was a great cast as Mater. Owen Wilson as Lightining was another great decision for the makers of Cars. There is never a dull moment while watching this film. I guess that is obvious by the overwhelming success at the box office. Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids. I recommend everyone go see this film and then go see it again."
"Rectangular_businessman","7","14","17","14 January 2007"," Pixar keep the good line
","I found this movie to be enjoyable enough: Even when it is true that it wasn't at the same level than some of previous Pixar films (Such as ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"") it was a good film anyway, with an entertaining story and likable characters.<br/><br/>Despite the strangeness of the premise of a world inhabited by living cars, the execution is fairly convincing, with a neat character development and many funny and heartwarming moments.<br/><br/>Without being perfect, it managed to be something totally worth-watching from beginning to end, and in many ways this could be easily considered one of the best animated films from the year 2006 (Which was a terrible year, in my opinion) <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"frankselden","8","11","13","28 June 2006"," worth watching
","Animated films are not my favorite genre and I am not a Nascar fan. I anticipated that I would reflect on the 2 hours in a movie theater as quality family time rather than quality entertainment but this movie had me hooked from the beginning. My kids did not have my background to understand Route 66 history but they didn't need it. The loved the film for other reasons. I lived in small towns where a day is fueled with hope of what might come over the horizon. I have actually been cow tipping and laughed at the tractor scenes. I really appreciate the part of the theme of a successful member of a younger generation listening to and profiting by the wisdom of someone older. Far too many children's shows revolve around a plot with stupid adults and the youth needing to save the world. This film perhaps restored, for me, a little faith in our entertainment industry. This is one movie the whole family really can enjoy. See this movie if for no other reason than to support the production of this type of message."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","5","5","18 July 2011"," Perfect for the Kid Who Loves Matchbox Racers - His Parents, Less So
","There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Revised thoughts, nearly three years later:<br/><br/>My boys are absolutely bonkers for Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater right now, but had never actually seen the movie. Needless to say, they loved it, and I discovered that my own opinion has softened over time. Of course, it still can't hold a torch to the innocent humor of Toy Story, the sentimentality of Monsters, Inc. or the pulse-pounding twists of The Incredibles, but it fits in snugly on the second tier alongside A Bug's Life and Ratatouille. The theme may have seemed transparently concocted to sell merchandise, but as a product of the era when Pixar didn't do anything they didn't believe in, it still resonates with thoughtful care and well-placed emotion. Perhaps unfairly cast aside at first, it's a well-made, lovingly executed film that tugs shamelessly at the heart strings when its points bubble to the surface. I'd upgrade my score from 7 to 8/10."
"bwoodworth","9","5","5","27 June 2006"," Wonderfully entertaining
","A delightful animated romp made by Pixar and Disney. It is filled with talented voice performances by Owen Wilson and Paul Newman. A little slow to start, Lightning finds himself in a three-way tie with two other racers to win the coveted Piston Cup. After a comical tragedy leaving Lightning in a small town on route 66 he begins an emotional odyssey. He finds help from the locals in his search for true happiness.<br/><br/>It's a story with a moral that everyone can appreciate. Life in the fast lane is not everything it is cracked up to be. There are more than a few laughs sprinkled throughout the film. Fart jokes are in overdrive during an expedition to tip tractors but young children will be in the aisles. Larry the Cable Guy as the tow-truck Mater is endearing for most of the movie as the slow sidekick.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful and memorizing. The viewer truly becomes sucked into this fictional world run by cars. Overall Cars is an enjoyable film with laughs both for adults and young audiences.<br/><br/>more reviews at: www.salutetocinema.com"
"randomStuff101","8","5","5","24 June 2006"," Exquisite and fun. Visuals steal the show.
","Pixar again shows us their superior skills in 3D animation and to a lesser extent this time, the storytelling. There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.<br/><br/>It's a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows. But nevertheless, it's all very cool stuff, and the story is entertaining enough. Cars is a must see Pixar film - even if the visuals steal the show."

","I was able to attend a premiere showing of this movie in North Carolina and was amazed again at how much more a movie can be than just ""animation."" This film focuses on a changed reality, a world where cars are the only life form and so we must suspend our own reality to enjoy this film. In the same flavor as the first Pixar films, we quickly accept a world where everything is a motorized vehicle that lives and acts like we do in our own world. The cars have experiences in life, desires that drive (sorry for that) them, and misunderstandings that are taken advantage of.<br/><br/>My wife and I loved this movie and plan to see it again when it is in public release.

","Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes.""<br/><br/>After watching ""The Polar Express"" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' ""faces"" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.<br/><br/>For me, watching an animated film for two hours is usually asking way too much but not with this film. It's so much fun to see and there are no boring lulls, yet the action after the first 10 minutes is light. The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.<br/><br/>At times, the colors in here astounded me, especially with the nighttime scenes. The sound also is excellent, especially in the opening and closing race scenes. With surround speakers, it's almost like being at the track.<br/><br/>The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about this film. It's really good stuff for anyone of any age. I was extremely impressed. Oh, and as a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger ."

","I just got home from an early screening of Cars. I got to see it in a digital cinema, and it really brought out the beauty of this Pixar gem. It seems that with every Pixar movie they aim to tackle a new piece of animation. With Nemo it was water, Monsters Inc. was fur. Cars has some amazing effects as far as the lighting and reflections. The cars in the movie feel very real, because of the fantastic lighting work. Also, it seems there are a lot more landscape scenes which are done very, very nicely.<br/><br/>Now, about the movie itself ... this one definitely lives up to the Pixar name. I wasn't as excited about this movie as I was with some other Pixar productions, but I should have been. This movie is a full two hours long, which is quite long for a movie of it's type. It really doesn't feel that long though, as nothing is really drawn out past its due. There are a few story lines that progress nicely as the film drives on.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat predictable (when isn't a family movie predictable). However, even though the story has been done before, it's rarely to the quality that Pixar does it. The movie somewhat caters to the ""redneck"", racing fan crowd, but I still loved it, and I am not a redneck (last time I checked).<br/><br/>This is the only spoiler I had to give away. It's not huge, I just want to make sure that people stay for the credits to watch the characters go to the movies and watch ""Toy Car Story"", ""Monster Cars"", and ""A Bug's Life"" (as in a VW Bug's life). It's a really funny bit."

I love Paul Newman, he's one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>I recommend that everyone watch this movie. I LOVED it, and I am 21 and do not have children either but I am a huge Disney fan.

I was truly moved by the serious message that the movie sends about the need in our society to get where we are going in a hurry and thereby missing the truly great things in life.

I loved how Ramone had a new paint job every time he came on scene. I loved Luigi's Ferrari mania and when Michael Schumacher came in at the end...perfect humor.

","I, like most fans of Pixar studios, felt my heart sink when I saw the first preview for ""Cars"" when it ran in front of ""The Incredibles"" in 2004. There had been previews of other Pixar movies that left me underwhelmed, but this was the first one that looked...well...bad. The constant shots of racing cars, the frenzied editing, the apparent belief that the phrase ""dadgum"" was funny in and of itself...it just looked like Pixar had come up with their first stinker. I am so glad, no...ecstatic, to say my first instincts were wrong. ""Cars"" has every bit of the Pixar spirit at its core.<br/><br/>I'm also happy to report that Mater the Tow Truck, who I thought might end up being the most loathed character since Jar-Jar, ended up being one of the funniest, most heartfelt characters in ANY Pixar film.<br/><br/>Every frame of this movie is wonderful to look at, containing all of the vibrant color and rich texture that we expect from Pixar. The voice work is uniformly excellent and, contrary to what I've read in some reviews, the story and script are just as engrossing and imaginative as their other films. Yes, the movie does have a lot of car puns, just like Monsters Inc had monster-ish puns (the ""grossery"", the ""stalk/not stalk"" crosswalk sign) and A Bug's Life had a lot of bug puns (the mosquito ordering the ""bloody mary, o-positive"", but these type of jokes are never the main type of humor. The biggest laughs come from the characters. They stem from knowing their personalities and their foibles. This has always been the key to Pixar's comic genius and ""Cars"" continues this great tradition.<br/><br/>Plus, the tractor tipping scene is one of the funniest things I've seen in a movie in a VERY long time."

The voice talents really made this a stand-out,in my opinion.Larry the Cable Guy (Mater)and Paul Newman (Doc Hudson) were my favorites.I don't know if it was intentional when Doc Hudson asked Lightning McQueen: ""When is the last time you cared about anything other than yourself?"" In case you don't know about Paul Newman, he is a caring and supremely generous man, and the founder of ""Newman's Own"" a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which he has donated to charity.

","Originally published on June 6, 2006.<br/><br/>They's taken us - happily - into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, those masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios (""The Incredibles,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Monsters, Inc.""), including Academy Award- winning director John Lasseter (""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""A Bug's Life"").<br/><br/>In their latest endeavor, the team hits the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of automobiles, the aptly-titled, ""Cars."" Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie Mustang driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy, nearly defunct Route 66 town of Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>During the film's opening scene, an exciting NASCAR race that is as thrilling to watch as it is to wonder at its creative technology, McQueen battles beloved veteran, The King (Richard Petty) and obnoxious cheater, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). The surprise outcome results in a special winner-take-all contest in California.<br/><br/>On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in Los Angeles to compete against the two seasoned pros, McQueen gets accidentally stranded (by his idiot driver, Mac, Pixar voice-over veteran John Ratzenberger), but gets to know the town's offbeat characters - including prosecuting attorney, Sally (a snazzy 2002 Porsche voiced by Bonnie Hunt), the town judge, Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, voiced by Paul Newman), and the goofy, drawling Mater (a rusty but trusty tow truck voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) - who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship.<br/><br/>But before he learns this lesson, McQueen, who has wrecked the town's only street, is sentenced to repave the thoroughfare - and he is not happy about it. He hates the backwater berg and all of the supposed yokels who reside there. He even tries to escape several times, but the authorities have drained his fuel. <br/><br/>Slowly, however, he understands how much pride the locals have in this quaint community that was once a beautiful haven along that famous American road, even Sally, who has just recently moved there. Of course, McQueen begins to see her in a new light, as well.<br/><br/>The most interesting relationship, however, is between the brash young McQueen and the dark mysterious Doc. There is a very good reason the elderly gentleman does not like race cars, but it takes a while before the kid finds out why.<br/><br/>The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by racing legends Darrell Waltrip (as Darrell Cartrip) and Mario Andretti, as well as Bob Costas, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Paul Dooley and Cheech Marin, among others. <br/><br/>As funny as the situations might be, and as big of a heart as this story has, I was continually amazed at the animation technology. The bright shiny vehicles, the beautiful sunsets, the painted desert scenes and, especially Radiator Springs spruced up in art deco neon. <br/><br/>All of this makes ""Cars"" easily one of the best films of the year, not just the summer. It may not be Pixar's greatest creation, but it's good enough for this humble scribbler.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't leave before the credits finish, though, as the conclusion is drop-dead hilarious."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","5","23","38","30 October 2006"," A different kind of Road-Movie
","As Pixar, Blue Sky and DreamWorks continue to tick off the list of cute cuddly animals to make films about, director John Lasseter and Joe Ranft (the latter sadly and ironically died in a car crash last year) brings us a story about cars in incongruous human setting. Nine years of hard work in combining Lasseter's two great interests, cars and animation, finally gives us a satisfying end product but regrettably 'Cars' is just that. Satisfactory and utterly charmless.<br/><br/>The story, for one, is one of the most predictable riffs I have ever seen in an animated feature. It zooms in on an exhilarating, high-profile race for the prestigious 'Piston Cup' and the third lap offers a sense of impending doom. It is Lightning McQueen  rookie at the top of his game, and voiced by the energetic Owen Wilson  that races in pursuit of prestige... so much that he alienates everyone around him, even his pit crew. The race becomes a three-way tie between him and his competitors and now the final showdown will be held in Los Angeles in one week. It is on the way to L.A. that 'Cars' really starts up its engine, specifically when McQueen takes a detour across the desert-laden terrain by route 66 and gets caught for speeding by the local sheriff. He is sentenced to community service in the seedy little nowhere-town and, predictably, here the arrogant McQueen learns the true meaning of friends.<br/><br/>For a movie about fast-paced vehicles, 'Cars' starts slowly and keeps in this lane for far too long. One hour into the film, Lightning still has not learned the mandatory 'morals & message' lesson that you know Disney is just waiting to dish out with a wagging finger. Undoubtedtly its fatal flaw is its length: there is absolutely no need to stretch a Disney comedy across two hours. This problem escalates as the extremely safe and passive approach to humour makes its mark; soon it is clear that the film is not going to tip over into goofball or absurdist humour but remains sedated and expects us to find the mere facial expressions of the cars hilarious  and they are not, because cars are too clunky and mechanical to effectively emote.<br/><br/>Yet it needs to be said for all its comedic shortcomings, 'Cars' remains afloat simply because it makes no pretense about being a Disney/Pixar film of a different calibre. It is obvious that it caters more to the younger audience than, say, the heavyweights Shrek, Nemo or Ice Age that are all about adult references. Only once or twice does the film sneak in a subtle racy element such as the bitch-tag at the back of the female Porsche's rear or the 'organic fuel' that the hippie-van uses. On that note, ""hillbilly hell"", as McQueen bitterly spits, is beautifully crafted in terms of animation. The CGI environment is crisp, fluent, lean and simply superb in capturing the well-oiled sleek machines of superstardom juxtaposed with the rusty hicky complexity of the hillbilly town. 'Cars' is possibly Pixar's greatest feat in animation, but its weakest jab at story and entertainment.<br/><br/>Although Paul Newman brings perfect charisma to his bitter-and-doomed-but-good-old-mentor character, none of the other cars shine. Indeed, there is a frightening lack of funny sidekicks with assigned quirks and the closest Cars gets to this is its shy firewagon truck Red. This wide-ranging mediocrity also applies to the soundtrack which is noticeably sub-par and unimaginative: either cheesy mellow 'mood' music or Sheryl Crow pop. Where's the oomph in the engine of 'Cars'? Step up, Disney, because you cannot ride on the success of Finding Nemo forever.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"
"Rosser94","10","5","6","23 March 2012"," Disney and Pixar - take a bow
","I am incredibly reluctant to score a film perfectly as there is always something, big or small, that bugs me in any cinematic experience. However, this was NOT the case in ""Cars"".<br/><br/>Prior to viewing, I expected a below-standard Pixar production that was good but not great, however I could not have been more wrong.<br/><br/>I'll begin with the visual and audio utilisation - the animation is (as you'd expect from Pixar), tremendous on every level - wonderful scenery and character models ensure this is an aesthetic treat. In terms of audio, sound effects are great and the soundtrack is beyond fantastic.<br/><br/>Characters (an important aspect of any family film), are found in positive abundance here. Stereotypes are present but not overused, every character is easy to relate to (despite the fact that they are cars), and the emotions of every character are truly emphasised; nobody in ""Cars"" is anything short of vivid.<br/><br/>The plot itself is perfectly paced; the story-telling is easy to follow, yet allows room for twists, turns and speculation to a perfectly adequate degree. In addition to this, the script is brilliant; there is plenty of humour to accompany some equally emotional outbursts. The way in which Disney and Pixar make us feel empathy for animated vehicles is intelligent and a fine achievement.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time, and it is, in my view, able to compete with any other piece of cinema, from ""Casablanca"" to ""Shrek""; the magic of Disney, alongside the high production values of Pixar, in accordance with the sheer brilliance of this movie, ensures that it is a must-see for anybody. ""Cars"" is a true masterpiece."

"carreraturbo","9","5","6","15 June 2008"," Highly Underrated
","When going to watch Cars for the first time, I did not have the highest expectations for it. People say that this is one of Pixar's most disappointing movies, but after watching it I could not understand why this movie was getting a lot of criticism.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a race car named Lightning Mcqueen whose dream is to race and win the Piston Cup. He's rather arrogant and does not have friends because of his unlikeable personality. The film starts with Mcqueen in the big race going for the Cup but after a three way tie, the race is set to be raced again in a few weeks. During his trip to the race, he gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town which has lost its business due to a highway which bypasses the town. Mcqueen meets a whole lot of interesting characters here that teach him the true meaning of friendship.<br/><br/>Most of the reason why I think this film is so criticised is because of its long running time of almost 2 hours. Although the film is a little slow during the middle, I feel it is necessary for the development of all the characters and to show the story of Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>Pixar's Cars is a very enjoyable film with plenty of laughs and an emotional scene in which I couldn't help but shed a tear. Although Cars is usually on the bottom of peoples list of Pixar films, it is one of my favourites of the lot.<br/><br/>10/10"

Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help. However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations. I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too). I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas. Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.<br/><br/>It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job. These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

"KarisLOVER","9","5","6","9 July 2006"," Surprisingly deep, and wonderfully entertaining...
","I'll admit it: I was frightened to see this movie. The trailer was ridiculous and cringe worthy. Thankfully, this movie has almost no relation to it's trailer. It's dazzling, fun, and quite frankly, the best movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>We open with our hero, Lightning McQueen (what was his mother thinking?), racing for the Piston Cup. Conveniently, the race is a three way tie so, a tie-breaker is held in California. On his way there, however, McQueen gets arrested in the small town of Radiator Springs. What happens from here is typical Pixar fare: Hero learns to be a better person and make friends. What is more interesting here, is the story, within the story. It's what's implied throughout the movie; the surprisingly deep story about how society has become too fast paced. It's about taking things slow and stopping to smell the roses. That is the great triumph of Cars' screenplay; the surface story serves only as a Trojan horse.<br/><br/>This entire movie meshes perfectly. Everything, the music, story, acting, direction is all wonderful. More amazing than anything, however, is the animation. It's jaw dropping on more than one occasion. Everything from the dirt flying off McQueen's tires, to the car models themselves (besides Pixar, who else could make a car replica of Jay Leno look so much like him?) is fantastic. It's simply dazzling.<br/><br/>There are so many scenestealers in this film, it's hard to tell who's the best. The most noticeable is Mater. Larry the Cable Guy, who I despise with my every breath, gives an honest and hilarious performance. It's an amazing feat that he won me over. While Mater is the most noticeable character, he's certainly not the best. Owen Wilson (another one I hate) was excellent as McQueen as well. He's just enough of a jerk starting out, so at the end of the film, you're really glad to see his character progression. My favorite character was Luigi, Radiator Springs' body shop owner. Tony Shalhoub gives a wacky, over-the-top performance that I fell in love with. Bonnie Hunt is nice, but her brilliant comedic talent is woefully underused. I'm a little upset that she had to play the straight person. Another one to mention is Paul Newman. He's very nice, and very subtle here. Excellent job, Mr. Newman.<br/><br/>Movie like this don't come around often. When something this good comes around that appeals to both kids, and adults, jump on it. While I love Finding Nemo to death, the rest of Pixar's films are kids movies. Cars, however, is not. In fact, it leans more to side of being a G rated movie for adults, that kids happen to like. Even if you don't have children, Cars is a dazzling ride that's not to be missed by anyone."

Paul Newman, what more could be said about this wonderful man? With the pairing of Larry the Cable Guy and Owen Wilson these two hit the ball right out of the park with perfectly delivered lines to make the most hypocritical person laugh.

It had heart, and had some great lessons about learning to put others ahead of yourself and to think of others instead of being obsessed with getting attention for yourself. Not Disney's finest, but certainly a winner for me. The music was good as well, Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" and Rascal Flatts ""Life is a Highway"" set the mood for the film perfectly. I'm a fan of country music anyway, and of Rascal Flatts. I loved this two songs. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD, so I can watch it endlessly. This ranks among my favorites for Disney/Pixar's films: 1. Cars, 2. Finding Nemo, 3. Toy Story 2, 4. Toy Story. All of these are excellent in animation and story. I even cried at parts of the story, especially when McQueen pushed The King to the finish line, and when Mater and McQueen were developing their close friendship. Also, when McQueen found out that being cared for (in more than just publicity) and caring about others was great. That really was what stood out to me. Great job, Disney and Pixar!"
"jberlin11797","9","5","6","2 July 2006"," The Best Movie So Far This Year
","The first half of 2006 has been a very lackluster year at the movies. There hasn't been too many big hits this year. So far, ""The DaVinci Code,"" although it broke the $100 million mark, was a confusing mess, and I found that when I read the book to prepare for the movie, the book moved even faster than the movie itself.<br/><br/>But we can always rely on Disney/Pixar for a solid midyear hit. This year, it's ""Cars,"" and like many other Pixar movies in recent years (""Monsters Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles,"" to name a few), it has every Pixar element to offer - a great big-name voice cast of stars from varied backgrounds and the cast voice characters that best match their personas, colorful, cheery animation, and a story that evokes emotions. Pixar just never disappoints. We hope that Pixar, whether sided with Disney or not, just gets more hits flying.<br/><br/>In ""Cars,"" the main character is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a self-absorbed red racing car that after departing a big NASCAR race, travels the legendary Route 66 and gets stuck in a small, forgotten town called Radiator Springs. He makes friends and learns various lessons about life, love, and the meaning of being a car. This sounds all-too familiar in the ""Toy Story"" movies, which deal with the philosophical meanings of toys' lives, but now the story is transferred to cars. He makes friends with the hillbilly tow truck Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, a comic hoot), the pert blue Porsche Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), and in a strong performance, a has-been race car Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a race car driver in his own right as well as a legendary actor.) Mater delivers the laughs with that southern accent, Sally delivers common sense, and Doc Hudson tells Lightning McQueen, that he once crashed, and there is more to life than just being a race car. Once lessons are learned, Lightning McQueen must go back for one more big race.<br/><br/>Other actors voicing colorful characters in small but pivotal roles are Cheech Marin as the Hispanic car Ramon, Tony Shalhoub as the hilarious yellow car Luigi, and Michael Keaton as Lightning McQueen's rival Chick Hicks, who ties with Lightning McQueen in the race in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>I thought it was amusing to see that at the race track, everyone is a car. There are no people. The spectators are cars, the press are cars, and the models are cars with feathers on their roofs.<br/><br/>Cars is absolutely wonderful and perfectly fast-paced, the whole ride through."

When I saw the previews for the movie I thought that the movie was completely about racing, but it wasn't! I found that this movie had some racing material in it but was much more than that!

Whether you're a NASCAR fan or not (I'm not) you'll love the variety of cars from snobbish Porsche fans to 80's mullet-haired Buick Grand Nationals to a '51 Hudson Hornet and the thinly disguised ""Corvette"" shape of the lead character - all were wonderful.<br/><br/>While it's difficult to rate any animated film with the Disney classics of Bambi, Snow White and Fantasia, ""Cars"" is right up there with the best ever.

I'll definitely see it again, just to see what I must have missed - there's so much going on here, you can't possibly take it all in at once - but you'll get the story and let the scenery and sound just wash over you. <br/><br/>As usual, stay through ALL the credits."
"nishantkumar","10","5","6","19 June 2006"," A unique concept translation!
","This animation movie is by far the best I've seen in my life. The very concept of using cars with human emotions was fantastic. The rapid pace at which the movie progresses and the end with a sting in the tail was just too good to resist! Lightning McQueen, has demonstrated almost every human passion and emotion during the short duration of 1:35 hrs. ""Turn right to turn left"" was not just a technique proposed by the doc but also a straight hint to the audience. When things don't seem to work as they should, the exactly opposite method to do it can work wonders. I think this very statement was the catch-phrase in the movie. The animation and computer graphics are taken care of with immense detail. At times it felt as if the close-up shots of the revolving wheels were actually close-up shots of a real car wheel. With a nice storyline the movie deserves to top the chart. In short, a movie that truly deserves to be seen by one and all!"
"smit815","9","5","6","17 June 2006"," Movie That Touches Heart and Funny Bone
","As far as pure devil may care humor goes, Over The Hedge is probably funnier, but Cars has good humor, but also touches the heart without being manipulative. The humor is obviously generated mostly by Tow Mater the Tow Truck whose voice is provided by Larry The Cable Guy. And the moral of the story is provided by the relationship of Speed Mcqueen the racer whose voice is Owen Wilson, and Doc Hudson whose voice is provided by Paul Newman. The moral can be summed up by the poet that wrote, ""No man is an island unto himself"". Rarely are our accomplishments the result of what we do alone - most successful people on sports, arts or business have people in the background doing a lot of support work.<br/><br/>So this movie works on the level of a humorous story, good moral point, great art work, and last but not least a very good sound track. The remake of Route 66 is very good. Based on these qualities I give the movie a ""9""."
"wlb","9","5","6","16 June 2006"," A Must See if you are a Car Nut

While I am not a rabid NASCAR fan even I know Richard Petty's Plymouth number 43 (voiced by the King himself) , and while watching this animation can easily see why NASCAR is so popular. The engine sounds were so realistic & matched to the vehicles. <br/><br/>CAUTION: If you miss even 15 seconds of dialogue you'll miss a clever pun. Even the motel in the movie is a clever take off on Rt 66's famous Wigwam Motel.<br/><br/>There are no people in the movie - only cars and other vehicles. It is a world of talking vehicles.<br/><br/>And they cleverly made the cars movement believable using a lot of suspension travel.<br/><br/>The car's voices were so well matched to the car models! Cheech Marin is the voice of a low rider 59 Chevy Impala, a cameo by Arnold Schwartzenegger with an H1 Hummer, Michael Schumacher in what else but a Ferrari, and George Carlin in a 60s VW Van complete with peace symbols. Richard Petty was the Plymouth of course. Paul Newman is the wise old Hudson Hornet. Speaking of detail the Hudson's blue color was an actual Hudson color according to one of the magazine articles. <br/><br/>Can a Porsche Carrera find true happiness with a NASCAR race car? Does a particular NASCAR race car find the true meaning of life? <br/><br/>You'll have to watch the movie. <br/><br/>Bill"

","I'm from an Arts College, so i tend to examine and criticize animation. After watching Cars, i must say that it has one of the best animations ever. All the cars in the movie looked so real and alive, it's unbelievable. Pixar's animation is truly top-notch.<br/><br/>The storyline was very warm and sweet... showing how humility affects everyone.<br/><br/>I've seen all 7 Pixar movies, from Toy Story to Finding Nemo to Cars, and Cars is definitely one of the best. I would place Cars alongside The Incredibles, just above Finding Nemo. It's amazing how Pixar can handle any challenge thrown at them. I mean, in Toy Story, they made toys look so real, then they did insects in A Bug's Life, followed by monsters (Monster's Inc), fish in Finding Nemo, humans in The Incredibles... and now cars. Amazing. Pixar is really versatile.<br/><br/>I give Cars a 9/10 because it shows the amount of effort put into it, and how awesome everything is."
"Knewsense78","8","5","6","14 June 2006"," an animated feast for the eyes!!!
","Let me just start by saying that CARS to me was wonderful but I did enjoy FINDING NEMO better. I have yet to watch THE INCREDIBLES (I'm slow sometimes) so I can't really compare this one to that one. Lightning McQueen is a racing car. During one of these races there is a three way tie. The officials decide that Lightning and the other two cars involved (Chick Hicks and The King) will battle it out in a race in California. Los Angeles to be precise. Mack, the truck who is bringing him to Cali, dozes off while moving along while Lightning is asleep in the trailer. That's when four street cars (think THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) sneak up and have some fun with Mack. This fun causes him to go over in the lane with all the grates in the road to wake you up and let you know what's going on. The bumps cause something to fall off a shelf in the trailer and hit a lever that makes the door open. Lightning rolls out (still asleep) into the middle of the highway. From there on, he rolls his way (or should I say ""Speeds""?) into RADIATOR SPRINGS, a town on the outskirts of a major interstate that everyone seems to have forgotten. Everyone except the few cars that still live there and call it home. Anyway, I will stop right there before I give away the whole movie. This movie boasts awe aspiring, lush animation that can only be done by Pixar. But, like I said, I liked FINDING NEMO better. That's not to say don't watch this movie because it sure is a delight."

","Don't get me wrong, Cars is a good movie, it's just that it isn't a great one. Personally I do think it is my least favourite Pixar movie, but there was still a lot I enjoyed. So what were its problems? Well, firstly I felt the narrative was a little too slack and sedate particularly in the middle act. Secondly, while there were some nice jokes, some didn't quite work and the script had its weak spots, could've done with more sophistication. Thirdly, the film's message is a little muddled.<br/><br/>But there is a lot to enjoy. The animation is superb, the backgrounds are beautiful and the character movements are crisp. The film has some really bright and inventive colouring which was a delight to see. The soundtrack is quite exhilarating as well, and the race scenes themselves are like mini-masterpieces of editing.<br/><br/>The characters are at least likable and engaging, Lightening McQueen(a refreshing retread from the dull and flaccid hero), female Porsche Sally(who is really cute) and Doc Hudson(the wise old-timer with a secret past) are the best characters in my opinion.<br/><br/>The voice acting is very well done. Owen Wilson gives a spirited and appealing vocal performance as Lightening, this was really refreshing to see and it really helped that Lightening himself was likable, yes he is cocky and arrogant then again even the best characters ever in film have a flaw or so of some kind. The late talented Paul Newman is a sheer delight as Doc, and Bonnie Hunt is delightful as Sally. Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, Tony Shalhoub and John Ratzenberger also give solid turns in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, Cars is my least favourite of the Pixar movies but for the animation and voice acting especially, not to mention the race sequences it is well worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","In a world inhabited by locomotion machines and cars, the little abandoned town of Radiator Spring languishes until it receives the visit of a posh race car, Lightning McQueen. His stop and meeting of the old- style cars living there will change his perspective on life and on what he wants to achieve.<br/><br/>The mate drawing of the landscape and town settings is magnificent. The cinematography and shot angles used to film the story are truly artistic. The design of the cars is equally impressive regarding animation, colors, texturing and lighting. The night scenes in the open field are among my favorites, so beautiful and realistic. The whole film is a long wow in that regard, and you feel like clapping to those big artists working for Pixar in this movie. In that regard, the movie deserves a 10.<br/><br/>The voicing of the characters, done by A-list actors (Paul Newman among them, in his last acting role before passing away), is extremely good, very charming and effective, as the viewer really feels that the voices match the cars' personality and bring a big cozy feeling to the movie.<br/><br/>However, all of this is not enough to save the movie, which suffers from an absurd point of departure, stereotypical script and characters/role models, and a childish storyline feeling in general. This will delight children, guaranteed, but will not engage enough most adults. I thought that Pixar had lowered their storyline standards and made a movie that would suit more Disney's requirements. No wonder that Disney bought Pixar little after the movie was released.<br/><br/>An enjoyable movie for kids, with spectacular animation and eye candy colors to be enjoyed by all."

(Lightning McQueen, our main character, initially is very cocky and full of himself, and after some life lessons, becomes a' better car') The car theme is not exactly my favorite, but even so, the producers were original in many things, like for example, Lizzie, the 1923 Ford Model T that is an old character, as well as the car model is very old."

","Pixar has the difficult obligation of bettering itself with each subsequent movie in order to please their fans. With instant classics in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the Pixar standards are set high. I wondered how Pixar could take the concept of talking cars into an entertaining film and original story and characters, especially considering the studio's standards.<br/><br/>Though the new Pixar film is not ""better"" than its other features, Cars is definitely up to par with the rest of the classics, delivering yet again a complete package of stunning visuals, a great story, and memorable characters.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is a hot shot racecar that needs to make it to California to make it to a big race and fulfill his childhood dreams of winning the Piston Cup. However, a series of unfortunate events lead him to the beat up town of Radiator Springs. Though the town doesn't look like much, it is actually full of an assortment of charming citizens that take great pride in the place they lived in all their lives, its people (cars rather) and its history.<br/><br/>In Radiator Springs, the hotshot McQueen learns lessons about the different aspects of life he has taken for granted, among other things: like how to have a good time at a night out with Mater, a rusty tow truck voiced by Larry ""the Cable Guy"" (Git R Done!).<br/><br/>Pixar pulled it off. A movie about talking cars actually turned out to be a heartwarming story, with hilarious sequences and dialog. Pixar does a great job of personifying the world of inanimate objects. A lowrider that specializes in Body Art. An Italian tire salesman (salescar rather) obsessed with and only with Ferraris.<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining from beginning to end (even before and after the movie). Make sure to get there early to check out the awesome short ""One Man Band"" a worthy addition to Pixar's collection of animated shorts. And after the film, Pixar replaces their blooper gag reel for a new treat that may be the funniest closer yet.<br/><br/>How does Pixar do it? Create such great stories with such memorable characters? Besides Oscar the Shark Slayer I can't remember anyone else from Shark's Tale, and I am hopeless in remembering a single character's name from Robots, nor the Wild, but I can name Pixar characters in a heartbeat. Those movies can eat Pixar's dust Lightning McQueen style.<br/><br/>No photo finish is necessary to determine that Cars is a definite winner. We can all breathe a sigh of relief that John Lasseter and Pixar yet again prevailed in bringing us another gem to join our growing collection of Pixar classics. Sigh."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","8","12","10 July 2006"," Try turning right to go left!
","With as many phenomenal films on their resume as Pixar has, it is hard to believe that they can keep up the level of quality one film after another, and if you are waiting to see what will be the film that will be the first stumble from them, keep waiting because Cars is not it. Just when you think they must be running out of ideas by now, they come out with something like this and it blows me away every time. I watched Cars having never heard anything about it beyond the not very informative billboards that are plastered all over Los Angeles. <br/><br/>The thing that I kept thinking to myself as I watched this movie is that if you took someone from, say, 1985, and showed them this movie, they would be absolutely astounded at how far animation has come. If you took someone from 1950 and showed them this movie I don't think there is any way you could convince them that the movie is animated at all. The animation is so real that there were times when I wondered if they mixed in live action shots.<br/><br/>I love the way the movie mixes the super-fast culture of stock car racing with the culture of a sleepy town which has become forgotten because a freeway was built nearby, taking all of the traffic away from the town and letting entropy take its course. Kind of like what happened to the Bates Motel, right?<br/><br/>Owen Wilson is the perfect person to voice the cocky Lightning McQueen, an up and coming stock car that is well on its way to winning a much sought after sponsorship. An unfortunate series of events, however, leaves him stuck in the charmingly named Radiator Springs, repaving their road after losing control of his throttle, so to speak, and thoroughly destroying it. He begins by thinking of them not as the little people, but as the microscopic people, not worth his time, energy, or even a thought. The process by which his views of these simple people form the plot of the film, and it is a highly entertaining ride.<br/><br/>Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater, the town's rusty tow truck, and he steals the show from beginning to end. I got into listening to Jeff Foxworthy tapes and CDs when I was a kid living up in Diamond Springs (near Placerville, CA), and from there got into the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, of which the only two that I found really funny were Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy. The guy with the mustache and goatee and the guy that was always smoking and drinking got real old real quick. My question at this point is, what else is there for Larry the Cable Guy to do in the movies? I would love to see (or at least hear) more of him, but he doesn't seem to have a lot of range at this point.<br/><br/>I think that the most important thing that makes this movie good, besides the animation and wonderful performances, is that there is depth to just about all of the characters. The amount of backstories that are smoothly provided is astonishing, and it gets you that much more into the movie. Also, in keeping with Pixar's image of not being able to curb their own overflowing creativity, the movie opens with another charming short film and, possibly my favorite part of the entire movie, ends with the characters from the movie watching excerpts from past Pixar movies, in which all of the characters are now vehicles of some sort. <br/><br/>And one more thing, I would like to nominate the scene with the Italian-speaking Ferrari's as one of the single best scenes in any Pixar movie!"

The boring part of the movie was in the beginning when Lightning McQueen was in the race and talking to the other race cars and when he got lost on the way to the final race. But I think all sorts of children will like it. However I do think this because as I was in the movie theater,in my seat the movie was starting and heard a few little kids yelling out saying:awesome or cool or just plain yelling.

","With the rash of animated movies coming out (5 of the 6 previews shown at our theater were for upcoming animated features) I'm hesitant to see them. Having seen only one CGI feature previously (Shrek) one might tell that I'm not a real big fan of animated films. But I do think these movies are well done, and Pixar scores yet again, 7 out of 7 based on the story, content and imagery.<br/><br/>However, being a certified car nut, the subject matter immediately got my attention. Reading the synopsis of the story and seeing a behind-the-scenes program on the making of Cars, I was really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>The act of restoring old cars is a way for many of us to connect with earlier, and more simple times, before progress became regressive as it seems to be now, as we spend more times with our computers than we do with our kids, etc...<br/><br/>This movie captures the imagination in ways that also tug the heart. Kids and adults alike, will catch a glimpse of what true friendship, loyalty and love is all about. Everyone will see something in these ""people/cars"" that they will recognize and hope for in themselves and those around them. Don't get hung up about seeing talking cars. I have heard people complain about this, yet they have no arguments about talking rodents... Go figure.<br/><br/>As one who has traveled along Route 66 and seen some of the real places the movie used as inspiration, you may also recognize the Cadillac tail fins sticking up out of the desert, and the old rusty hoods of old cars (as desert buttes) lying in the canyon. A real visual feast. There were numerous times that I could not believe what I was seeing was not actual photography. Note the aerial views, especially. The cameo appearances were a real treat as well, knowing the backgrounds of the characters used made it even more enjoyable, such aRichard Petty and his wife Lynda. She's portrayed as the stationwagon they used to haul their kids arounf to the races in the early days. The music was also great. James Taylor's Our Town truly captured the melancholy reality of what once was, and what is reality now for the hundreds of little dots on the old folded paper road maps, that no longer show up on the GPS navigation system in your SUV.<br/><br/>Take the kids and see this show a couple of times. Then, take them on vacation along the Mother Road and show them the living history of America's automotive, cultural and expansionist heritage. Or at least pack the kids in the car, pack a picnic lunch and leave the game boys and DVD players at home and drive around your own community and rediscover the heritage of your town. Take your own road trip. You might just rediscover yourselves, too! If you are at all nostalgic for the way things used to be, or long for what could have been, you must see this movie and get a good understanding of what America's love affair with the automotive culture--and America itself, is all about."
"Mr Parker","8","12","20","30 May 2006"," Slow start but speeds ahead to come out on top!
","For the first half hour or so of the movie, all I could think to myself was, ""Damn, Pixar might be in trouble here."" For some reason, I just could not get into it at the beginning. The whole thing with having cars as characters just didn't sit well with me, the story wasn't engaging and I couldn't shake the feeling like Pixar had finally dropped the ball with this one. The streak had gone long enough and Pixar had struck out after a long line of animated classics.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I was wrong because by the end of the movie, I was loving it. By the end, I loved all of the characters and I had that same fuzzy feeling that I got from all of the other Pixar films. The story was a bit formulaic but in there were definitely several moments where I found myself getting a little choked up. Yeah, I'll admit it. The story is actually very touching and what I really dug was that the main character, Lightning McQueen, really makes a change from the beginning of the film to the end of it and realistically speaking, that's what a good story always has, a big change. I hated him at first and by the end, he really proves himself to be a stand up guy (car, whatever...). The rest of the characters were great and fit their roles well, especially Paul Newman who is perfect for his role given his car racing history.<br/><br/>I was laughing out loud at a lot of the jokes and on an interesting note, the jokes in this film are gonna fly right over the heads of probably 95% of the kids that go see this. I think this movie has more sight gags than any of the other Pixar films to date and sly jokes directed at the adult crowd.<br/><br/>The animation surpasses everything else they've done up until now. If there is one word to describe it, it has to be photorealistic. Maybe too real.<br/><br/>Last but not least, there is one absolutely hilarious bit at the end where John Ratzenberger's character, Mack, watches car versions of earlier Pixar movies with titles like ""Toy Car Story"" and such. All he can do is comment on how funny the actor is who plays the roles that he did in those movies and... just watch it and see.<br/><br/>In the end, while it's not the best Pixar movie, it's damn good and far from a failure. Car nuts will love it, adults will love it and I'm sure the kids are gonna eat this one up. Recommended.<br/><br/>RATING: **** out of *****."
"jluis1984","6","11","18","8 July 2006"," Not a classic, but I still like it...
","when Pixar announced their idea for ""Cars"" (a world exactly like our own but inhabited by living cars instead of humans), I thought that the film was going to be an instant failure. Then, as the images of the new graphics and the plot outlines started to came out I was still unimpressed by them, seeing at how unoriginal the plot was and how everything seemed to be aiming for showing off their technical progress, my hopes for ""Cars"" were really low. I guess that's why I ended up liking it so much.<br/><br/>""Cars"" is the story of a cocky, arrogant and very ambitious young racer named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who has become the new sensation in the racing circuit. During the trip towards the final race of the circuit (a race that would give him the Cup if he wins), he gets lost and accidentally ends up in a small forgotten town on Route 66 named ""Radiator Springs"". Without knowing how to return to the Highway and forced to repair the damage caused by his arrival, McQueen will discover the simple way of life of this quiet town and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is perfect; the computer animation has reached a point where it seems that the only limit is to create a human being, and I bet that Pixar is not too far from it. Light effects, water effects, reflection, chrome and other phenomena are represented with great detail surpassing everything Pixar had done before. However, this tale of a young and ambitious car living in the fast urban world and his clash with the simple and slower life of rural U.S. is nothing really new or original, and this is where the directors/writers John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft make a difference.<br/><br/>""Cars"" is a new version of a familiar old story. Sure, it is by no means an original story and it is very predictable, but the details added by the writers are what makes the film different. The lovable and different characters give soul to the apparently lifeless ""Cars"", and they make the difference in what otherwise would be a dull boring and predictable film. every character has been carefully detailed, not only visually, but also in their personalities, antics and voices. This care in the characterization department is what made ""Toy Story"" or Fox's ""Ice Age"" different among other animated films.<br/><br/>The voice actors are very good, and it is noticeable the care taken in assembling the cast. Owen Wilson makes a very good McQueen, making him an arrogant, ambitious city boy; Paul Newman brings his experience and makes a wonderful Doc Hudson, Radiator Springs' mayor. Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable guy complete the cast and all of them are equally competent in their jobs. Their performances give the final touch to the film.<br/><br/>As written above, the film has only one big detail that may turn off some viewers. Its plot is nothing really new or unseen, and it could be said that it is one of their least funny scripts. Sure, it touches an important subject, but a few more laughs could had helped the final product. However, credit must go to the writers, who have crafted a movie that will keep the kids interested even when it is not a laugh riot.<br/><br/>""Cars"" may not be have a multi-awarded script or even an original plot, but it has a lot of heart, and it shows how much Lasseter and Ranft cared for the story. Despite its troubles, it is a fine film to take the children. If you keep the expectations low and relax a bit it will be a nice ride."
"eichelbergersports","8","11","18","6 June 2006"," Pixar's 'Cars' is certainly no lemon
","They's taken us - happily - into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, those masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios (""The Incredibles,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Monsters, Inc.""), and Academy Award-winning director John Lasseter (""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""A Bug's Life"").<br/><br/>In their latest endeavor, the team hits the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of automobiles, the aptly-titled, ""Cars."" Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie Mustang driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>During the film's opening scene, an exciting NASCAR race that is as thrilling to watch as it is to wonder at its creative technology, McQueen battles beloved veteran, The King (Richard Petty) and obnoxious cheater, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). The surprise outcome results in a special winner-take-all contest in California.<br/><br/>On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in Los Angeles to compete against the two seasoned pros, McQueen gets accidentally stranded (by his idiot driver, Mac, Pixar voice-over veteran John Ratzenberger), but gets to know the town's offbeat characters - including prosecuting attorney, Sally (a snazzy 2002 Porsche voiced by Bonnie Hunt), the town judge, Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, voiced by Paul Newman), and the goofy, drawling Mater (a rusty but trusty tow truck voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) - who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship.<br/><br/>But before he learns this lesson, McQueen, who has wrecked the town's only street, is sentenced to repave the thoroughfare - and he is not happy about it. He hates the backwater berg and all of the supposed yokels who reside there. He even tries to escape several times, but the authorities have drained his fuel. Slowly, however, he understands how much pride the locals have in this quaint community that was once a beautiful haven along that famous American road, even Sally, who has just recently moved there. Of course, McQueen begins to see her in a new light, as well.<br/><br/>The most interesting relationship, however, is between the brash young McQueen and the dark mysterious Doc. There is a very good reason the elderly gentleman does not like race cars, but it takes a while before the kid finds out why.<br/><br/>The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by racing legends Darrell Waltrip (as Darrell Cartrip) and Mario Andretti, as well as Bob Costas, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Paul Dooley and Cheech Marin, among others. As funny as the situations might be, and as big of a heart as this story has, I was continually amazed at the animation technology. The bright shiny vehicles, the beautiful sunsets, the painted desert scenes and, especially Radiator Springs spruced up in art deco neon. All of this makes ""Cars"" easily one of the best films of the year, not just the summer.<br/><br/>It may not be Pixar's greatest creation, but it's good enough for this humble scribbler.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't leave before the credits finish, though, as the conclusion is drop-dead hilarious."

","You know never in my wildest dreams would I see a company or a specific group of people shell such high quality entertainment in all my life. I have thought about long and hard and couldn't come up with a single reason not to love these movies. I think with each movie Pixar creates the greater the story tellers they become.<br/><br/>In this next winner the people at Pixar create the story of Lightining Mcqueen a race car with a I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread complex. Well when Lightning Mcqueen blows his two back tires, and the two competiors tie with Lightning a tie breaking game is set to take place in one week in California. Lightning who believes he's the greatest imagines himself in the spotlights and working for the greatest company in the world. He's that much of a prick.<br/><br/>We'll on his journey to California Lightning, the moving truck named Mack that transports him is ganged up by tricked out sports cars and causes the back end door to open pushing Lightning on to on coming traffic. Lightning by mistake end up fowling the wrong truck and ends be chased by a police car to Radiator Springs where most of the movie takes place.<br/><br/>Due to Lightning's arrogance he is forced to re fix the road that he destroyed. In radiator springs Lightning is introduced to a cast of characters that almost rival that of Toy story but not quite. I won't spoil to much more for the fact you must see the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>What makes the movie so great is that it takes a machine a car, and put's so much life into it that you feel for them. YOu feel bad for the town of Radiator springs because this kind of stuff happens all the time in real life. There is also so much great emotion in this movie, You actually feel sorry for Lightning because he is not a mean person he actually has a good side in him that wonders why he doesn't have friends. He actually goes on a life altering journey that proves itself once he returns to California. The ending of the film proves this.<br/><br/>I actually will admit that I get emotional in these movies that Pixar creates because John lasseter and gang take story's that pretty much occur in real life, and incorporate them into the genius story telling. THink about you have been that outcast like in Bugs life, You have been forgotten like in Toy story 2, you have had friends who you depend on through thick and thin like in Toy story and Monsters inc, You have the sense of Danger like in the Incredibles, and In Cars you have had the sense of loneliness and have had your world flipped upside down. One thing that you have in all these films though is Forgiveness and Togetherness. That's why I love these movies and feel emotional towards them.<br/><br/>Kind of Straying of the point. Cars is an exceptional film with exceptional casting, Everyone from Luke Wilson to Bonnie Hunt to Paul Newman to even the Pixar Regular John Ratzenberger are perfect to a t in the roles. Go see this just to see the amazing visuals and breath taking landscapes and exceptional casting and story telling and think about how fantastic storytelling can take even the most silly premises and end up moving you.<br/><br/>9/10"

Sounds crazy - yes it is but in the end of the movie you'll see your car in a different way. Maybe the masterpiece in this film was to make you feel for a lifeless thing - maybe it's just the superb animation (watch the reflections, lightning effects, dust clouds) - maybe it's the voice over or the music....I think this film is great and it has won my heart.

","I was quite surprised to read a number of less-than glowing reviews of this film. But then, I realized that because ""Cars"" is really quite different from most of Pixar's previous fare, I can now understand it, in a way. When you look at the ""Toy Story"" movies, as well as ""A Bug's Life"", you see anthropomorphism, of course. In this one, it goes to a whole new level. This IS a universe of cars ... no people, no grounding in reality, as with ""Toy Story"", etc. Now this could have presented a real difficulty. As with LOTR and Narnia, you create a whole world at your peril; nevertheless, Pixar's ultra-creative staff pulled it off. The voice casting was superb, and I was particularly pleased with Paul Newman's and Bonnie Hunt's efforts. But in fact, everyone ""fleshed out"" their characters beautifully. Oh, and the animation was kicked up another level, too. The scenes of Monument Valley were breathtaking ... and finally, this movie is up another whole level thematically speaking. You have Pixar's usual ""what's really important in life"" theme, along with the usual ""learn to value friendship"" admonitions. Along with these, though, is a sly, carefully crafted message about living life in ""the slow lane,"" done in a way that made me want to plan a hip trip down Route 66. All in all, I've seldom been as moved, surprised and satisfied with a movie as I have been with this one. My only complaint? The story did sag a little in the middle ... something I've noticed again in several other Pixar efforts. However it wasn't a big sag, and things revved up fairly quickly. #Spoiler Alert# You'll never again pass a tractor sitting in a field without wanting to tip it!"

","I just saw this on a drive-in's screen (appropriate, right?) and thought that it was absolutely wonderful! I wouldn't rate this as high as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc., but this is definitely along the same lines as those films. The worst language in the whole movie is the word 'Hell' (as in, I'm in Redneck Hell). The scenes that showed the racing, especially at wheel level, reminded me on the IMAX NASCAR movie. Also, there are many life lessons in the film that should reach to the younger and older audiences. I believe that many fans of Pixar's work will find that the ending credits will be a warm and hilarious look at John Ratxenburger's career with Pixar. Definitely a good family movie!

","Once again Pixar has come up with a gem, a non conventional take on a coming of age story that needs more exposure.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a self-centered, up and coming race car poised to become the first rookie winner of the coveted Piston Cup, but gets side-tracked in Radiator Springs and learns a life lesson. Along the way Lightning MxQueen is befriended, sometime begrudgingly, by the habitants of Radiator Spring.<br/><br/>The individuality and uniqueness of all the characters and the extras is stunning. In it's own unique way Pixar tells the story in a world populated and made for cars. Several cameos (voice) (Mario Andretti, Darrel Waltrip, Micheal Scumacher, etc.) will get a chuckle out of the adults.<br/><br/>The animation produced by Pixar is beyond anything we have seen. Some scenes appear virtually ""real"". Keep an eye out for some of the desert scenery and you will spot portions and sections of vehicles in the unlikeliest of places. It is this level of detail that lets Pixar's creative team's love for the art shine through. I cannot wait to get this one on DVD and get a closer look at the detailing in the scenery.<br/><br/>As an added treat at the beginning of the movie a Pixar short (One man Band ) was shown.<br/><br/>Great for kids from 5 to 95."

Everything you see is real except for the fact that the players are cars. At one point, you start feeling even the cars speak! Lightning Mcqueen's ultimate goal in life is to win the Piston Cup. The story revolves around his encounters before he reaches the grand finale. A very well written script, lively animation especially the Interstate roads,the car characters, the cute Porsche, good dialogs make this movie worth watching for all adults. It is always better to slow down a bit to succeed in fast-paced life. This is one of the many messages you get in this entertaining movie with several twists and turns. Great movie!"

When I saw the previews last year, I wondered how they would manage to create cars with hearts and souls, but they did it. I'm not a big fan of auto racing, so some of the celebrity cameos went a little over my head, but the race scenes were still very exciting. The film is definitely family friendly - though at 2+ hours it may run long for the youngest viewers.

Pixar films have always been about the story first, and Cars is no exception. All of the cars have personalities and are characterized to perfection. What's left of the real Route 66 was the inspiration for the computer artists. There is so much amazing detail to admire, it's almost impossible to see it all during a first viewing.

He's the screenwriter/director responsible for such films as ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""Wall-E.""). Past experience has taught me that in the realm of film-making, there's little they can't do.

I felt no connection with any of the characters; the story's premise was lost on me. I could barely make it to Larry The Cable Guy's entrance before I got off the couch and went elsewhere to stop the agony.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe I don't get this movie because I'm not part of the NASCAR revolution. Maybe it's because Andrew Stanton didn't have any part in this movie other than providing a voice. Maybe I have a problem connecting with automobiles, or maybe it bugged me that there are all these cars, and no drivers behind the wheel. Or maybe I just don't like Larry the Cable Guy. My point is, this movie clearly is not for everyone."

","I honestly don't get, why there are so many positive comments on this movie. As you can expect from a ""pixar"" movie, the animation quality is really awesome. But in my opinion, that's about it. The story is really boring and the comical scenes are just mediocre as well. Has anyone noticed that, besides the fact that the story doesn't surprise the viewer even once, it's pretty much the same as in ""surf's up""? A young talented guy enters a challenge, meets his old hero (who has stopped doing what he was once the best at, for a tragic reason), doesn't recognize him at first, then gets him to give some advice, and finally is the winner of the hearts, although not actually winning the challenge. And while doing all that, he wins a girl over, that didn't like him before, and gets his hero to appear before the public again.<br/><br/>Since that plot wasn't even new when used in ""Surf's up"" I won't call it ""theft"", but rather ripping off the standards.

As a result, McQueen ends up in the charmingly barmy town of Radiator Springs, the kind of place you'd want to visit, but wouldn't like to live in. His holier-than-thou ways don't exactly impress the simple townsfolk, not least Doc Hudson (Newman), the wise old granddad of the town. He learns those familiar lessons of ""There's more to life than racing"" and yaddy yada. And it is all perfectly charming and fairly amusing whilst never being particularly effecting.<br/><br/>Except, of course, for it's visuals. Cars is gorgeous, every pixel is beautifully rendered, so we have superb backdrops of waterfalls, the glow of traffic lights and rim lamps in the night, and of course rust. Lots of rust and dirt. Then there's the racing: the nascar-style drives are electric for both kids and adults. So in the end, whilst it has a decent, if predictable cast of characters, it is the aesthetics that win you over. Whilst Cars is probably lacking that great wit of The Incredibles, or indeed the benchmark film Toy Story, but it isn't disappointing. It doesn't necessarily go nought to sixty in 3 seconds, but manages to keep a relatively enjoyable pace for it's overlong duration."

","My family has waited for this movie for over 2 years, ever since we found out, while traveling Route 66, that it was in the works. As frequent Route 66 travelers, we were awarded with not only an excellent story but also an homage to the Mother Road. We had a blast trying to spot and then identify all the places we have seen along 66. Hopefully, it will inspire others to get off the interstate and revisit all the ""Radiator Springs"" that are still alive on Route 66. We especially loved where the Cadillacs from Cadillac Ranch appeared (you have to watch the mountain scenery) and how the WigWam Hotel became the Cozy Cones. We just finished another run down 66 a week ago, but after seeing Cars, we are ready to go ""get our kicks"" again."
"lao_pee","4","7","12","11 February 2007"," Over rated
","Yeah the graphics are great, but that is all because of the computer animation techniques today (consider how much money they keep putting into these CG's). The story line is old style and dragging, one can easily predict what will happen. I think this movie is overrated, maybe because of all the car-lovers in the U.S. The plot is just OK, the effort to portrait characters (both the main and supporting ones) is weak. Anyway, worth to go with kids to see all the colors and spend some family time. But if you are looking for something exciting, youmight be disappointed.<br/><br/>Pix is very good in visually making the wildest imagination come true, but to make a good movie, they will need some creativity in the story telling."
"diac228","7","6","10","9 June 2006"," A feast to the eyes, good medicine for the heart, and a good flick for everyone, Pixar remains running without a disappointment yet
","The only problem with setting the bar so high is that then you are expected to always perform at that level. Pixar set the bar so high with some of its masterpieces that whenever they come out with an above-average animated film, its still ""disappointing"" because it's compared to its other brilliant creations. The Incredibles suffers from this, and so does Cars. But, just like The Incredibles, Cars is a superb tour-de-force that should entertain the entire family. From the beginning fun-filled race to the great ending, Cars is a technical achievement, visually appealing, and also contains a great message, one that does not seem forced unlike other animated movies. As a matter of fact, this is perhaps the best animated movie since Finding Nemo three years ago.<br/><br/>Cars focuses on Lightning McQueen, who is a fast-talking, cocky, arrogant, independent rookie whose first year in racing has proved to be a very successful one. Yet, during his drive to California in attempt to claim his first Piston Cup trophy, he becomes sidetracked and is stuck in a secluded town called Radiator Town full of friendly cars led by a quiet yet bitter car with a mysterious past. Throughout the movie, Lightning attempts to leave the town, but the citizens are not going to just let him go without a fight.<br/><br/>Casting is amazing. Owen Wilson perfectly matches his character, Lightning McQueen, and Larry the Cable Guy actually provides some laughs as Mater. Paul Newman is excellent as the humble Doc Hudson, and the rest of the cast (Cheech Marin, Tony Shaloub, George Carlin, John Ratzenberger, Michael Keaton) did a great job as well. Pixar separates itself from most other movie companies because there is a lot of focus in storytelling, and the script was very good, and the dialogue has many humorous moments as there are one-liners sprinkled all-over the place. Watching the credits, one would see the amount of research put into the movie as well as dedication and effort, and that is something that really doesn't happen much with movies nowadays, especially those that come out in the summer.<br/><br/>While it is not the funniest Pixar movie nor is it the one with the saddest moments, the blend of comedy, drama, and hint of racing action is spectacular. The pacing totally slows down as the setting changes, which is a rarity in itself. You sometimes forget that they are all cars as they showcase their happiness, sorrow, and pain through their dialogue, tone, and also their facial expressions like a human being. Some moments actually had the audience collectively saying ""awwww,"" or collectively gasping, or collectively breaking out into laughter. If anyone complains about the pacing of the film, then they obviously missed the message. Cars shows that at times, its best to slow down and take life slowly, not constantly have to go out their to win the gold, to earn the money, to gain respect. If you complain about the pacing, then you are a victim of the fast-paced world we live in.<br/><br/>Animation is utterly startling, so rich in detail, so rich in color. Everything visually is practically perfect, from the tire tracks in the background to the little scratches in the main character's car, to the thousands of spectator cars witnessing the race. It is hard to blink because missing a moment of Cars would be a punishment to the eyes. Showcasing emotion through facial expressions in automobiles is not easy, yet Pixar pulls it off like it was no problem at all. It is obvious years were put into this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I can't put enough praise on this film to fit into this review. In a world of sequels, remakes, and disasters, it is nice to see that there is still some creativity out there and that there is still a company that can flesh out quality movie after quality movie. Cars has excellent casting, a great story, detailed animation, a superb ending, and a hefty dose of drama to blend in with the humor, Cars is a blast--much better than previous Dreamworks efforts, better than any Blue Sky movies, and even better than the latest Wallace and Gromit production. You would have to go back to 2003 to find a better animated film, when Finding Nemo surprisingly destroyed the summer competition for a very long time. Cars should add some nostalgia for the adults, and should also entertain the kids despite it being almost two hours in length. 10 years and still running well, good job Pixar. Cars: not the first good movie of the summer, but the first great movie of the summer."

","I saw a trailer of this and made the adult(without children) mental note: ""won't bother""! So glad I saw it when visiting my niece and her two young children. We had a movie outing together and I chuckled more than the rest of the audience, in between trying to figure whose voice was ""Humber Hornet"". Too distracting from the sheer pleasure of this action-packed animated frolic. It was Paul Newman! I like to think I am a movie buff, so going to a kid flick I brace myself for being dumbed out. Not so here. I loved every second of the masterful fusion of human emotions,and believable characters, with mechanical objects. <br/><br/>It is still good to get into the child in all of us - but probably most of you know this already?

","Excellent movie, another Pixar classic! All of the characters are well modeled and voiced, with very good specular details (reflections), and there are also very heart-touching moments, like when they divulge that Radiator Springs was bypassed when they built the big interstate, and also learning that Doc Hudson had won several Piston Cups but was ""deserted"" because of a crash. They also apparently studied a lot about NASCAR because the race scenes were pretty much spot-on. The sound design was also excellent, from the gravel underneath the tires to the crashes and engines. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, voice-acting was very good. I really liked Larry the Cable Guy doing Mater. He even does his GIT-R-DONE! catchphrase. The scene where Mater and Lightning were scaring the farm tractors was very funny. I'm definitely getting this when it comes out on DVD."
"TheFly-2","10","3","4","9 June 2006"," Pixar's string of great films continues!
","A thought hit me hard when I walked out of the theater after viewing cars; as good as Pixar films have been over the past 11 years, Cars is clearly the best.<br/><br/>To be honest, this may not be the best Pixar film for the kiddies. The tots in my theater were attentive and quiet for the full two hours, but I can see how a child could zone out. The eye candy may hold them - and there's a lot of eye candy - but the extensive talking may bore them.<br/><br/>For the adults, however, it should be an amazing film. The comparisons being made to Doc Hollywood and other films of that sort are correct to a point. The difference is the sense of loss that is presented in Cars. While many films have highlighted the differences between fast-paced city life and a quiet life in the country, Cars goes a step further. In our attempt as a nation to get everything going faster we have lost touch with ourselves and who we really are. During the film as we see what the Interstate did to the town of Radiator Springs, it's difficult not to choke up. Randy Newman's excellent song, ""Our Town"", adds to this feeling (sung superbly by James Taylor). As someone who hails from the Midwest and remembers the towns shutting down, it really hit home. Has the hectic pace of our lives really made things better for us? Maybe we should stop and realize what we lose when we don't pay attention to the beauty around us - to our families, friends, and the beauty of God's Creation that surrounds us.<br/><br/>Cars is a masterpiece. The animation is beyond superb. The cast is spot-on. The film is quite funny, especially due to Larry the Cable Guy's uberlovable Mater. Pixar has consistently brought wonderful stories to the screen that bring us so much more than cute characters. Cars is no different although it is certainly a cut above. This is the best film I've seen in a long while."

The characters are great - there's a moral curve but it's not rammed down your throat and the movie never slips into saccharine. The music is great and well picked.

","The movie is made by Pixar, the creators of another one of my favorite films, Finding Nemo. In this new film, they make cars come to life like real human beings. The story revolves around Lightning McQueen, a cocky hotshot race car. Enroute to California to compete for the Piston Cup, he gets lost in Radiator Springs, destroying their main road. The sheriff sentences him to fix the road before he can leave and head on to his race. At first, Lightning, like the arrogant self-important person -- err -- car that he is, looks upon this job with resentment and does a bad job. But as he gets to know Sally, Doc Hudson, Mater, and the other cars, he too falls in love with the town and realizes that life is about enjoying the journey, and not the frantic race to the finish line.<br/><br/>In the end, I was in tears.

"Thunderbuck","9","4","6","12 June 2006"," About those mixed reviews...
","...DON'T believe them. CARS is as good as anything Pixar has produced. It's a big, bright, fun, very American movie.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect, and I'll quickly point out the two real flaws I saw in it. First, despite some great action sequences in the first half-hour or so, the story doesn't really get going, and I found it a little harder to get into this little universe than I did for, say, Monsters Inc. Have patience, though, because the story has a lot of heart to it, and the characters really do ""come to life"" as the story goes on.<br/><br/>The only other ""flaw"" is that the rendering of Pixar's movies is getting so good that they hardly look animated anymore. This film may not hold the attention of small children, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff... Pixar's strength has always been in presenting great stories. They might use the best technology to do it, but story has always been king at Pixar, and CARS doesn't disappoint here (though as I said, it takes a little time to get rolling). In this case, the story is really an utter cliché, on many levels , and it's presented with a complete lack of irony. This is an old-fashioned Hollywood comedy in a lot of ways. Elvis could have starred in this movie in 1959 if there had been some way to magically morph him into a car. There are some lovely messages in the movie, like the value of slowing down, and taking the road less travelled. The climactic race actually manages to turn a race-movie cliché or two on its head, to great effect.<br/><br/>The characters are terrific, with Paul Newman's Doc Hudson rating special mention. Of course Paul Newman would do a movie like this, he's been in racing for decades. Not so obvious is that the car his character is based on, the Hudson Hornet, really WAS a great race car in its day. ""The King"" is based on the legendary Dodge Charger Daytona. And while I wouldn't have cast a Porsche 911 as the female lead (I thought the Boxter was Porsche's ""chick"" car), Pixar veteran Bonnie Hunt's Sally makes a great foil for Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen.<br/><br/>As usual, the art direction is fantastic. I loved the car-forms in the buttes surrounding Radiator Springs (I even recognized a Cord 810 in one scene), and there's a plethora of detail in virtually every frame. I can't wait for the DVD to re-watch and freeze-frame. The cars have very realistic physics for the most part, and like the fish in Finding Nemo, maintain a remarkable verisimilitude.<br/><br/>The in-jokes fly fast and furious here (in fact, there's a cute dig at THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, come to think of it). Jokes about cars, jokes about NASCAR (and even a little F1), and--of course--jokes about Pixar. Don't leave when the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>""They don't build 'em like they used to..."" goes the old expression, but CARS has a lot of old-fashioned, traditional qualities. It works as a family comedy, as a beautifully-rendered piece of animated art, and as a great tribute to Route 66 and the American automobile. You won't go wrong with this one."
"rjung","8","4","6","10 June 2006"," Another fine Pixar film that practices what it preaches
","For the three people remaining on the continent who have avoided all prior buzz regarding this movie, Cars is the computer-animated tale of Lightning McQueen, a cocky hotshot NASCAR race car who dreams of making it to the top in record time. En route to an important race, Lightning gets lost in the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, where he meets an eclectic group of residents and eventually learns that the journey is the reward.<br/><br/>Despite how it may appear, there's nothing spoiler-oriented in the summary above. That's because Cars is not a plot-driven movie; there are no unexpected developments or surprise twists here. Just as you know Luke Skywalker will defeat the Empire, just as you know George Bailey will realize how meaningful his existence is, so you also know that Lightning McQueen will ultimately learn how to stop being a dipstick and slow down. Cars is, instead, all about how you get to the end and the experiences along the way.<br/><br/>And, true to the movie's message, it takes a leisurely drive to get there; the characters have subtleties that aren't evident until you actually spend time with them, and the movie gives us ample time to do so. In many ways, it's the opposite of X-Men 3, which zipped past its story so fast that the characters are merely blurry clichés -- in Cars, the characters that seem like clichés in the commercials and trailers become fully-formed people (okay, cars ) after you've invested the time to know them. This investment pays off at the film's climax, where you care about them as individuals and end up sharing their joys as a result.<br/><br/>If there's a weakness to Cars, it's that the second act is entirely wrong for the summer movie market. In a season filled with ear-shattering explosive effects, Cars' quiet serenity stands out to trip the unwary (the trailers, filled with high-speed NASCAR races, don't help any). Instead, the movie shows itself off with understated grace; the desert plains of Cars ranks up there with the undersea reefs of Finding Nemo for breathtaking visuals. And because it's such a character-driven vehicle (sorry), the deep introspection of Cars' second act will leave impatient viewers -- and younger kids -- fidgeting in their seats. But I can't fault the film for this; I'd rather keep Cars' second act as-is than break it up with audience-pleasing slapstick or -- even worse -- cut it short in the name of expediency.<br/><br/>Cars is not Pixar's best movie ever -- that title goes with The Incredibles, which deftly blends audience-pleasing action and humor with adult-oriented themes and messages. But Cars is a worthy addition to the Pixar filmography, a leisurely byway far from the frantic summer box office superhighway. This is a movie that doesn't just talk about slowing down to appreciate the quiet things in life, but also slows itself down -- and rewards viewers with some quiet beauty of its own."

","An allegorical homage to early 1960's television<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the previews for ""Cars"" (and the cast and crew interviews on the Disney channel) which make the story look rather lame. This is a movie to see the day that it opens, experience it in the company of an enthusiastic audience of first time viewers. <br/><br/>No surprise that it is slickly written and well executed, it is a Pixar Films' production, almost a seal of approval for those who want to be sure they get something for their admissions dollar.<br/><br/>The animation is great, definitely the best they've done. Giving distinct personality and character to a normally inanimate object is nothing new but it has never been more effective. Not only do the cars communicate emotion, but the star (Lightning McQueen-a hotshot rookie race car with the voice of Owen Wilson) illustrates moments of character revelation and change better than most contemporary flesh and blood actors. They load the movie with just enough automotive insider jokes to let race fans feel privileged but not so many that other viewers feel left out.<br/><br/>Speeding cross-country to race in the big Piston Cup Championship in California Lightning McQueen gets hung up in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. <br/><br/>Much like Tod and Buz in an episode of television's ""Route 66"", the layover allows time for him to interact with the town's offbeat characters including Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past and Paul Newman's voice) and Mater (for Towmater-a rusty but trusty tow truck). Although it would have been nice to have included the voices of the original ""Route 66"" stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, there is enough here to suggest that the baby boomer demographic was one of the film's target audiences. <br/><br/>Making it the perfect film for kids to drag their grandparents to, even if it is the first movie the boomers have seen in years. Lightning eventually learns that life is about the journey, not a destination or the finish line.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"rrogers2-1","3","14","31","2 October 2006"," Cars Is Terrible
","The premise of Cars is one we've seen a million times before. Hot shot thinks he's the best. Hot shot runs into needy group of screw-ups. Hot shot comes to epiphany and gives up his superficial dream to help his lovable friends. Not that there is a problem with this premise in and of itself. These days it isn't so much what the movie is about as much as how we get there. We've all seen horror movies but Jaws made it an adventure. We've all seen war stories but Saving Private Ryan made it an experience. It is all in the ride, the ups and downs, the twists and turns (do NOT take this to mean all movies need twists (they don't (M. Night Shyamalan is a hack))). Therein lies Cars biggest flaw, the ride. All Pixar movies are gimmicky concepts to begin with but they set themselves apart in the ride. Well, all Pixar movies except Cars. I can't say for certain because I haven't been to Pixar's HQ but I imagine there is a plaque mounted on the front door that reads ""MISSION STATEMENT: Leave no object un-anthropomorphized. It's cute and the jokes are easy."" Incidentally, their only movie to focus on humans was their best, The Incredibles. But Cars follows the old formula. Instead of windshields the cars have eyes. Instead of grills a mouth. Instead of.well that's about as far as it goes. There is a half-hearted attempt to make the tires into appendages but it falls short and makes you feel like you are watching someone or something with a disability. Simply put, it does not work. The Cars inhabit a world devoid of all animal life (but plants are in full bloom?). While a noble effort it just raises plenty of questions: why do they need buildings? Who made the buildings? Who makes the cars? How do cars ""die?"" How come all of the cities are fictional and have cute car-related names except for Los Angeles? How do their politicians feel about issues concerning green house gases and exhaust fumes? Instead of using this opportunity to make some funny and insightful jokes the film seems to shrug carelessly and say ""well it's just like our world only instead of people they're cars!"" Sorry but it is boring to watch cars driving for two hours (NASCAR). Why did anyone think this was a good idea? How long would people sit along side the highway before deciding that they have had enough of watching cars drive by? My guess would be a hell of a lot less than two hours. This movie seems designed for a niche audience. And who knows, maybe I would have liked it a lot more if I were a gearhead. But I feel like I got most of the jokes. Like the car named Luigi (Tony Shaloub), complete with Italian accent and bravado, likes Ferraris, and the Mack truck is named Mack (John Ratzenberger). But suggesting that these jokes would be funny even to gearheads is more insulting than calling them, well, gearheads. Lame. Lame. Lame. Cars go to a diner to eat food. That's crazy. The cars go to a diner to get gas! You know, because gas is like food for cars. Or the flies are really VW Bugs. Get it? Flies. Bugs. Yes, I get it. And it doesn't end there. Cameos galore! Jay Limo is the late night host while Bob Cutlass and Darrell Cartrip are the sports commentators. Not to mention all of the hilarity that ensues in car crashes. I don't know if that's just me but I was sort of put off by the movie's carefree use of multiple car pile-ups. The problems of this film are too many to count and frankly, it is boring me trying to remember them all. Bottom line is that anything that made the old Pixar pics enjoyable is completely lacking here. All jokes are as predictable as the sunrise. The characters are as exciting as 2nd grade sketches. And most importantly there is no worthwhile reflection of our society whatsoever. As a punishment the hero of the film, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), has to pave a road. Sounds like punishment to me, so don't make me watch it for a majority of the movie."
"LadyLiberty","3","13","29","11 June 2006"," Cars a Distant Second to Previous Pixar Releases
","The general story told by Cars is a simple one  as is to be expected from a movie aimed squarely at the elementary-school set: Race car Lightning McQueen (capably voiced by Owen Wilson) is fast, but not too nice. You see, he knows how good he is, and he rarely misses an opportunity to brag. Lightning is in a three-way tie for this year's coveted Piston Cup, and he's determined to be the first rookie car to take the trophy. All that stands in his way are his two chief competitors.<br/><br/>Veteran racer ""The King"" (surprisingly well voiced by retired NASCAR champion Richard Petty) is running his last race before retirement. Not only his crown but his lucrative endorsement contract will go to the next top racer. Meanwhile, the experienced Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) will do anything to win, including some questionable moves on the track. Though Lightning has a very real chance to win, his hubris costs him and the three finish the big race in a photo finish tie. That, in turn, results in an unprecedented ""race off"" to take place in California the following week.<br/><br/>Lightning, who has just alienated yet another pit crew, climbs aboard his transport vehicle for the trip to the west coast. Mac (John Ratzenberger) actually doesn't seem to mind his passenger's attitude. But if Lightning notices at all, he's much too busy making demands to do much else. Though Mac is concerned he's too tired to make it to California in one night, he does his level best to comply with the orders. Unfortunately, Mac is right, Lightning is wrong, and a mishap on the road finds the two separated and Lightning on his own in an out of the way small town.<br/><br/>Lightning is more than a little taken aback when the few denizens who remain living in the community don't know who he is. He's even more disturbed to discover how little they care. Doc Hudson (brilliantly brought to curmudgeonly life by Paul Newman) isn't inclined to put up with Lightning's antics or his attitude and would just as soon see the race car leave town as quickly as possible. But local innkeeper Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) determines that Lightning isn't going to take advantage of her or her friends and that he, in fact, owes them a little something.<br/><br/>During his sojourn in Radiator Springs, Lightning meets other colorful characters including a rust bucket tow truck named Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, who is perfectly cast); low rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and his 1950's floozy, Flo (Jennifer Lewis); a rigidly upright Jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley); a psychedelic van (George Carlin); and an Italian tire dealer named Luigi (Tony Shaloub) who works with a sidekick named Guido (Guido Quaroni).<br/><br/>Between run-ins with the law and nighttime shenanigans, Lightning finally gets the chance to learn that there's more to life than winning races. He sees that actions have consequences, and that others have feelings. But will the lessons sink in? And if they do, what does that mean to his pursuit of the Piston Cup? Cars is another film from Pixar Studios, so you can safely bet that the animation is superb. Although cars don't lend themselves to as much human-like expressiveness as do toys (Toy Story and Toy Story 2) or fish (Finding Nemo), the quality of the voice work does make up for some of that lack. The chrome and other metal finishes depicted are just terrific (as a graphic designer and artist, I know just how difficult it is to get a natural looking sheen on objects!), and the background scenery is nothing less than stunning in the main while the animation itself is smooth as silk.<br/><br/>The real problem for me was a script that just wasn't funny. The relative simplicity and predictability was forgivable  again, look at the age and sophistication of the target audience  but the almost total lack of humor was not. There were plenty of kids in the showing I attended, and I didn't hear a single giggle out of any of them (on the plus side, I also didn't hear much else out of them, and over the course of a two hour movie that's actually pretty good). In fact, the only part of the entire film I personally found amusing was the little surprise appended to the end of the credits (if you do go to see Cars, be sure to stick around for that).<br/><br/>Superlative graphics and excellent voice work just aren't enough to take Cars and raise it to the level of some of the better animated films released previously. Earlier efforts also made good use of computers but didn't rely on them to take the place of a good script. That's where Cars finishes an unfortunate  and distant  second.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: There's one point made in Cars that will be all but entirely lost on the children who see it. Their parents, however, will find themselves almost literally beaten over the head with the overwhelmingly blunt commentary made mid-movie which concerns the building of interstate highways. The only real surprise to me is that nobody took what seems a tailor-made opportunity to talk alternative fuels and hybrid engines.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Cars is rated G. I certainly saw nothing unsuitable for even the youngest family members. I do, however, think that the script uses enough big words and marginally complicated concepts that the littlest ones will be confused or even bored by the on screen action. Cars is most likely fine for those children of age six or so and up, though the older they get the less I suspect they'll like it."

","Steve Jobs, we're gonna miss you in the movie creation business.<br/><br/>Of all the things that Jobs is credited with, the one that matters in the creative process is the notion of parallel metrics. In the computer business, he'd (with much advice) draw up a set of traits for a product and then independently seek excellence according to each list. It sounds obvious but this isn't the way it is normally done; usually you have one trait you sell and you attach others done well enough to not ruin the mix. So in computers, consumer electronics and films.<br/><br/>Ah, in films. Within the first few minutes of a film, you can pinpoint the one thing the filmmaker is trying to do, the one value around which everything else is assembled, often with just passable competence. Pixar is different. They have several lists, several things that need to be as perfect as possible.<br/><br/>So its an odd thing, reading reviews of Pixar projects. The movie press is set up to address one value per film, and we as readers of this material have come to limit the way we actually see. And not just in the theater, but in elements of life as well. So thanks, Steve, for adding some dimension to the mix.<br/><br/>I don't write reviews, only comments, so I don't feel obliged to run down each of the Pixar lists. Do it yourself, recognizing the obvious: story and character of course, nesting in values, rhythm, dialog and how it settles in the music and all that. Ordinary stuff.<br/><br/>I focus on space and what I call folding. ""Folding"" is the engineering of how the viewer is placed in the narrative and often it is a matter of careful engineering. The folding here is how two movie genres are mixed: one is the spectator sport where the spectators (with us included) are explicit. What the ""people"" in the stands value is what we do, the excitement, the sportsmanship. The other movie is the one about city visitor to hick town and each changes the other. Its a rewarding enough formula, which I like best in the Swayze/Newmar ""Wong Foo"" version.<br/><br/>So the folding, while expert and lucid is a bit obvious.<br/><br/>Its the use of space that blows me away in these things. How the dimensions are exploited. I've heard Lasseter talk about this. The thing that modern animation gives us is not that we can have talking cars, that's about 85 years old now. It is that once you design a scene, the camera can be anywhere and move in any manner.<br/><br/>Pixar has a group that concerns itself with the visual excitement of such things. Its both a matter of excellence and novelty but the novelty cannot be too extreme or we reject the thing. Look at the shorts Pixar presents, in particular the one coupled with ""Cars,"" ""One Man Band,"" to see experiments in spatial adventure.<br/><br/>Prior projects have been designed in some ways to exploit this dimensionality, especially ""Nemo"" which doesn't have a surface, a horizon or much gravity. When you do these things, you can exploit space in only a few ways. You can use architecture, a technique that is challenging, rare and uniquely rewarding. You can have the action be the center of the dance. Or you can center the dance on the camera. Its the latter that is done here.<br/><br/>You should watch it just for that, just for the way your mind's eye can be stretched. The group responsible for this list, these values did well, better than anyone else in animation for sure. Steve, we're gonna miss you.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Absolutely wonderful animated feature that is arguably the finest of its type. In a world of human-like automobiles, one is at the threshold of super-stardom via his amazing racing skills. However he is brash, selfish and ignorant of others around him. It takes a crazed twist of fate to forever change him as he gets stuck in a small town just off the interstate and is forced to repair a street after unwittingly tearing it up. There he learns that sometimes the best thing to do is to slow down and enjoy the show that is life as he meets others who have been demoralized due to technologies and innovations that have all but killed their sleepy little community. ""Cars"" is a deep-thinking analytical glimpse into the losses that many have experienced due to gains by the world. Small-town values of love, friendship, sacrifice, caring for others and putting the well-being of a group above the well-being of one's self are the major elements found within. There are life lessons here aplenty that are not only valid for the youngest of age groups, but also for the most bitter and disenchanted of adults. Amazingly dominant due to its animation, its great voice characterizations (led most notably by Owen Wilson and Paul Newman) and most importantly its second-to-none script. 5 stars out of 5."

","I saw a sneak preview of this film last night, which played to a packed auditorium in an area theatre, comprised of an audience who won tickets from various media outlets. I must say that I was completely impressed with this latest Pixar outing and I almost dare say it was among the best animated features I have ever seen. It is almost hard to say ""animated"", because it looks like the bar for computer animation has been risen yet again by Pixar. There was the well-animated details of the cars, with great expression and fluidity, and the backgrounds and scenery was just jaw-dropping and nearly seemed photo-realistic.<br/><br/>The movie is incredible on so many levels. It is easy to forget that the cars are just cars, and you begin to relate to them on a people-like level. They are made to have easily identifiable facial expressions, which are animated well.<br/><br/>Going into the movie, I thought that it would focus too much on racing, since NASCAR related stuff seems to be all the rage now. But, the back story of learning to do things like not taking bad shortcuts with life and not being so selfish and inconsiderate, really takes the fore in this film. We could all learn from these ""car-acters"".<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film, no matter if you're into racing or wouldn't even know what a ""bump draft"" is.<br/><br/>And, of course... remember to stay until the very very end of the movie, otherwise, you'll miss some cool stuff."

"hitchcockthelegend","7","4","7","6 May 2011"," Vroom Vroom for Pixar's blend of excitement, nostalgia and friendship.
","As pretty much noted by everyone who has seen it, Cars is visually stunning but unable to live up to the narrative standards set by previous Pixar big hitters. But mid tier Pixar is still better than most other animation offerings from other stables. Plot simply finds arrogant race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) about to hit super star status, only to suffer a highway crash that leaves him stranded in a ghost town called Radiator Springs. A once thriving town, Radiator Springs is now only home to the loyal locals and very much a product of an era long since gone. Forced to stay due to community service, Lightning is desperate to leave the place he calls ""Hillbilly Hell"", but as he comes to know the people of the town he comes to find a new perspective on things.<br/><br/>Cars is made up of three segments, the beginning where we are introduced to Lightning and the other cars involved in the race circuit, the action rip-roaring and setting up the film nicely. The middle section in Radiator Springs where it becomes a coming of age-life lesson-friendships formed-piece. And the final section as we get back out on the track for more wonderful racing and the character development reaches the winning line. It's the middle (bulky) section that many have problems with, and not just the children anxiously awaiting more athletic car shenanigans, the adults too have found this something of a chore to get thru. I liked it, felt it was a nice move from Pixar to get ""Shawshank"" like with the characters, a nostalgia nod to yesteryear and we get to spend time in the company of Doc Hudson, voiced poignantly by legend Paul Newman.<br/><br/>How you find that middle section may determine how much you enjoy Cars, but rest assured that even if you find it too talky, too slow, what bookends it is pretty darn great anyway. And of course the visual treats available on every inch of the screen make it a winner as well. 7.5/10"

","""Cars"" is the right movie to watch whenever one feels the need for speed. I'm not really into CGI films, but at least this one is much better than other CGI productions. It's fun to watch. Unlike most CGI films with annoying humor, weird and awfully designed characters and often weak visuals, this one has brilliant graphics, funny and clever humor and some great visuals.<br/><br/>A very creative, imaginative, original, funny and interesting detail is that the eyes of this film's anthropomorphic cars are placed on the windshield. Plus, the cars have mouth and teeth.<br/><br/>This is Pixar's greatest achievement. Pixar has never done anything like this before or after.<br/><br/>The way how the story is made is funny and entertaining. Many hilarious quotes can be found in this movie, especially from Lightning McQueen and Mater. Mater's jokes combined with Lightning McQueen's sarcastic humor results in a real scream and a full plate.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is hilarious: overconfident, arrogant, talkative, sarcastic and snobbish. He is also selfish, especially towards his pit crew. But I like this rookie race car exactly like that. After becoming kind, he's not as funny. Also, I like his original race car look better than the changes he makes later in Radiator Springs, which make him look much more conservative, something like a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette. But, focusing only on his race car appearance, he seems to be a mix of a Dodge Viper, a Ford GT40, a Lamborghini Miura, a Ferrari 250 GTO and a Mazda RX-8.<br/><br/>His name seems to be a reference to Steve McQueen, who was a fan of cars and speed. Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen's voice. Others do great voice jobs as well, especially Larry The Cable Guy as Mater and Paul Newman as Doc Hudson.<br/><br/>Other cars include Doc Hudson (a Hudson Hornet of the original model - to be more specific, the Fabulous Hudson Hornet), Mater (a rusty old wreck), The King (a Plymouth Superbird), Luigi (a Fiat 500), Guido (a forklift which resembles an Isetta), Lizzie (an ancient Ford Model T) and Mack (a humorous Mack Super-Liner lorry). All of them are great characters and even Bessie is... if that counts, LOL. Mater is like ""Tow Mater"" but without the ""Tow"".<br/><br/>Chick Hicks is the only character I don't like and even hate. He is vindictive, obnoxious and nasty. He is very greedy and actually way more selfish than Lightning McQueen. Although Lightning McQueen is what he is, at least he never rams any car and he'd never do that, unlike Chick Hicks who purposely rams all the cars in his way and causes them terrible accidents (including The King). He hates both The King and Lightning McQueen and yet copies Lightning McQueen's jokes.<br/><br/>When it comes to visuals, they can be easily described as real-looking, fresh and modern but done with high standards of quality comparing to most many terrible CGI creations. Visually, the best part is the beginning: the electrifying and powerful noise of the racing cars's engines, the cars running in a big track and amazing race, the fabulous and realistic sceneries (with sparkling lights and entire crowds of cars watching), great music...<br/><br/>The soundtrack is not brilliant but the opening song is pretty cool, as well as the song ""Life is a highway""."

There is nothing in the movie that would be mature in nature. It just seemed the plot was made more for adults than kids. The grandkids lost interest with it about half way through. It was well done technically but the kids didn't understand things like the drug references by Carlin's character. All in all as an adult it was an entertaining movie worth watching. It's just not really for the younger children. That is why I believe it is so important to try out the movies buy renting them first, before buying them for your library or as gifts."

","Over the decade all full-length Pixar's animated flicks kept incredibly high level and provided wise entertainment for the whole family. In addition, no other studio gained such an acceptance not only from viewers, but also from critics. Alike in case of previous Pixar's movies, I also had a big expectations with regard to ""Cars"". It turned out that ""Cars""is the least enjoyable of all Pixar's productions. The animation is as always breathtaking. The film is obviously visually stunning and a great number of scenes is beautiful. The idea of humanized talking cars was awe-inspiring and provided a room to display screenwriters' talent. However, they missed a chance to make other instant classic. The plot is rather typical and painfully predictable with an obvious message known from the very beginning. What's more, the script is not abound with wonderful ideas (I found only allusion to Road 66 interesting) and humorous situations, which was a trademark of previous Pixar's films. The emphasis is rightly placed on likable characters humanized by the excellent voice cast. Although not so great as ""Monsters, Inc"" or ""The Incredibles"", this flick is still worth seeing."

I couldn't be less interested in Nascar racing, but what it matters is the story, right? So, let's see what we have here: a cocky young boy that only cares about himself, ready to learn a life lesson from the experienced but troubled old man. And then characters: It looks like they just grab one from each category and mix them up with the blender. We have the silly, the shy, the old lady, the ""couple of Italians"", the soldier, the cheater, you name it, it's there Some might see this as an amazing creativity, but to me it's only lucking so much of story that they're just adding whatever character, having saying the line that corresponds to that profile, and they're happy with it. My favorite one is in the old town, each time something happens, the camera pans from side to side so each character say whatever comment suits the profile. It gets extremely boring and predictable after the first run Then again, the casting. How could the story be any different if Owen Wilson is playing the young guy, and Paul Newman the old guy. Haven't we seen them a million times playing the exact same roles? Please. I normally don't enjoy waiting until the end titles to see something new. And what's up with the names? Toys, Bugs, Monsters, Cars? Maybe if they weren't so obsessed in making sure their movies can sell all type of merchandising they could focus in writing a better story. Not that they shouldn't try to make money, but I definitely prefer when they have a great movie to justify all. Pixar to me is all about innovation, creativity and imagination, just not this time. I should have left after One Man's Band short, which is a perfect example of what they know how to do. My guess for the next title: ""Socks!"""

As with all things animated, Cars works best when the action speaks for itself, when the animation suspends character interaction in favor of broad and breathtaking observational sweeps, via the American highway, poignantly harking back to days of old in completely new family-friendly gestures. While the humbling of hot-rod hot-shot Lightning Mcqueen (Wilson in one of his most convincing roles) and subsequent homage to mid west America may not have been pieced together in the most convincing of manners, Cars will still sweep excited children into it's blazing introduction, mellow out with it's sweet and funny character interaction and race past the finish line in a blaze of feel good family entertainment from the highest, visually animated order."

","But WHY is it great?<br/><br/>1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America's Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn't realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn't made up of old car parts.<br/><br/>2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it's still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John's babies, I can't wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.<br/><br/>3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America's heartland with dolts, ""we don't like outsiders"" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It's funny how the gravel in Newman's voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson's distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.<br/><br/>4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race."

","A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets waylaid in Radiator Springs on his way to California. He's a brash self-obsessed car mired in a dispute in the racing world. But when he damages the road and is sentenced to repair it, he must slow down, work hard, and find what's truly important in life.<br/><br/>Pixar creates another fun franchise. This time the cars are humanized. Like Toy Story, it's always about the characters. It's a great family movie. It has fun but it's also a message movie. The breakout character of this movie must be Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old rusty tow truck. He's definitely the comic relief."

","CARS is another fantastic creation by Pixar, but guess what it has risen above all.I bet, its the best movie of Pixar.<br/><br/>The plot is :Up-and-coming rookie race car Lightning McQueen , is about to win the prestigious Piston Cup. The championship ends with Lightning finishing in a tie with legendary ""The King"" , who is in his final race, and Chick Hicks ; thus, a tie-breaking race is set in California.<br/><br/>But a road mishap leads Lightning to the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, a part of what was once Route 66, a place that once basked in glory, but has since been thrust into oblivion. There he meets an array of other cars - including Doc Hudson , Mater, and Sally - who teach him that ""life isn't about the destination but about the journey. <br/><br/>Firstly, the animation is awesome. It's truly an amazing 3D ride.Shortly into the movie you forget that the people are cars or the cars are people, you suspend disbelief, and you just begin to watch an engaging story about real people.The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions.The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering. The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Every single character in the movie is just amazingly made.The story is really nice and it serves much lessons about the value of friends and family. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Cars"" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside.This is movie is worth all of your time and money.It is extremely recommended movie."

","There is a moment in Jurassic Park where I simply stopped thinking, ""Hey, how did they do that?"" and was enveloped in the story. It happened three quarters of the way through the movie, but I am not being critical of Spielberg or JP.<br/><br/>The point of this is that I was enveloped in the story of Disney/Pixar's Cars from the moment it started. The artistic and character animation is simply so good that Cars is a comedy and not an animated comedy.<br/><br/>The artistry, the color, the sound, and the performances are impeccable and I can't think of even a nit to pick about the film. It is that good.<br/><br/>I usually prattle on at this point about where I was when I saw it or what I would have done differently, but I'm not that much of an idiot!<br/><br/>Cars is brilliant."

"fwomp","9","1","1","20 November 2006"," Another Animation Success
","Pixar has proved its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.<br/><br/>But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by hearkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.<br/><br/>The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.<br/><br/>Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.<br/><br/>That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout."

But we see later that McQueen is really cold and harsh compared to the humble residents of Radiator Springs, the small town where he crash lands. But will Lightning ever find his way back? Will he be doomed to lose to the cheating Chick Hicks? Watch it!

I've been watching movies since 1960. This is hands down THE best movie I've ever seen. The only advice I have for you is to pay attention to peripheral things, not just the main action. You will be astonished. They didn't miss a trick. If there truly are infinite universes, you can just imagine a universe where these creatures actually exist.

","Throughout ""Cars"", the scenery (including deserts, mountains, trees, and waterfalls) looks so realistic you'd swear the cars were digitally inserted into film footage! The overhead shot of the Los Angeles raceway and the scenes of thousands of cars in the bleachers are the most elaborate scenes that Pixar has ever done. The ""starring"" cars themselves are as anthropomorphic as Pixar could make them, a vast improvement over Disney's old cartoon,""Suzie, The Little Blue Coupe."" Each car has a distinct personality. The best are Tow Mater, the tow truck, and Fillmore, the 1960s Volkswagen bus who, if he were human, would be referred to as an ""old hippie."" Lots of clever car-related gags too. And the closing credits, where the cars are watching movies at the drive-in, are the best part of the film!"

","This is more properly ""Trivia"" but I didn't see any way to submit a trivia item, so here goes: While almost all the landscapes in the movie look extremely realistic, there are a couple of scenes depicting these giant, very peculiar looking sandstone rock formations. They look peculiar because they're modeled on the rear ends of the Cadillacs that are half-buried, nose-first, into the ground at the ""Cadillac Ranch"" in Texas. As to my ""review,"" well, the wife had to drag me to this movie kicking and screaming as I've become very tired of computer animated cartoons. I'm glad as heck she DID however because it was EXCELLENT! I was impressed by the story, which contained real lessons about what and WHO should be important in ones life. On a technical note, the visual and SOUND depiction of the racing sequences was nothing short of INCREDIBLE! I completely forgot that nothing I was watching was real. Disney/Pixar have another winner."

","CARS is Disney/Pixar's latest animated feature, about a race car that learns a hard lesson about life and love from a bunch of automobiles living in a forgotten desert town. Five minutes into the film, and you forget you're watching a bunch of motor vehicles; each has its own very distinct personality. The film is gorgeously drawn and animated, wonderfully voiced by Owen Wilson as the race car, Paul Newman as an old-timer with a secret, and several others, and the antics of the characters are hysterical. CARS provides one laugh after another, with a series of nonstop gags and one-liners leading up to a thrilling finish. Make sure you hang around for and after the credits for some terrific throwaway gags and ""outtakes,"" the funniest one involving John Ratzenberger's character reacting to a rather peculiar situation at the local drive-in. Highly recommended. The film is preceded by a new Pixar short involving competing musical clowns. They have to be seen to be believed."
"sethgecko61","10","1","1","10 June 2006"," Great Fun!!!
","My daughter loved it and so did I!!! The animation was out of this world. It thrilled the kids as well as the adults. It did not have the usual feel of a kids movie. It blurred the lines between animation and a non-animation film while at the same time retaining the Disney/Pixar feel of a great kids movie (i.e. Toy Story and The Incredibles). I would recommend this to all parents, you'll love it as much as the kids. Owen Wilson and Paul Newman are great in their respective roles. Wilson shines as the arrogant young race car and Newman delivers his usual A-One performance as the wise old car. However it is stand-up icon Larry the Cable Guy who steals the show as the less than brilliant but all too lovable Mater the Tow Truck."

Larry the Cable Guy was a great choice for the character Mater. I really enjoyed all the car themed scenery around the falls, and it took a bit, but I realized that all the hills and rocks were formed like the backs of old cars. Doc Hudson, the famous Hudson Hornet was a great full circle. He was hiding from his past until his past catches up with him. I really liked how Lightining McQueen does realize what he is missing in his life and how all his friends in Radiator Springs help him in his big race, and the Famous Hudson Hornet makes a come back.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie, it is funny for all ages, I was laughing so hard, my eyes were watering.

I'm tired of reading those reviews by film snobs who aren't looking at this film with a balanced mind.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is trying to win the Piston Cup and learns a few life lessons along the way. Great material to teach the children who watch this film how to become more sportsmanlike. Other than that, this movie satisfies the most detail oriented car buffs to heavenly bliss. All of the things you can notice about cars and America's fascination with all things automotive is basically covered in this film. Animating it all just gives it an additional cute factor.<br/><br/>If you see cars as more than vehicles to get around, then please watch this movie."

What would of been even more funny would of been John Ratzenberger voiced a mail car or truck. I'm sure their are allot of hidden references to Toy Story in this movie like every other movie. Other actors who would be great to poke fun at them selves would be Tim Allen as a Tool Truck with Binford on the side.

"PyroPlasmX","9","1","1","8 June 2006"," Another great one from Pixar
","I just saw this movie at a free preview screening and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The movie had plenty of really good laughs and some good warmhearted moments. Pixar has show that they would rather put out a couple really good movies over a few years then 10 half-decent movies a year.<br/><br/>One of the things you'll notice first about this movie is there are no humans whatsoever. You have to suspend your belief for a bit as you enter a world where everything from cars to blimps and helicopters are alive. But the filmmakers do such a good job enveloping you in that world that you don't even notice.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the movie is the little touches. Like the fact that the little bugs flying around are actually tiny little Volkswagen Beetles. The detail on the cars themselves isn't up to the standards of something like The Incredibles but the scenery is just gorgeous. You see these beautiful landscapes that just seem so real and seem to go on for miles. But thankfully the cars blend in well with everything else and don't look out of place.<br/><br/>All of the voice acting in the movie was superb. Owen Wilson does a great job in his first voice acting job. I think this really says something because he has a huge amount of dialog in the movie. When it comes to the voices there wasn't one that stole the show like Ellen in Finding Nemo but Larry the Cable Guy did a fantastic job as Mater. He has some of the funniest lines in the movie and they also managed to work in all of his catchphrases. I would also like to add that the casting of Cheech Marin as a low rider and George Carlin as a hippie Volkswagen Microbus are perfect.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone that has children and anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous Pixar movies. Also if you are a bit of a car nut like me you'll enjoy it just to see the personalities of each of the cars. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and it ranks up there with the best Pixar has done to date."

"timecarter","9","1","1","8 June 2006"," Pixar strikes again!
","As far as CGI animation is concerned, the folks at Pixar remain king. While not quite as enchanting as their previous film ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" still delivers on all cylinders. It's a visual stunning and extremely funny adventure through the heart of Route 66.<br/><br/>Pixar films are unrivaled when it comes to creating realities that are alternate to our own world. Like the toys in ""Toy Story"" and the monsters in ""Monsters Inc."" the cars of ""Cars"" seem so human that you forget that they are... well.... just cars.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is simple. A cocky rookie race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) get's caught up in a quest for the racing world's coveted ""Piston Cup."" While traveling to the cup's championship race McQueen get's detoured to a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs. Once at Radiator Springs McQueen has to do a small service to the community before he can leave and participate in the ""Piston Cup's"" finale.<br/><br/>Along the way McQueen meets up with a lovable cast of a unique characters. Most notably are Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the rusty redneck truck, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) the 1950's hornet, Filmore (George Carlin) the stoner van, and Guido (who will no doubt be a fan favorite) the fork lift.<br/><br/>For some the movie may drag a little in the mid-section. However, its the little touches that Pixar throws in that keep the film engaging and funny. The cars eat at gas station diners and sleep in garage motels. In probably the films most memorable scene Mater and McQueen do a small town right of passage with a hilarious twist. And it's this ability to create alternate universes while giving these ""objects"" human characteristics that make Pixar films so memorable.<br/><br/>Fan's of CGI films may rejoice. Car's is an intriguing story with excellent animation and humor for both adults and kids alike. Definitely worthy of a nice family trip to the movie theater.<br/><br/>9/10"

At times I couldn't control myself and burst out laughing aloud. I think it loosened up some of the other adults in the cinema and they started laughing as well.<br/><br/>The graphics were awesome. The amount of details such as reflections in each scene, etc was amazing. I need to own this movie. If only they were taking advanced orders for the DVD already.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie is about Lightning McQueen's awakening from being a selfish, arrogant person/ car to one who realises the value of friendship. A truly feel-good movie for the whole family.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me in regards to my son was the one part where there was name calling - the part where someone referred to McQueen as a moron/ retard (can't remember). I just didn't want my son picking that up and referring to other kids in that way. But that was very slight. One word, two seconds. The rest of the movie was amazing. For the first time my son sat still for a whole two hours!! Well done, Pixar. An amazing movie that I want to own already. I hope they make a sequel and put as much effort into the story and character development as they did in this one.<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favour and see this for yourselves and if you have kids, take them along. It's not just a boy movie. Being a cartoon and not overly macho all kids should enjoy it."

I especially liked some of the big scenes that need to be seen in a theatre to do them justice. And it goes without saying that the animation is superb. Watch out for the history of Pixar films that weave their way in here and there... very cool. All-in-all a worthy feature with a feature length (2 hours) - Got my money's worth on this one.

Beautifully animated. Some of the scenes were downright breathtaking. <br/><br/>The only thing I found wrong with the movie were the sudden and extreme volume changes between scenes.

Cars, and motor sports specifically, are at the heart of what's really wrong with America. This movie is aimed at and celebrates brain-dead automotive consumers who are are oblivious to the real world around them. Why not just make a children's movie called ""Smokes""?

","Cars screeches off the starting grid with an action packed race sequence but loses control pretty quickly afterwards, ending up as a saccharine-sweet wreck of a film. I found Pixar's latest movie to be a charmless and rather dull effort, lacking the sharp humour evident in much of their earlier output.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is a cocky little race car looking to win his first major event, The Piston Cup, and, subsequently, receive a massive sponsorship deal. But en route to the finals, he becomes stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs, where he accidentally damages the main road. Sentenced to repair the damage he caused, Lightning spends the next few days fixing the road but, as he gets to know the lovable inhabitants of the sleepy town, he learns that there is much more to life than winning races.<br/><br/>Far too long, with a painfully slow second act, Cars needed a lot more laughs and a bit more action in order to succeed. With perhaps only a couple of decent jokes during its excruciatingly long 121 minute running time, this movie would have benefited from a major script overhaul, or alternatively, perhaps it would have been better off being scrapped entirely."

It is nothing special to tell You the truth, just the typical child's film that Your Son will outgrow by the age of about 11. The plot line is pretty stiff to say the least, the characters aren't really much and leave a lot to be desired. Most of the Characters are one-dimensional or so boring that You will want to get up and leave the theater.

","It should be no surprise to those who know me(including some on the internet who've never met me) that I'd see this movie. 1)I'm a certifiable car freak. 2)I've had a long-standing interest in animation. 3)This is officially the last Disney/Pixar collaboration. Disney now OWNS Pixar. 4)This may be the last Paul Newman movie, and even if you're not a big Paul Newman fan, any film buff should understand the merit of that.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson), who surprisingly was not named after Steve McQueen, is a cocky as hell hotshot rookie NASCAR racer who thinks he's so good, he doesn't even listen to his pit crew when they insist he should get his tires replaced. He has a huge ego, some loyal groupies, a sponsor he doesn't believe in, an agent who talks to him on a videophone from his trailer, and an eye on the finish line. Luckily he gets that along with his two rivals, the aging King(voiced by real life NASCAR racer Richard Petty), a 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird, and Chick Hicks(Michael Keaton) a Mid-1980's Buick GNX, who loves to push other cars around on the track. This means a tie-breaker race has to take place, and so it's on to California. His only friend at this point is his transporter Mack(John Ratzenberger), a Super Liner who hauls him to every race in the Piston Cup Series(They're obviously not going to use a real-life tobacco company for a kids' movie), but even Lightning won't let him rest when he needs it. When Mack falls asleep on the way to L.A., and is startled by a gang of street rods in the middle of the night, Lightning falls out of the trailer and gets lost. Lacking real headlights, he tries to get back on the interstate, and gets tangled in some telephone wires in a town called Radiator Springs, and wrecks their main road -- the famous U.S. Route 66. Radiator Springs was founded by a Stanley Steamer, and the statue erected in his honor is among the casualties. The town sentences him to community service, forcing him to repair the road by towing some old paving equipment. While there, McQueen is arrested by the Sheriff(author and cultural guru Michael Wallis), a 1949 Mercury, impounded by Mater(Larry the Cable Guy), a Chevy 3800 Tow Truck, prosecuted by Sally Carerra(Bonnie Hunt) a cute Porsche 911 who also owns the Cozy Cone Motel, and judged by Doc(Paul Newman), a 1951 Hudson Hornet. While there he starts to fall for the very girl who prosecuted him. During this time she takes the opportunity to show him the world around the town. She also gives him an education about the history of Radiator Springs, and he finds out something very interesting about Judge Doc Hudson. What happened to the fictional town of ""Radiator Springs"" is what happened to many of the towns that ran along the former US 66 in real life. The Interstate Highway System passed them by, specifically I-40, I-44, and I-55, and the towns went bust. Although, truth be told, an interest in the former Mother Road by nostalgia buffs and roadgeeks such as myself, has lead to an increase in tourism to these areas. To be fair, I think the federal government wanted the Interstates to benefit these towns too. So even after this movie, you still won't catch me shouting ""Damn the Interstate."" In fact, I'd love to see a couple of them built across Long Island Sound(I-287 & I-495), along with some other highways.<br/><br/>What makes this so good isn't the fact that it has motor vehicles as characters. Those kinds of cartoons were around before they ran cartoons on television. It's that the movie actually has good background scenes, especially the road scenes, whether it's on Route 66 or the Interstate on the way to California. Even the ""natural"" scenes are cool, some of which are rock formations shaped like cars of the 1930's and others are modeled after the famous Cadillac Ranch. I also like how the Los Angeles Memorial Colesium was converted into the ""Los Angeles International Speedway."" To be honest, I was looking for a different ending with similar results. But ""Doc Hollywood"" rip-off or not, it's still an enjoyable movie, even if ""The Incredibles"" was better."

","A road racing good time for adults and kids alike. Well-defined and appealing characters, a number of sight gags and one-liner jokes, an easy plot to follow, several well integrated back-stories, and more are coordinated for a fast and fun ride. When the characters reach the finish line, the story has emphasized the importance of friendship, trust, loyalty, responsibility, and kindness.<br/><br/>Wild, brash, reckless, and self-focused race car Lightning McQueen is en route to a three-way racing duel to determine a racing champion. Along the way, however, fate steps in to divert him to a bypassed and forgotten town along the old route 66. McQueen's new friends in this town bring him revelations about what kinds of things are really important and valuable; and his resulting metamorphosis serves as the impetus for a very upbeat finale.<br/><br/>Since the Pixar folks have created a universe populated only by cars (humans do not exist at all in this universe--unlike other Pixar films), most of the jokes will follow an automobile-reference theme. These and other cultural in-jokes are numerous in the movie and will go way over a kid's head. Still, families should be able to enjoy this movie together, as there's enough silly slapstick and goofy humor at a kid's level to keep them involved; mostly provided by the cleverly written supporting ""comic relief"" characters. Look closely at the flies buzzing around for one of the movie's best sight gags.<br/><br/>Good natured entertainment with heart that conveys a nice message. Highly recommended for adults and children alike. Be sure to hang around as the credits roll, as an epilogue provides a few additional gags, and ties up loose ends from various sub-plots."
"poguemahon","8","3","6","15 June 2006"," Well oiled ""Cars""
","It has been said that animators, good ones anyway, should be revered as the masters of story development. They approach the process of storytelling with endless sessions of brainstorming and storyboarding. ""Cars"" originally slated for release a year ago, was taken back to the storyboard at Pixar's demand, at a time when Disney and the digital animation studio were looking to part ways. Now that the two have more than adequately made amends, it is reassuring to know that Pixar (never having compromised, not even to the mouse that roared) has once again rolled another fine edition off the assembly line.<br/><br/>The film's opening is not as easy to surrender to. Race cars have limited appeal to people but at some point you become hooked. Days later you might find yourself dumbfounded when, after telling a friend about the film, you marvel at how you cried in a movie that has talking cars! The one thing that's consistently great about Pixar movies is that they're always filled with a lot of joy and love and not in an embarrassing or overwrought way either.<br/><br/>Make sure you get to the theatre on time. ""One Man Band,"" last years Oscar nominated short comes just before ""Cars,"" and will prime you for the atmosphere of next summer's Pixar film, ""Ratatouille,"" to which you get to see the trailer as well!"

","I've been a fan of Pixar for most of their releases. From the charming ""Finding Nemo"", a film that proved that it is possible to have a heart in the middle of the newest technology, to the well-orchestrated action in ""The Incredibles"", and the pathos in both ""Toy Story I"" and ""Toy Story II"". It was possible to believe that screen writing still mattered in this institution, and then we have a major crash in ""Cars"", a film that stands out because it is derivative, unimaginative, and possibly one of the most boring of its generation.<br/><br/>There is still plenty of talent around the film, with both Owen Wilson and Paul Newman doing good work. Yet the color scheme is pretty dull, and the dialogue never sparkles. In fact, it feels contrived and annoying most of the time. It is an insult to those of us who are paying good money to be ""entertained"". During the screening I attended many children kept asking to go to the bathroom or were asking too many questions. This being a sure sign that the screen did less than hold their interest.<br/><br/>There is another big fault with the film, and it is the design of its characters. They all have the same blank look, wit none of the emotions one did find in the previous Pixar animated films, plus it was very hard to believe that those cars in the movie really had the ability to be anything else but boring cars. They looked and behaved like cars.<br/><br/>It is time that Pixar looks back at itself and keeps itself from falling into the same trap that most studios are finding themselves in: Let's concentrate on doing intelligent work and develop those ideas beyond the board room and the sales pitch. Audiences are bound to wake up, and it is not a good time to make these expensive faulty guesses."

As it was, we found this effort a total let-down. The plot is tired and loaded with hackneyed sentimentality. You could see where it was going almost before it got under way. The characters were little more than one-dimensional clichés and the dialogue was so lazy, it seemed to have been written by robots. There was just one redeeming gag that made me laugh out loud, a Shakespearean allusion that would have been over the heads of all the kids in the audience, and probably would have been wasted on most of the adults! What on earth has happened to the all-round brilliant Pixar of Bug's Life, Toy Story and Finding Nemo?

The race cars are the shinny paint of this movie, but the plot is just a rusty chassis at best. Lots of fart jokes, and a few one liners, no adult humor, all basic burping, farting jokes.

Lighting is cocky and egotistical, but the crowd loves him and he's happy for the attention. The race ends, but on a three way tie between Lighting, Chick Hicks and defending champion The King. For the decider, another race is held in California between the three cars for the championship. On the way to California, Lighting gets lost on the old highway Route 66. While trying to find the interstate, Lighting is impounded in the small town of Radiator Springs. The town is inhabited by an old mix of cars; leader Doc Hudson, a porch Sally Carrera, a rusted tow truck Mater, a low rider Ramone, stoned out VW Filmore, plus an assortment of others.<br/><br/>Pixar have always been ahead of the game they started of computer animation, back in 1995 with Toy Story. They changed the world of children films, with deeper and layered stories that tailor to the young and the older audiences. Each film they have gone in boundless leaps, bringing the best in artistry of computer animation, and Cars is no different. The animation is flawless and at times mesmerising, the world these cars live in is wonderfully detailed.<br/><br/>Amazing animation aside, the driving force of Cars isn't that strong. The story is one road that has been very well travelled. Self centered McQueen learns life lessons about friendship and loyalty, with his ways changed by unlikely strangers. So Cars becomes a little to predictable as it moves through the numbers. The jokes are also too sparing. The jokes are to far apart, and many fall flat; even the opening short film One Man Band isn't that entertaining as other previous Pixar Shorts.<br/><br/>The Pixar team have always been excellent at suspending ones disbelief. One wondered if our toys were secretly alive, humanizing insects and sea creatures, or our closet was a doorway to a monster world. While writer/director John Lasseter has attempted to humanize cars, it doesn't feel that believable. The cars come off as caricatures of what type they are; one look and its not hard to click onto what personality they will have.<br/><br/>The voice talent like always is the defining part. Owen Wilson is great as the cocky Lighting McQueen. Paul Newman husky voice brings that pain to Doc Hundson and his past. Bonnie Hunt is good as the protective Sally. At first, Larry The Cable Guy's exaggerated southern voice started off irritating, but it not hard to fall for Mattor and his antics. Other voices include Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Tony Shalhoub and Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>Cars is not as strong as the other Pixar films, but it's still one journey your happy to go along with."

","I'm a big fan of Pixar: I've loved all their movies up until Cars. But I find it a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>After watching Cars, I watched Finding Nemo and The Incredibles to confirm that it was markedly inferior, and I was astonished at the lack of inventiveness or creativity in Cars.<br/><br/>Cars reminds me most of the mediocre animated movie Robots: Simple animation (no hair, no muscles, no clothing), simple settings, simple story.<br/><br/>What is new in Cars? What is unique? The settings were ho-hum, the characters stereotyped and boring.<br/><br/>Granted, my view might be tainted by the whole NASCAR milieu: it reeks of rednecks and racism, but ignoring that, the animation and story are still mediocre.<br/><br/>Compare with the Incredibles: Several individual _scenes_ in the Incredibles are superior to the entire Cars movie. Consider the scenes in E's house; or the ""getting in shape"" montage; or the glaring-fluorescent workplace of Insuricare. These scenes from The Incredibles are unique, inspiring, humorous, jaw-dropping. The same could be said for several scenes from Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>But Cars? Hmmm ... what scene is special? Maybe the neon-lighting ceremony at nightfall? But that is it.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that J. Lasseter had a personal affection for the subject matter, and hoped his enthusiasm would carry the story. But I think many of us did not grow up with his love of cars (perhaps we are younger?).<br/><br/>Lasseter, of course, deserves tremendous credit for Pixar's success: he had a hand in every prior Pixar movie. But was that the problem? Did no one at Pixar have the courage to tell him ""look, this story is lame, and the animation is ho-hum""?"

","Terrible movie. Lightning is a detestable character, within 20 minutes I was ready to turn it off and put it in the trash to save others from this movie. <br/><br/>I knew going in that it was a movie with very few female characters, but decided to see what the fuss is about and see if there was anything redeemable about it for girls. Nope. From Lightning sexually harassing the lawyer to the groupies I am just astonished that any adult would find this movie acceptable. <br/><br/>Also? Every other character is such a stereo-type that I had a very hard time believing this movie got made."

","Admitedly I wasn't compelled to see this at the movies, But my friend had it on DVD and i watched it and to be honest, I just didn't like it.<br/><br/>The characters were there but they felt like just a sting of stereotypes - The mentor with a secret, the cocky rookie who makes good, the sweet girl, the hippi, the deliveranceman. It all rang with false sentimentality. Real false.<br/><br/>With these movies you always know pretty much how it's going to end, but it's the journey getting there that is entertaining (like the much superior Finding Nemo - Of course he is going to find him, but the journey, characters and all that were fantastic)<br/><br/>Reading the last paragraph made a thought came into my mind which could really sum up what was lacking, A character you want to see win.<br/><br/>You loose the main character at the start due to him being such a SOB You loose most of the town folk because they essentially take a man (car) prisoner and depriving him (it) of his freedom. You loose the nice chick cause she is just so freakin nice i wanted to dent her fender. and you loose the mentor with a secret because you just don't give a crap.<br/><br/>I mean, the cartoon shown before it (with the little girl and the steet buskers) was about 200% better than the (dare i say it) dreck that went after.<br/><br/>This movie IS the empty cup. Still good animation. hope the next one is better."

","Mildly amusing tale of brash rookie race car who learns lessons in humility after being stranded in a small town. The animation is pretty good but the story is not up to the standard of Finding Nemo or Monsters, Inc. The script is predictable and the characters are all clichés. The cop car and the deputy are like Andy Taylor and Barney Fife. The jokes are rather stale. Just the concept of talking cars becomes tiresome after a while. There is one nice song (""Life is a Highway""); perhaps more music would have livened things up. Wilson does OK as the hero car and Newman brings the right gravitas to the voice of the wise old champion."

","**Disclaimer** I'm not a NASCAR fan, never have been and never will be. However I do know much of the history of NASCAR and its drivers as I was ""force fed"" as a child with the rest of my family being huge fans. I am a ""car"" lover though.<br/><br/>Now that I've ""disclaimered"" everyone let me say that I did ""get"" all of the references to: the drivers ( young and old ), cars ( new and old ), pedigree ( Ferrari, Hudson ) and living in Route 66 Americana ( I worked in Holbrook, AZ for 8 years ).<br/><br/>I still left this movie feeling empty. There simply wasn't enough ""fun stuff"" to entertain me. The jokes were few and far between and it seems like there was about an hour of the movie in the middle where they only thing ""funny"" was hearing how stupid ""Mater"" sounded ( More about that later ). Having said all of that the animation was excellent; the voice talents were also spot-on.<br/><br/>Now for a few things that really bugged me. Was it really necessary to make fun of Mater just for the way he talked and that he had buck teeth?"
"imdb-12718","5","4","11","10 June 2006"," A surprising disappointment
","How could you go into a movie directed by John Lasseter without the highest hopes for it? He isn't great just because he is one of the best computer animators around, but because his plots, characterisation and structure are simply sublime.<br/><br/>Well, in Cars the animation, CGI work and characterisation is top notch as you would expect (although it has to be said that cars don't give you much to work with in expressing character, and sometimes the strain shows). Oh dear, though, what has happened to the plot? If you want to tread down a staggeringly familiar path of big city fish out of water, cast of ""kooky characters"" proving how worthwhile they all are, and bucketloads of schmaltzy Hollywood redemption, then Cars is your movie. As for me, the final hour at least of the movie unwound with painful inevitability, with very little to keep me diverted along the way. I almost found it embarrassing to watch such prodigious talent being squandered on such a vehicle (sorry). It was noteworthy that a few of the adults in the movie theatre were laughing sporadically at some of the adult in jokes, while the kids were fidgeting and getting restless.<br/><br/>If you do go to see it, stay for the credits. You don't get the usual outtakes, but the neat cameos of other Pixar movies (if that is what you call them) definitely did raise a smile.<br/><br/>The short before the feature was a Pixar gem called One Man Band. Absolutely razor sharp in every department: animation, characterisation, and wit, with not a single word spoken. Worth the price of a ticket on its own, but it only pointed up how weak Cars is by comparison."

","By now, ""Cars"" is an old film--and I am FINALLY getting around to reviewing it. So much for staying ahead of the curve! But because there are already a ton of reviews, I'll keep this short.<br/><br/>So what did I like about the film? Well, the animation is just unreal-- it's gorgeous from start to finish. It's obvious that John Lasseter is insane for cars and put a ton of effort into this one. GORGEOUS! As for the rest of the film, it's quite good, though I wasn't quite as bowled over by it as some. After all, it now has a sequel, a semi-sequel (""Planes"") and some spin-off 'Mater shorts. I don't think the film was THAT good. But it was clearly enjoyable and pleasant throughout. Well worth seeing though I wish that Pixar would stop emphasizing sequels and started work on more originality. I understand why they don't, as it's all about marketing--and they marketed the crap out of this film."
"kdnor2011","6","2","4","11 January 2012"," Pixar's Weakest Film to date
","I have seen all but one Pixar film, and that's Cars 2. What I love about Pixar is that they don't make kids movies, they make movies that both kids and adults can enjoy. The Toy Story trilogy is my favorite trilogy, the Incredibles is my favorite Super hero movie, and Wall-e ranks up with some science fiction classics in my opinion. However their 2006 film Cars, doesn't match up well with their other films. The second weakest Pixar film in my opinion is A Bug's Life, which is still a really good film. Overall, Cars isn't really a bad film, it's just OK.<br/><br/>The film does have really great animation, as all Pixar films do, the acting's good, there are some really good characters, and I like how the final race didn't go for a cliché route. However the story is completely trite, we all know how this story is going to unfold. Also I'm not a big fan of Mater, I have nothing against Larry the Cable Guy, but Mater brings the film down a bit for me. That's why I'm scared to see Cars 2. Some of the jokes are good, but then you have some toilet humor that just doesn't work well.<br/><br/>Cars is OK, but for a Pixar film, and one directed by John Lassater, it defiantly won't be on my DVD shelf any time soon."

","I see on the message boards that some think this is Pixar's worst film, and others seem to think it is ""Ratatouille"". Well, I did not see that one. But I can say I found ""Cars"" very disappointing.<br/><br/>I have to give it a decent rating because the animation was great and the film was fun and had great voices. But the characters were not very deep, there was no real emotion ,and the plot was very predictable. This is a good film to put on for kids to watch, but not really one that involves much deep thought.<br/><br/>Is it Pixar's worst? I am not sure. But if it is, that is still a compliment because it means even their worst is better than the average film."

","Pixar Animation Studios has long maintained a history of excellence, always delivering enjoyable family entertainment. 'Cars' from their only film that I had yet to see, and so I greeted it with a lot of anticipation. Having finished it, I find myself considering a step-down from Pixar's other classics, such as 'Toy Story' or 'Monsters Inc.,' but that doesn't stop it from being an above-average two hours. In a world dominated by automobiles, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a super-successful rookie in competitive racing; all that remains for him is to win the prestigious Piston Cup, if only he can surpass retiring champion The King (Richard Petty) and cocky Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). After getting lost on his way to the all-important final race, McQueen ends up in the sleepy, dilapidated town of Radiator Springs, which had once been busy but had since slunk into obscurity when the new highway bypassed it.<br/><br/>After accidentally destroying the town's main road, the citizens condemn McQueen to repave it, despite his insistence that he is a famous car and must get to his race within the week. Tired town doctor, Doc Hudson  a 1951 Hudson Hornet (voiced by Paul Newman)  is the most respected vehicle in town, and yet he harbours an unusual reservation towards McQueen that we can't quite explain. Running the local motel is Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a relatively new resident to Radiator Springs, who found comfort and happiness away from the hustle-and-bustle of the city. Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) is the town's rusty tow-truck, and he's such an adorable creature that he probably steals the entire film. As he slowly gets the know the friendly residents of Radiator Springs, McQueen uncovers some meaning in his life: after all, it's not all about winning. It's about being happy and having some good friends.<br/><br/>The thing I've always loved about Pixar's films is that, despite the state-of-the-art computer animation, they've always told their stories in a very traditional way. The films don't try to be cool and high-tech (though I suppose this was a necessary prerequisite for 'The Incredibles'), but simply tell their stories in a simple way, as an older, traditionally-animated film might. Particularly during the opening sequence, the buzzing sound effects, flashing advertisements and pop music soundtrack just didn't seem to fit within a Pixar film: it, frankly, seemed like something you might expect to find in one of the inferior CGI-animated off-shoots from a different studio. Needless to say, I was relieved when McQueen drifted into the quiet country town, since it was then that I started to detect the filmmaker's skills for telling a good story. The outcome of the narrative  as in all Pixar films  was never in doubt, but it's such a nice story, and directors John Lasseter and Joe Ranft tell it pretty well. It's also interesting to note that the studio's next feature-length film, 'Ratatouille (2007),' truly recaptures the traditional spirit of Pixar's earlier works.<br/><br/>Once again, I'd like to reinforce that, despite my slight disappointment, 'Cars' is not a poor film by any means. It remains highly entertaining, and healthy fun for children of all ages, even if they have absolutely no knowledge of 1950s automobiles (I most certainly don't!). If I had to choose a funniest scene, it would probably be the ""tractor-tipping"" sequence, when Mater demonstrates the intricate art of startling cow-like farm machinery as they sleep. The ending also carries an excellent message of good-sportsmanship, and I can't have been the only person to let out an audible ""awwwwww!"" in the final seconds of the tie-breaking Piston Cup championship race."

And all the kids sat through it with out boredom, some laughed more than others but I cannot remember that last time a bunch this size stayed interested through 90 minutes let alone nearly 2 hours! Don't be put off by those who have criticize it as just a rehash of something else.... let's face it, by now everything is.<br/><br/>The animation is great, the voices top notch and the characters make you want to know them. Typical Pixar quality and detail.<br/><br/>As a vote of confidence nearly 20 of us are going to see it again this week. Again not even the Incredibles or Nemo got more than half of us to go a second time!<br/><br/>And positive is the word, everyone came out feeling they enjoyed something from this movie and all found the experience positive, unlike too many recent flicks like say,... Pirates of the Carrib. II which most of us saw as well and most came out feeling a bit had even though no one actually disliked it, we just expected more.<br/><br/>Again it is hard to see how Pixar will top this, but then I said that after Nemo as well, so I am ready to be stunned by the next Pixar masterpiece."

It shows the younger generation of today just what they can miss by speeding through life, without taking time to look around and enjoy the trip.<br/><br/>Though he only gave his voice, Larry The Cable Guy deserves recognition for giving Mater the breath-of-life. His delivery was 100% on target with each line.<br/><br/>This is one that Disney/Pixar will have difficulty topping.

By the phrase ""done it"" I mean created a believable world that you can have some form of connection with, to have an emotional attachment with the characters. Fantastic film for every reason possible, a great voice cast including Paul Newman and Owen Wilson and that old favourite from Toy Story and Monsters Inc and Cheers: John Ratzenberger!<br/><br/>The film is clever, simple but effective plot, inventive, playful, great for adults as well as kids and above all one of the funniest films I have seen in ages!!<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of NASCAR racing but the two main films I have seen covering this subject have both done it more than justice ""Days of Thunder"" and ""CARS"", the latter being markedly better than the former.<br/><br/>Go watch it, don't let it pass you by."

I'm not the hugest fan of Owen Wilson but I thought he did really well supplying the voice and adapting to the facial expressions of the main character, Lightning McQueen. And, of course, the CG graphics were superb. Larry The Cable Guy's timing is perfect in this movie, he comes out swinging in his role as Mater.<br/><br/>This movie is a bona fide classic, which makes you want to say ""that NASCAR movie from the early 90s called Days of Something-or-another."""

","If you've seen Doc Hollywood, a charming Michael J. Fox comedy, you have a basic understanding of the plot and characters in Pixar's latest offering. However, that familiarity won't detract a bit from your enjoyment of this delightful, well-made film.<br/><br/>We've all met (or perhaps even been) someone like Lightning McQueen. He's young, he's talented, he's ambitious, and he's not yet mature enough to realize that there's more to life than a checkered flag and a lucrative sponsorship. When he takes a wrong turn on the way to a Big Race, he finds himself stranded in a small town left behind by the advent of interstate highways, and populated with a colorful though less than glamorous assortment of automobiles past their prime. Yes, there is a love interest, yes, there are newfound friends, and yes, our hero is destined to learn a Big Lesson about the value of friendship and the true meaning of success.<br/><br/>Now, having told you all of that, I have to tell you that the simple predictability of this movie did not lessen its appeal or entertainment value in the slightest for me. By the end of the film, I (along with nearly every other member of a fairly packed Sunday night audience) was applauding, laughing and enjoying a nice, warm fuzzy feeling generated by the simple truths this movie offers up to our younger citizens. I liked and cared about these characters, and I was genuinely moved by the film's resolution.<br/><br/>The fact that the characters are cars rather than people or toys had no impact on the film's message or appeal, and the writers made effective use of the inherent comedy of a world populated by automobiles. I'm hard pressed to point out standout sequences, because the writing was uniformly excellent, but I will advise you to stick around for the credits: there are some priceless cameos that are truly enjoyable. Cars is good entertainment."

","Gentlemen and gentlemen ... start your engines!
With an exciting opening led by a well-played 'rock', the adventure begins in the traditional molds of films starring humans, quickly introducing the protagonist (Lightning McQueen) and antagonists of the story.<br/><br/>Interesting to note that in the trailer it seemed to be a film about racing like Days of Thunder, which is the passion of the Americans. Fortunately, Carros is more than that and engages one gear after another, addressing a legitimate and human history, but full of games with the automobile world. And all very well thought out. From the symbol of the film with the 'V' of classic V8 engines to LightYear tires, a clear allusion to the traditional American tire brand GoodYear and also to the priceless Buzz LightYear, created by John Lasseter in the successful Toy Story.<br/><br/>As in recent animations, the family is the target audience. Therefore, there are many quotes for adults, which are meaningless for children, but make no difference to them. Examples include famous names such as Rock Hudson in the character Doc Hudson, Jay Leno in Jay Limo, pilot Mario Andretti, among others. And there are also scenes from classics like Youth Transviated, E.T., Extra-terrestrial., Immediate Third Degree Contacts and a sentence by Sharon Stone in Wild Instinct: ""I provoke the most primitive instincts in 'cars'"".<br/><br/>Even Fast and Furious gets a quote, in the approach of Mack (partner truck of the hero of the story) in the middle of the road and in the scene of the train line. The sequence that the tunados play Kenny G (a successful saxophonist, who has become synonymous with brega) is very good for doping Mack. The engine speed is already high and then you ask: but what does the film have to tell? Cars overlooks two very current issues that are (pun intended) the speeding promoted by technology and the advance of the signal with the lack of solidarity. And so, the paths are covered very safely in the curves and straights of a well-tied script. Anyone who has a minimum of knowledge and / or connection with the automobile world will be able to enjoy the author's trip more. It's fact.<br/><br/>After all, the richness of details contributes a lot to bring the work closer to perfection. There are, for example, an Italian owner of a tire shop played by a Fiat Topolino and whose assistant is a Romiseta. The duo, of course, is in love with Ferrari! And there is also Ramon. A genuine Impala representing the low-rider crowd. Even the van (immortalized by Hanna-Barbera in Scooby-Doo) has its hippie version in this work. His passages yield a good laugh, like the mania to listen in the morning to the American national anthem in the classic rock version of Hendrix as a counterpoint to the Sarge, a military Jeep that has not yet forgotten its barracks past.<br/><br/>Everything connected to the American vehicle industry gets a ride in the movie. The character Rei, for example, is a Corvette. If you want to have quality on the tracks of life you have to ""float"" like a Cadillac, says idol Doc Hudson to McQueen. The traditional Route 66, immortalized in the minds of millions of people around the world (even if not from the beat generation), is also there in the form of the unforgettable road sign or in music. And so on. That s America! Rest assured. The program is guaranteed. And the kids have everything to really enjoy this adventure. And as one of the songs in the film says: 'life is a highway' and making real friends is the best of prizes. Have a good trip!<br/><br/>I liked this criticism of AdoroCinema<br/><br/>Film seen on June 6, 2020."

","After an incredibly strong first line-up of films for Pixar, some of which are amongst the best animated films of all time, it was only a matter of time before they stumbled.<br/><br/>I don't think Cars is a bad film, but it definitely doesn't have any of the Pixar magic which is featured in a lot of their other films. It also feels like it has been specifically made just to appeal to children. That's fine for a lot of animated films, but Pixar had an impressive track record of introducing relatable subject matter for adults and wrapping them up in a family-friendly package.<br/><br/>That being said, the narrative is definitely something which will appeal to the target audience. In fact, I do remember liking it more when I first saw it back in 2006. It's a fun adventure, but it just didn't quite work all the way for me. There were a few nice elements though, especially regarding the history of Doc and the town of Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't find any of the characters to be all that interesting, which might sound like a no-brainier considering that they're cars, but Pixar are the same studio that made me care deeply about toys and fish.<br/><br/>I sound like I'm hating on this film more than I intended to.

","So I have been working my way through all the Pixar movies and ranking them, removing the nostalgia as best as I can. Look if it were about nostalgia, Cars would be the landslide victor. I got to see the movie while in the USA on holiday and it is my earliest memory of the cinema.<br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't worked it out, Cars works on the premise that Cars are animated and sentient beings, that compete in races and have millions of fans. Enter Lightening McQueen, who is a cocky prick that everyone loves because he impresses everyone by being a rookie who competes and ties with two other cars. The have to travel across the USA to race again and break the tie.<br/><br/>The actual story of Cars is stellar. We see a real character arc develop for Lightening McQueen. It is the exact stuff a children's movie should be made out from. The message is wholesome and as the story develops, we see interesting side characters, tragic backstories and perfectly-timed comedy.<br/><br/>However, here's the catch. Pixar movies are great because of all the details that are thrown in. But in this movie, the added details do not make sense. I have a massive list of these that I'm not going to write out for your own sanity. It is frustrating because so much of the story is great. And the soundtrack is next level top notch.<br/><br/>Overall, I love this movie. But the small details that created plot holes, or loose ends made me deduct a couple stars from my rating. Don't avoid watching it."

","Pros:
1. Some of the animation is absolutely beautiful, especially in regards to the Grand Canyon imagery.
2. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has a great character arc from beginning as an egoistic narcissist, to a selfless humbled individual who is eager to learn from those around them.
3. The humour mostly lands and produces some genuinely funny and heartwarming moments.
4. The race scenes are really fun to watch and are well made and built-up to.
5. There is fantastic voice-acting from Larry the Cable Guy (Mater), Tony Shalhoub (Luigi), and Guido Quaroni (Guido).
6. The ending is suitably heartwarming and concludes the plot succinctly.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. Some of the animation is a little dated.
2. A couple of the feel-good moments are a little too cheesy and unnecessary.
3. There is a running gag about cow-tractors that falls flat after its introduction.
4. Owen Wilson fares poorly as a leading man, even when he's a disembodied voice."

","I'll tell you what. Pixar does not seem to disappoint. By the way for anyone wondering, I first watched this on launch in 2006 back when I was just 5. And now I am 18. I constantly see reviews from so many people saying that Cars is the worst Pixar's series/film(s). I cannot say that in the slightest. I will admit Cars 2 was a bit weird with the series, but Cars 3 was a very feel good moment. And this one.........oh this one. They should've just made the finish line out of solid gold because that just what this movie is.<br/><br/>There are so many characters in this particular movie to start off. Obviously you got the incredible Lightning McQueen and his trailer Mack. Then you got the entire Radiator Springs crew: Mater, Sally, Sheriff, Luigi, Guido, Flo, Ramone, Sarge, Filmore, Red, and Lizzie. Oh, and don't think I forgot about the Fabulous Doc Hudson. Then you got the bad boys on the road, such as Boost, DJ, Snotrod, And Wingo. And even memorable racers too, such as the respectful veteran in the Dinoco King and the stubborn, yet intriguing character in Chick Hicks.<br/><br/>The message at the end with McQueen having the King finish his last race and turning down Dinoco for his Radiator Springs crew is just the best moment you could ask for. This is definitely a top 5 Pixar movie."

","People seem to regard Cars as one of the weaker Pixar movies, but it's a childhood favorite. When I was a kid this movie was huge! All the kids (myself included) loved it, Rascal Flatts' cover of Life Is a Highway was extremely popular, everybody loved Tow Mater (which is most likely the reason he was the center of attention in the sequel), the tractor tipping scene was everyone's favorite scene, and everyone owned the toys. Now that I'm older I realize that the story is definitely weak compared to the other Pixar movies, but what makes up for it are the characters, animation, voice acting, humor, the music especially Our Town by James Taylor, an emotional scene, and the movie's tone.

","In alternate reality the world is much like ours but there are no people; instead there are sentient vehicles! This film tells the story of Lightning McQueen; an arrogant race car who is challenging to be the first car to will the prestigious Piston Cup in his rookie year. He throws away a clear victory after ignoring the advice of his pit crew and is involved in a three way tie with the current champ and his long-time rival. To decide the winner there will be a three car race in California in a week's time. Wanting to get there first Lightning pushes his support truck to drive through the night despite his exhaustion. A run in with some street racers leaves Lightning on the road with no idea where he is. He leaves the interstate, gets more lost and as he speeds along the old Route 66 is chased by the police; this leads to a crash and his arrest in the town of Radiator Springs. Here is told he must help fix the road before he can leave. As one might expect he is not happy with this but gradually befriends the locals and learns a lot about how to treat others; he also falls for a Porsche and experiences the joys of just driving. Naturally these lessons will help him in the big race but will he win?<br/><br/>Having watched and enjoyed most Pixar films I put of watching any of the 'Cars' films as I'd heard they were a little disappointing; having watched the first I can say it turned out better than expected. It opens well enough with some exciting race scenes. There are some problems with such an arrogant protagonist even if most viewers will appreciate that he has to be flawed if we are to get the character development and life-lessons later on. The film picks up once Lightning gets to Radiator Springs and we meet a variety of interesting characters. The most notable of these are Matey, a rusty old breakdown truck; Sally, the love-interest Porsche and Doc Hudson; an old race car who keeps quiet about his past. There are also fun side characters such as the Italian Fiat 500 who is obsessed with Ferraris and a hippy VW camper. The story contains some fun action scenes and some good laughs before the final race which enables Lightning to show everybody what he learnt; both about racing and about both accepting help and helping others himself. Overall I'd say that this certainly isn't among Pixar's best films it is still a lot fun; Pixar has still not disappointed me."

","Pixar's Cars (2006) truly is an excellent film did everyone to watch and enjoy. The writing is funny, creative, heartwarming at times. And the cast chosen to voice the characters was very well chosen. Owen Wilson is perfect for the voice of lighting McQueen. And Bonnie Hunt was a great fit too. The chemistry between the characters was very sweet and intimate, made you value the characters and the the relationships they held with others. And just let me say that who else could play ToMator soooo perfectly other than Larry the Cable Guy?? I'm not a fan of Larry personally, but he was the PERFECT choice to voice his Redneck down to earth hilarious character. This movie really has all you could ever ask for from a film of this kind. Well written/times humor in the right places, sentimental value, a tad bit of romance, quality dialogue, and great fitting actors to voice the animated characters. I totally suggest giving this animated gem a watch. It'll give you that warm fuzzy feeling with a side of laughs. 9/10 for Cars."
"Hitchcoc","8","0","0","9 January 2017"," That's ""Mater"" Without the Tow
","This is just a load of animated fun. Our dearest possessions, our cars, are made anthropomorphic, and take on the personalities of their functions. The old tow truck, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, is my favorite character, and he functions as the voice of the drawling hick. The sports car is reckless and unpredictable. Of course, vehicles of law enforcement have their own way of acting as well. So the creators have put together an entire subculture where these vehicles are the stars. It sounds silly until we begin to be engaged in their roles. There are protagonists, antagonists, characters of comic relief, just like any movie, animated or not. Pixar has masterfully connected what would have been flat animated images and brought them to life. I'm not much of a car fancier, but this one still got me. There's adventure, romance, and a race. What else could we want?"

","Lightning McQueen is not stopping for anyone until he finds himself stuck in the old town of Radiator springs. McQueen talks Mack into driving through the night to his tiebreaker race with Chick Hicks and The King, in Los Angeles. On the way to car race, Mack who is holding lightning in the back falls asleep due to his lack of sleep, and the other cars around him playing lullaby's. The cars on the highway find it fun to push Mack back and forth over the rumble strips, that cause the button for the back trunk to open. Lightning is sleeping, and slowly drifts back off Mack and left in the dust. Shortly after Lightning awakens and is not able to find Mack again. Lightning McQueen is the fastest car around, and is very proud of what he has accomplished so far. This being said, he gassed it all around and even to a near trailer yard where Mack could have been sleeping. After he drove around, and found himself on a deserted highway to what it looked like. He approached a small town that had beaten and rusted radiator Springs sign. When Lightning first arrives in radiator Springs, he is arrogant, cocky, and overconfident. So confident that he believes that he can win the Piston Cup on his own without help from any pit crews or a coach. During his stay in the old run down town, he is not able to maintain his racing needs like practice, tire changes, car maintenance, and most of all the love of his fans. Lightning is not liked that much in the town because he treats some of the cars as if they are unequal to him. Although Lightning is not the most interested in the town, he learns new things in the town, and grows a stronger and greater heart. The sheriff whose name was Doc, makes lightning redo the roads for the town and the people for what he has put them through. Lighting does not want any part. He is certain that he would never do such a thing. Although he is self-centered, he is a perfectionist and takes pride in what he does. Therefore his work ethic and pride gives him the strength to repave the road to perfection. After he had accomplished that, the town people started to appreciate lighting. It was because of his actions that the others started to respect him enough to thank him. After he has wondered into the sheriff's garage, he sees that he had won many races himself, Doc was a Six-time Turismo Carretera champion. Not long after, Lighting and the sheriff have a lot in common, and Doc ends up helping lightning understand the roads, and gives his old knowledge to Lightning. A key lesson in the movie was when Doc taught McQueen to turn on dirt. McQueen could not perfect it, and Doc knew how to exceptionally well. This was the first time Lighting was listening to someone else and learning. This opens his mind to how much better he could be as a racer if he had people to learn from. He also finds a car that he likes who lives in the town whose name is Sally. <br/><br/>Lightning learns new things and improves his racing abilities by going to the worn down town filled with the great cars of Radiator Springs. Lighting had created a negative to positive relationship with the town, that the town shop Rust-ESE repainted him and gave him a new look just in time for the Piston Cup. Lighting also find himself with a coach, and a Pit team at his next race. Lightning couldn't be any happier, and it was because of his personal attitude that life was so jolly. He also meets one of his bests friends in the town Matter. Matter is a tow truck who is not the brightest, but has a good attitude, and is stoked on life. He does not seem like a huge factor to the story, but Mater is the friend that Lighting can go to for anything, especially when he needed him to tow him out of the mud.McQueen and Mater create a best friend relationship because they are the complete opposites, but both want to have fun."

"votoole-00090","9","0","0","31 October 2015"," Review of the movie
","I watched this movie as a child and recently it just came on TV again, so one night when I was sitting at home I saw it and I watched it. I had forgotten how much I loved this movie, the soundtrack, the plot, and the characters are all were great. When you first turn on the movie, the opening scene with Sheryl Crow sining ""Real Gone"" just draws your attention to the movie. As soon as the song played I was hooked onto the movie. Also, Rascal Flatts does an excellent job on his make of the song ""Life is a Highway"". With those two songs placed near each other I couldn't help but watch the rest of the movie. Another thing, I liked about this movie is that its not your normal Disney good vs evil plot movie. In this movie there really isn't any ""bad guy"" and I liked that. Sometime when you watch a movie you just get caught up thinking about the rivalry and you lose track of what's actually happening in the movie. In this movie all your attention is on the movie and you don't have to worry about picking sides between good and evil. Not to mention that the problem in the movie can be seen as a real problem today in real life. Small towns are being driven out of business because society to focused on saving time on the road. In real life there are real Towns like Radiator Springs that are going bankrupt because the roads that they were built on are just not being used anymore. The directors John Lasseter and Joe Ranft really put together are real plot line that fits our society well. Lastly, how can one forget about the comedic aspects on the movie. Larry the Cable Guy does a great job at playing Mater. Mater is one of the funniest characters that I have seen in any movie. Larry the Cable Guy's back road country accent fits Mater's old time tow truck character. Disney couldn't have picked a better actor to play Mater in the movie. I am so glad that Disney's Cars came back on TV this past weekend, it reminded me of my childhood and how much I loved to laugh. I hope that if you see it on TV, you decide to watch because though it may seem childish its a great movie."

","Pixar's Cars is a brilliant movie, with great characters an a an interesting story line. It teaches viewers that life isn't about winning or being the best at something. ~~Life is about journey, not the destination.~~ The characters are fun and believable, and diversely designed. Cars is not just for kids, as like in most of their movies, Pixar included some 'under the radar' adult jokes, that children will not notice or understand, such as Mia and Tia 'flashing' Lightning at the beginning of the movie. I do not understand why so many people seem to hate his move, saying it's Pixar's worst movie. Pixar put a lot of work in to this- the crew traveled down route 66 personally, so they could talk to people who live in towns that had a similar fate to Radiator Springs, and research facts and building designs, to make the fictional town look light one that could really exist. Everyone says that Cars is only used for money making, but how much do you think this road trip would have cost them?"

","Cars (2006): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Larry the Cable Guy, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub: From the creators of Toy Story and Monsters Inc comes this surprisingly imaginative computer animated film about cars. It is never explained why these vehicles sustain life but director John Lasseter succeeds in creating a story of wondrous images and virtue. Owen Wilson voices race car Lightning McQueen who serves time in Radiator Springs after a night of misfortune. He is sentenced to repair damage he caused but ultimately realizes that this rundown town was once a production for cars. He meets Doc voiced by Paul Newman who hides a past. Portia voiced by Bonnie Hunt teaches Lightning to slow down before he misses the important things in life. How two cars romance is something that is never attempted in an explanation here. There is also a rusty tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy who befriends Lightning and introduces him to a new version of cow tipping that is one of the funniest jokes. Tony Shalhoub voices Luigi, and Richard Cheech Marin voices a Chevy Impala named Ramone. The computer generated images bring the characters to life presenting glorious colour and accompanied by a screenplay that crosses the finish line. Strong theme regarding selflessness highlights this superb animated gem that wins more than a race. Score: 9 / 10"

","Cars is a really entertaining and delightful movie. I like how all the characters are cars (But some back-round characters are planes or trains). This is much better than Cars 2 as well. The credits are the best credits I had ever seen because normally credits are boring. One thing I don't like about Cars is that Mater is a very very VERY annoying character. Another thing that I don't like is that Lightning McQueen is treated so unfairly in Raidiator Springs. Speaking of the credits, they show a car version of Toy Story (Toy car story.) Monster inc (Monster truck inc.) and A bugs life (A bugs life) during the credits. This the 3rd best Pixar film in my opinion. The best Pixar film in my opinion is Toy story 2 and the runner up is Toy story. This is a film that is good for all ages."

So this movie seemed perfect to me. I love the animation, the characters but most of all the plot. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a hotshot race car in a world completely dominated by automobiles. On his way to his next big race he is dropped from his trailer and stumbles across Radiator Springs, a small town in the middle of the desert. He meets a tow truck named Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) a Porsche 911 named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) and the town judge a Hudson Hornet named Dr. Hudson (Paul Newman) who takes an immediate disliking to him. Lighting and Mater soon bond after a while, and Lighting makes friends among the rest of the towns people but Doc Hudson never gets used to him. It turns out that Doc also used to be a race car but was rejected after a crash. Eventually he can't stand Lightning anymore so he calls the racing company to take him away. But at his next big race he meets the townsfolk who are now his pit crew and Doc finally get's used to him. I have to say I always enjoy this movie. Ever since I saw it I loved it. Go see it."

","After watching the movie Cars I felt something I last felt a long time agosheer joy!! There is not a second you won't enjoy of this 117 minute movie. Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic cars and other vehicles, the star of the movie, Lightning McQueen, is a hot shot race car who is the first rookie ever to have a shot at the Piston Cup. But McQueen is an arrogant race car who believes that he is a one man show. His pit crew members don't like his attitude and desert him before the final race but lightning doesn't care. As the final race approaches McQueen suddenly disappears and everybody wonders about him. Thanks to an accidental set of events MacQueen ends up is a small town called ""Radiator Springs'. And there MQueen's adventure began. He discovers the meaning of life and friendship along with his friends Doc, Larry and Sally.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter along with Pixar production house this US$ 120 million movie has reportedly grossed around UD$ 5 billion dollars worldwide. The voice of MacQueen is that of Owen Wilson and Paul Newman lent his voice for the rough and tough Don. Apart from these many other celebrities have donated their voices such as Jeremy Piven, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, Jay Leno, Michael Schumacher, Tom and Ray Magliozzi. Overall Cars is a fine movie, one worth watching."

","A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen gets waylaid in Radiator Springs, where he finds the true meaning of friendship and family.<br/><br/>Pixar's movies have never became a disappointment. It easily draws into childhood imagination and memories, making us enjoy the little things. And in 2006, when everybody thought their streak would end, Cars proves that it has not. While not being the best Pixar movie (most possibly the worst one) I'm still saying Cars is a great movie. And that is pretty darn cool. From the everything, you can talking cars isn't the most imaginative idea, but still holds up very well. The voice acting, directing, messages, and overall everything still has that magic Pixar touch. So nothing missing there... Only complain is, the movie cannot compare to the magical expression that Finding Nemo or Toy Story has. Again, this is still calling Cars a great movie. Nothing else really to say to this film. Although possibly Pixar's worst, Cars is still considered a great animation. Everything was expected and everything was enjoyable. Kids will probably love it and the rest will cherish it's message and carry on. I enjoyed myself as well. Great movie, lots of fun, and another great Pixar film. Only problem is, will Cars 2 hold up to it's magic? 7/10."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","19 September 2011"," Much closer to the fast-lane than it is the hard shoulder, Cars is a neat and pleasurable animated excursion with an ability to sneak up on us.
","Cars is a 2006 animated feature from that of the Pixar stable, they of that wondrous ability to seemingly breath life, indeed fresh air, into worlds given radically creative overhauls; in doing so, providing specific dynamics to a functioning and working universe featuring oft-inanimate objects now come alive and living with their own patriarchies and politics. When the process works, it can be enchanting; when it doesn't, the films can often grind one down – Cars is an instance in which the proverbial rabbit is pulled from the hat, and whilst not on a level with their best work, is easily one of the better films the studio has produced. Owen Wilson, lending his ""talents"" behind a microphone but instead off screen, voices Lightning McQueen; a sports car in an eye-catching shade of red operating within a world devoid of humans in which cars may speak; act and, excusing the pun, drive proceedings. McQueen is young and cocksure, a rookie within the career field of motor racing somewhat closely resembling that of NASCAR; plugging away at race after race in the long season and coming to find himself on the brink of winning the elusive Piston Cup, the prize for heading these standings at the end of the year. <br/><br/>When we join him, he is at the venue for the final race – the points level between he, the serial champion of the sport and a competitor often stuck with the runner's up spot on account of him. At the track, the stands are beset by an audience solely made up of cars and other vehicles; heaven only knows what might constitute as a Diamond League meeting in this universe. Whilst there, numerous company brands and labels are slapped all over cars; barriers and buildings, but they are fictional and what might have been easy product placement is pleasantly avoided. McQueen races and races well, but rejects the idea of teamwork and guns for all the glory all by himself when turning down a pit-in chance and the allowing of his crew to get involved: it's all about him and his glory.<br/><br/>The race ends in a remarkable three way tie between the front runners and a one-off playoff is announced between the three. We build an image of McQueen being somewhat of a vain, limelight loving showoff - a celebrity figure very much enjoying the verbal jousting with rivals and the gluts of attention which fly his way as the new hotshot following this remarkable first season. There is a quieter moment reflecting how far he's come when a certain sponsorship company is revealed to have once helped get McQueen off the ground; his moving onto larger plains and bigger companies whilst leaving the old one somewhat in the dark reiterating this inability to be anything other than self-centred and malevolent. Enter one or two good gags about cars operating within this world both falling asleep at the wheel and attempting to jump a level crossing, at which the trains are as anthropomorphistic as the cars are, and a road trip to the playoff race which goes horribly wrong when McQueen tumbles out of his pit team's truck and is left stranded in the wilds of America.<br/><br/>Where he ends up is a small town sweetly named Radiator Springs; his chaotic arrival born out of panic near-enough destroying it. Bossed by that of Paul Newman, lending his voice to a 1950's gag-guzzler, Doc Hudson, and populated by a mixture of stereotypical Italians, Mexicans, louder than life African American women and VW van's whom are hippies, McQueen is caught and kept to fit the bill of the damage. We spot what might happen whilst he's there, although crucially, enjoy those eventual places it takes us. Life away from the glitz; glamour and gaudiness of the track-side, track-set existence sees McQueen come to recognise the simpler, more down to Earth ways of certain others. He comes to make friends with a tow truck named Mater, whose friendship is one of an honest and grounded nature away from the strictly businified racing world ties. Through an equally young-as-McQueen-is Porsche named Sally (Hunt), we observe a strong and empowered female presence in the town whom achieved a fair amount in a specific career field herself; McQueen's interaction with her is a joyous observing of him manoeuvring away from fatuous pit-lane girls and Hollywood socialites and towards more grounded people.<br/><br/>Where one might say the Tom Tom navigation device is set firmly to where it's going to head from an early stage, we are surprised by the effect Cars comes to have on us. We foresee specific frameworks, anticipate character shifts and yet it comes to engage us to the level it does, often even coming across as quite moving. One could criticise the narrative frameworks for these things all day long – it is a churlish, fruitless exercise. Is 2009's ""Up"" much more than a film about a man coming into contact with the young boy he never had in life running in parallel with a father-figure that aforementioned boy struggles to find? Likewise, narratively speaking, is Toy Story much more than two binary oppositional components in character form thrust together and forced into recognising both one other as well as their own natures? Is Finding Nemo much more than a buddy-pic road movie that happened to be set underwater? In their barest forms, most of what overlies these films are sound and routine – when unfolded around great adventure and exuberance, they exude degree of charm difficult not to get caught up in. It happens again here."

","Cars is a terrific movie with a well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. Pixar took a huge risk with this movie, setting it in a universe with no humans, every character being a talking car, and also having the majority of it set in one location. It did not seem like an easy project to pull off, but they did so using great character development as well as great casting choices that perfectly convey the personalities of these characters. <br/><br/>Admittedly, it can get a bit boring at times. Running for nearly two hours, the majority of the movie takes place in Radiator Springs, a very small town, and we almost start to feel the same isolation that the main character feels, wanting to be taken out of this area and see something that's a lot more visually exciting. <br/><br/>Like any Pixar film, Cars never forgets its heart. There are many heartwarming moments, and particularly the last twenty minutes brought a smile to my face. The overall message of the film is basically stating that all that glitters is not gold, joy does not come from fame and fortune, the real happiness is being around people that you love, who also love you. It's a true message and it is very surprising that a film about talking cars manages to convey this so well. <br/><br/>Sweet and entertaining. Funny, beautifully animated and heartwarming, Cars is great entertainment for all ages and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>Lightning McQuenn is on his way to winning The Piston Cup, however, after accidentally ending up in a town called Radiator Springs, he must stay there and fix their road. While there, he begins to form an attachment to the residents."

","Talking toys! Talking bugs! Talking monsters! Talking fish! Now, talking cars? Oh, my! A talking race car movie! How awesome is that? The story of racing rookie Lightning McQueen thinks his career is a walk in the park, when he suddenly ends up in a town called Radiator Springs and meets some particular faces, and learns that there is more to life than gold medals. Now, this is something I call completely inspirational. I thought ""Cars"" was an excellent movie from Pixar, and another movie that uses fiction to teach real-life lessons. And the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Keaton, Larry the Cable Guy, and an appearance by racing star Richard Petty was all quite impressive. I thought the story was well true to life, it's another Pixar flick with a big heart, and it was actually pretty funny. I felt that the movie really taught that everything else in life is more important than winning a lot of races. I love the animation, the heart, the characters, and all of those racing scenes. This movie just makes you want to go out there and race to glory. Wow, what a funny pun! Now, it's time to rev up the engines and head back home! ""Cars"", in my review, ""hilariously awesome, and has a big heart""."

","It took me a few times of watching Cars before it became a delight to see it. In fact, I started off feeling a shade disappointed by the movie, feeling that the humor in some places flopped because they tried too hard to be funny and feeling that the message was clichéd.<br/><br/>But make no mistake: Pixar's Cars is a first class movie that embodies something wonderful. Where it lacks in originality of content, it makes up for in resonance. All of us look back on the past with a shiny glow in our minds, because we grow older feeling that we've lost something of the innocence of our youth. And to have that more than effectively communicated by cars for characters is icing on the cake. The resolution to the last race is a stroke of brilliance that delivers a strong message, a happy ending, and with a twist that I didn't see coming. It is truly a movie for all ages and will delight them all. As I said, the movie was a slow grower, but oh so worth it!"

","It's amazing how Disney movies seem to capture the hearts of children all over the world. Last night while watching this creative film with my children (who are both younger than this four year old film), I seen their eyes stair at the TV in amazement. They both could not believe that there was a world of only cars that really talked! <br/><br/>Disney's Cars shows that there is a true meaning to the word ""family"", it's just up to you to find out what that is. The movie begins when Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson), a famous race car gets lost in a small abandoned town called Radiator Springs. He got into some trouble while there and had to stay until he and his powerful engine repaved Radiator Springs' main road. This famous race car who could only think about winning the Piston Cup had no care in the world and thought he was better than every other car in Radiator Springs. However, he met several characters including: Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a famous race car from several years back, Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a really nice Porsche who Lightning McQueen falls in love with, and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty old tow truck who becomes Lightning McQueen's best friend. All of these characters change Lightning McQueen's way of thinking and he begins to learn the real meaning of family and friends. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes was when Lightning McQueen and Sally go on a drive to an old abandoned hotel. This is when Lightning McQueen learns the true meaning of Radiator Springs and he begins to fall for Sally even more than before. There was a slow motion shot of Sally as Lightning McQueen was watching her drive beside a water fall. Director John Lasseter, angled this shot perfectly. You could truly feel that Lightning McQueen was becoming a new person, or shall I say car. <br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter, who also directed A Bugs Life and Toy Story, seems to have several motifs in this film. The biggest one of all being that all of the cars in this movie have their own personality, just like a human being. A Bugs Life and Toy Story are both very similar in this way. A bugs life is about talking bugs that live a normal, working life like humans and Toy Story is about talking toys who only talk and have personalities when humans are not in the room. All three of these films have very similar motifs. <br/><br/>Overall, I believe John Lasseter, as well as all the actors and actresses voicing the characters did an excellent job giving these cars personalities. As a mother, I am very protective over what my children watch, however, the family oriented message this film gives is great for children to learn from. I also love that it is entertaining for the entire family."

","Caught the world premiere at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte-- we're not race fans ourselves by any means, but you really don't have to be to get on the road with this one. We were privy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backboard to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun. Not only on the fact that he's a tow truck, but also his ""they call me tater salad"" bit-- Overall, highly entertaining, just try not to speed too much on the way home...."

","As we all know today, the cinema market will, more or less, never make a groundbreaking profit from the movies if the films do NOT have one little aspect to attract the average movie goer... and that's ""previews!"" Unfortunately, for the practices of Pixar, ""Cars"" didn't have the exciting previews that movies like Ice Age 2 had during that time-line. After the large juggernaut ""The Incredibles"" brought up into the box office, ""Cars"" just faded away in the Pixar line-up, and for a poor reason, too! As it stood, I watched the movie, and I now own it! Without a doubt, Cars was a very inspiring movie, in which careless viewers seemed to overlook for its quiet nature! I basically made this review not to explain the premise, but to explain why people rate the movie so low! You see, after ""The Incredibles"" came out with an action-packed attitude backing it up, hence it being a super hero movie, people were, apparently, hyped to see the next installment from Pixar animations! But, when come for the premiere, the viewers watched it, and, once again, overlooked it... Because the movie didn't contain a ""gripping"" or ""entertaining"" story line, many reviewers mainly tossed it! The story's moral was a rather poor base for the movie (don't let stardom cloud your mind), but, with what Pixar had to work with, they made the BEST of it! So, you can basically surmise the media and the public as the following, Gripping storyline + poor premise = GREAT MOVIE!!!! Quiet natured story line + Superb premise = BORING MOVIE!!!! What I like about Pixar is that they don't always rely on gripping effects and big name actors to support their movies, they take a different approach... THEY MAKE YOU THINK!!! Pixar movies are one of the few groups of films in the cinema market that make the viewer think and ponder on the moral, instead of having you wasted with overbearing effects and visuals! For that aspect, watch Cars! Because instead of becoming excited, think and ponder about it while you watch! IT'S GOOD!!!!"
"revere-7","8","0","0","18 October 2009"," Not Pixar's best; still among animation's best.
","Cars Like most digital artists, I was a fan of Pixar before they made their first feature film. In fact, by the time I saw their first short film Luxo, jr. many of us already knew their name from the .pxr (pixar) file format.<br/><br/>After a string of top notch shorts, most of us were excited to see their first feature film; the first feature film created entirely on a computer. True to form, Toy Story did not disappoint. Even if you took away the ground breaking animation, the fact that it launched a whole new type of animated film – you'd still have a damn good story. Entertaining even if it had been done with stop-motion, cell, or any other type of animation.<br/><br/>But Pixar didn't stop there – for the next decade and a half, they continued to produce top-notch films, both long and short. While few (except maybe Toy Story 2) were as good as Toy Story they were all still outstanding.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Cars. Released as Pixar's 20th anniversary film, Cars follows the story of a race car, Lightning McQueen, on his quest to win the prestigious 'Piston Cup'. As usual, there is great animation, fun jokes, and neat cameos. But this time, Pixar failed to win the Academy Award for best animated feature – a category that was practically created for the studio following the repeated snubbing of films like A Bug's Life, and the Toy Story films. This was only the second time since the award was created in the early 2000s that Pixar failed to win. And the loss to Warner Brothers (and previously to Dreamworks) was deserved, as this (and the previous Monsters, Inc.) were neither among Pixar's best, nor the best in the field.<br/><br/>BUT, the fact that Cars is still an enjoyable, and even superior film judged in the context of all animated features ever made, or all films ever made for that matter, just goes to show how high Pixar has raised the bar for itself and everyone else."

","Cars and racing are really not my favorite subject, and the only reason I (reluctantly) decided to watch Cars was because it was the only Pixar movie I haven't seen, so I just wanted a complete collection. Thank goodness for my obsession with completeness. This movie isn't about cars or racing at all, even if it features both. Of course, there is nothing original in the plot (almost a remake of ""Doc Hollywood"") or in the concept of a human world populated only by non-humans (""Duck Tales""), or a world of sentient cars (""Transformers""). But the lack of originality is characteristic of every Pixar movie to date, and they always get away with this. But there is one unusual twist this time - the cars don't try to be human! Unlike ""WALL-E"", ""Bugs Life"", and many others, it's often difficult to draw parallels between humans and cars. What is a human equivalent of a paint job? Tattoo? Ramone does call it ""body art"", but they change their colors as easily as clothes. So maybe it's clothing? If so, then rusty cars are naked, but they aren't regarded as such. And many characters seem to retain the same pain job for decades, day and night. So what is a paint job? It's paint job and that's all it is. And what is oil? Mack refers to ""oil-thirsty parasites"", but the Sheriff goes for a ""quart of oil"" at Flo's. So which is it, blood or drink? It's both. The moral is - don't try to draw parallels, just enjoy this new world of cars and take it for what it is. The decision to put eyes on the windshield is brilliant! Not because it makes the cars ""more expressive"", but because it solves a very big problem, which plagues the world of Transformers - why would a car in a world devout of humans even have a windshield? Or doors, or seats, or steering wheels? These cars have none of this. Look closely - we never get a look inside any of the cars. These are truly living Cars, not vehicles made by humans for humans. The final piece that puts it all together is the soundtrack - every song is so catchy it stays in your head, and it flows with the movie. If you need proof that a weak music score can ruin a movie, watch ""Harry Potter"". I had to watch Cars at least 10 times before noticing that the end of the final race doesn't make much sense and could have been made better (I wouldn't say more so as not to spoil anything), but if it takes that many times to notice that, I guess it's as good as it gets. I don't remember any other movie that was so close to being perfect (despite all the mentioned flaws), so it's 10 hands down."

","I wasn't a big fan of animated movies, and believed that it is just ""Childs stuff"" and used to co-relate all animation movies with 'cartoon movies'. This movie (apart from 'Finding Nemo') truly shows the difference between ""animation"" and ""cartoon"" - the former being much wider in sense and spirit and involves a story line as compared to funny sketches doing crazy things on screen.<br/><br/>The huge plus this classic animation has got is the subtle message and storyline along with hugely improved CGI (good job Disney and pixar.... keep it up). At first I thought the movie would be centered around a lot of racing stuff, but it really wasn't and surprisingly blends the story of 'route 66' (which actually exists) with a roller coaster emotional ride which the rookie racing car ""Lightning McQueen"" <br/><br/>The finesse with which the cars (including junkies and rusties) are brought to life is amazing. Pixar has done their homework and featured small town folk as they really are and the set up gives realistically diverse view of small town life. Every character is so paired that you love virtually every character in the movie. The filmmakers have gone far enough to detail the perfect reflections in the cars of the sidewalk - It is a visually stunning treat. Even the old, vintage car models have that chic look that brings some of the essential charm of this film<br/><br/>Shortly after the 1st 15-20 minutes of the race you forget whether the cars are characters or is it the other way round. The struggle of the rookie race car; who has the ability, but not the discipline to become a true champion; and how this 'raw ability' is crafted into a champion racer by a old-retired-hurt racer ""Hudson Hornet"", is depicted wonderfully with some comic characters and the love interest (a car of course) of the rookie providing wonderful support. The icing on the cake is the last race to win the championship (piston cup) which the rookie is within centimeters of winning but 'withdraws' at the last moment to help the reigning champion to cross over the finish line much to the delight and surprise of the 'car audience' and bagging the sponsor of dreams without winning the championship.<br/><br/>Certainly not an 'only kids' movie and worth every penny - 9/10 definitely..."

However after his rig loses him on the way to the race and he winds up trashing the road in radiator spring he is forced repair the road over the week he is supposed to be travelling down to take part in his final race and on the way learns numerous life lessons.<br/><br/>After the praise that was lavished on ""The Incredibles"" it would have been easy for this to be an anti-climax, in fact when I first heard that it was a film about cars I thought Pixar had taken the easy option as when I was a kid I often played with cars and imbued them with personality so I though that Pixar were taking the easy option in a way, but nothing could be further from the truth. Unlike the animation in the Incredibles this animation has not dated at all and looks sumptuous and fluid in a way that the Incredibles animation hasn't. The story is a little clichÃ©, but it's handled with charm and panache by the usual Pixar team, with stellar voice performances from Larry the Cable Guy, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenburger, but the big steal in the film coming from the late great Paul Newman, who put in one of his great final performances in this film.<br/><br/>While it's not been praised as much as Incredibles or Ratatouille, it is up there with Wall-E, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2 for me.<br/><br/>Yet another under-rated masterclass from Pixar."

","Released in 2006, this was the seventh full-length feature from Pixar, and wasn't quite as well received as a number of other films from the CGI animation company, but unsurprisingly, it was apparently still another success from them, which I can't question after seeing it. I didn't see it in the theatre, but I think I first saw it on the small screen two years ago this month, when I first rented it. The other day, I rented it again, to watch it for the first time since then. So, I have now seen it twice, and it wasn't a masterpiece in my eyes either time, unlike some of its predecessors, all of which I had seen beforehand. However, from what I remember, I was impressed enough during my first viewing, and not much changed with my second, if anything.<br/><br/>In a world with no humans, one completely inhabited by anthropomorphic motor vehicles, Lightning McQueen is a very self-centred rookie race car. In the last race of the season, he hopes to be the first rookie to ever win the Piston Cup, but at the end of this race, he finds himself tied with The King and Chick Hicks! The three cars are scheduled to compete again in a tie-breaker race in Los Angeles. On the way there, Lightning McQueen is transported by his truck, Mack, but late at night, he falls out while he's asleep, as Mack struggles to stay awake! The young race car soon wakes up to find himself on the road, and tries to find Mack, but doesn't succeed. Instead, he finds himself in a town called Radiator Springs, and unintentionally destroys the town's main road as a result of his speeding! For this, he is sentenced to fix the road as community service, and won't be able to leave the town until he's finished. At first, he just wants to finish the task so he can get to the race, but he has a lot to learn.<br/><br/>Unlike some Pixar films, I've found that the humour here is somewhat lacking. For the most part, I did find quite a few small laughs, but not very many big ones at all. Some parts of the film are funny thanks to Mater, a living tow truck who lives in Radiator Springs, and is assigned to look after Lightning McQueen during his community service. In terms of humour, my favourite part is probably the ""tractor tipping"" one. (In the world this movie takes place in, tractors are like the cows in the real world!) The characters may be a bit bland and insignificant compared to popular characters in certain other Pixar films, but some of them stand out, including the humorous Mater, along with the main character. As for the story, Pixar has done better. I found it to be somewhat dull at times, not that consistent, but overall, it is a reasonable story about an arrogant, selfish character with valuable lessons to learn, with some perhaps mildly touching moments.<br/><br/>Unlike most of Pixar's full-length films to date, I've never seen this one in the IMDb top 250. However, even though this may be one of the CGI animation company's weaker efforts, and I can understand why many people might think it doesn't live up to Pixar's standards, it's still better than certain other animated films from recent years, including certain films from DreamWorks Animation, Pixar's rival computer animation company, such as ""Shark Tale"". For the most part, ""Cars"" is a good family film with nice animation, and one which isn't restricted to a certain age group, but probably entertaining for people of all age groups. I think that's typical of Pixar, and I'm very sure many would agree. This particular piece of computer animation probably has most things, if not everything, one would hope for in a Pixar film, just to a lesser extent than a number of its relatives."

","Cars is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Usually, I'm more for movies that are PG-13, but this is at the top of my list. Cars is one of the best movies out there. While I know a lot of people who disagree, it is as good as it seems.<br/><br/>For starters, it's by Pixar, and we've yet to see them fail. Just seeing the Disney/Pixar logo on an ad for a movie guarantees that it's gonna be good.<br/><br/>The plot is so good, I can't help but enjoy it! I love how it starts off with a high-action race scene putting you in the mind set it's gonna be fast-paced. Then in throws you into the slow lane when Lightning enters Radiator Springs, putting you into his position. Also, it has a really great metamorphosis for Lightning's character showing him change his personality slowly, but surely, as he learns that the journey in life is more important than the destination. Plus, the characters are so unique and no two are exactly alike. There are so many quirky characters in the movie from the rusty, friendly, lovable tow truck Mater, to the peace-loving hippie Filmore, to the grumpy, secretive character that is Doc. You can't help but to not enjoy the nostalgic feel of Route 66 and all of the car puns that are too many to count! But you don't have to be a car geek to enjoy Cars. You just gotta enjoy a good film (and a sense of humor never hurts also)."

","I really am surprised that this isn't on the top 250, while that atrocity ""Ratatouille"" is. This is easily ten times the movie that one was. <br/><br/>It's a kids flick of course, but made for adults too. An all out celebrity cast fills out the cars' personalities including the late greats Paul Newman and George Carlin. It's a sweet little movie about the meaning of family, friends, helping out others and not just thinking about yourself all the time. Keep an ear out for some extraordinary cameos (Jay Leno, John Ratzenberger and Michael Keaton most notably.)<br/><br/>The animation is excellent, the music is great the story is interesting and holds your attention the entire time. I also love all the little incidentals they threw in (notice the flies are actually tiny little cars??!!) The attention to detail is absolutely amazing. Roads have real texture, grass, sand and plants look real, etc. And for the kiddies some great moral lessons and is very touching. I've read other reviews on here that stated they didn't ""get"" or ""like"" the movie because they weren't that into cars or Nascar. That's like saying you didn't like ""Finding Nemo"" because you don't have an aquarium. It's just silly, this is a great movie for everyone. <br/><br/>The characters were great, my personal favorites besides the lead would have to be ""Mater"" and ""Doc Hudson"". It's a safe engaging film from a lot of garbage being cranked out nowadays. I'm not going to review specifics about the film, it speaks for itself. 10/10"

","I wasn't one of those persons who thought a car as a character was a bad idea. Mainly because, well, I love cars. But I did wonder - what kind of story can be told about a car - a story that is engaging enough to compete with stories about cherished toys of our youth, a fish separated from his father, or a cute ant banished from his colony? It turns out I shouldn't have worried at all - because, as always, Pixar didn't do a story specific to a car - it did a story everyone can relate to. Cars are just an excuse to tell it, and have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Years and years after it came out, I'm still enjoying the little details here, there and everywhere a car nut can appreciate. The love for America and cars in general is pretty evident throughout the movie. But, guess what? That really doesn't matter. I think the really important thing here is, once again, Pixar made a story that has more of a human side than many other movies with real life actors.<br/><br/>And, once again, the fact that they did it with bits and bytes is nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>9 / 10."

","If I was in ""Cars"" I would been a modified, 1953 Ford Victoria Hardtop and the vechile would have 1952 Ford Wheel Covers, a 1954 Ford decklid handle, and a brake light where the Ford Crest used to be and have backup lights & a 1954 Skyliner Roof and where ""Crestline"" would be on the trim it would be ""Supercar"". And the eyes would be in the windshield & it would be thick to show my status wearing glasses and billed as ""Markie Brainard, Supercar"" and the 1953 Ford Victoria hardtop would fly & serve in Radator Springs as a supporter of the town & had a son would be a 2005 Hyundai Accent. Dubbed Marcus, Jr. The color of the car would be black with a white top. Lighting McQueen started out as a brash rookie & after his visit to Radator Springs he learned about things and learned what happens to a three time Piston Cup winner named Doc Hudson, voiced by the late, Paul Newman in one of his best roles. The final race did well when Chick takes The King out & Lighting saw what happened to The King, Strip Weathers and helped him finish the race instead of winning the Piston cup and that was an act of a hero. Chick did get the cup & still got dissed by his peers. However Lighting McQueen had a status of a winner for his act pushing The King to finish the race. Markie would explain to his son, Marcus, Jr. and told him ""You can win The Piston Cup like Chick did and still don't get any respect!"" There was some truth about interstate highways that bypassed some communties and they ended up becoming ghost towns. US 40 was a main way for many years until I-70 arrived and some communties became ghost towns. I liked the story and I liked Lighting's Courage saving The King & The Drive-In scene was good with car versions of Pixar's Hits. I wonder what ""The Boomobile"" would looked like? She would been a 1974 Dodge Monaco, black sedan. Matt Wagner's characters, Kevin Matchstick & Edsel would be cars & Kevin would be a black, 1968 Mustang with a white lighting bolt on the hood & Edsel would be a red & white, 1959 Edsel Corsair Sedan and her mouth is the vertical grille.

","This was the only Pixar film I gave a miss at the cinema. I just couldn't buy the premise of a world full of talking cars. I don't know why, I just couldn't, despite the fact I rate Toy Story the greatest CGI animated film of all time. Some Pixar faithful fan I turn out to be, one who has followed their progress since the 80's, being awestruck at their short 5 min animated films that took them a painstaking 3-5 years to make each one. As a budding Spectrum/Commodore computer programming enthusiast at the time, they were like God, and no one knew who they were and what they would eventually become, lead by the great John Lassiter.<br/><br/>And so with this guilty conscious hovering over me, I finally got round to watching my poor Cars ""why haven't you watch me yet? Have I done something wrong?"" DVD.<br/><br/>As I watched the first 10 minutes, my fears of still not buying into this world of talking cars, still held me prisoner. It started off straight away with the razzmatazz of car racing and an extremely obnoxious character who to my horror I realised was the main antagonist of the movie. There was no soul. I shook my head at this point and thought, well, you had an amazing run, Pixar, and you did recover with Ratatouille and Wall-E so this one bad film is just a glitch. Then the plot of the film took a turn as our obnoxious antagonist ends up in a town called Radiator Springs, a quiet struggling and run down town. And it is here that I realised for the first time what a complete idiot I was, what a Judas I have been for turning my back on my childhood heroes. It is from here that the joys of every Pixar film of the past exploded into my senses and then I realised why the the first 10 minutes lacked that soul. It was deliberate. It was there as a message that we are living life too fast. Slow down and pause and look around and discover the beauty that surrounds you, the stuff you always took for granted and in some cases destroy. As usual, Pixar characters are larger than life. The funny characters had me in stitches, the antagonist obnoxiousness became endearing, then there were characters who tugs at your heart and none more so than the Doc. I watch this film two weeks after the passing of Paul Newman, and all I can humbly say, he couldn't have had a more fitting end to his remarkable film catalogue with a role in a world so close to his heart. He truly added gravitas to an already great flick.<br/><br/>If you are apprehensive as I was in watching a movie about a world ruled by talking cars, please allow me to dispense your apprehension. Go and get the DVD, put it in the drive, put your feet up and press play and be swept away by John Lassiter's masterful storytelling.<br/><br/>Pixar, forgive me for my momentary doubts and lack of faith. But don't you dare ever sell your soul because that is what breathed life into a lamp, a toy, a fish, a rat, a bug, a boogie monster, a robot, and a god damn car! I mean, how the hell did they get me to love and even cry over a blasted rusted car!"

","As with all of Pixar's previous releases, I keep finding myself coming back for more. No matter how many times I see it, I'm actually excited about seeing it again. This is mainly because Pixar spends so much time on the story. Here, the plot twists and turns, splitting apart so that everything can interweave and meet in the end. Such issues that take center stage here are family, friendship and love, with a slice of social commentary on the side. Here, each issue has time to gradually build until everything peaks near the end of the film. To say it's ""feel-good"" would be an understatement, but anyone familiar with Pixar should know this by now.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent and the voices fit the characters so perfectly that they become almost inseparable. The actors may not have always had a say on how their characters look, but I don't think they should be complaining; they're all spot-on. Seriously, I usually hate Larry the Cable Guy, but his character ""Mater"" was adorable, funny and plays a rather important role in the film. George Carlin (rest his soul) plays, quite appropriately, a hippie Volkswagen van, Cheech Marin plays a painted lowrider... these could've simply been amusing caricatures, but they were also made genuine elements of the film's emotional world. About the soundtrack... though this kind of music is usually suited for NASCAR fans, it actually fits the film quite well and *gasp* doesn't make me want to sandpaper my face off!<br/><br/>Oh, and the visuals are stunning, even by Pixar's standards. There are countless moments that beckon ""ooh""s and ""ahh""s. This is especially true in the scene where Lightning and Sally go for a drive. All in all though, this is a film well-worth seeing, both for children and adults. It's a film about family, friends and love, but also about the places we call home."

But yet- there are still those surges when Cars fans once again get an urge and watch the movie.<br/><br/>I really just wanted to see this movie because it was a Pixar film. Truly, I didn't care if it had been about flying spiders or frogs in a blender- it's Pixar, isn't it? I went on June 11th 2006 to see this movie with a friend. To tell the truth, I left the theater thinking 'THIS is truly Pixar's downfall'.<br/><br/>A month later, I was re-reading the Star Wars Guide To The Characters- I was a huge Star Wars fan- and I realized I'd read it too many times. I picked up a Boba Fett book, but for the first time since probably May 2005, I put it down. I didn't want to watch Star Wars, didn't want to read it. I felt that I couldn't.<br/><br/>Suddenly, I realized something- Star Wars was for the people born when it first came out. Not many kids my age liked it.<br/><br/>I moved on to Monsters Inc the next day. Talk about a dying fandom! No one updated their stories, no one talked on the IMDb boards. It was boring.<br/><br/>Skip to November, 2006. Picture me, my dad, my brother, and my mom watching Cars on the TV on the DVD player. Me, cheering for Lightning McQueen. My mom, falling asleep, claiming it's boring. My dad, staring at the TV like what the heck? My brother, doing the same.<br/><br/>By November, I'd started a Cars series- not because I liked the movie, but because I needed to write something, and Cars was the first idea. But yet- there was something else. A spark inside me whenever I so much as heard the word 'lightning'. A feeling that you can't ignore- and the same thing I'd felt at the height of my Star Wars obsession.<br/><br/>I was obsessed with Cars.<br/><br/>Suddenly I realized something- Cars was awesome. It was like being hit by a baseball and realizing it hurts.<br/><br/>Like a grasshopper jumping from place to place, I normally jump from obsession to obsession. And yet- I'm stuck on Cars. It's something about that Pixar magic mixed with the different thoughts of a different world, where you're a car.<br/><br/>No having to earn a driver's license, and you can drive anywhere anytime. Faster than people.<br/><br/>Pixar is a movie making studio that comes out with a movie once a year, sometimes skipping a year. They skipped 2005, when I started my Star Wars obsession.

I've never liked Randy Newmans contribution, but this time the score is really working. The songs are also enjoyable and the script is well written - and sometimes little bit unpredictable.<br/><br/>The reason that I'm giving ""Cars"" a 9 out of 10 is because of one little thing; the movie is too long! It could have been cut down a little bit.<br/><br/>The critics where rougher on ""Cars"" comparing to the other Pixar movies, which I think it's undeserved.

Wonderful movie that I watch many times (and I don't even have any kids). This is a great family movie or if you're just looking for a funny clean movie to see on a rainy day. No, this one isn't only for kids. It's for anyone that likes good times, racing, and good humor! I was very impressed with the animation. The environment was so beautiful and it looked almost real. (PS: Darrell Cartrip's 'boogity boogity' remarks in the movie are Darrell Waltrip's actual comments when a NASCAR race begins.)"
"dsl3001","9","0","0","3 June 2007"," another great Pixar
","When I first saw this movie I didn't know if I would like it or not. It's just that it didn't get really good reviews but I disagreed this is another great movie from pixar. It's about a HOTSHOT rookie race car who first just cares about winning and getting awards. But he accidentally takes a wrong and goes down route 66 then he accidentally drives into the long lost town of Radiator Springs. Then he learns that there's more to life than winning and awards. That is pretty much the main plot of it. We will be seeing RATATOILLE soon and if there was another pixar after that I would think they would need to make more sequels of other Pixars besides Toy Story. Like I said it's another great movie from Pixar if you get a chance to watch it don't miss it."

","I needed to make the dishes man, okay. I don't support my kid to have telly in his eyes except 30 mins every day but this flick really blow-ed away that goal. So i put on this DVD to my kid, one time only (I thought). I knew he like cars in general so I thought, wouuu, I well a movie about cars, called Cars, might do the trick. Damn! 3 months later the kid, every days says to me ""wauu wauu"" (the sound of a car ;)), He has seen the damn thing every day instead of the local kids show, when i try to put on anything else he goes sick ""WOUUU WOUUUU"". So I have seen the movie for a while with my little prince and, well, I'm not as freaked out as him but I still see parts that I can laugh about, and, ""hey, haven't noticed that, eyy"". Great movie for a kid and well, a bad conscience for a parent (should have played cars with him instead of let him see the bloody thing)."

","OK, I watched it and loved. Unfortunately I got sick watching it in the movies last summer, but eventually that year I got to see it again, rented then I got it for Christmas. Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson, Starsky and Hutch) is a cocky racecar that lands in Radiator Springs and meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, Git-R-Done) and also falls in love with Sally (Bonnie Hunt, Cheaper by the Dozen). Unfortunately he also has to deal with Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, unknown films), who really hates him, but then later realizes that he's a really known racecar and has to deal with a super cocky racecar, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, Beetlejuice). It spoofs off of NASCAR actually. I loved the quotes ""Morning, sleeping beauty"", ""He did what in his cup?!"" and ""McQueen and Sally, parked beneath a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-T"". I would of listed the other quotes, but I don't have time. But anyways, rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it on DVD. Watch the Mater and Ghostlight. It's really funny XD."

The characters are totally lovable, 'specially Mater, who is the comic relief of the flick. We're even sick of ""git er dun"" but loved his down-home charm in Cars. Last time, when our son asked to watch his ""racin cars"" Daddy turned on NASCAR qualifying, but he replied, ""No, Daddy, *MY* racin car show."" He's claimed it as his own & we love it too.

","""CARS"" (2006): I'm just going to repeat myself: Pixar CANNOT be beaten in the visual animation & cartoon story market. The visuals are SUPERB. Detailing, light/shadow, texture, perspective, wit, and characters with soul, make their (predictable theme) stories pure pleasure. Within the stories are the family/societal lessons we expect from Disney (whenever they've been at their best), and, they (the Corporation) SEEM to have the SENSE to leave the Pixar people alone. Pixar approaches a project as MORE than just ""another cartoon"", and the results are there to see and feel. Not since the Fleischer brothers of the 20's, 30's, and 40's, has anyone been more innovative and thorough. Pixar kicks everyone's butts - including the good looking but generally empty products of their main competitor. To make the comparison, rent ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz"". Watch them both on one night. ""Antz"" first. That says it all. ""CARS"" is a must-own for me."

","I LOVE this film. It is fun, exciting and it's about cars in a new perspective! I LOVE this film. I don't need to tell you again - do I? <br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is a young racing car who has almost won his first race! Unfortunately, he didn't quite make it.

However, Mac, his carrier falls asleep on the way to the racing track and Lightning McQueen falls out, getting lost! :( He ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs in the middle of the desert ...<br/><br/>Here are the five main reasons I LOVE this film. One: I love the Pixar perfect animation, especially the desert scenes. Two: All the characters are likable, except for Chick, who I think sucks (he's the main baddie but luckily doesn't appear much). Three: The plot in this is well-thought up, unlike many cartoon films these days. Four: I like how Lightning McQueen learns his lesson near the end of the film. This improves his character - then he isn't just a racing car who wants to win. Five: The voices suit the characters. I like Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson), Mater's (Larry the cable guy) and Sally's (Bonnie Hunt) voices best. <br/><br/>So, if you haven't watched this, then DO! :) ;) :()"

","What a wonderful movie,i thought maybe because of the car type animation it would be a waste of money to see.Was i wrong,this movie had me laughing to the end.The cars on how they moved and raced you would think your watching an actual race at daytona.The shading and movement of background themes was amazing in every way.Even the bits of gravel being left behind the racers tires on each turn or straight way and off of their tires itself.Incredible details to the environment wowed me,the people at pixar out did themselves with this film.I loved the characters such as Owen Wilson,Paul Newman,bonnie hunt cheech Marin and a host of others to make this film a great family show.Paul Newman especially because of his actual racing days which coincide very well with the films genre.It is sad to hear Joe ranfts passing away though,he did bring most or all of the characters to life with his imagination that gave kids the world over wonderful creatures they can learn to love.But with pixar,they will always bring forth the fun kids and adults love and love to watch.Fantastic work all,hopefully we will have a new adventure."

He is constantly repeating one-liners from Mater and Lightning McQueen - ""That's what they done did said, and KaChow are his favorites. He has watched it up to 4 times in one day. He has a fit if he can't watch it at least once. I have bought other movies to try to pull him away from it - because all though it's an extremely cute movie, there are only so many times I can watch it! The other movies don't work. Barnyard and Open Season still didn't pull this boy away from his CARS movie! The cars in this movie are very human like. It is amazing how they made it so real. My kids know all the characters by name and like the different personalities of them all. Comparing the movie to others - like Bugs Life or Ice Age - I would have to say that this one is better than both. The story line is better because it actually relates to the way humans should/would behave. I like that."

","When I first saw the ads and trailers for ""Cars"" all I thought is ""A lot like the kids show ""Auto be Goode"", I'll pass."" Then I was shopping for ... something... in the Electronics department of WalMart. They just so happened to be showing ""Cars"" on some of their TVs. One character was commenting about how things used to be on the ""Mother Road"". I'll admit that my eyes got a bit moist at the gorgeous scenery thinking of the times I had traveled Route 66 and the like, myself. Once I drove it 'all the way' (sort of) from Chi Town to LA - but almost half of it was routed onto the 'newfangled' Interstate. And, like some of the characters feel 'yeah, it's quicker - but where's the SOUL of an Interstate?'<br/><br/>Well, I had to see it 'just once' so I rented it. I was NOT disappointed! The plot, the characters, EVERYTHING made the movie SO easy to get into! But, hey, this kid (61) is ""The next of kin to the wayward wind""! I love to drive to ""Have a good time""! My ex-wife and I 'blue roaded' from Oklahoma City to LA and back on a motorcycle (4,200 miles and only 250 on the Freeway)! Obviously, I bought the movie! There are parts of the movie (that are FAR too short) that I can deeply enjoy even with the sound OFF and scenes that I'd almost consider capturing, printing, framing and hanging on the wall!<br/><br/>They say the 'lesson' of the movie is the importance of ""friendship and family"" but another statement that this movie makes is that there's more to life than the concrete caverns of the Big City and the next quarter!

"robertmbfan-1","8","0","0","3 February 2007"," Almost the Best!
","When I saw this movie, I had lots of feelings. I loved the graphics so much, it looked so real yet the character and fun in each car made it not 100% real. I think Cars is almost the best.<br/><br/>I voted 8 for a few reasons. First, Dinosaur is my favorite movie, so it would of been 9 if it weren't for a few minor flaws in the movie.<br/><br/>For one thing at the beginning when lightning is just getting out of the truck he bumps a tiny bit before the camera shows the area around lightning. Also during the news scene at the beginning where they are showing the three cars, as they show the names of each car and a colored arrow points down to the three cars, the green on to the middle guy isn't exactly on the car as the red and blue one is.<br/><br/>But other than that the movie is very good and the graphics are perfect, and the story is okay but where are the big bad guys that are in every movie on the planet? Also it was very funny when the statue of the founder of Route 99 flew in the air when lightning was panicking when he first entered the town and the statue some how got back into the proper place and the wheel hits the statue and the water goes back on! To me Cars should get a 10 but because of what I mentioned above Cars is pretty great anyways. 8 For Cars!"

","What do Richard Petty, Owen Wilson, & Paul Newman have in common? They're all in Walt Disney and Pixar's latest film 'Cars'. The story revolves around a rookie race car learning that life isn't about where you're going, but how you get there. Now I'll admit, last fall when I first heard about this movie I completely wrote it off as being utterly preposterous. Why? Simply because the idea of talking cars didn't seem entertaining in the least. It actually wasn't until the day before its release I said, wow, I think Disney's got something here. (Which only proved to be true after seeing it the next day.) John Lassester, the man who took us into the world of toys in 'Toy Story' and on a search for a young clown fish in 'Finding Nemo' has done it once again. First off, there's Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson) funny and irresistibly lovable new best friend, Mater. (Larry the Cable Guy) He adds to 'Cars' what Scrat the squirrel does in the 'Ice Age' films. Now don't get me wrong, many of the other characters featured in the film are plenty likable, but Mater is the glue that brings it all together. Also in 'Cars' the animation is superb. It doesn't have the same style or look the other Pixar films have. I don't really know how to describe it, but it's certainly something.<br/><br/>But, as almost all movies, 'Cars' does have a drawback. It's missing something. That special something only Disney and Pixar can add that made 'Toy Story' what it is, a great movie. I'm not sure why, but it's just not there. I imagine in the end 'Cars' will just fall short of having the longevity and memorability films like 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters, Inc.' & 'Toy Story' will. Despite this, 'Cars' is still a winner and manages to be excellent. Not a classic, but excellent. I highly recommend seeing it at least once to give it a test drive."
"shagangmaneandelfinacup1","9","0","0","31 January 2007"," The best car-related movie for the family!
","When I first saw Herbie: Fully Loaded, I was so shocked at the old buggy forcing Lindsey Logan onto its seat that it ended up strapping me to my place; I ended up loving it because of this ""shock factor"" that Herbie gave me! As for Cars, I wasn't attracted to it out of any factor--in fact, I had doubts about the movie due to its car-related jokes, and doubted that it would live up to the Pixar name. But once I saw it on Pay-Per-View, I kept thinking to myself, I just gotta see this again! And I did. And I still loved it. Why? It was so adorable and touching, it was worth it to see it a second time--not to mention that although quite a number of jokes here are car-related or come off as mildly crude, they're still great enough for a laugh-fest, a chuckle, and maybe a smirk or two.<br/><br/>The story behind all this is as goes: Lightning McQueen, a rookie race car whose dream is to win the Piston Cup and a sponsor from Dinoco, loses his way and ends up in Radiator Springs, or, as he calls it, ""hillbilly hell"". There he meets a handful of diverse characters, such as Mater (one of my favorite characters), who becomes a good friend despite all differences, Luigi, an Italian car who prefers Ferraris to Lightning's type, Red (another favorite), a shy and sensitive fire truck, and Sally, a Porche (?) with both sweet and sassy sides to her. And also while there, he wrecks the road and was thus ordered to fix it, dragging a cement-producing machine nicknamed ""Bessie"". But through Mater, Sally, and an ex-racer named Doc Hudson, he eventually opens his eyes to the true beauty of Route 66, and he not only repairs the street, but also helped everyone in the small town as well! Tension rises as he is found and sent to compete in the Piston Cup against his rival, Chick Hicks, but with his new friends' support, he won much more than a race--he won the appreciation and kindness of many.<br/><br/>This movie is not only of trademarked Pixar-quality, but it also features some of the best country and country-esquire music in modern movie history. From the highly awarded ""Life is a Highway"" to the two different versions of ""Route 66"", the soundtrack will have you jamming and jiving throughout the film.<br/><br/>As for downsides, the film does have a tendency to drag in some parts, and, like I've mentioned a couple of times, the humor is mainly car-related and/or mildly inappropriate, so it might not appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>Overall, Cars may not be fast-paced as Lightning claims it to be, but with the help of a well-known company with a little lamp for its mascot, it brings out a level of cuteness and light-hearted emotions that most other movies are unable to reach.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

","I will maintain my same opinion about animations: it is hard to go wrong with an animation. Some are better than others sure, but I have yet to see a terrible animation. Having said that, ""Cars"" is one of the better animations. Even though I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson I was able to forget that it was his voice behind Lightning McQueen. Cars was a real feel good story with a good message and pretty darn funny as well. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was particularly funny, even though I don't find his stand-up all that. Pixar has found a winning formula, they need only stick with it, and hopefully Disney doesn't continue to squeeze them."

The cars, the scenery, and just the general feel of the movie will get the average gear-head into the mood to go out and turn a wrench, pull out the old photo album, or just sit back and remember how cool that old road really was. I still live in Chicago, and driving down Ogden avenue will still remind you of what it was all about. Go get the DVD, and sit back and enjoy."
"general-melchett","9","0","0","15 January 2007"," Pixar have done it again!
","Pixar's latest animated film has been good. Very good, in fact - though it is just another one of the swarm of animated films that invaded cinemas in 2006, the idea to have cars as talking, living characters is an ingenious and original one that makes a nice change from the usual talking-animal fare. The visual effects in this film are neat - the cars actually gleam and the colours are immensely saturated, which makes for a very colourful flick which kids will enjoy looking at. The sound is also nice as well - especially in the cinemas. But while this film more than delivers on the visual and audio scales, there's actually a brilliant story to be found with it. The film is full of interesting new characters that the audience will quickly identify with - from the elusive 50s auto Doc Hudson to the rusty tow-truck Mater. The film has quite a touching story that has happened in real life - how big famous people's fortunes take a tumble and they are reduced to small-town life, but quickly realise the joys of it and let their new buddies help them make their way to the top again. Though the film isn't exactly a laugh-a-minute riot on the comedy scales, it is something very different - these cars are people. Their losses in the past are brought to us in a touching way that may bring back memories to people who have suffered similar losses in life. Cars isn't realistic and you won't need to explain it to young kids or start a long discussion about it at the tea table, but it still is a bloody good movie, and we don't care about realism any more. Pixar aren't about to lose their throne as animation kings yet. This new world has two sides to it - a side of celebrities and paparazzi and one side of small-town folk, very much like in real life. And these two worlds brilliantly clash with the arrival of cocky Lightning McQueen in the small town of Radiator Springs. McQueen has to accept his new fate and use his new buddies, who he initially doesn't like but soon needs them more than ever. Some could say Cars was overlong, but there's so much story to tell and so much character to cram in that it is actually the ideal length. A bit more interaction between the celebrity and ordinary-car worlds would have been nice, though to be fair, this film did revolve around exile, loss, and friendship, and you'll be so caught up in the hugely-original premise of romance between cars that you won't care anyway. Stunning! 9/10"

","""Cars"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: John Lasseter <br/><br/>Starring: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, & Tony Shalhoub<br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""G"" <br/><br/>Disney and Pixar team up once again to continue the legacy of animated excellence. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""Finding Nemo"" more than once. They are amazing animated movies that are entertaining for all ages. They have proved to be modern classics. The question now is: does ""Cars"" live up to the Disney and Pixar legacy? Does it retain the same excellence executed so brilliantly in the four movies that came before it? Well, mostly yesbut a pinch of no. ""Cars"" is a charming family movie with an excellent array of intriguing characters and a wonderful voice-over cast. But, there was something missing and I'm still not sure what it is. It just wasn't quite as good as the other projects from Disney and Pixarwhich, please let me stress, does not mean that ""Cars"" is not a good movie--quite the opposite actually. ""Cars"" kept me entertained throughout and presented a seamless balance between entertaining adults and entertaining kids. If you were a fan of the other Disney/Pixar, then ""Cars"" will, no doubt, find a warm place in your heart, as well. Though, don't expect this to surpass the likes of ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (voiced by Wilson) is a big-time racecar who has the chance to win the Piston Cup, gain better sponsoring, and become the greatest champion racing has ever seen. But, on his way to the cup, he accidentally falls off of the truck carrying him and crashes into the small town of Radiator Springs, home to eclectic bunch of cars, including Mayor Doc Hudson (voiced by Newman) and the beautiful attorney, Sally (voiced by Hunt). McQueen accidentally destroys the only road in the town and, as punishment, is sentenced to community service. He must repair the road before he can leave. As all of his plans for escape fail miserably, McQueen slowly becomes closer to the somewhat wacky citizens of Radiator Springsespecially to Sally. But, with the Piston Cup quickly growing, will Lightning choose his old lifestyle or will he stay at the quirky, but lovable Radiator Springshis one chance to find a caring place in the world. Life is a journey. Enjoy the trip.<br/><br/>I missed ""Cars"" in theaters, but I managed to watch it at the school (where I work) with my group of children (all are in Kindergarten). I, as well as the two teachers with whom I work and every student, had a blast. ""Cars"" shows that I should probably rethink my average reviews of such animated films as ""The Wild"". If Disney and Pixar (combined) can consistently make amazing animated movies year after year, then why shouldn't any other studio? But, that is beside the point. ""Cars"" has got some of the best laughs in the world and is amazingly creative. The cars in this movie all have very human characteristics transformed to feet the fact that they are automobiles. If you have ever been to a concert or to any big event, you have probably done ""The Wave"". The cars also do the waveexcept instead of raising their arms in the air, they flash their headlights. The movie is filled with moments like these and ""Cars"" seems to enjoy packing itself with small bits of humor that you will miss on your first showing. I know that, even though I have seen the movie approximately three times, I still haven't found everything.<br/><br/>I know that the ""Cars"" fanboys will probably give me heat for thisand I am sure that many of them will probably discontinue reading this review at my very next sentence. ""Cars"" seems far too similar to ""Doc Hollywood""--and that, my friends, is the problem. Disney and Pixar, when together, typically revel in their original story lines. Yet, ""Cars"" was far too reminiscent of the Michael J. Fox comedy from 1991. Trade a wealthy, young doctor for a cocky, young racecar and you have ""Cars"". I really must admit that this was the most disappointing aspect of the movie, though I am sure that most six-year-olds have never even heard of ""Doc Hollywood"" or even of Michael J. Fox. However, ""Cars"" almost completely makes up for that with its creativity everywhere else and with its characters. The bright spot of ""Cars"" is the cars themselves. Everyone, from Lightning McQueen to Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), seem to have their own personalities. ""Cars"" proves that, if you want a good animated movie, Disney/Pixar is STILL the company to trust.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Though not the best film from Disney and Pixar, it is easily one the best animated movies of the year.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)"

We stopped of many tourist attractions along the way and some that were a bit out of the way too. We were not in hurry to get where we were going so we enjoyed the trip as a family. The Grand Canyon, The Colorado River, The Painted Dessert, Petrified Forrest, Four Corners, Cave Dwellings, Navajo Villages, Olde Town of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Aspen, Vail, Hover Dam, Las Vegas were all places we got to stop and spend some time in.

Pixar knows how to make you love all their characters, because all of them are special in their own way. They even seem to exist in the real life. Compared to the latest animation movies, Cars is different because it makes you think that we live in a world where people actually use to race in order to win something. Anything. And that is true. And from Cars we remember that friends are more important than prizes. Than anything in the world. So... Pixar... keep going and sorry for the co-producer. May he rest in peace."

","CARS may be lost on some generations intervening children and those who lived in the 1950's and 60's, but for those fortunate enough to have seen and lived in America before the rise of the superhighway and the sad demise of small towns, this film is wondrously sentimental and potentially tear-jerking. For me, the highlight of CARS is Sally's revelation of her affinity for Radiator Springs, as both she and Lightning McQueen gaze off into (what presumably is) the Grand Canyon (accompanied by Randy Newman's song ""Our Town,"" as performed by James Taylor). CARS is the perfect film for grandparents and grandchildren to see together, since it's a fitting vehicle for cross-generational dialog and an examination of what's important in substantive human relationships. The anthropomorphizing of cars is useful here, because sometimes it's unrealistic to expect humans themselves to be capable of speaking with such clarity on the nature of their own condition. On a more immediate level, CARS is a visual and auditory feast."

","Cars is a must see for everyone. Take a person who says that they are an adult and don't watch cartoons. This movie will change their minds.<br/><br/>The characters are done so well that by the end of the movie you forget they are cars. It is great to see good old entertainment, the world is filled with reality, it is time to let yourself get entertained. Along with being a wonderful movie it has a great sound track that will have you tapping your feet and wanting to buy the sound track afterwards. Here is one thing that people miss, don't be in a hurry to leave and please sit through the credits until the end to see the final scene, you don't want to miss it.<br/><br/>This movie also has a wonderful theme of how important friends and family are. <br/><br/>Take the family, friends, anyone they will thank you."

","On his way to a big event in California, a conceited race car finds himself stuck in Radiator Springs, a tiny town in the middle of the desert. It's a typical podunk burg, the very epicenter of Hicksville, and the clean n' shiny supercharger doesn't know how to cope. But cope he must, as during his grand entrance he wrecked a good portion of the town's road.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a pretty sheltered car - he doesn't even have headlights, since race cars don't need them (the whole track's lit, y'see). But he's not happy with his life as it currently stands; he dreams of winning the famed Piston Cup - even better, of becoming the first rookie car to do so. But the final race of the season winds up a three-way tie, thanks in equal parts to Lightning's refusal to stop for new tires midrace and his apparently long tongue. At any rate, a special race is scheduled in one week's time. Naturally, along the way, Lightning is somehow separated from the truck transporting him, and he finds himself in the active, hoppin' Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>At first the judge in town, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), just wants Lightning to leave as soon as possible, but he's quickly convinced otherwise by Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), who thinks Lightning oughta fix the road he's done tore up. Which is only fair, seeing also as he's the only vehicle in town with enough horsepower to pull the big ol' tarring contraption.<br/><br/>While he's there, Lightning naturally makes the acquaintance of the other (few) citizens. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), the town tow truck, immediately befriends Lightning; others include Ramone (Cheech Marin), Flo (Jenifer Lewis), Fillmore (George Carlin), Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), and Sarge (Paul Dooley).<br/><br/>By now, we're all used to Pixar's animation prowess, but they constantly top themselves. There are no humans in his film. It's not that there aren't any in the story, there aren't any in the cars universe. For instance, the stands at the races are filled with vehicles of all kinds (the inner circle is filled with RV trailers). The motel in Radiator Springs is a series of - get this - traffic cones. The pit crews are made up of small, handy vehicles. There's even a field populated not by cows but by tractors (Lightning and Mater go tractor tipping), watched over by a gigantic plow.<br/><br/>But even with all of the cars, trucks, and whatnot floating around, even more impressive is the absolute crystal-clear detail in the backgrounds, particularly the canyon and desert sequences. Even if you pause your DVD player and squint reaaaaally hard, you can't really tell that these aren't photographs. And, of course, when they're moving a regular speed your subconscious can't tell, either. Check out the splash when Sally and Lightning drive through a puddle, and tell me that's not as realistic as a photo. Go on, do it.<br/><br/>As with the best Disney films, one has to care about the characters, I mean really care about what happens to them. It's not enough to have someone with dreams of success if that character isn't all that fascinating to begin with. But Lightning McQueen, bless his self-absorbed self, is appealing, even charming in a preening, egocentric kind of way. See, he's never really experienced life outside of his racing existence, and he's always seen his winning the Piston Cup as a way to better himself. Little does he know, of course, that his life will wind up being bettered by the denizens of Radiator Springs - and one certain Porsche in particular - whether he likes it or not! The movie's similar in theme to Michael J. Fox's Doc Hollywood (1991), in which a hotshot doctor gets stuck in a tiny town and has to offer medical services to get his car fixed.The entire cast is a hoot, especially Carlin's hippie, alternative-fuel Volkswagen minibus - a clear descendant of the comic's late sixties' Hippy Dippy Weather Man. Good times, good times.<br/><br/>The main themes are enjoying what one has and embracing different and new people (er, vehicles), but there's also a side theme of innocent lost. Radiator Springs takes place on the famed Route 66, just a hair's width away from Interstate 40. It seems that back in the day, Radiator Springs was THE place to stop if one were traveling along 66. But then the interstate was built just to the north, bypassing the town by just a few minutes' drive. And now no one ever stops. It's a wry commentary on the real-life Route 66, what parts of it still exist, a true monument to the American spirit.<br/><br/>A fantastic ride from start to checkered flag, Cars is the perfect animated feature - gaggles of giggles for the little tykes and a bevy of knowing jokes for the grownup kids."

The movie gets a grip on you right from the word go when the race starts. The voices of folks and expressions the ""Cars"" have on their faces is something just not possible in real life to see on any actors as well ;) The movie has a strong moral in it as well and shows how the young if manages his skill well and gets rid of sad ,don't care attitude can make a lot of difference to the world. At a point of time the movie made me so emotional that i was about to cry,but the very next moment they bring out something funny and motivating and things start going positive. This is truly a masterpiece and amazing piece of work. Its a must watch even for kids. The end is great and i wished the movie was longer even though its a long enough movie. Only reason i gave it 9 is there was a point of time in the movie where they should have explained about the ""Route 66"" problem a little earlier than they have talked about. For people who don't know anything about Geography might have had a little curious thought about that. A MUST SEE MOVIE !!!"

Good things come in small packages, and true friends value you for who you are, not what you have. <br/><br/>And like every family film, it's predictable.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this entire movie, and it really had a lot of creative bits when using the cars versus real people theme. To make it quick, I thought the 3D animation was a bit 'cartoony', but it really made it one of the easiest animated films to watch. Being a fan of automobiles and racing myself, I felt that not a whole lot of connections with various kinds of racing was ever noticed (just Nascar -- which isn't all that special).

Speed … I am Speed… and when the same line gets repeated at the end of the movie, you get up having the effect of watching a action movie, the story is all about a racing car ""Lighting McQueen"" who wants to win the piston cup, and he gets stuck in the middle of a town on his way to the racing field and what happens there is the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The kind of attention given is interesting, even the bugs which come here is in car shape and the statues are too shaped in car symbols.

","I started this movie looking for entertainment for my grandson, and ended up enthralled and enchanted by this wonderful movie. It's hard to imagine that animation can be made to look so realistic, and much of the time I had to remind myself that cars can't really talk like that. The ability animators have to inject realism into a movie has never been better illustrated. It's a far cry from the way things were when I was young.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie were both diverse and extremely likable. Well, not all of the characters were likable, but I'll let everyone decide for themselves who is and who isn't. A fun part for me was figuring out which actor's voice went with each character. I was surprised how much Bonnie Hunt sounds like Ellen DeGeneres. It seems to me that each actor brought a little of their own personality to their character, which greatly contributed to the overall movie.<br/><br/>My only problem with this movie (and it's a small one) is the storyline. The plot is very reminiscent of ""Doc Hollywood"" (starring Michael J. Fox), with a little touch of ""American Graffiti"" thrown in during one short segment. But, it's only a small problem because I loved both of those movies.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend this movie for all to watch and enjoy. It's a delightful movie experience!"
"ExpendableMan","8","0","0","24 November 2006"," A visual feast with a storyline to boot
","The concept of talking cartoon cars having an adventure doesn't sound like a thrilling premise for a movie does it? Sounds a bit Thomas the Tank Engine without a railway line right? Well you can cast all doubts aside because Pixar have triumphed yet again, proving once and for all why they are the undisputed leaders when it comes to computer generated family entertainment. And by family entertainment I don't just mean to label it as the sort of film little kids enjoy, parents endure and everyone between the ages of twelve and twenty two avoids, because this is a richly rewarding two hours that anyone, regardless of age can enjoy.<br/><br/>As always with Pixar movies, much of the appeal comes from the visuals and here, they excel. From the jam packed stadiums at the opening to the gorgeous depiction of the American desert, we are given a lush world that is pure visual candy and it doesn't end with the wide angle landscapes either, for the character design is top notch too. Cars by their very nature may be metallic and featureless, but these are not cars, these are characters and there is a world of emotion etched on their faces which puts most real life actors to shame.<br/><br/>However, the reason why Cars triumphs isn't because of the visuals, it's because of the storyline. Sure, the tale of a big headed race car getting stuck in a small town and learning to slow down once in a while is somewhat clichéd, but is imbued with so much depth and characterisation it doesn't matter. You come to care about all these offbeat automobiles and they'll make you laugh and cry in equal amount. Of particular note here is Larry the Cable Guy's work as Mater, the dim witted redneck tow-truck. It is testament to the script writers abilities that Mater is such a lovable fellow and he effectively steals the entire film when he could very easily have been the most irritating character to appear since George Lucas rolled out a certain Rastafarian Amphibian.<br/><br/>Of course, you could put the reasons for it being so enjoyable down to the fact that expectations were not as high for this one as they were for the likes of Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc, but that would do a disservice to the beautifully crafted film on offer. It's not perfect and is let down by a rather contrived romance subplot which relies on the usual tactics of the two leads chatting and laughing nervously together at the same time, but that minor gripe aside, it's second only to The Incredibles. Pixar's track record is still intact and while some of you may be a little put off by the somewhat childish subject matter consider this; at least they're not talking animals."

"PorpoiseMuffins","10","0","0","16 November 2006"," Kachow! Pixar does it again!
","Cars is one of those movies that only Pixar would dare to undertake. Whereas many of Pixar's past successes have been copied by other studios, Cars is a concept that stands alone. The attention to detail in Cars, in everything from the motion of the vehicles to the breathtaking settings and animation, is simply astounding. When Pixar decides to create a movie, they do it right. They do their research and it pays off.<br/><br/>With Cars, Pixar has created a world populated solely by vehicles; a world in which machines not only have faces-- but have real heart and soul. Pixar's mechanical world is fleshed out enough to suspend disbelief without insulting or eliminating the need for the audience's imagination.<br/><br/>The concept of anthropomorphic cars without humans may not sit perfectly in a logical sense, but that's okay-- Much of the movie's unique charm would have been lost with the inclusion of humans. The world of Cars is an alternate interpretation of our own-- it's a ""what if?"" world. After all, we spend so much time in our vehicles that to someone looking in from the outside, it might appear as though the vehicles were the actual beings inhabiting the Earth rather than the humans within them. Somehow, Cars makes surprising sense... perhaps in some ways even moreso than the world that we do live in.<br/><br/>Every scene in Cars advances the movie's purpose and the development of each character, and every voice-- even every spoken line-- does the same. Cars is simply really touching. There are plenty of laughs throughout, but the real charm of the movie is its heart. Cars isn't about cheap comedy; it's a movie that makes you genuinely smile if you let it. The characters are diverse and surprisingly realistic, and the character interaction is unparalleled. The message of the movie is not subtle or terribly complex, but it's real. The story isn't anything completely revolutionary, but it's incredibly well polished and superbly executed-- without being overly predictable.<br/><br/>Cars is one of the few movies I've ever felt the desire to watch multiple times just to fully experience all of the detail and heart infused into every scene. To be honest, I'm not a big car guy (I probably wouldn't know an automotive joke if it hit me in the face), I've never cared a lick about racing, and I don't have any emotional ties or great interest in the history of the Midwest... yet I absolutely love this movie.<br/><br/>If nothing else, I think that says a lot."

En route to the race, one of the competitors, Lightning McQueen, the rookie, get separated from his truck and loses his way. Finally he ends up in a small town in the middle of the desert, which is on the edge of ruin. McQueen, whose entrance wrecked a large part of the town, must repair the damage, but can't get his mind off the race. Or can he?<br/><br/>Comments: Pixar delivers once again (not another Nemo - but who can deliver such movies all the time - Nemo was superb). First off, the animation is stellar. I could watch the movie solely to watch the effects. Especially the water effects are spectacular. But, of course, as much effort has been put into the story. Combined with the detailed animation, this story, weaves a humoristic, funny and warm movie, as Pixar usually does. This is a movie that everyone can watch, both grown-ups and kids. Parents with small kids should be warned though! The movie is over two hours long. It's never dull, the entertainment is good throughout the movie, but I could guess that small kids could grow tired of sitting still this long.<br/><br/>As before, characters are an important piece of the movie, and as before Pixar has done well. Owen Wilson is a good choice, and performs well, as Lightning McQueen. Other favourites include Mater, Guido and Luigi.

","I remember seeing this film at the cinema with my friend not long ago, with chocolate and drinks all around us. Two hours later, I left the cinema, smiling and impressed. Yes, Pixar certainly haven't lost their touch as they get older. In fact, I think they're getting better! Owen Wilson is the voice of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant racing car who competes in the Piston Cup: a racing tournament. He ties with two other cars in the finals, so all three must travel to California for a tiebreaker. But on the way, he accidentally ruins a small town named Radiator Springs and is sentenced to community service there, repairing the stuff he destroyed. But as reluctant and stubborn as he is, he learns important lessons about his selfishness from the moral citizens of the town and as the film unravels, he slowly builds up a new, honourable and trustworthy personality.<br/><br/>There have been plenty of CGI films recently, but none can compete with Pixar's films. For example, the graphics in ""Cars"" is simply beautiful. You could actually compare them to a real-life scene or object and the difference would be small. Pixar have done the right colours, excellent real-life feel, all that sort of stuff, and the backgrounds are also nice, ranging from a huge racing stadium to the huge canyons beyond Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>The film also has a good cast on board: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, John Ratzenberger (whose continuing appearances in Pixar films has been turned into an in-joke) and even Paul Newman. Everyone has a different personality, McQueen is the cocky arrogant racer, Mater is a stereotypical hillbilly, Sally is the sweet, pretty female car, and Doc is an old, serious car. There are lots of puns which will get laughs out of you and the plot hooks you and has you stay in your seat. Also, the voices of the cast match their car's looks and personality perfectly, which I found a nice touch.<br/><br/>I also give ""Cars"" points for originality: talking cars. A simple idea, but executed fantastically. The cars' windscreens are eyes. Their grilles are mouths. And their wheels are basically feet and legs. It's easy to take a liking to this, plus the everyday objects that the cars use are quite cool (fuel is water to them, rust is dirt to them, etc).<br/><br/>Parents will also be pretty impressed by this film and how it delivers something for everyone, from relaxing scenes of drives in Radiator Springs for the calm ones, and the tense action-packed racing for the boys.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Pixar have yet again given us a perfect example of what a kid's film needs to be: a solid, funny and entertaining film with top-notch animation and originality. A must-see film for kids and animation fans."

","I, being an avid NASCAR fan with a 2 year old son, could not wait to see this movie. It was very well written, and has amazing effects. Pixar has once again done a fantastic job in creating the background elements necessary to enhance the movie as a whole. For example when Doc and Lightning are going to race and the command to start the engines is given, you can actually see the vapors coming out of Lightnings exaust blur the scenery in the background. The directors could not have picked better people to do the voices of the characters in this movie, especially Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. All of the characters have such wonderfully funny characteristics, and all combined, they all make the movie extremely enjoyable. The only downfall of this movie in the eyes of a racing fanatic, is that I wish there was more racing action. When you saw the previews, you would think that the entire movie revolved around the racetrack, instead racing is only a small part of the actual movie. However, the lesson learned in Radiator Springs is an important one for the children to learn. I also think that the creators left a way to do a Cars 2, and with the success of the original, they would be crazy not to.

I wish I could live back home, but there are no jobs. <br/><br/>The use of shadows in this movie is probably what struck me the most. The shadow of Mack on the side of the road as he's traveling, the dappled effect on the road as Sally and Lightening are driving, etc. Everything is so subtle that you forget that it's not real. That a group of people actually sat and created this world is astounding. We're so jaded and cynical about everything.

","Many CG animations of today seem to focus on 1 idea: animals. Luckily, that's all about to change with the arrival of Cars, which takes those inanimate objects we all love so much, and blends it into a story where all living life forms are gone.<br/><br/>Cars tells the story of a world occupied by none other then automobiles of all sorts. After a heated NASCAR race, cocky race car, Lighting McQueen rushes off to the stadium where the finals will be held. He wants to be their first so as to get time on the circuit before the big race, but unluckily makes an unplanned detour to Radiator Springs. If the situation can't get any worse, McQueen destroys the main road of the town and is forced to repair it alone.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect of Cars is its animation. The CG is cartoon-like but highly slick and brings a sense of believability to the variety of cars on screen. Industry-standards have been pushed in terms of cartoon CG animation, and Cars is definitely up at the top. Complimenting the visual feast is the voice acting, which is indeed good. Owen Wilson brings a lovely cockiness to Lighting McQueen, and the rest of the cast are all aptly suited to their characters.<br/><br/>Sadly, while Cars does sport a genuinely good script with a good story, it suffers midway with dome dead areas. These sparse in number scenes add nothing of value to the story: they're neither funny nor attempt to add to the characterization, which I'm guessing was their purpose. This is because all the character development is done quite effectively before these scenes occur, or are too long winded before getting to the necessary development. Sadly, this problem sticks out like a sore thorn and really hurts the overall pacing of the story.<br/><br/>Cars is an amazing feat in what it achieves, and will surely be a winner for the entire family, yet it suffers in not being an entirely smooth ride, and sadly can't finish in first place."

","I loved ""Cars"",many kid's movies are just tedious for parents,so is not the case with ""Cars"".A solid two hours is a bit long for a kid to sit still though(I saw it with my three oldest,ages 8,7 and 4½)and they got a bit restless the last 20 minutes or so. Apart from that,they loved it too.Particularly the two oldest who are hardcore racing fans. ""Cars"" is about a new,flashing rookie racing car named McQueen(the Steve reference is for parents probably;).On his way to California for a very important race he takes an involuntary detour to a town where time has stood still since the fifties,no one stops there anymore,and to him the inhabitants are just hillbillies.And what was a very reluctant stay becomes a new life experience for him,with new friends and new values.Winning isn't everything. The animation is stunning,it's almost incredible that it's all ""just animated"". I have only seen it with Swedish voice-overs(because of my kids),but I'd love to see the original version too. I appreciate the more adult references,it gives us parents an extra treat:) I found myself both having a tear in the corner of my eye and getting lost in the beautiful scenery more than once.I think there's not one kid out there who won't love ""Cars""!"

","What happens if humans, animals & even flies are replaced by cars? A world where the wise old ones are Hudson Hornets, the stupid and lazy ones make for corroding tow away vans, the cute ones are Porsche & the flashy racy types are Ferraris & Lamborghinis. Good piece of imagination man! Cars is all about equating BHPs with human behaviour.<br/><br/>This is the story of a talented rookie racing car ""Lightning McQueen"", who transforms from a cocky and Narcist car to a matured one thanks to his unexpected ""pit-stop"" at a sleepy town called ""Radiator Springs"". McQueen is the latest sensation in the Nascar kinda racing track and with the championship season drawing to a close, the coveted ""Piston Cup"" is well within his reach if he can ward off the legendary reigning champion ""The King"" and the evil runner-up Chick Hicks. A win for McQueen will fetch him name, fame, a contract with the most sought after race team and the distinction of being the 1st rookie to win the cup. But fate had something else in store for McQueen as he ends up in a tie with the other two and is forced to another tie breaker race in California. On his way to California, McQueen is separated from his trailer in which he was travelling and is forced to stay back in Radiator Springs town due to a series of unfortunate events.<br/><br/>The cars of the Radiatior Springs are the usual small town folks who are neither aware of nor amused by the superstar status McQueen and is put through a rigourous community service to compensate for the damage he has caused to the town. His subsequent interaction with the town folks transforms him completely from a reckless racing car to a more responsible one and in the meantime earns him a best friend, a mentor and a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Cars is a heartwarming animation movie with well defined characters. Its really funny when it has to be and equally touching and inspiring. The quality of animation is top class and the humour never goes over the top. Overall the perfect weekend movie for kids and adults alike; its a must see for racing enthusiasts (the opening racing scenes are awesome). Go ahead for this movie on top gear, vrooooooooom."
"robfitz1972","8","0","0","3 August 2006"," Full throttle and a change of direction for Pixar
","Dedicated to Joe Ranft, collaborator in just about all of the Pixar movies, there is a distinct change of mood here. A PG certificate for an animated feature is unusual, but then Cars is something of a grown up movie, focusing heavily on Lightning McQueen's long road to redemption. At almost 2 hours, it is also long for an animated feature.<br/><br/>But as there are a plethora of computer animated films doing the rounds at the moment, usually following the formula of casting a few stars, creating a few quirky characters and an average script, then Pixar have always tried to remain one step of the competition. In Cars, they have succeeded with a sound script, brilliant humanisation of a cast full of vehicles and stunning animation, especially with the racing sequences and the backdrop for Radiator Springs, the remote town where Lightning McQueen is convicted and sentenced to a community service that involves repairing the road he had damaged by his own recklessness.<br/><br/>There are moments of fun to be had here, like the flatulent tractors and Mater, the worn down breakdown truck, actually swearing in one scene. But these are few and far between in what is a very serious film. Still, given the circumstances of Ranft's demise, it is perhaps a miracle that the project was even completed. Ultimately, it is unfair to compare Cars with previous Pixar successes as it is so different, even though it is essentially the same team behind this film, with Randy Newman brought in for soundtrack duty and the customary continuation of what happened afterwards during the credits which raises perhaps more laughs than the rest of the film put together.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, this is an excellent film. Perhaps not one for the kids though."

He thinks he's in hillbilly hell when meets the offbeat characters but soon begins to learn the values of friendship, trust, loyalty and teamwork that hold this town together. McQueen grows warm to these characters and realises that there's more to life than fame, fortune and the fast lane. For the motoring maniacs out there cameo roles include Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and the Formula One champion Michael Schumacher as well as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

That is not a bad thing, Do Hollywood is quite an engaging film after all, but it does detract from the originality that the other Pixar films have shown. Nevertheless, the film is undoubtedly well made; the choice of voice actors was excellent and they were well matched to their on-screen characters (Michael Schumacher excepted - surely the Ferrari should be voiced by an Italian).

"genegene","10","0","0","1 August 2006"," This is a very well done animation
","I would like to comment on the recently released Pixar animation, Cars. First of all, I found Cars very entertaining because I could not stop myself from laughing during the whole movie. There was a scene where Lightning McQueen was in a field with his friend, an old tow car, trying to scar the cutting machines that looked like Goofy, but right when they scar off the last machine, an angry cutter appeared and chased them off. That scene was hilarious! <br/><br/>Secondly, the animation of the movie is well done. Even though the characters in the movie are cars, yet, facial expressions on their faces are very detail oriented as if it is real people acting in the movie. They make it more like a real life movie when the audiences of the Piston Cup, which are of course cars, made waves in their seats cheering for Lightning McQueen. Also, the voice casting of the movie did a very good job matching with the personalities of the characters.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Cars to animation lovers because this movie is meaningful and entertaining. The message is not presented in a very serious way and you could really relate to the characters while sharing a good laugh watching the movie. It is good for both adults and children."

","The critical knives were unsheathed for this one (""Has Pixar Lost Its Touch?"" being a common plaint), but on a clearer day ""Cars"" seems to be a very good film. True, the humor tends to generate quiet smiles rather than peals of laughter, and the overall pace and style tends to be extremely laid-back (with the obvious exception of the car racing). <br/><br/>The animation reaches new heights of technical excellence. There are several sections where the line between computer-generated imagery and reality has been erased completely. Whether or not one agrees with the aesthetic goal of pursuing such photographic realism, it represents an enormous achievement - and sets the Pixar studio leagues ahead from the rubbery-looking ""3-D"" characters currently glutting multiplex screens (""Over the Hedge,"" ""Monster House,"" the upcoming ""Barnyard""...write in your own candidate).<br/><br/>For me, Paul Newman's voice work was a minor revelation. He can still sound astonishingly young and vital, then turn around and deliver lines with the age-worn weariness of his octogenarian self. The man remains a terrific actor.<br/><br/>""Cars"" doesn't achieve the near-perfect blend of story and style that marked ""The Incredibles,"" but its merits are far from negligible. <br/><br/>(For what it's worth, this is the only summer '06 movie my 12-year old daughter asked to see twice.)"

","This is a movie which had great potential and could be a great family flick. However, i found it to be a satisfactory film with great room for improvement. <br/><br/>There is no denying that Pixar studios have surpassed themselves again in the ability to create such breathtaking animations. In this movie they mastered the shine on the cars, and the reflection on them. It cannot be faulted, and i give Pixar credit for the animation alone. <br/><br/>The story is based around a race car (Owen Wilson), who thinks he has it all. Until one day he finds himself in a sparsely populated town in the middle of nowhere. He realises what has been missing in his life, as this close community who work together and care for each other show him. Inevitably he falls for the town attorney (Bonnie Hunt), who once had a similar lifestyle as he did, but gave it up for a simple life. <br/><br/>What is meant to be taken away from this film is that having every material aspect in your life fulfilled doesn't make you happy. In the end it's the simple values which make one truly happy. It may be seen as an attack on consumerism and materialism in our modern day world, but then the Disney corporation promote the opposite of what the film's message is trying to say. <br/><br/>I took it for what it was though, and went into the cinema with an open mind. It was spectacular at the beginning, and looked promising. However, it lost its way by the middle of the film, and only at the end was my attention grabbed once more."

","Based on reviews I had seen, I was not expecting too much from this film. This added to my surprise at quite how good a film this is. Another factor might be that we know by now that Pixar appreciate that 'the Devil is in the detail'. Being a sad petrol head I would have been disappointed if the detail had not been observed in terms of the audio and visual aspect of the cars. Sally the Porsche both looked and sounded the part with her flat six burble.<br/><br/>With 'The Incredibles' I don't remember there being quite so much subtle/hidden humour, Cars is packed with it, it takes some effort to keep up the hidden funnies such as the stickers on 'Lightening McQueen'. Also, the quality of images is excellent, the improvement over the last film is significant.<br/><br/>Another quality point is the sympathetic relationship of the actors to their parts. Best case in point being Steve McQueen as the forgotten legend 'Doc Hudson'.<br/><br/>All in all, well done Pixar."

","I had never really watched (or in this case, heard) Owen Wilson before, so up until recently when I saw this film, I didn't think much of him, just a ""dumb blonde"" (in a man way). Needless to say, this film changed my mind.<br/><br/>But what I really saw as interesting I don't think most people saw as interesting. The film was implying something about our society, which is probably what makes me like it so much. And it's all got to do with the object of the title: cars.<br/><br/>Cars surround us. They're displayed in TV ads, mag ads, Internet ads, and public. We love them for their speed, style, and power - everything that hotshot racecar rookie Lightning McQueen (Wilson) has, which is why he makes such a good symbol as a pop icon and the ""hottest new thing."" In our society, we're into the ""hottest"" things, like celebrities, music, action films, iPods, and, well, cars. We can't love these things enough. It's like a jungle of these that we live in, so full and thick that we can't turn without having to see these things.<br/><br/>This jungle may be, in fact, too big. It's so full and thick that we can get lost in there. ""Cars"" is implying that we have to watch our way in order to not get lost from the things that truly matter: family, friendship, and love. Lightning finds these things in Radiator Springs, which symbolizes all those. The cars there may be slow and a little ""rusty"" around the edges (all over the edges literally for Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), but as Doc Hudson (Paul Newman)says, ""they're good people."" The fact that the town is forgotten and off the map implies that in that society, love itself is forgotten. But the fact that the citizens still remain there, faithful to the cozy city, shows that it's not lost, and can get back on the map, which it does.<br/><br/>The first time I heard about this film was in the Parade magazine - when they were reporting that Paul Newman was to lend his voice to it. Despite the fact that I loved Pixar, I was thinking ""oh no."" It was to be their seventh film and, well ... I thought they could do a bit better than talking cars (they didn't put that in the magazine, but what else can it be about?).<br/><br/>In fact, I was still thinking that in the theater. The beginning was even starting to kind of tire. I was thinking ""oh man, why'd I come here?"" But that was immediately erased. Like all Pixar films, the graphics were eye-popping, the jokes were comical, the dialogue was great, and the characters stood out. Lightning McQueen was already gaining my interest as the first Pixar protagonist whom you just want to slap on the face. Paul Newman brought that usual acting talent that we expect in him all the time. When I got out of the theater, I was mainly thinking ""wow"" and ""that was great!"""

However, I can now!When I first entered the theater room, I saw both teenagers and little kids with their parents their too. It was something like a 7:45 showing or somewhere around there. I could tell that everyone was excited to see this movie. It was a truly excellent film. It has some humor that is meant for kids, and some for adults, but anyone can laugh at any of the jokes. It definitely deserves its G rating, for it was not inappropriate at all! The fact that the story is very easy to follow and you understand everything, is probably only one of the reasons people love this film. The animation is incredible!! When you watch this movie, you don't feel like, okay this is a silly little movie with talking cars. You find yourself in the world of cars. And it's a great world to be in. The fact that the characters all have real personalities is probably what traps you the most in the world of cars.

"abum190","8","0","0","26 July 2006"," Charming
","At first I didn't expect to be invested in these characters- they're not cute little fish or bugs that you can easily feel for, and they look nothing like humans, territory that Pixar has mastered. Then as the movie's gears began grinding and the story began to develop, I realized that I was looking at these cars as real people. The most amazing thing about this movie is how the Pixar team has managed to imbue these cars with so many ranges of emotion and movement that after a while you forget that they're made of metal and glass.<br/><br/>Of course none of that would really matter if the characters weren't likable and the story weren't good, so I'm happy to say that Pixar has done it again. It may not be as magical as Finding Nemo or as entertaining as The Incredibles, and the story may be a tad contrived at times, but that's to be expected from a cartoon. However, what made Nemo and the Incredibles great is that you didn't look at them as cartoons because their stories belonged in the world of live action. You never really forget that Cars is animation, but that's okay, because it's such a charming movie.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie that tells its story very well. It's comforting to know that Pixar still hasn't hit its slump, and Cars makes me look forward to the next gem from this studio."
"tnrcooper","9","0","0","24 July 2006"," Another great Pixar film
","Cars takes the themes of maturity and development and, with Pixar's usual grace and wit, animates them in the context of a world of anthropomorphized cars. The animation is so realistic that you would swear that the skies and cars in some scenes are photographed. The science of animation has advanced a long way since Toy Story (1995). However-and this is perhaps the ultimate irony about the success of Pixar -as inventive as the animation has been-and it has been fantastic, their films have been most characterized by intelligent and witty storytelling. This might say as much about the paucity of intelligently written films currently but nevertheless, Pixar has become well-known more for the intelligence of its screenplays. Some animated films succeed without good stories, and some fail without them, but the common thread among Pixar films has ensured that the films have usually been critically lauded, if not always (though the majority of the time) financially successful.<br/><br/>This film is very enjoyable although I do not think it is Toy Story quality. The film is about a car in the heat of a championship race with one classy, legendary car, The King (Richard Petty playing some version of his real life persona, presumably) and a tough, hard-nosed and also quite successful car, Chick Hicks (a wonderful Michael Keaton) in the prime of his career who intends to concede nothing to the brash up-and-coming star, Lightning McQueen, a rather oddly-named car referencing the connection of Steve McQueen to race-car films, voiced by Owen Wilson, who imbues the car's, um, character with a youthful cockiness which is tamed somewhat over time as he learns some tough lessons about his abilities and about how to relate to others. Wilson conveys a wide variety of emotions that convey the transformation which his, um, car's character undergoes. The end of the film is not predictable but is in keeping with the remainder of the film. Bonnie Hunt is fantastic as the love interest in the film, a car, um, lawyer named Sally Carerra who made a lot of money as a big city lawyer but yearned for the more relaxed pace of life of a town named Radiator Springs which she came across while vacationing. While the town is considered backwards by some, during the film its inhabitants are depicted as good, decent people and the value of people over superficial attributes is determined. <br/><br/>Several actors depict a wide range of varied characters, with particular credit due Cheech Marin, Larry the Cable Guy depicting a somewhat slow lifelong resident of Radiator Spring, Jenifer Lewis as the energetic general store owner, and also recommended performances from Paul Newman as the city's de facto leader, a man who has a secret unknown to anyone in the city, and George Carlin as a rather tired conglomeration of '60s clichÃ©s. <br/><br/>As said, the animation is amazing and on many occasions, it seems an animated scene is real. There are lots of clever references, as is usually the case in Pixar movies, to real events and figures which gives the film a sophisticated undertone that will entertain adults while the animation and colorful characters will certainly amuse children. While this isn't Toy Story, it's nevertheless a very, very good film and better than the vast majority of mainstream fare during the summer."
"jaredmobarak","8","0","0","22 July 2006"," Cars
","I'm not quite sure why people are speaking of Cars as the worst Pixar movie to date, as being the one that had nothing original to bring to the table. I must totally disagree as I found the film to be highly enjoyable. Besides an overly sappy ""better-days"" flashback scored to a James Taylor led song, the film was funny, smart, and amazing to behold graphically. The animation is the best Pixar and Disney has done. Reflections, glares, textures, and materials are as real as possible. Some overhead shots of scenery could have been reality shots with animation characters overlaid, they were that good.<br/><br/>The acting was top-notch and the story, with few exceptions, was a winner. Contemporary pop-culture abounded with Larry the Cable Guy's Mater doing his catchphrase ""getter done"" and a great cameo by Jeremy Piven doing his best impersonation of his own agent character Ari Gold from HBO's ""Entourage."" I do have to say, however, that the movie was more for the adult crowd than the children. Usually Pixar does a good job of making kid movies with an abundance of jokes that the adult crowd can take with it. With Cars, it was the other way around. While when first hearing of the project, I thought of Hot Wheels cars, we are actually given a real world of automobiles, both recreational and Nascar circuit. With a very poignant almost personal story, we are shown a heartfelt movie with an abundance of broad humor for the kids.<br/><br/>Details are what shine in Cars. Besides the brilliant animation of the cars themselves, we are treated with living backgrounds. Little things like the headlight wave in the Nascar crowd and the mountains of classic cars in the desert, (by this I mean mounds in the shape of cars not abandoned cars in mounds), are great to behold. Even the flies shooting around near bright lights are little VW Bugs; everything was taken to the nth degree and that is why it succeeded for me. Other parts to look for are the scared SUV's who've never gone off-road before and the tongue-in-cheek sequence during the credits with John Ratzenberger's Mack Truck. Also, look during the opening sequence of the final race towards the end of the movie. I recall seeing two cars looking over the balcony in the nosebleeds when the camera is panning in to the stadium. The one strangely looked as though it emitted something over the rails, not sure if this was a joke of it spitting over the side, or what; it was definitely intriguing. Stay after the credits as well to see a nice progression in the plot of a couple brief side characters from the middle of the film."

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Pixar tend to set the standards for the animation films. Every film is exceeding your expectations and show you what can be gained with what can be described as perfectionism. The Incerdibles was a mile stone in animation. I was asking myself where and how further they can go. As usual, with Pixar, they show that they can go further with technology. The sets look as real as possible. You get the feel you are on Route 66 and its unique landscape. I had a problem getting use to the talking cars. This subject is a deviation from a traditional Pixar movie. While other Pixar movies have been focused on a world which run in parallel to our world, a world we don't even know it exist, this movie create a world which is an allegory to our world. Pixar wanted to say something about our society and invent a world which doesn't exist for that reason(pay attentions: there are no humans in this world. Each car represent a type of person that exist in reality). When you get used to this idea, you can fairly enjoy the film. Which is funny, moving, say something about us and make it no secret that he prefer the way we lived in the past than the way we live now.<br/><br/>The end of the film, when the credit run, is a pleasure. It shows that Pixar can laugh on itself and its success. And wait till all the credits end, than there is another surprise.<br/><br/>In one word: recommended."

","What do Richard Petty, Owen Wilson, & Paul Newman have in common? They're all in Walt Disney and Pixar's latest film 'Cars'. The story revolves around a rookie race car learning that life isn't about where you're going, but how you get there. Now I'll admit, last fall when I first heard about this movie I completely wrote it off as being utterly preposterous. Why? Simply because the idea of talking cars didn't seem entertaining in the least. It actually wasn't until the day before it's release I said, wow, I think Disney's got something here. (Which only proved to be true after seeing it the next day.) John Lassester, the man who took us into the world of toys in 'Toy Story' and on a search for a young clown fish in 'Finding Nemo' has done it once again. First off, there's Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson) funny and irresistibly lovable new best friend, Mater. (Larry The Cable Guy) He adds to 'Cars' what Scrat the squirrel does in the 'Ice Age' films. Now don't get me wrong, many of the other characters featured in the film are plenty likable, but Mater is the glue that brings it all together. Also in 'Cars' the animation is superb. It doesn't have the same style or look the other Pixar films have. I don't really know how to describe it, but its certainly something.<br/><br/>But, as almost all movies, 'Cars' does have a drawback. It's missing something. That special something only Disney and Pixar can add that made 'Toy Story' what it is, a great movie. I'm not sure why, but it's just not there. I imagine in the end 'Cars' will just fall short of having the longevity and memorability films like 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters, Inc.' & 'Toy Story' will. Despite this, 'Cars' is still a winner and manages to be excellent. Not a classic, but excellent. I highly recommend seeing it at least once to give it a test drive."
"jonathanwr","9","0","0","21 July 2006"," don't be fooled; this movie is just as good as any other Pixar movie
","I was a little bit uncomfortable with the whole cars idea at first, I thought making a world full of talking cars would be a bit too far. Then I remembered that they've already done that kind of thing with their other movies, like A Bug's Life or Monsters, Inc. (and Disney has done it with Dinosaur). And the idea fit nicely, just like all the other movies. That part was good. The plot began with big-shot Lightning McQueen's race, and the movie showed a mix of what McQueen was really doing and what he was thinking about, so it was pretty confusing. The story really only begins when McQueen is driving to California in Mack the truck. That's when the plot and the computer animation gets started, in the Pixar spirit. I thought they did a really good job of showing what it was like to drive on the Highway. About in the middle of the movie the story starts to get emotional. Pixar has been getting more dramatical lately; a good example was Finding Nemo. Cars was also emotional in some parts. I didn't mind; I liked what they were doing. Their messages were things like ""keep your promises"" and ""think about other people instead of yourself"". These are really good morals, not like the ones Disney has been using that don't even make sense: ""follow your heart"", ""belive in yourself"", ""have faith and trust"". So I thought the emotional parts were a big improvement. I was really satisfied with the ending; McQueen uses his fame to encourage people to come to the town of Radiator Springs, and all the citizens of the town finally get customers again. I'd give it a 10/10, but I demoted it to 9/10 for the flashy, confusing start."

","Pixar, Pixar, Pixar. With every movie they get better. From Toy Story all the way to Cars. They have done nothing but improve, improve and improve.<br/><br/>Cars is an all round movie. With excellent animation (Duh! Its Pixar), a little bit of romance, a very entertaining storyline, there also a little bit of excitement. I really enjoyed watching this movie especially the part with the race, the first race when lightning was pushing himself with his blown rear tires to cross the finish line, it was rather exciting when they were trying to figure out who had won the race.I think the relationship between mater and lightning is very cute and touching, ha-ha. I believe that Pixar is the most versatile animation company there is. Dreamworks, a good animation company, but nothing compared to Pixar.<br/><br/>They have tackled so many types of stories. They have done toys in 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2'. They have taken on the challenge of making a movie about bugs in 'A Bug's Life'. They did an amazing job with fish in their movie 'Finding Nemo'. They have also done human beings in the movie about a superhero family, 'The Incredibles'. They have even done monsters in 'Monster's Inc.', and now there is 'Cars'. A movie about automobiles. Truly, Pixar can do anything. If you have already seen Cars in the cinema, you would have seen what the next movie Pixar has concocted, a movie about rats living in France called 'Ratatouille', or something like that, i am not sure how to spell it, but see, Pixar really can do anything. I am just amazed at all the Pixar projects.<br/><br/>My final word on Cars, a definite must-see. If this movie is not watched, you will regret it for the rest of your life. ha-ha. seriously, it is that good."

","Very clever, creative film. It helps to know a little about NASCAR. For example personalities like Darrell Walltrip, Richard Petty (the King), and Dale Earnhart, Jr. add credence to the story for people who know the sport well. Famous names like Mario Andretti will help non sport fans ""get the in-jokes."" The animation is so good, some of the road scenes look like photographs. The graphics for the town tied in with ""car"" references well, and made the viewer feel like they were in with the""inside jokes"" also.

"etsm92","9","0","0","3 July 2006"," A very impressive Pixar Animation Studios Film and it's not just the story that caught my eye...
","Cars/2006/***1/2<br/><br/>By Eric Staab/ July 3, 2006<br/><br/>Main Stars: Owen Wilson Paul Newman Bonnie Hunt Larry the Cable Guy<br/><br/>Throughout the entire month of June, John Lasseter's very impressive film Cars has been one of the most talked about films in the nation and has been one of the tops at the box office which is why I wrote my review later to show you how popular the film really is. It still is making some big bucks so the three years of making it was obviously worth it. It was positively impressive and I'm not just talking about the clever story; I'm talking about the crystal clear animation. It was incredible just like Brad Bird's prior Pixar Animation Studios Film The Incredibles which is still THE BEST Pixar film yet followed closely by Toy Story (1&2) and Cars and all the others and I won't name them now. When I saw the previews for this film I thought it wouldn't be that entertaining because it's about racing and I'm not as huge a fan of that as I was years ago. But it turns out the film wasn't just about sports car racing it was about friendship. The film didn't always have a racetrack as a set. There was a town called Radiator Springs (clever name) and that's where most of the story takes place. As you may well know, there are no humans in this movie which makes it even more entertaining to watch. Instead of pesky little flies, they are actually tiny cars with wings which was very clever from the animators. Everything living has to be a vehicular object: a car, a tractor, a truck, a bus, even a Ford Model T which was played by an extremely old woman. That's another thing. Newer cars are younger people. Older cars are older people. The age of the car resembles the age of a person which was very clever indeed. Instead of cows there were tractors so the tractors would go ""MOOOOOOOOOOO"" but you can't mess with Frank (the enormous plow) or he'll practically cut you up. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) calls it tractor tipping instead of cow tipping and Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is the main character who is told this. So Lightning McQueen is the big rookie car star that everyone likes. And if he wins the Piston Cup (the championship trophy that the racecars win) he'll be the first rookie to have done it in, I guess, ages. Unexpected guest voices are instead of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno it's The Jay Limo Show where Jay makes a silly joke about Lightning McQueen which makes everyone in his audience laugh and Leno himself plays Jay Limo. Then instead of Bob Costas, it's Bob Cutlass and played by Costas himself. Richard Petty (an elderly former National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing racecar driver which is abbreviated NASCAR) is in this film playing The King. And Michael Keaton plays the sinister Chick Hicks (who is very aggressive like Dale Earnhardt). Dale Earnhardt Jr. plays Junior in this film or the number 8 car which he always has been. Darrell Waltrip (another real racecar driver) is in this film playing Darrell Cartrip. So they got quite a few stars in this film and then there's Paul Newman himself playing the crotchety Doc Hudson. He's the leader of the Radiator Springs town. The top dog, big cheese, head honcho (a line from Airplane!). The film shows a point not just about racecar driving but friendship. McQueen makes quite a few friends like Sally Carrera (CARrera) who is voiced by Bonnie Hunt. She seems to really like McQueen in this film. However, the Doc is not too fond of him and tries to avoid him more than speak to him or settle out his problems. He's a bit stoic and doesn't like to settle his problems with anyone, more just wants to keep it in himself. After McQueen is reported missing he finds the tiny town of Radiator Springs and simultaneously being chased by a sheriff. That's where he meets the interesting ol' gang. He even has to do some manual labor before he's supposed to be let free after messing up their road with his reckless driving after being chased by the sheriff for a few minutes. His final destination is California where he is supposed to have his next race but the manual labor needs to be completed before he is let go! It is a fun movie with an impressive story and interesting characters. I know very young kids won't be astounded by the animation but they'll most likely still have fun. And at the end you feel good because McQueen did the right thing and it was all thanks to his Radiator Springs buddies who influenced his life in a good way. Movie directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranft."

","It was a ""cute"" movie and the animations were as reported, spectacular. I did fall asleep for a few minutes in the middle though. The story can be slow. It is all about lessons in life and learning about priorities without any real humor to it. I heard the audience laugh at one point but since I didn't laugh I can't even recall what they found amusing.<br/><br/>I recently saw ""Over The Hedge"" and liked it so much better. Though some of the lessons were the same, I think I liked it more because there were silly antics and a bad guy(materialistic woman) to root against all the way through the film. <br/><br/>One thing that I observed about Cars that I hadn't experienced before, people actually sat through the credits. There were little clips and incredible music going on while the credits were rolling.

","On both of the continuity items already listed, yes there was a comment about the whitewalls even though Lightning had his regular tires on. What the writer didn't pay attention to is that the comment was bout when the reporters found him in Radiator Springs he had them on. Also about the boot at the impound. Yes Mater hooked up the rear bumper even though he had the boot on and dragged Lightning anyway. Both of those comments should be removed since they aren't really problems with the movie. The bigger question is how do they build everything with no darn hands? Overall, this was a great movie though. I mostly saw it for my kids, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I though I would. The animation is for better than anything I've seen so far. Now there are so many more animated movies coming out, the bar is high now. What will they look like in just a few years? I also appreciate the feeling that this movie was written or at least helped a lot by real racers who have been around. As a member of a racing family, it's good to see that some guy with no real idea of the history and reality of racing didn't just throw something together. This movie has real history and factual basis in it that will probably go unnoticed by most, but for older fans it will be great to catch the small items of interest, such as the cows and the older model cars."

","The good - this wipes the slate clean of such pollutants as ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Driven"". The plot delivery is somewhere between ""Doc Hollywood"" and ""To Wong Foo..."", reconstructed for kids in the 6 - 10 years old range.<br/><br/>The best parts are the Pixar components, those being the effortlessly fastidious attention to detail, and the 'camera' movement. This is not a gimmick, but part of the visual storytelling. <br/><br/>Consider the way this movie handles memories: when Wilson's ""car"" remembers his trip through the turns on Rt. 66, the memory is shown from the car's-eye perspective, not as we first saw it from our 3rd person perspective. This is a clever effect, the best of its type I've seen since the BASE jump in ""To Live and Die in LA"". And consider that the entire movie is a 'memory' too (a computer program), and let that bake your noodle for a while.<br/><br/>The (slightly) bad - there's a bit too much 'Disney' in this, meaning the tendency toward saccharine characters, pop-culture innuendo and reliance on audience testing...smart movies make comments about movies, not usually about cultural trivia. You can see the 'Pixar' forces fighting back in the end title sequences where the Pixar back catalogue is reimagined as the Cars would see them, and those 'movies' are framed within a 'drive-in movie'."

","That's right. I have a new favorite animated/computer generated movie. Pixar's Cars is a great movie. Not only does it deliver a very fun film that people of all ages will enjoy... it does it with class and is visually stunning to boot. Just look at this animation! The CGI in the film is simply amazing. Over and over I was struck with how realistically things were rendered. The landscape was stunning, the physics of things like dirt particles/water etc. was breathtaking, and the cars were just too cool.<br/><br/>Sure the story was simplistic and formulaic, but they used a good story and a good formula. I have never cheered a cartoon before... but I was completely caught up in the storyline and wanted desperately for the hero to prevail. There are not many films shot with real actors even that inspire that kind of emotion.<br/><br/>My hat is off to Pixar once again for taking the bar previously set by themselves and raising it even further.

","Cars, the new CGI animation flick from the people whom brought you Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Monster's Inc.<br/><br/>Now Pixar has churned out some of the best CGI Animated films I have ever seen. Their care and love for each project is what keeps people flocking to the cinema's year after year. Although Cars isn't their best film, it is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen to date. The story has a very moral theme, and shows not only the kids, but the adults about selfishness.<br/><br/>Pixar films although aimed at the young audiences, has also been great entertainment for the adults, and Cars is the one film I would say was more tailored for the adult audience. The humor alone is very adult oriented, but not that it would offend kids, it just helps the parents enjoy the film while their kids get to enjoy the animation.<br/><br/>My favorite characters are probably Filmore (Voiced by George Carlin) and Mater (Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) The comedic timing of their delivery is superb, and are clearly the driving force behind this animated buddy picture. The adults will enjoy the humor from both these characters and enjoy the theme of the film as well.<br/><br/>Cars is about Lighting McQueen, a race car lost on his way to the big Piston Cup race in California. On his way he becomes lost in the forgotten town of Radiator springs. A town that bustled in the hay day before interstate highways came along. Radiator Springs is filled with great residents, all talking cars, enjoying the slow paced life of their forgotten town, but they still have hopes that one day their forgotten little burg will be hoping again.<br/><br/>The great thing about Cars is how they are able to show the real life we all know being lived through Cars. They go about their business much like we do and the situations they find themselves in will have you busting a gut every minute you can. I guarantee you will sit there and go ""Oh my god""... WOW... etc etc. You won't be disappointed in the least bit.<br/><br/>The film runs about 2 hours in length which is a little much for the youngin's, but I guarantee they will enjoy it as much as you will.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was. How could a movie with talking cars be that good? Well, it was! They somehow managed to do it and do it well. There were references to the whole car theme, but they were craftily done and interspersed throughout. The ""characters"" are nicely done and lovable. The animation was probably the best I've seen yet from Pixar. Of course, the movie turned out like I thought it would, but that is not the point. The story of Route 66 is really interesting in itself. And there is also, the main character change from selfish to giving, which is a good lesson for kids. The voices chosen for the cars was a great match."

","Pixar. Let's just keep that name in mind. Because, as a matter of fact, Pixar has made children's movie's a huge hit...and this movie, ""Cars"", is their seventh time, in a row. First there was Toy Story, with the lovable Woody and the hero Buzz. Then, A Bugs Life. Who wouldn't love the cute little ants? After that came along the excellent Toy Story 2, which all the little kids adored. Then, Monsters Inc., with a cute story line and just as cute characters. After that is Finding Nemo, which was a big hit. Before Cars, was The Incredibles, which was, well, incredible. Finally, we came to ""Cars"", which just so happens to be one of my new favorite movies. I see Cars plushies, Cars toy car's, Soundtracks, books, MP3 cases, CD players, even TV's and Radios. At the Movie Theatre, I got a package of trading cards, my little brother was sporting a Cars tee shirt. I guess you can say, we are all obsessed with this one-of-a-kind movie. Which deserves a perfect ""Two Thumbs Up"" + four golden stars. This Pixar movie is as cute as a button, the whole entire family will laugh and enjoy it. So, don't blow off the chance to see this brilliant motion picture, Cars."

","This Walt Disney movie completely exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>I will admit, I didn't want to go see a movie that was all about vehicles, because I thought ""What could you do for an hour and a half that only has to do with cars"" Because my family did see it on father's day, I felt good about going-- and I felt even better when I walked out.<br/><br/>The movie kept you on your toes and was really amusing to watch. Everything was really appropriate for all ages. Bonnie Hunt and Owen Wilson made it even better to sit through. They both have really great talent and I think it really stood out in this movie."

","Best animated movie produced by Pixar yet. It's a shame to see Pixar and Disney split up. This movie was full of cross references to real life events, for example, Dale Earnhardt Jr. appears as a fellow race car with the main character. Attention was paid to every detail, and every moment kept you interested. Keep an ear open for 'Mater's' (Larry the cable guy) lines which are sometimes identical to his stand-up routine. Working at the local theaters, I've seen my fair share of animated classics but this is by far the best. Be sure to stay after the credits for some extra laughs. Nine thumbs up! A++. A true cinematic masterpiece."

","Computer animation has had it's ups and downs since Toy Story but I have to say that even though I am thirty seven years old I am still a kid at heart. Even the least of the animation films (Shark Tale) over the last decade have still been of reasonable quality. People who say that movies these days are all about the effects and have no heart need to go out and rent some DVD's.<br/><br/>The cream of the crop include the Shrek's (Donkey has to be one of the classic characters in animation history) the Toy Story's, Finding Nemo, Ice Age and The Incredibles. Up to now I thought the Incredibles was an amazing film. Both technically and story wise. However, I think this has been surpassed by Pixar's Cars.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I went into this film not expecting much. Reviews were pretty average and the trailers weren't all that spectacular. I definitely got my moneys worth though.<br/><br/>The visuals in this film are beyond compare. Even little things like how the cars travel on a new road compared to the newly sealed road. Absolutely brilliant. The opening sequence is an action spectacle to rival any live action blockbuster. It probably even surpasses them. The backgrounds in this film just blew my mind. This is artists at their extreme best.<br/><br/>The thing that really makes this film worthwhile though is the characters and story. That's one thing that Pixar and particularly John Lassiter have never compromised over. I think the man is a genius and Walt Disney must be smiling in his cryogenic freezer.<br/><br/>John Lassiter is that rarity in film-making. He is an excellent artist who wholeheartedly embraces state of the art technology to put his great storytelling abilities to good use. Filmmakers don't come along like that often. I think he can be compared to Walt Disney on those terms. He has created classic characters and stories while moving film technology along in giant strides.<br/><br/>There's not much more I can say about this film but I look forward to every new Pixar film that comes out and they haven,t let me down yet.<br/><br/>John Lassiter will go down in history as one of the greats and he truly deserves it. <br/><br/>Good stuff."
"rd350c","9","0","0","21 June 2006"," Lasseter talks to baby boomers through the dashboard speaker of my 64 Valiant
","Cars is the best animated movie I've seen since ""The Lion King""  maybe better.<br/><br/>Definitely cooler.<br/><br/>We saw the trailer last winter, but my only point of reference was other talking machinery cartoons -- ""The Brave Little Toaster"", etc..and that annoying PBS train cartoon. I didn't expect that much. <br/><br/>Then I heard John Lasseter (the director) on NPR. He was born in 1957, and I realized that his POV growing up in a car society was similar to mine. Drive ins and car hops are cliché, but he spoke about family drives and long trips on pre-interstate roads -- it struck a chord. I realized this was going to be a great movie.<br/><br/>Cars blew us away, from the opening to past the credits (you gotta stay and watch). The story is good (B+), the characters are great (A) and the visuals are unbelievable (A++). But the soul of the movie makes it different. <br/><br/>I remember taking route 19 up to Lake Erie before there was an I-79, and taking 301 to Carolina Beach before I-95 existed. Often we'd caravan with my cousins and share cottages. The trip was always half the fun  playing car games in the back seats, while our dads played games on the highway. My uncle disappeared from in front of us once and my mom exclaimed. ""Good Lord he's flying!"" Dad replied ""He's just familiar with this road."" It was as much a justification for the speed as it was a rationale for why he couldn't keep up.<br/><br/>it was about big American Iron, and rest stop rendezvous and stopping for sodas and ice cream in the middle of nowhere. It was about experiencing how big America was.<br/><br/>Cars goes right to the heart of that, to Route 66. You sense of the size of America, and how cars move around in its parts, and how we're losing the uniqueness (and the awareness of that uniqueness) to interstate homogeneity. There are subtle, visual hints to the heavy-handed way the interstate slices through the country side, and there's even a brief preachy/diagrammatic point, but only for a few moments. It makes those points with character development and a good story. The power of the film -- the way it really gets to your heart -- comes from the way Lasseter uses the visuals and develops his characters. The visuals are positively breathtaking. The scene where the cars race down country roads, in and out of shadows, past waterfalls and up a mountain revitalizes the lost joy of just going for a ride.<br/><br/>And the character development is augmented by the CG. More than just cartoony facial expressions and over the top dialogue, the cars are displayed with fantastic realism that makes the chrome shine realer than real, and the engine rumble stir your soul. When they pan across the chrome Hudson logo, it's like the helicopters coming at you playing Wagner in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>My dad ran big, bland Mopar station-wagons, while my uncle had a sleek red Chevy Impala convertible. Dad's second car was always a Valiant/Dart, but uncle Rich rotated a parade of wild, unique, and fun cars behind the Chevy. A huge yellow Pontiac Catalina convertible, an early 60's Cadillac Fleetwood, a mid-fifties Ford coupe  a lot of junkers and nothing very ""nice"". I remember his Hudson the most though. <br/><br/>Paul Newman voices the Hornet. He's great; so is the carit's the soul of the movie. Like other movies, there are variations in character development, but this movie seems to augment and parallel character development with drawing complexity. Shallow characters have forgettable details, while well developed characters are remarkably catching. Richard Petty's (Sr.) high-wing Roadrunner is lovingly detailed, while the Michael Keaton (bad guy) car is a non-descript mid-80's Regal or Cutlass. His character is shallow, like its representation. Even Lightning, the protagonist gains detail after his ""awakening.""<br/><br/>My dad had a big box of old Popular Science magazines I read all the time, cover to cover. And I mean old. There was ""Gus's Garage"", and ""Say Smokey"", and of course, the car tests. I excitedly read the 1949 road test of the ""Hundred Mile an Hour Hudson"". It was full of superlatives, and the pictures were thrilling, even fifteen years later. Right around 1965, I'm twelve, and everyone's introducing their ""fastback"" models  the original Dodge Charger, the glass-back Barracuda, the Mercury Montego and the AMC Marlin (the fastest looking rambler ever). And Uncle Rich shows up with a sleek, low, baddass, fast- lookin' 49 Hudson fastback. It was dark and ominously un-shiny, and grey inside, and smelled vaguely like the basement at the old drugstore. And as I remember, it never ran very well or for very long.<br/><br/>But man it looked fast. <br/><br/>Paul Newman is Hudson Hornet cool. Knowing his skill as a racer made it even better for me. The Hornet's even got blue eyes.<br/><br/>If you like cars, you'll love the movie cars. Check out NPR's Click and Clack as the Dart and the Tradesman; they're a hoot. Tony Shaloub revisits his Italian chef persona from the EXCELLENT ""Big Night"" with amazing energy. George Carlin's VW van is a welcome throwback to the persona that made him famous. And Cheech Marin plays a metal-flake painted low rider with and over-the-top accent. The rock formations still have me thinking (of course there's Cadillac Ranch), and the signs in the town go by so quick you can't read them all (just like when you're passing through). And there're a ton of other cameo's and little sight gags/inferences that'll make you laugh and then want to see it again (and again) just to see what you missed. <br/><br/>Btw. DVD rendering will NOT do this film justice You gotta see this in the theaters, or at home on HDTV feed."

","I went to see Pixar's newest, ""Cars"" fully expecting not only not to like it, but possibly to DISLIKE it. Those who know me know I'm a HUGE Pixar fan, but I don't follow car racing of any kind and don't particularly care for cars (though I do know a little about classic cars-- come on, I grew up in Detroit). I was really put off by the long-running teaser that had Larry the Cable Guy as the tow truck, and went into the theater prepared to be underwhelmed.<br/><br/>I'd like some catsup with my previous words, please. Thank you.<br/><br/>Though not with the type of amazingly original story that fueled the likes of ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters, Inc"" and ""The Incredibles"", this film is a worthy addition to the Pixar family and is, IMHO, their 7th home run in a row. <br/><br/>Since anyone who's aware of this film knows the story, I won't go into it much here. Suffice to say that it IS Michael J Fox's ""Doc Hollywood"" revisited with a few minor differences; you can even pick out a few scenes that are darn near frame-for-frame similar. But you know what? You won't care. You're so blown away by the animation and the voice talent and the whole package in itself that you'll note the similarities and go on with the movie. The theater we were in had quite a few children of various ages as well as adults, and it kept everyone thoroughly entertained. <br/><br/>Being a computer tech, I'm always aware of Pixar's technology... for the first few minutes, that is. Then I'm so swept away in the movie itself that I pretty quickly forget that I'm watching animation. This one was a bit different; there were some scenes that were so amazing that I couldn't help but notice the animation, but that only made it better and more impressive. I've driven cross-country from Michigan to Arizona and let me assure you, the Pixar folks got that drive down pat!<br/><br/>I don't know where to start with the voice talent. This isn't all of Pixar's usual stable of talent, but the new voices are spot-on perfect for their characters. I take back what I said about Larry the Cable Guy, and Paul Newman IS that Hudson Hornet, blue eyes and all. A particularly funny part is the cow-tipping take off, which had me in stitches along with the kiddies. Come on, moo-ing and farting tractors? What's not to love?<br/><br/>And while I didn't get the car racing jokes, it really didn't matter. One of these days I'll sit down with a friend who does follow car racing and have her explain it to me, but in the meantime I plan to see this film at least once more before it leaves the theater. Maybe twice. Hey, how often is it that you don't tear up at the end of the movie, you get misty-eyed at the end of the CREDITS?<br/><br/>Oh, and, as you may have heard, DO NOT MOVE FROM YOUR SEAT until you see the Disney logo! Especially if you're a fan of the other Pixar movies, you won't regret seeing the adorable extras they threw in all along AND past the end of the credits.<br/><br/>Back to my Fancy Feast of bad words about this movie. Now I know better, and Pixar has won me beyond the shadow of a doubt. Whatever they do next is FINE by me!"

","Most of the comments I read were by younger people than me ... if you're male, American, and 70 up you may recognize the poignant true story of Doc Hudson's forced retirement. The Hudson Hornet WAS the hottest thing on the stock car circuit in 1951-53, when they really were STOCK cars, but for all their spectacular success the company dies the next year. But Paul Newman's 70 plus and he's raced cars himself; he would know. Do they give Oscars for voice-overs? The expression that the animators can get from car-faces is amazing, too --- I fell in love with Sally too! The town must have been just what Route 66 looked like in its heyday."

","Wow, Disney really out did itself! My son begged me to see this production; Although, the previews appeared to be somewhat childish, I gave in. My hesitation quickly turned into delight. The graphics are beautiful and very realistic. My son and I had traveled on part of the old Route 66 just last summer. What a thrill it gave me to have my 10-year-old recognize some of the scenery! The movie had me right there making each turn of the highway; taking in the awesome details of the mountains. The character voices were wonderfully casted with actors that match the personalities of each car. By the end of the movie, I was ready to hop into the car and hit the road again. Thank you, Disney, for remaining true to your company's foundering fathers. You have crafted a marvelous work of nostalgia and friendship, sprinkled with clean,adult humor."

","I went into Cars a little nervous. After the two towering hits of The Incredibles and Finding Nemo, I didn't think that a movie about automobiles (and the very unassuming title) could even come close to the soul and wit. Anticlimactically, though, it does. It so totally does. It's a little creepy that the world is now run by cars, and you wonder what kind of bloody massacres kept the humans out of the picture, but the brilliance of the first race keeps your mind off that kind of thing. Computer Animation (Especially at Pixar, most other companies, like the one that did hoodwinked look kind of cheap) has come so far that things like the sheen of a car and the clouds in the sky look very real while the talking cars still look properly cartoonish. There have been some complaints that the movie slows down a bit when Lightening McQueen, the main car gets lost in the backwater town of Radiator Springs, but IMHO this is where the movie really finds its heart. I hate to say I liked anything with Larry the Cable Guy, but his portrayal of Mater was real good (If you clamp your ears before he says Git-R-Dunn) and Bonnie Hunt's Porsche was a real beautiful car that you'd like to sit inside for a bit, just playing with her radio. Of course, the movie snaps back into big city racing with a touching finale, but one could only watch those front and end Xtr33m pieces for a bit. The middle, though, represents the town of radiator springs perfectly: soothing and cute and you'd like to stay there for awhile."
"cwrdlylyn","9","0","0","16 June 2006"," CARS : Not Pixar's Best, But Still Better Then Many Movies Today...
","CARS <br/><br/>It's dangerous to do what Pixar has done over the past few years. If you build up an empire and flawless reputation for producing some of the best films released in modern years... inevitably something has got to give. Leading up to its release, it looked like CARS could potentially be that film. Trailers weren't as awe-inspiring as they've been the past, the story looked a little cliché, and the concept seemed a bit forced. And along with the inevitable fall of the empire, there's no doubt going to be people looking to bring you down... or at least people who have come to expect sooooo much from you that they will inevitably be disappointed. Personally, I think CARS is suffering that fate.<br/><br/>And it's a shame, because CARS is far from being a ""disappointment"". Pixar's latest CGI-film tells the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a stuck up race car with nothing on his mind besides his own pride and glory. While en route to the final race for the Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen gets himself lost and in trouble in the abandoned city of ""Radiator Springs"". What was once a thriving stop on Route 66 has now become a resting place for a group of rag tag vehicles. They include the reclusive leader Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally the Porsche (Bonnie Hunt). Initially, Lightning couldn't possibly get out of ""Radiator Springs"" fast enough... however, as time goes by Lightning begins to realize the importance of slowing down and admiring the scenery.<br/><br/>True, the story is the most familiar of all the Pixar films yet... and it's not given as many layers as past screenplays had. Also, at times the story lags a bit more then others. The film is never boring, although it seems the producers were wasting a little time building up some minor characters that ultimately didn't effect the story that much. Yet still, CARS is an endearingly light-hearted tale of enjoying the simple things in life, so why shouldn't the story be simple as well? It might lower the prestige of CARS, but not necessarily it's entertainment value.<br/><br/>In terms of providing it's audience with a good time, Pixar still has not failed. CARS opens at a stadium filled with vehicles of all type doing waves, cheering, flashing the crowd, and more as the first major race for the Piston Cup takes place. It is in this opening sequence where Pixar really gets to showcase their skills as computer artists. The gleaming lights off the hoods of the race-cars, the details all the way down to the little pebbles on the racetrack, and the highly detailed background are just a few of things in this movie that truly impress. All the more impressive, these visual elements are blended in with sound editing and effects that match the very best in film today. All these factors combine to create some of the most exciting footage of race-cars captured on film, fake or not.<br/><br/>Pixar also shows they are still the masters of finding visual gags and slapstick humor without having to resort to pop-culture references and crude humor. Whereas most animated films today evoke their humor from ""hip"" and ""edgy"" pop-culture (SHREK, OVER THE HEDGE, and ICE AGE are all guilty of this... though they are still entertaining movies). Pixar's ability to evoke humor from the actual storyline instead of the outside world is what will ensure their films remain fresh and funny forever. They have managed to make films that will never feel dated. My personal favorite gags in this film came when we saw the Cars in their natural environments... on the roads cruising.<br/><br/>The voice-work in CARS is a fun addition as well. Though the limitation of having all the characters by automobiles limits the variety of characters that was welcoming through TOY STORY, BUGS LIFE and more... the actors still manage to infuse their characters with a distinct heart. Larry the Cable Guy, though probably the least gifted actor of the bunch, manages to come off best in a perfect marriage of voice-actor and machine.<br/><br/>Overall, CARS is possibly the best piece of family entertainment to be released this year. It seems unfair that a film with as many good elements as Pixar's CARS get deemed a ""disappointment"" simply because it can't meet the insane standards set up by the studio's last few films. Who cares if the movie is stretched a little bit longer then it needs to be... it's not like we get enough Pixar anyway! And who cares if it's a little less impressive then past efforts... it's still a worth addition to Pixar's credits and it shows they are continuing to develop in the visuals department! In the end, while CARS isn't close to being the best Pixar film yet, it is certainly the best animated film I've seen all year... and for that it deserves the credit it would receive whether it was being compared to past Pixar films or not.<br/><br/>... B+ ..."
"dennissmithjr","7","0","0","15 June 2006"," This movie has been done before.
","As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but feel that I'd seen this movie before. Then I thought back and remembered a movie ""Doc Hollywood"" starring Michael J. Fox. This movie is a ""kids"" version of Doc Hollywood. Personally, I thought this Pixar release was not up to the standard of previous titles turned loose by Disney's powerhouse, with exception to the character portrayed by Larry the Cable guy, ""Mater"". It had it's moments, but was lacking overall. I think a major part of Pixar and Dreamworks 3D animated success has been their ability to cater to a dual audience. Adults and children enjoy these films because there is enough clever humor to please adults with liberal amounts of slapstick to garner the kids attention and all wrapped in a 3D package that is a feast for the eyes. Don't misunderstand me, it is a worthwhile film, but it's a story that's been done and not up to Pixar's standard of originality and freshness. Perhaps, if you have never seen ""Doc Hollywood"" you might enjoy it more."
"rparham","8","0","0","13 June 2006"," Cars is worth racing
","In the computer animated movie race, Pixar Animation Studios is the clear front runner, so it is fitting that their newest opus, Cars, is a film about a race car. Cars is an entertaining and enjoyable romp, for certain, although it is a little slower and more steeped in nostalgia than their previous films, and as such, children may find it a little less exciting than talking toys and monsters hiding under the bed.<br/><br/>Cars opens at a major race where Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) ties for the Piston Cup, a major racing trophy. A run-off race is scheduled in California one week later, and so McQueen sets out for the race, and his plan is to win the cup and land the major sponsor, Dinoco. Partway through the trip, McQueen gets lost on Route 66 and ends up under arrest in the small town of Radiator Springs. McQueen is ordered to repair the road of the small sleepy hamlet, and along the way becomes familiar with the local color: hick tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), motel owner Porsche Sally (Bonnie Hunt), custom paint car Ramone (Cheech Marin), Ferrari enthusiast Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and the local tune up expert, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).<br/><br/>Lightning just wants to finish the road and get to the race, but he shortly begins to realize that what there is in Radiator Springs is what is missing from his life: friends. He begins a friendship with Mater and finds himself falling for Sally. When he later learns that Doc is a famous former race car, he starts asking him for information about his past and Doc is convinced to get this loner out of the city before he causes damage to the people he loves around him.<br/><br/>Cars isn't built around the most original of concepts, the hotshot youngster who discovers that there is more to life than winning and himself. But in true Pixar style, they can still take it and make a good, solid two hours of entertainment out of it. As with most prior Pixar hits, Cars is helped by a few key elements: snappy dialogue, good voice acting and some spectacular looking imagery.<br/><br/>Ever since their first hit with Toy Story, Pixar has always managed great sounding dialogue along with smart, funny characters and Cars is no different. Mater is given most of the really memorable bits, but everyone in the film has some great moments throughout. While many of the characters are not exactly original, they are drawn sharply enough to be memorable. The characters are helped along by strong voice casting. Owen Wilson fits the young, brash McQueen perfectly, Paul Newman is equally strong as the grizzled old veteran Doc. Larry the Cable Guy will, without doubt, be the biggest hit with children as Mater. Most the supporting cast, including Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin and George Carlin as a hippie Volkswagen bus, are fitting for their parts.<br/><br/>Where Cars goes over the top is in it's imagery. This is easily Pixar's most gorgeous looking film to date, with spectacular vistas of the great American heartland that is breathtaking. The animators and art directors are not without a sense of humor, as they have designed many of the rock mesas and mountains in many of the scenic shots looking like old '50s era vehicles. The texture work on the cars is impressive also, the paint jobs and metallic surfaces as real as they should be. It all has a strong sense of stylization, but that works in the film's favor.<br/><br/>Cars may fall a little short in one key area: keeping youngsters preoccupied. Cars moves at a slower pace and features elements of reverence for times gone by that many children may not be thrilled by. Most adults should find Cars more than diverting, and it's nice to see an animated film that is willing to slow up and take the time to catch it's breath, but the younger set may be quickly find their attention wandering. Even so, Cars should once again prove a winner for Pixar and leave the audience waiting for their next hit."

","Not the best Pixar film (but then again any film following in the wake of The Incredibles would have a hard time) I found Cars to be pleasant but rather uninspired at times, a bit long in the middle, and overall recycled as far as ideas are concerned.<br/><br/>It seems that Hollywood has an obsession with following in the footsteps of the Golden Age directors such as Frank Capra whose works have become formulas for generations of stories that seem to fixate on the goodness of the common man, pitting the virtues of one group against the corruptive influences of fame and the prospects of fortune. Anyone who has seen Mister Deed Goes to Town, Mister Smith Goes to Washington, etc. (even The Majestic if you want to throw that in for good measure), has probably seen these age old themes used over and over again. These are good themes, and have very simply messages about the importance of having one's priorities straight, but seeing it one more time in an animated film seems rather wasted.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is nostalgia that drove this piece -- an easy temptation for any writer to succumb to (look at Akira Kurosawa's last few films for future reference) but somehow seeing this film it made me feel a bit cheated.<br/><br/>Granted, like I said before anything that came after The Incredibles would have to be stupendous to match the amount of anticipation that probably developed in the last year and a half so it is fair to say that this is a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>But let's face it: if you are spoiled with the amazing quality of the previous Pixar films it will be easy to see this film as a bit of a letdown. But if you keep an open mind and simply go to have a good time, you will not be disappointed."

","I've never been too big of a Pixar fan. They studio has always had novel ideas, but the action sequences seem to fall flat in CG fare and the kid friendly comedy never really connects with me. Their movies have always been solid, but never great, until the incredibles came. The Incredibles was a fantastic movie and made me thing the studio had turned a new leaf. I was very excited about the idea, especially since it seems to be somewhat based on an old Disney animated film that I loved as a child. Well, it seems Pixar is back to their old tricks, it's not really a bad thing, just nothing new. The movie sports the best CG work I've seen, Pixar tops themselves again, and the film features great voice work. I read a review likening this to Doc Hollywood and thats appropriate. I really enjoyed the beginning of the film, although the laughs seem to be few and far between in the beginning. The middle is where things crawl to a snails pace, i realize character development is essential, but I could have been done in a smarter less time consuming approach. Luckily, the last 30 minutes or so are a blast, fun, fast, and heartfelt. I really enjoyed ""mater"" voiced by Larry the cable guy, although I felt the ""fart"" joke was lame and WAYYYYY over used. As always a solid message is delivered in a family-friendly way with some fast action and laugh added along the way. The only thing that really hinders this movie is that the beginning and middle should have had more laughs and the movie should have been shortened at least 20 to 25 minutes. I think 2 hour kids films is a little too long for most kiddies, even the child I sat too was losing interest near the middle. Still I recommend it, a solid film."

","So I loved the movie don't get me wrong I thought it was hilarious, but I couldn't help but think that I had heard this story somewhere before. Then midway in the movie it hit me like a Mac truck. Michael J. Fox's movie Doc Hollywood has almost the same story line. Both movies start with the main character trying to get to California, they both end up crashing in a small out of the way town. In both movies they hate the town when they arrive and in both movies when they leave they love the town. Both times the main character is attracted to a very attractive female that moved into the small town life for a slower pace of life. Both movies the main character ends up in California just to realize that they would rather be in the small town with the girl they love. I still think that everyone should go see cars, well at least I enjoyed it!"

","It's ironic don't you think, that the X-Men's Last Stand would be up against a squad of animated marvels known simply as ""Cars"". The film was a particularly unique experience for me since I was able to accompany my year and a half year old grandson to his first movie theater experience. Though antsy at times, he seemed to be fairly well mesmerized by the events on screen, and not distracted by a nearly full theater packed with kids on a Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Film animation continues to make wondrous strides, and it looks like Disney and Pixar have another hit on their hands. The film will appeal to the inner kid in all of us that yearns for a simpler time and good friends to share it with. It occurred to me on the drive home though that all those down home sentiments are conveyed on film by six figure computer whizzes that have no idea what Hudson Hornet might have gone through winning his races in the 1950's. But at least the story works.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I'm not that good at placing the voices to their characters. The only ones that were identifiable for me were Paul Newman, Larry the Cable Guy, and Cheech Marin, while John Ratzenberger was unmistakable as Mack. The other voices, some belonging to even bigger celebs escaped me, but then again, it was about the characters and not their secret identities.<br/><br/>Not to offer too much of a cliché, ""Cars"" is a fun ride, made even better if you can catch it with someone younger along for the road trip. In my case, fifty years younger was just the right buddy to have along."

","OK, it's a horrible association, but I wonder why Chevron didn't sue Lassiter for copying the ideas of their cars... but who cares now? I'm sure this new addition from the Pixar pen (Digital, I'm sure) will make it's costs and then some. But before I get into actually reviewing this film, I want to part my observation from the spectator side. I realized this was going to have lots of kids seeing it is actually for kids, but for a kids movie, there was a lot of restlessness in the seats. It wasn't engaging them as a cartoon should engage a kid. Either ADHD is at an all time epidemic level, or maybe they were bored with the first part of the film. One mother actually took their 5 year old to the side isle and let them run up and down the steps. A parent behind me tried desperately to ""shhhsssh"" their 1st grader into submission. It didn't work. Even during the latter third of the movie, the conversations amongst the kids seemed more about everyday things that the movie. So, what was the target audience of this film? NASCAR enthusiast? Chevron toy car collectors? Pixar CGI enthusiast (I grimly raise my hand)? A little bit of everything, but not enough on one thing in particular. The one thing that went against this cartoon was it's running time. At 4 minutes less than 2 hours, no kid should be expected to sit through something like this. The apparent nature in kids is to move around and be active. So, this is testing even the most committed parent with a 3 - 6 year old. However, cars is still Pixar, and charming in it's own way. I have to admit, I gaped in awe as McQueen speeds through the mountain tunnel to reveal the waterfall on the other side. Particularly realistic, it could match anything Yosemite Park has to offer, and to think it took down entire computer server when they tried to render the shot in real time, you know they were jammin those bytes by the millions. The sheer magnitude of the study of reflection, color and texture warrants applaud all by it's self. It was a simple plot: Car gets lost, car meets girl... err, chick-car umm, future soccer mom... (whatever) , car ends up making lots of new best friends and setting up shop in depressed town of Radiator Springs. Mater (Larry, The Cable Guy) really pitches his voices to create a great beat up buck toothed tow truck, even managing to slip in a ""get 'er done"" near the end of the movie. Funny thing about this film: it really has no villain, no promoter of evil... all there is is competitive egos. Man, sometimes that can be enough too! I didn't mind the corny name droppings, but the pace of this film is uneven, and even drags for quite a while. Happily, it picks up pace though in the final third, and the action resumes to what one expects of Pixar. If you see it, stay for the credits: They didn't do out-takes, but seems to snip in some funny stuff that one could have imagined the characters doing in the side lines... especially the car versions of previous Pixar films. I would recommend you not take any kids under 5 or 6 simply because some people may be really involved with the film, and a young kid not engaged in a movie enough to shut them up would make a bad viewing for some. Not me, of course!"

","Basically the world is, as the title would imply, full of cars. There are no humans or animals in this flick, though there is a visual pun used here and there with flying Volkswagen bugs. As in the car, really tiny with wings. What kinds of sports do you think sentient talking cars go for? If you answered racing, then you win an internets. The plot revolves around a race car named Lightening McQueen. He's a loner who thinks he doesn't need a pit crew and is obsessed with winning the biggest prize in the North American racing circuit, the Piston Cup. The race at the beginning of the movie ends up a 3 way tie, and a tiebreaker race is set on the other side of the country in a week. In an effort to be first to the track, he pushes his semi partner into driving through the night, which results in him being dumped out of the trailer and on his own when they both fall asleep. After an altercation with a backfiring police car, he's arrested and forced to repave a road he tore up in a backwater Western town along old Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Here he meets a cast of strange cars, including a redneck tow truck named Mater, and a Porche named Sally Carrera. Will he make it to California in time for the race? <br/><br/>The good: It's Pixar. They've never done a bad movie yet, and Cars is not going to be the first. The visuals are stunning. Except when you see the talking cars, you'd think the images on the screen were of real places. The music is great, and really fits with what's going on at the time, especially the dilapidated 50s-60s era feel of Radiator Springs. Makes you want to drive down old Route 66 yourself and see what Pixar thinks we're missing. There are some memorable characters, and most of them are reasonably well fleshed out. There's also some real laugh out loud moments, such as when McQueen and Mater go tractor tipping, and the self ribbing jabs at other Pixar movies near the end.<br/><br/>The bad: Well, the plot is, to put it in car terms, something of a retread. There weren't as many surprises as I would have liked, and I could tell what was going to happen at the end by the time it eventually got to it. Some of the characters are over reliant on the personalities of their voice actors, and are one trick ponies as far as personalities go. It's nice that they got George Carlin to voice Filmore and Cheech Marin for Ramone for example, but they don't actually DO much with them in the movie. It's like, ""Hey, I'm just here for a couple of one liners, but look at my celebrity voice!"" <br/><br/>My thoughts: Overall I think the movie was worth the $8.25 I paid for the ticket. It's a nice way to kill a few hours, especially if you're a geek like me and just love watching that pretty, pretty CGI. The way that the world of the movie is structured so that it still looks familiar to us, but is built for automobiles is really interesting. Like for example instead of stairs in the stadium, there are circular concourses to the upper level parking spots. The parodies of the way human fans behave is good for some laughs too. There are also a few sad moments, though none that brought tears to my eyes like in some of the previous Pixar movies. Be sure and stay for the credits, there's an extra scene after them. While I don't think it's Pixar's best work as far as the plot goes, it's still Pixar, and that still means something."

The casting was wonderful, in particular, hearing George Carlin as a hippied out VW van was nifty and having Paul Newman in his role was also perfect. As with all of Pixar's stuff the animation is gloriously detailed with in jokes for the adults and a number of jokes which will work well with the kids. One line generated a clearly audible ""oooohhh"" from the audience. How often do you get that?<br/><br/>One major hint for those attending this movie (as with all Pixar pictures) do NOT leave when the credits begin.

The critics were looking for the ""wow"" in the story. It is kind of hard to top ""The Incredibles."" Yes, there are plot pieces we've seen before (the main review on the page today does compare Cars to ""Doc Hollywood"") but each Pixar movie finds human truths that the other studio's computer animation films lack. I like and laughed harder at some scenes in ""Over the Hedge"" than I did in Cars, but which one will I remember more? Car's end credits had just as much belly laughs as did all of ""Hedge"" BTW.<br/><br/>Pixar has created a tribute to our driving history: Route 66, the tee-pee shaped motels of the west, the little one stoplight town, and the old school NASCAR before it became what it is today, all of those simple things that we speed by on the interstate. I cursed AAA for putting me on a side rode a few years ago when I found later that I could have driven a less direct, but faster route on an expressway. I was on a timetable, but I would have missed the unique character of the landscape.<br/><br/>They made all the cars believable living creatures, something I doubted they could have sustained, but they did. They even captured Owen Wilson's smarmy charm and facial expressions. They also made me forget Ardman's Chevron Cars, something I was afraid they would begin to resemble.<br/><br/>The basic story, though maybe not all that original, mines the truths in life from what is there. Honor, love and friendship are more important than anything. Themes that run through out the Pixar films--and some critics complained about that!"

","Pixar has done it again and Cars is simply amazing. Loved the animation, the scenery, the voices, the sound effects, the jokes, and all the ""aha!"" moments when you put 2 + 2 together (Paul Newman, ""Hud"" does the voice of the ""Hudson"" Hornet, etc.) The story is really well done ... not too corny, too sugary, too condescending, too toilet-y, or too over the top ... it's excellent.<br/><br/>Like the Incredibles, the action, intensity and visual imagery of this movie is breathtaking and will leave you wanting to see it again and again. There is so much wonderful detail to soak in. Unlike the Incredibles, however, in my opinion the only place where this movie lagged behind was in its soundtrack. The music was fun and they chose some really good 'pop' tunes to tie it together, but Randy Newman's original soundtrack was too reminiscent of his score to Toy Story. I think there was plenty of material to inspire a fresh soundtrack that could have made the ride even more memorable. <br/><br/>Stay around during the credits. The fun continues right to the end!"

","I saw Cars this afternoon with a group of animators I work with.<br/><br/>Plainly and simply stated, I liked it. It was a fully pleasant way to spend a few hours on a summer afternoon.<br/><br/>This films is notThe Incredibles, but I found it better than Monsters Inc. and a far sight better than A Bugs Life. The animators did an admirable job articulating sheet metal into being appealing characters, the digital sets were expansive and gorgeous and the lighting was beautiful. It is certainly worth seeing on the big screen. Voice casting worked very well in conjunction with the character design; I believed those voices would come out of those characters -- not something that always works out.<br/><br/>John Lasseter has made a play on the heartstrings of the audience and some people will find the film a tad sentimental. Fair enough, but just remember, Cars is officially a Disney film which is the official territory of the family tear jerker. I think its actually good to see that Disney has found their audience again after having lost their way for a while with such films as Treasure Planet and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, that were so scatter shot you couldn't figure out who they were made for. If your memories of Disney films are ones of beautiful animation that make you inwardly admit that cartoon character not only made you smile but perhaps caused a tear to well up, this film will fit the bill.<br/><br/>Critics who are already dismissing this movie might have their heads up their tailpipes. Ignore them and judge for yourself.<br/><br/>There are lots of great gags, funny writing at a level both kids and adults will enjoy. Too many in jokes to mention, and be absolutely sure you stay right through the tail credits.<br/><br/>p.s. For those of you who listen to Car Talk on NPR, watch out for the Tappet Brothers."

It is clear what they need: some action, some tension, music/singing is good, but mostly  bad guys. They need clear delineation of who is good and who is bad. Just having the nearly wooden Owen Wilson search for himself in the guise of a sports car does not cut it.

Indycar racing is dull and almost unknown to Europeans- which does not help. Many of the other clichés are again almost unknown outside the US of A, and even as a Brit who has lived in the midwest they rankle.

I think the plot and action were not accessible to young kids. What do they know about cars and the history of Route 66? The theater was relatively crowded and no one was laughing.

The movie runs for about 2 hours, and there were many times when I caught myself thinking things that had nothing to do with the movie (did I left my PC turned on when I left home?)... the story was simply NOT engrossing enough. You may say that maybe I wasn't in the mood for an animated film, but you would be wrong. I was in the mood. Besides, the best judges in the theatre could corroborate my words: All around me, kids were starting to lose any interest in the movie by the second half of it. Even my kids where apparently more excited to play with their Cars action figures than watching the ""real thing"" on the screen. But enough with the bad... wait, I'm not done. The movie seems to be directed to... I don't know who, but not to the people who liked the other Pixar films. I mean, now I know what my girlfriend felt when I made here watch with me films like ""Any Given Sunday"". I felt lost as to why those Cars were making such a big deal of a race. Things like having a ""cameo"" of this driver guy Schumacher (totally sic) flew over me until after like 10 seconds when my brain woke up and look for his name in the file cabinet for ""unnecessary general culture/pseudo-sports"" (btw, he's this big-shot driver, kinda like the Michael Jordan of racing, I guess). Then, if you'd know me, you would know that I'm a guy with a very, VERY good sense of suspension of disbelief. Throw me all the wizards, unicorns, aliens, ghosts, superheroes, valiant reporters, gooey masses, talking animals, living toys, God, the Devil, whatever! I will hold my brain ""on hold"" and believe it all for the duration of the movie, so I can enjoy it, you know. But here, I just couldn't do it. I've heard the expression ""leave your brain at the entrance"" many times, but this is the first time that I've actually wish I could do it. How in the HELL can we believe in a world where EVERYTHING is cars-related! As hard as I tried, I couldn't stop from thinking that the damn machines do NOT have hands! There's no way they can ""create"" anything, let alone something as sophisticated as, well, human-like lifestyles! I now realized that in every movie there's always something/someone with hands. This idea, a world populated with cars, may work in shows like Thomas The Tank, or maybe Bob The Builder (but there Bob has hands), BUT these shows are segments of 20 minutes tops, and they are idea-based on some moral argument directed at 2, 3 or 4 years old kids! They're like a naptime story that you usually don't have to explain because the point of the story is the idea of ""sharing"", or ""be nice to your siblings"", or some other brainwashing message to have better kids. Here, in a movie that's supposed to be fun for little kids, as well as for adults, or just kids that are potty-trained, well, it just didn't worked. The good things are what make Pixar probably the best animation company out there. The graphics were excellent as expected. The highlight would be the short animation ""One Man Band"". Totally hilarious with a lot of emotions mixed in its scarce 5 or so minutes. Probably my second favourite next to ""Yak-Yak Attack"". I would say that the short film made it worth going to watch Cars, but I still wondered why didn't I left my wife with the kids and went to watch ""Nacho Libre"" instead. OK, I gotta stop myself. I started writing this saying that the movie is OK, but the more I write about it, the more I'm actually hating it. That wasn't supposed to happen. I know that you will see for yourself if this movie sucks or not, I just hope that you have a better control of your brain that I do, and that your day is REALLY relaxed, so you can stand the boredom of s stroll thru Route 66."

","It starts out okay, but then when he gets stuck in the small town there's little to no action to really hold the viewers attention. Personally I started dozing off in the middle of the movie. Also many kids don't know too much about cars so it's difficult for them to understand a lot of jokes because they go over their heads. Many of the jokes were geared more for adults, especially many of the jokes about between the main character and the Porsche. I also found the movie to be quite predictable after the main character got stuck in the small town. It was cute but nowhere near the top quality of other Disney/Pixar movies such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the Incredibles. It's a rather forgettable movie, I saw it just today and I can't even remember the main character's full name, just that it's Lightening something."

Now that it is out, me and my girlfriend went to it. <br/><br/>Horrible. The animation is great, the comedy relief provided by Tow Mater (Larry's character) is hilarious, but the overall storyline was lame. I read somewhere it took 17 hours per frame to make this movie. How about spending an extra 10 minutes per frame to make a decent storyline? <br/><br/>Definitely not one of Pixar's best as far as ability to enjoy an animated masterpiece, I would recommend Toy Story part 1 or 2, A Bug's Life, Antz, or anything else Pixar has graced us with."

","I love Pixar movies and was still looking forward to Cars even though the clips I'd seen didn't exactly grab me. Sadly although visually it looked great I was so bored I actually considered leaving the theater which is rare for me. I think the problem was it lacked the compelling story, great characters and witty script I've come to expect from Pixar. They've always had the knack of appealing to all ages but this felt liked it was squarely aimed at little boys and Nascar fans. Before you say well I guess you just don't like Nascar, well I don't but neither do I like French Restaurants but I still enjoyed Ratatouille. Fortunately Pixar has been back on track since and I can't wait to see Toy Story 3."

","But considering how amazing Pixar films are, this ain't so bad. So they remade Doc Hollywood with cartoon cars. Meh. It was okay, but not Pixar's finest by any means. Still it was worth the watching. I would probably not go out of my way to watch it again. I think the concept of anthropomorphizing vehicles a bit weird. Why wasn't Bessie alive? And I get the VW Beetle sight gag, but it did not make sense in the parameters of the Cars universe. Without people with hands how do the buildings get built and the cars (again without hands) repair each other? This movie just does not work on so many levels. On the other hand the voice actors did a great job! I love Bonnie Hunt and of course Paul Newman, Katherine Helmond and George Carlin. Jeremy Piven playing the same character again? I loved that they got Click and Clack in there too. They fit so many famous voices into the film, the actors must have worked for scale. Not a great film but still a fun time."
"swim_freak777","2","2","5","27 December 2008"," Definitely Not Pixar's Best
","I am actually a bit of Pixar myself. Some of their movies, like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"", are my all time favorites. However, Cars really just didn't grab me when I first watched it. It's a rather sweet film (I guess), with good animation, but there's something lacking in this one.<br/><br/>The story follows Lightening Mcqueen, a hotshot race car, whose dream is to win the major, important grand race (I forgot what it was called). However, after qualifying, on the way there, his ride falls asleep and Mcqueen falls out. In his frantic search back he gets lost and stumbles upon a little has been town known as Radiator Springs. Here, he begins to find himself, and see what's really important in life (or something).<br/><br/>I know I probably sound very uncaring about this movie, but that's its problem; it is a dull movie. I remember this first time I watched it, I saw it with my nephew. He seemed really entertained (maybe because he actually likes playing with cars), but I was bored.<br/><br/>What's really missing from this movie are the creative, engaging characters found in a lot of other Pixar films. Most of the characters are just flat, and boring. I never really empathized with Mcqueen or any of his back road friends. Another thing that brought the movie down were the titular characters, the cars. Maybe it's just me, but the usage of cars in a movie is just not that entertaining. I don't mind cars a side characters (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", for example), but when they're the main focus there's nothing that attention grabbing. Though there are a few funny car-related jokers here and there (i.e. falling asleep at the wheel), over all, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>The plot line is rather drab and seems to be recycled from other Pixar works. And in the end the morals that are presented are either so over used or not well presented that they really don't seem to matter that much. Also, another thing that drags ""Cars"" down, is, though the animation is well done, the overall color schemes is not that appealing. The whole cast and background are really dull colors that don't didn't catch my eye at all.<br/><br/>Unless you find the idea of a movie about automatic vehicles the greatest thing ever, ""Cars"" is really not worth the time. It will most likely get boring after awhile, and kids (unless they really love their Hot Wheels) will get anxious and squirmy."
"bob the moo","Null","2","5","24 April 2008"," Good but not great film whose main failing seems to be just not hitting the bar set by its predecessors
","Lightening McQueen is a rookie racing in The Piston Cup and set to make history by being the first rookie to win it as it comes down to a three way decider between him, a retiring champion and the car who has been building his whole career to this victory. However while on his way to California for the deciding race, Lightening gets separated from his trailer and finds himself on the interstate and suddenly the thing he has never needed as a race car has become important  headlights. Lightening gets off the road and speeds his way through a small town where he is caught for speeding and sentenced to community service. While the small town people grate on Lightening, he knuckles down to the task, knowing the clock is ticking.<br/><br/>For some reason Cars was not as well received by critics as some other Pixar films had been but I was confident that the studio could still give me something worth seeing. Watching it I can understand why the film maybe didn't go down that well but this is far from saying that the film is no good or even average. The film has a solid plot where we have an arrogant hero learning valuable life lessons from ""simple"" folk and pretty much you know where it is all going to go and indeed so it does. The twist here is that the characters are all cars and I did enjoy the logic within this alternative universe and it was this that made the film for me because I didn't find the plot strong enough on its own. However the themes of the racing world, simple townsfolk, media hype and so on are better such as they are done.<br/><br/>Two hours is probably too long to sustain though and the material does feel a bit stretched at times and it doesn't quite zing along in the way some other Pixar films have, where everything comes thick and fast. This is particularly evident in the laugh department because the film is not really that funny although it does manage to be consistently amusing  again it does feel a bit harsh to be criticising a film for this but I suppose the phrase is ""victims of their own success"" when it comes to Pixar because it is hard not to compare with the previous films, all of which have set the bar very high. The touches are all fun (I loved the cows in this alternative reality) and generally it is all good stuff but personally I did miss the really strong ""one-liner"" characters.<br/><br/>This is not to criticise the cast because I did really enjoy Shalhoub and Quaroni in these side roles but just that the material didn't serve them as well as others have been. Wilson was a good bit of casting as his usual character fits Lightening well. Likewise Newman seems like a no-brainer and his voice is a great presence. Hunt is so-so and Larry the Cable Guy is good, if a bit one-note. Cheech, Lewis, Dooley and others are reasonable if not that great. Minor roles from Piven, Keaton, Leno, Schumacher and others add colour (well, the latter adds the colour ""grey"" in his own unique style). Although Ratzenberger does have a small role in the main film, I did enjoy his contribution to the end credits.<br/><br/>Overall then this is an enjoyable and consistently amusing film from Pixar and the only real problem with it is that it is certainly not up to their usual standard in regards mixing laughs with a strong plot. Not brilliant but I think it is a sort of backwards compliment to the high standards set by Pixar that a film that is just a solid ""good"" comes over a bit disappointing."
"fritosorlays","2","2","5","29 December 2007"," How did ""Cars"" receive over 5 stars?
","Pixar has been falling a long drop since separating with Disney, and this may be one of the lowest its ever been. When I saw this movie, I wasn't expecting a Toy Story, or A Bugs life. Not after Pixar's last few movies, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo to name a few, but I was expecting it to be at least entertaining. Boy was I wrong, this movie is so bland, predictable, and one dimensional, I would've paid extra money to get my one hour back. The movies only saving grace is the animation, but even then, Pixar chose some pretty boring things to animate. Talking cars that you always see in gas commercials, and 80 percent of the movie is nothing but desert and a small town of which the scenery never changes. And the other 20 percent is spent on a race track and spending all that time just circling the race track, something anyone who has ever stopped on ESPN would've seen.<br/><br/>This movie deserves nothing more than a two, it was exactly like a trap hole, it looks alright to step on, but once you do, you wish you never did."
"donalexei","4","2","5","10 March 2007"," By far the worst Pixar film
","I'm sorry, I just didn't like it at all. First of all there's the opening race : boring, it's way too long, it's just to show off clean special effects. Then there's the story, one of the most simplistic ans sentimentalist ever. Okay ! it's a film for children, great, but when it just has some crappy predictable and moralistic end (they're teaching our children that friendship is a good thing). I mean, compare that with Toy Story, or even Snow White, and you see that films for children can be superb without having to give a pompous lesson, some of the scenes really made me feel sick (the hero and his gal riding in the forest with silly music, pathetic). AND it's not even that funny, the scripwriterS (yes, more than one) only managed to crack about five jokes in two long hours of SFX and cheesy romance. The only good thing about it was the thing about small towns being cut off from the world because of a big motorway that had been recently built."

","Incredible! I just watched half of ""Cars"" on DVD (I hadn't seen it before), and I'll give my DVD to someone else...

About 15 minutes of tape, at the cost of the equivalent of some 30$ at the time. Great stuff! I've been following Pixar ever since, bought and enjoyed all their productions (partly on VHS, partly on DVD) and I just don't get what's happening now. A Pixar movie that mainly consists of storytelling errors! What on earth made them think they could make this ""cars only"" item work? I really don't see who could enjoy this thing, apart from a bunch of car racing aficionados... Incredible... and a big disappointment!"

","If you're going to see this movie just for the animation, you likely won't be disappointed. But if you want to see something funny akin to Monsters Inc., you'll have to sit through an hour and half of ho-hum dialogue before anything really gets going. The last 30 minutes are pretty funny and the story finally comes together, but it doesn't save the movie. The end credits are funnier than most of the main feature. Two hours is just too long to sit and watch (albeit amazing) animation. The main contradiction in the movie is that the dialogue is aimed at little kids (too bad Disney bought out Pixar) but the running time of the movie is way too long for little kids."

","Normal films about racing cars are generally bad. In fact, I have yet to meet the first good one. Good thing this is an animation film. A young and rebellious car, still full of dreams, races his rounds, hoping one day to win the big prize: the Piston cup. Travelling from one race to the other he accidentally ends up in a small town. A town that once stood proud as a part of the great route 66 trail, but that has fallen apart after a highway is installed, taking away all the need to pass the city at all.<br/><br/>In many respects this children's film is about making new friends, standing your ground, putting your priorities right. In many other respects it is a colorful animation film that amuses the kids. In completeness, it does fairly well, if not good.<br/><br/>Can't say I was overly impressed with it myself, but my 7.5 year old nephew loved it. It stays interesting from the start to the end and brings a couple good messages across - to the parents. The children will probably miss them.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 fast cars on the slow lane."
"adudewhoiscool","6","2","5","19 August 2006"," Pixar's First Disappointment
","From the makers of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bugs Life,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Monsters Inc,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" comes the newest addition to the Pixar family, ""Cars."" When you watch something by the animators of those movies, you expect something better then the average animated movie. From the looks of the trailers, it did not look good, but because of the high reputation Pixar has, I decided to see it. Unfortunately, ""Cars"" does not perform quite well enough to the standards and it has become my first Pixar disappointment.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is the next big thing in Racing. Unfortunately, while he was speeding on his way to a huge race, he crashes into Radiator Springs, destroying many things in this path. Lighting is forced to do community service in order to make up for all of the damages done. Even though McQueen will do anything to get out of the work, he must learn to accept and bond with the inhabitants of Radiator Springs, in order for him to leave and get back to the raceway.<br/><br/>As always, the animation is beautiful. Ever sense ""Toy Story"" hit theaters, revolutionized the way we view animated movies, I have been impressed with Pixar and am always left speechless with every movie they make. The animation is so well done, in some scenes, it is actually hard to tell that it is animated. The animation was the best part, but that does not make a movie.<br/><br/>I thought the length was too long. At two hours, this is the longest movie Pixar has ever made. A normal animated film is between 1 hour and 20 minutes and 1 hour and 45 minutes. If ""Cars"" were fifteen to thirty minutes shorter, it would be a lot better. It really dragged, in the middle, to the point where it was somewhat boring. I checked my watch twice during this. The movie I saw before that, ""Superman Returns,"" which was 2 hours 37 minutes long, I did not check my watch once. I even felt antsy for something to happen and I could only imagine how a younger child would feel. I never felt that way about the other Pixar movies; I always thought they were the perfect length.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes Pixar movies so great is because all their stories have either triggered or been triggered by a childhood imagination. I have felt my imagination come to life when I see a normal Pixar film. In this world of ""Cars,"" there are no people or animals, just cars. As a child, I have imagined stories about monsters living in my closet, the life of a toy once a child leaves the room, and even a world where superheroes and people live together. I have also imagined being a fish or a bug and having conversation with the same species. As a child, I had never pictured a world full of cars. Yes, I have played with Matchbox cars, but the only noises they made were the typical ""Vroom Vroom"" that all children make when playing with toy cars. <br/><br/>What makes Pixar animated movies better then the average animated movie was the humor added. Usually you would get a movie with lots of funny moments that not only kids can laugh at but adults can too. I did chuckle at four or five scenes but only tiny chuckles. Majority of the Pixar movies, if not all of them, had many memorable scenes but was not the case for ""Cars."" The only real memorable scene is the tractor-tipping scene, ""Tractor Tippin's fun!"" In ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles,"" I would be laughing aloud at many scenes.<br/><br/>Overall ""Cars"" was very disappointing. Sure, it had great animation but that does not make an entire movie. As I mentioned earlier, I believe the best thing would be to cut about 15 to 30 minutes. There was an animated short, before the movie started, that was excellent called ""One Man Band."" Do you remember when I said that the other Pixar movies were all above average quality? That rule did not apply because this was an average animated movie. I recommend only seeing this for the amazing animation!"
"RCWjr","6","2","5","12 June 2006"," Good, but that isn't the usual reaction to Pixar/Disney
","While this film gets a decent enough score from me, a 6, this film suffers from two things; a lack of distinct style and believability. In all the previous Disney/Pixar creations, each had its own animation style that set it apart. Here, this looks like a hodge podge of Toy Story and Monsters Inc. The believability of the characters is a huge hurdle here. I think the choice of cars as characters hinders the believability of the characters and we the viewer being able to relate to them.<br/><br/>There is very little in the way of adult entertainment in the film and with a run time of right at 2hrs, it feels that long, especially for kids. My daughter was bored with the film after an hour, something she hasn't ever been with the previous Disney/Pixar films. I have to say I agree with her. The ending is nice enough and the film does have its moments. But overall, this is a pedestrian effort from all involved."
"samseescinema","3","25","148","21 May 2006"," a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid
","Cars <br/><br/>rating: 1.5 out of 4<br/><br/>It was bound to happen. After one-upping itself over and again with pioneers and masterworks like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, there had to be a stumble. Pixar's track record couldn't be that good. We just didn't expect Pixar to take a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid. <br/><br/>If an infant's picture book was the idea Pixar had in mind when they birthed this project, then maybe John Lasseter and his team deserve applause. Their film works on this level, refusing to smarten up or hunker down on any ounce of maturity. The fundamental error, perhaps, is that it asks us to relate to automobiles. Not just a world where automobiles keep their speech skills secret a la Toy Story, but a world made up entirely of cars. Even the flies swarming the light bulbs are VW Beetles. I can relate to superheroes, I can relate to fish, I can relate to monsters, I can even relate to bugs, but a machine that looks like my childhood Hot Wheels? Sorry. Giving a car googly-eyes and bumper lips does not make it human. And for that matter, the cars don't act human. The personalities of these characters mirror most of the characters I remember from a babysitting experience years ago, when I watched ""Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends"". They're broad and smeared with stereotype; kind, easy traits that reflect Cars' story.<br/><br/>It's the tale of Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) and his time spent in Radiator Springs, a backwater town that rests on the grave of Route 66. Stranded there a week before his big showdown with Chick Hicks (voice of Michael Keaton) and The King (voice of Richard Petty), Lightning gets himself mixed up with the locals and thrown into jail. The mayor of the town, Doc Hudson (voice of Paul Newman) and the prosecutor, Sally the Porsche (voice of Bonnie Hunt), sentence him to a road pavement job that will requires five days of work. Lightning's arrogant and huffy, steamed that he's stuck in a ghost town with the likes of Mater (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) the rusty tow-truck, and Ramone (voice of Cheech Marin) the custom paint-job fanatic. But his stay turns therapeutic once he softens up to Sally and finds there's more to a car's life than endorsements.<br/><br/>Cars is, well, just very silly. Its story surrounds a life lesson, which is a formula that, when put to Pixar, stands a chance. Not a great chance, as central lessons tend to dilute otherwise human stories, but a Pixar-sized chance nonetheless. But the lesson turns infantile and the film moot, sullied probably by our enormous expectations. This stuff will work fine for your toddler, and maybe distract a wide-eyed nine year-old, but trying to compare it to The Incredibles is the only tear-jerking moment you'll have in the theatre. The art can be pretty, sure; but these days digital beauty is standard. And paired with the plastic-esquire car animations, the lovely backgrounds mean even less.<br/><br/>Luckily for Pixar, their films aren't known for being Thomas the Tank Engine look-a-likes. Cars, let's decide, can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one. Their revenues probably won't be dented by this hiccup, since everyone's still giddy from The Incredibles. But when Ratatouille (Pixar's next project) is released next Summer, the film will have its share of skeptics. Ratatouille is headed up by Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles--and hardly anyone from this Cars hack-job is on the projectso we can at least expect a move to square two. For now, however, Pixar can go sit in the corner, hiding beneath its dunce cap."

Not to mention the internal logic that is non-existent. To put it bluntly: had this movie been made about humans, not a single person would have liked it.

(2001), Pixar's strength has been not just its uber-progressive eye for CG detailing, but the team's sense of humor and flexibility with its intended target-audiences - an animated sortie by Pixar can appeal equally to preschool whipper-snappers and grouchy retirees' laugh quotas.<br/><br/>The versatility of the studio's subject-matter over the years has also been enviable, Pixar proving itself as adept at lampooning cultural icons as it has been at unfurling cool characters for kids' lunchboxes.<br/><br/>On first impressions, with Pixar's founding father, John Lasseter, back in the driver's seat after a seven-year directorial hiatus, Cars has all the essential ingredients to create another sure-fire winner - checkered flag, lunchbox and all.<br/><br/>But scrape beneath its waxed and polished exterior, and you may walk away a tad disappointed.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot premise: Churlish, high-octane motor-racing rookie Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) sets the track afire and is all set to take the national championship before an accidental detour off Route 66 sets him in the slow-lane in a sleepy little hick town called Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>There he realizes the error of his ways and becomes best buddies with a multicultural cross-section of motor vehicles bearing engines of gold; he also gets the chance to fall in love with someone aside from himself, and saves said town from obscurity.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a bit like Toy Story on wheels, filtered through a homogenized host of celluloid predecessors including City Slickers, U-Turn and Petticoat Junction.<br/><br/>While at times quirky, mostly this yarn borders on pedestrian. Chances are it's all the backseat drivers involved - Lasseter may have written and directed with Joe Ranft (who was tragically, if ironically, killed last year in an automobile accident), but there was scripting input from at least nine other people.<br/><br/>The cast also struggles to turn over. Cars plunks 81-year-old veteran actor Paul Newman alongside the more comic-inclined Wilson, Michael Keaton, Cheech Marin, and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger (Hamm the Piggy Bank in Toy Story).<br/><br/>Ratzenberger is side-tracked (as Mack, the transport truck) until the final credits, Marin fills out a tired Latino stereotype, Keaton isn't allowed driving time to develop his surly take on McQueen's chief racing rival, and Wilson is unusually flat as the stockcar infant terrible.<br/><br/>It's left to Newman to save the (spoken-word) day, but even his gravely intonations - as Doc Hudson, the 1951 Hudson Hornet M.D. with a mysterious, racy past - aren't quite up to the Herculean task here.<br/><br/>Lasseter has confirmed that the character name of Lightning McQueen is in part a homage to the late, great Steve McQueen, the actor who pushed the driving envelope in movies like Bullitt and Le Mans; Newman himself has been a renowned car racing nut for years on end. Classic Pixar would've tweaked this angle for more than it was worth, yet all we get here is Lightning McQueen's racing number - 95 - which is a mundane reference to the year Toy Story was released.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely funny sequences here, like the tractor-tipping, the closing-credits Ratzenberger rant, and the flying bugs which are, yes, VW Beetles. But these moments are fleeting and spaced far apart.<br/><br/>Most surprising is the lack of depth in the personas - particularly since Pixar usually renders insightful character designs and personalities. This may be just animation, but coloring between the lines is essential.<br/><br/>Luigi, the 1959 Fiat 500, and Fillmore, the 1960 Volkswagen Kombi van, offer cute asides, but visualizing central character Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) as a 2002 Porsche 911 is a bland choice for the love interest. Wouldn't a 1969 VW Karmann Ghia or a 1960 Volvo P1800S Sports qualify as far more sexy options, if we're going to get all auto-erotic? For a studio following up on its two most internationally successful films, in its 20th anniversary year, Cars is Pixar's least satisfying outing.<br/><br/>Unless you reside in the heartland of the American Midwest, twiddle with V8 engines, listen to country music, smash the odd mailbox, vote for George W., have secret hankerings for reruns of The Beverley Hillbillies, or adore NASCAR racing - as Lasseter does - your attention span may start sputtering before you've completed the first lap."

","After thoroughly enjoying this movie with my kids, I could not help but having that nagging feeling of Deja Vu... It hit me about 18 hours later but I realized that I HAD seen this movie before, only under a different title. <br/><br/>Think about it... Big city hotshot on his way to California. Has to work off a debt before he is allowed to leave. Meets girl whom he assumes (wrongly) is another small town, small minded, no goals woman. Finds out later she too came from the big city. Finally gets to leave and makes it to California. Eventually sees the errors of his ways and returns to settle down in same small town. <br/><br/>Does this ring any bells with other movie goers?? Of course I know the answer, but have YOU seen these same plot points in another movie?"

","Looks like Disney's habit of ""borrowing"" from other, original sources has infected Pixar. The anthropomorphic vehicles are cute--until you remember animator Tex Avery's delightful ""One Cab's Family"" and ""Little Johnny Jet"" for MGM 54 years ago. Unfortunately, anyone in a position to fully appreciate this movie (who remembers the American highway between the end of World War II and the start of the Interstates) is probably going to remember them. My family DID have a Hudson. And I have to agree with Roger Ebert: Whereinhell is the Studebaker (they were made less that forty miles away)? Definitely several cuts below ""The Incredibles,"" and can we please lose the self-reflexive humor (the Pixar self-parodies at the end)? All of P's previous efforts were able to stand on their own without showcasing pop-culture references, especially obsolete ones from the fifties. I doubt anyone will get the Cozy Cone joke unless they've visited the Teich Postcard Museum in Wauconda, Illinois."
"StuntsForFilm","2","6","30","9 June 2006"," Boring
","Possibly the worst film by Pixar to date. It started off OK but drug so bad in the middle that even the most immature prepubescent member of the audience couldn't find anything to laugh at. Thank God they finally threw in a fart so someone in the audience got a chuckle. It seemed to attempt at tugging on your feelings rather than just making you laugh which is what a cartoon comedy is supposed to do. Or so I thought. Larry the Cable Guy carried the entire film and his character wasn't all that funny. I really wanted to like this movie and so did my kids but we walked out disappointed. Animation was very good, as always, but the script just absolutely stunk the place up. I wouldn't even recommend this one for rental but I would definitely avoid going to the theater to see this ""wreck"" of a film. (Pun intended)"

","This film is extremely underrated and is an unappreciated Pixar film and does not deserve it. It is one of Pixar's finest works. It tells a beautiful story of taking life slowly, enjoying it, and being a good person. The songs are touching and there is some good comedy. The races are also very entertaining and McQueens character change is well executed. It does have it's flaws, like some of the racing rules and some things like Tractor Tipping are fun but weird. Overall, this is a great film and is one of Pixar's finest works, it deserves better recognition and praise."
"bigbootyjudy-62490","8","1","2","5 September 2018"," Epic
","1. When you hear the name ""Pixar"", you instantly expect a high quality film experience. This expectation is an example of connotation, the suggestive meaning of a word. Cars lives up to this studio's reputation as its protagonist, plot, climax, and point of view are all excellent.
2. The first superb aspect of Cars is the protagonist, Lightning Mcqueen. Like any protagonist, Mcqueen serves as the main character that the plot revolves around. He is a youthful, hot-blooded racer who is living the good life of fame and fortune. As a side effect of this ravish lifestyle, Mcqueen becomes oblivious to the outside world. One of the turning points for Mcqueen's character is his interactions with the various cars of Radiator Springs. 
3. They teach him to be a ""slow racer"". This combination of words with contrasting meanings that reveal the truth create an oxymoron that symbolizes Mcqueen's dynamic change as a character.
4. Unsurprisingly the position of which this work is told is third person with a focus on Mcqueen's experiences. With this common point of view the viewer is given insight to not only Mcqueen's thoughts, but the other characters he interacts with as well. This comes into play for three of the biggest side cars, Doc Hudson, Mater, and Sally. No new grounds are broken with the POV in this film, but it serves its purpose and is simple enough for kids of any age to understand.
5. The next factor behind Cars's greatness is its plot. The order of events that take place in Cars is standard, offering an easy to digest plot made for its target demographic. The driving factor behind the story is Mcqueen change as a ""person"". This is accomplished through the life lessons that Mcqueen attains from each of the inhabitants of Radiator Springs. When Mcqueen stumbles into Radiator Springs he may have lost his way, but he found new friends. Doc Hudson, Mater, Sally, and the others of Radiator Springs all make an impression on Mcqueen that later plays a role in the final race. 
6. Everything in the film builds up to this final race to make it the most significant part of the movie, causing it to be the climax and the payoff. Mcqueen is more motivated to win the piston cup than ever before. His new friends are also there to cheer him on and act as his pit crew. Using the skills he picked up along his journey, Mcqueen is able to pull ahead in the race and secure a victory. That is until Chick Hicks plays dirty and puts King (the previous piston cup champion) out of commission. Just as Mcqueen is about to receive first place, he reflects on the life lessons he has learned. Being the hero that he is, Mcqueen backs up and pushes King to the finish line, allowing King to finish the race. This honorable act not serves as a satisfying conclusion, but also as an important detail of Cars 2 and Cars 3.
7. The only proper way to sum up our feelings about Pixar's Cars is through consonance. Through the repeating consonant sounds at the end of the words in this phrase: the movie ""Cars"", is a star that raises the bar, because it is made by Pixar, anyone can understand its greatness."
"Mr-Fusion","5","1","2","13 June 2017"," Why does it feel like a soulless cash-grab?
","""Cars"" was never one of my favorite PIXAR movies, even back in the days when I was an ardent fanboy. But before I say anything else about it, the animation is resplendent, above reproach and characteristic of the studio's reputed craft.<br/><br/>It's everything else that isn't. This movie lacks the heart of the studio's other titles (say, ""Toy Story"" or . . . hell, any of them) and it grinds down to a halt once the story moves away from the race track. From there, it's lots of Larry the Cable Guy, awkward gags, and awful cover songs. It's completely fair to say that Michael Keaton - in his few minutes' worth of presence - steals this thing.<br/><br/>But it's shocking to learn that this ""Doc Hollywood"" rip-off was a passion project for John Lasseter.<br/><br/>It's not good.<br/><br/>5/10"
"frankjones-84156","7","1","2","17 April 2017"," Not Pixar's best, but still enjoyable
","Okay, so Cars is not Pixar's best movie and it has been out shot by other movies they've created: Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Monsters Inc. This movie was really enjoyable and I really liked a lot of the scenes in it. Especially the drifting scene because that's what Cars do, right? The characters were also a lot of fun and the racing scenes were really entertaining. Although a lot of people think it's one of the weakest Pixar movies, I thought it was a really fun ride and definitely one that you can sit and watch."
"datautisticgamer-74853","3","1","2","22 May 2016"," What influenced toys should have remained as toys
","Cars, the second Pixar dud I had to sit through (though with lower expectations than A Bug's Life), was unfortunately one of the final films for some absolutely amazing actors, like George Carlin and Paul Newman. The only plus that I can give it is that since it's Pixar, they try with the animation and it paid off: the visuals are cool to stare at if seeming more generic than other Pixar movies. For the rest of the film, however, I was absolutely stultified by how the humor was rather low-quality for a Pixar movie (tractor cattle that can blow flatulence-sounding exhaust, somehow), and how the story couldn't engage me even with one musical scene that I felt recycled excessively from When She Loved Me. Some characters are nice, like Lightning McQueen, who did a Samaritan action near the end that I greatly appreciated and boosted points for, but others mainly make borderline abysmal jokes or act stereotypical or anything other than likable. It just goes to show you that even when John Lasseter is one of the biggest people at the company, that doesn't mean he can make only decent movies. All this movie felt overall was one more reason to sell more Cars-painted Hot Wheels and similar toy cars in order to blast the competition away. It paid off in the toy market, but as a movie it's one that I would pass. The good news is, Pixar recovered from here, this time with something more original than 7 years prior."
"byson5186","2","1","2","14 November 2015"," Too Slow, And Childish
","I'll be giving a popular Pixar movie a low rating. For one, I find it hard to believe that this movie is almost a decade old. You wonder where all the time has gone? I feel like 21st Century special effects haven't really changed. I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters around the time it came out, and how popular new Pixar characters seemed at the time. But, this movie did not appeal to me when it came out. I'd see this movie a final time a few years later even as an adult. One of my adult friends who had this on Blu Ray, wanted us to watch this because of the high definition and nice special effects.<br/><br/>This movie has never appealed to me. I also thought of this movie like Finding Nemo, a popular high grossing movie that has great special effects and came out a few years earlier. To me, they seem like movies I'd see with my nephews on a preschool channel, as if I were watching something like J.J. The Jet Plane, Or Thomas The Tank Engine. I feel like this movie would appeal to kids, they might not understand the story but just be obsessed with the characters but I don't see how a movie like this would appeal to adults? Maybe, the special effects.<br/><br/>I also felt like this movie is a little slow paced. Lightning McQueen is a race car, but a lot of this movie takes place in the middle of nowhere. I was more anxious to see Lightning McQueen get to his race. It's also interesting how this is a kids movie, but there aren't any kid cars. There isn't really action either, Good Verses Evil. I heard there's action in the second one. Also, all the living things we see in the movie are vehicles, from cars, tractors, trains, and helicopters. There is not a single person or animal in the movie.<br/><br/>We can think back to The Lion King. That movie doesn't have any people, just animals. I feel like Lion King would appeal more, and it's a great Disney movie. It feels like we all remember the Disney movies we saw as kids and frequently make references to them. That being said, I feel like it's fine to still have a kid inside you as you grow up. Doing so will allow you to keep up with younger kids and make you feel a kid at heart. Sometimes my Dad even feels like I am still childish, specifically for liking DragonBall Z as an adult. But, seriously I saw Resurrection F earlier this summer and loved it. Almost everybody in the movie theater were young adults. We can watch videos of people going over the series and they are guys with facial hair not like 10-year old kids. <br/><br/>I also rented a movie a couple of years ago that remains my favorite movie, Junior High Spy. I still regularly watch scenes from that movie. It's the type of movie that entertains me, and even as an adult my eyes get glued to the screen each time I see it. The main character in that movie, Ricky Lazio is a totally awesome respectable character. His sidekick in the movie Jack is a naturally funny character. While the movie was independent and didn't have the best acting it can entertain me more than any other film.<br/><br/>Sometime shortly after seeing Cars, I saw Monster House. That movie appealed to me way more. It's more interesting for me to see a Special Effects movie showing 3 Middle School friends keeping a watch on their neighborhood after believing the house across the street was possessed. Also, how you could tell while watching that movie that it was supposed to take place in the '80s or possibly early '90s. That's more interesting than watching a movie where everything is a vehicle, and a car trying to get to his race. Cars also is a long movie, almost 2 hours long, but it mostly feels slow paced so if you're like me you'll find it slow and childish. I leave it with a 2/10. Instead, I'd recommend the other movies I mentioned."

"ajs-10","7","1","2","26 December 2010"," It's good... but not great...
","I have seen this film a couple of times now and, I have to admit, I didn't like it much at first, but after a second viewing, it's starting to grow on me a little. Made by Pixar, who have made some brilliant animated features, I expected something of a higher standard, but having said that, it's not all that bad. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please re-surface Main Street while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is a race car; he is an up-and-coming star and has qualified for a race-off in California for the Piston Cup. Loaded onto his transporter, Mack, he sets off for the long trip dreaming of victory. An accident leaves him lost in the desert and he finds himself in the little town of Radiator Springs. Sentenced to re-surface Main Street, which he inadvertently destroyed, McQueen is not happy and, at first, tries to escape. When this fails, he begins to accept his fate and, with the help of his new friends, Doc Hudson, Sally Carrera, Mater, and many others, he discovers that friends are more important than ambition. I won't tell you how it ends, but they are making a sequel.<br/><br/>Technically, of course, I can't fault this one, the animation is spot-on. The story telling, well, it does get a bit baggy in the middle, but there is a rather good ending which I found, after a second viewing, partly makes up for it. The performances were OK too, but nothing particularly special. Honourable mentions go to; Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen, Paul Newman as Doc Hudson, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera and not forgetting Larry The Cable Guy as Mater.<br/><br/>I guess this is one of those 'almost, but not quite' movies that you'll come back to several times hoping it will be better. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not quite up to the high standard I'd expect from Pixar. I guess they set the bar very high with the Toy Story trilogy. So, over all, although it's not as good as the other Pixar films (IMO), it's still perfectly watchable and so Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.1/10"
"Supachewy","5","1","2","7 September 2010"," Another Enjoyable Film From Pixar
","The animated family film Cars is directed by John Lasseter and stars Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, and Bonnie Hunt. The film takes place in modern day world that is ruled by cars instead of humans.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Lightning McQueen (Wilson) preparing for a big race. McQueen is a car that is very self absorbed, hard to get along with, and all he wants to do is win. He is in a race with a total of forty three cars to win the acclaimed Piston Cup. After refusing to get his tires changed at a pit stop they fly off right on the last lap of the race and McQueen's two biggest competitors Chick Hicks and The King end up in a tie with him for the win. Because of the tie there has to be a race between the three of them to gain the Piston Cup and if McQueen wins he would be sponsored by the great Dynaco. But as his truck is taking him to the race in California McQueen falls out of the truck and is stuck in a small town, Radiator Springs, as a prisoner because he damaged the road while driving. McQueen must fix the road to be able to make it back to the race, but while in the town he meets some memorable cars like Doc Hudson (Newman), Sally Carrera (Hunt), and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).<br/><br/>The writing for this film was very original and was a light enjoyable film. Unlike many of the other Pixar films this one does not have a great sense of depth or an underlying message. Yet it is easy to watch and will keep you entertained which is not an easy feat. It was somewhat corny but not so much that it was ridiculous to watch and it is a kid's film so you can't really expect for something drastically different. Now while watching this film I thought to myself that they made Toy Story again but instead of Toys or even bugs from A Bug's Life they used cars instead. I wonder how many films Lasseter can create that are about different sorts of inanimate objects or creatures other than humans.<br/><br/>The direction of this film I thought was quite good. Lasseter truly made a pleasant film with some nice performances from the whole cast. I really liked the shots he had at the beginning and towards the end of when the cars are speeding by in the race. Also I enjoyed all the shots of Lightning McQueen getting his photo taken. Lasseter makes many pleasurable films and this one is not an exception.<br/><br/>I know I have been using the word pleasurable a lot during this review so I will switch it up and say that the acting was as well delightful. Owen Wilson played McQueen and he did a fine job, it was nothing special but nothing special was really required. Paul Newman played the part of Doc Hudson and he was as well fine in his last feature film. I don't know if that is how he really sounds in real life but if not then he did a good job with his voice for the part. Bonnie Hunt was average as the love interest Sally Carrera, her part was no different really than any generic love interest. Larry the Cable Guy really brought a nice warm feeling to the film as the rusty pickup truck Mater with his comedic lines. Mater was definitely my favorite character of the film.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a weak 7/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Pixar and enjoys family films."
"madeye666","7","1","2","21 June 2010"," PIXAR's weakest effort.
","Without a doubt, PIXAR creates truly memorable films, not only for children, but for adults as well: Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. (and more since than, but for the sake of fairness, I'm reviewing from a THEN standpoint.) But when I saw Cars for the first time in theaters, I remember walking out feeling two things: disappointment and somewhat confusion.<br/><br/>I was confused by the storyline of the film: a rude, arrogant, conceited car is thrust into a town of humble, down to earth cars. He's rude and obnoxious to them, and than changes very, very suddenly. And than we're supposed to care for him? Sure, he does admirable things towards the end of the film, but with a character so grounded in stereotype to change in an instant to another stereotype is something that PIXAR has never done before, and shocks me. I felt no sympathy at any point for Lightning McQueen, or any of the other characters except Mater, who though comedic, is a character with originality and appeal.<br/><br/>My disappointment ran so deep because I was expecting, for the first time EVER, TOO much of PIXAR. I expected something heartfelt, meaningful, deep, and ultimately fantastic, and instead I was given something that was shallow, cliché, somewhat boring, and ultimately just a DECENT film from a company that usually creates NEAR-PERFECT film.<br/><br/>PIXAR has since redeemed themselves: The fantastic Ratatouille, and three pitch-perfect MASTERPIECES: WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>But now that the next film in PIXAR's canon coming down the line is a sequel to the film that was so dismally decent in my opinion, I find myself somewhat worried for a spotless reputation the company have given themselves.<br/><br/>Please PIXAR...prove me wrong."

"rick_7","Null","1","2","8 April 2010"," Well short of Pixar's greatest, but worth it all the same
","Widely held as Pixar's weakest, Cars (John Lasseter and John Ranft, 2006) is unexceptional but easy-to-take, with a well-worn plot given bright treatment. As has been said before, it's Doc-Hollywood-but-with-cars, as a speedy, superficial young buck - race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) - gets stranded in a small hick town where the residents' goodheartedness and easy-going nature start to work their magic. As in the Michael J. Fox-starrer, our conceited hero is asked to repair the damage he caused during his noisy arrival, and ends up dating a female lawyer who wound up in the area after an unhappy stint in the big city. (Having said that, Doc Hollywood itself is a hybrid of Local Hero, The Secret of My Success, a Dr Kildare, and a complete mess, so it's hardly the essence of originality.) Cars is well-short of the studio's best: Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille and Monsters, Inc., but the usual spark is periodically apparent, particularly in the treatment of tractors and a hysterical epilogue in which Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are given a new spin (pun intended). Elsewhere, colourful characters and cut-to-the-chase races compensate for the sometimes slack narrative and muddled motor-y message. Nice James Taylor song, too."

","Don't judge this by the standards of a Toy Story or Monsters. It barely reaches out for that.

Did you see ""Doc Hollywood""? Yes? Then you already know the story.<br/><br/>On the other side i had the feeling i was never meant to be the target audience of this flick. Too cute, too lovely, barely any mature ideas in there. Even the romance plot looks like written for twelve-year-old's. In contrast all the previous Pixars felt much more up for entertaining adults as well.<br/><br/>On the base of that the whole moral aspect of the movie looks much more unnecessary. I'm used to Disney shoving their morals into my face, Pixar usually delivered them in a more classy way.

Our main hero is Lightning McQueen, a selfish egotistic rookie car which made it to the final of the Piston Cup, a Nascar tournament. He soon finds himself in a difficult situation, getting out of it proves to be challenging because of his hot-shot character.<br/><br/>The voice acting is very good, we have famous actors voicing the cars, like Owen Wilson, Michael Keaton, Paul Newman and so on. They all do a terrific job, so no complaints here. <br/><br/>Now, the bad. First of all, we have no back story for McQueen, how he got to be so good, why, when and so on. At least 3 minutes of back story would have been nice. On the bright side, we see some character development. The plot, while creative in ways, is actually a very common story, with a different approach. Another bad thing, all cars are stereotypes: there's a hippy car which always says something about ""organic fuel"" and hippy stuff, there's an army jeep which always uses army terms. That's not a major flaw, more like a minor one.<br/><br/>Overall, the story isn't very original.

","I saw this movie over two years ago when it first came out, and I must admit, I was slightly disappointed. The Incredibles had just came out the year before and that movie blew me away. Pixar was at the top of their game when they made that one, but Cars doesn't come close to the Incredibles. The movie is about a red car who becomes lost in a small town along Route 66. While he is there he meets new friends and falls in love. The cars themselves aren't very creative. Imagine the Chevron cars with eyes on their windshields instead of their headlights. The movie also lacks in its soundtrack. Instead of original, classy songs like ""You've Got a Friend In Me"" by Randy Newman and ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Billy Crystal and John Goodman the main theme is a terrible country song by the band ""Rascal Flatts"". The song is commercial and very unoriginal. Usually Pixar doesn't put music by popular, well-known bands into their movies but puts something different. That song pretty much knocked 2 stars off of the movie. The movie isn't terrible, but it isn't one of my favorites. If you aren't familiar with Pixar but are interested in seeing some of their movies, check out better flicks, like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and of course.... The Incredibles. If you have kids that are into motorized vehicles, rent this. If you don't, there is no talking to you. I would expect this from a company like Dreamworks or 20th Century Fox, but not Pixar."
"sameerpatel105","9","1","2","18 May 2008"," Best Pixar Movie - Why So Underrated?
","I strongly believe this is the best of the Pixar films made, along with Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the others, this movie was genuinely laugh out loud funny especially with the character of Mater:<br/><br/>Mater: What's your name? Lightning McQueen: You... you don't know my name? Mater: No, uh... no, I know your name. Is your name Mater too? <br/><br/>Great storyline, great characters, great humour....just a great film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, please do.. In my opinion, this film should surely by in the IMDb top 250, I struggle to understand why Ratatouille is and this is not.<br/><br/>I would absolutely love a sequel.<br/><br/>10/10, 5 stars .. highly recommended on my half.<br/><br/>Well done Pixar!"
"FilmCreature","6","1","2","29 June 2007"," I don't get it...!
","I just don't get how this movie got such stellar reviews. In a world where Cars gets better fan review than Happy Feet and A Bug's Life, no one can be safe. Cars is long, boring, and uneventful. The main character, Lightning McQueen, gets stuck in a boring old desert town called Radiator Springs. His further adventures make up the movie.<br/><br/>The animation is stellar, and there are a few good moments, especially with Paul Newman's raggedy old car Doc Hudson. But the movie spends too long establishing the story with the audience, and overall it's a bore. Don't waste your time with this, go watch Happy Feet or Finding Nemo, two massively better animated films. <br/><br/>6 shiny cars out of 10."
"vsilly25","5","1","2","26 June 2007"," Am i the only one disappointed?
","OK, for months this movie was super hyped, it did great at the box office, more than doubling its budget here and got stellar ratings. Am i the only one disappointed by it? Guess so This is a kids picture so i guess its not aimed at my demographic (But I'm 16!!? is there such a difference??) The movie is filled with toilet humor by Larry the Cable Guy, but it gets old after a while. Its clichÃ© driven, something kids don't notice but adults should be able to point out by now. And it follows the whole, ""I learned an important life lesson"" by the end of the movie. Sorry Pixar, i just didn't like it. I hope Ratatouille doesn't follow the same formula, but in my opinion it looks exactly the same."

You know what? It was just actually kinda good. Sold storyline, great animation and modeling, I'd go see this again with my 6 year old sister. It was just a pretty good movie with a lot to see and point out. I loved how the cars shiny bodywork glistened off the big screen. I love all Pixar movies, and this one still wasn't the best, but like most of the old Pixars I enjoyed when I was a kid, this was a decent film. I'm glad that pixar still makes lots of movies, and lots of good ones. I will keep an eye on Pixar, and see some more of their movies. I noticed a new ""Ratouille"" coming out, and I think this will be just like Cars, horrible ads, but I think it will turn out to be a solid film. Keep up the hard work Pixar, lots of kids love your movies, and keep making those animated shorts! Those are great too."
"pedrodebiasi","5","1","2","10 February 2007"," A mediocre plot about numb characters
","I just don't get it. Maybe I missed something, in both times I went to watch this weak animation, but I still don't see why ""Cars"" is so celebrated. I have to admit I couldn't hear the original voice cast, and the Brazilian one is not very good, but I don't see anything, but the animation, working in this movie. The predictable plot just made me yawn, since every little detail is easy to notice right in the beginning of the narrative, from the mysteries of Doc Hudson for the obvious final decision of McQueen. Even if the moral teachings are a law in Disney's movies, in this case, they are too silly and exaggerated, and are included just to redeem characters that could be more interesting and ""credible"" without that quick personality changes. Talking about credibility, the visual of the cars is somewhat ugly. Not that the animation is bad, for it certainly isn't. But it is difficult to feel a human touch in the cars. Because of their different, inanimate shape, they don't look like characters. I didn't feel moved by any character, in the whole movie. The lack of empathy and mediocre plot call me to one serious question: what did the Golden Globe see in this crap? I hope that justice will be done in the Oscar (I doubt), and the prize will be handed over to ""Happy Feet""."
"aktowfik","5","1","2","6 February 2007"," Something wrong....
","I liked this movie and I think it's a masterpiece as far as animation movies are concerned. The problem is that I have observed about 20 children of varying ages in random circumstances watching it.. There is something wrong with this movie. kids lose interest in it after the first 15 minutes and they never seem to follow anything. The same children didn't blink or go to the bathroom during ""polar Express"", ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice age"". My humble interpretation is that this movie is OK for adults, but it failed to capture the eluding magic that catches children's attention. Perhaps cars are not interesting like people, animals or fish. That's why I give it 5 on a score of 10. If it was intended for adult audience only it could have scored 8 or 9."
"raypdaley182","4","1","2","31 January 2007"," Rips off Doc Hollywood
","Steal a plot from another film and set it in a world populated by CG cars. By blatantly stealing pretty much the entire plot of Doc Hollywood, the writers of this film have had little or nothing to do.<br/><br/>They have also stolen lots of the film Days Of Thunder, not that anyone will care that they couldn't bother to come up with their own plot.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson plays Lightning McQueen, a racing car with an ego and no idea about how to be part of a team. He sets off to a race, gets lost and destroys a road in a little town and from there he's firmly stuck in the plot of Doc Hollywood - stuck doing community service until he learns some life lessons about himself and how to be a team player and not just think only of himself.<br/><br/>The film looks lovely, the race sequences are far too long. You know that before the end of the film he will be helping the townspeople and the town will be set back on it's feet.<br/><br/>The guest voices from racing legends such as Mario Andretti & Micheal Schumacher are well cast. I like the Pixar re-hashes of Toy Story, Monsters Inc & A Bugs Life all done with cars and all played with the original voice talent somehow persuaded to parody themselves.<br/><br/>The THX goof at the start of the DVD is excellent and really funny too. The kids will like this as it looks really good but the adults might find a wee bit boring to be honest."
"Luigi Di Pilla","5","1","2","28 January 2007"," Didn't met my expectations
","I had great expectations but I was disappointed and so was my wife because the story is not very original and special. Therefore I have great respect for the special effects and the beautiful cinematography. After Ice Age 1 and 2 CARS shows very clear the power of high perfection in technical possibilities creating such animation movies. Okay there were some good and lovely sequences but there wasn't so much to laugh as in the Ice Ages. For all these reasons I gave 5/10 and even my 4year old son forgot quick this one and loves much more Finding Nemo or Ice Age. I think the votes here are too overrated. For all fans of this genre and for all kids I recommend THE POLAR EXPRESS that is no doubt a great movie for Christmas time."
"toxfly","5","1","2","18 December 2006"," Only So So
","Having raised the bar so high in the past, it would be unrealistic to expect Pixar to constantly match past successes and sadly Cars is at best only on a par with most of competition.<br/><br/>The problem is not the animation techniques, but telling yet again the same story of the lost toy/ant/little girl/fish and now car. Worse, the ending of the story was sign posted from the moment the hero was trapped in the little town. Compared to Toy Story this was scripting by numbers and it showed. The huge number of credited writers (and lord knows how many script doctors) does lend credence to a good idea (let's do a film about cars) which went wrong.<br/><br/>My kids didn't want to go to the cinema to see this ( I did) as they are bored with computer animated films. I rented it on DVD. They gave up watching it half way through and never bothered watching it again during the next week.<br/><br/>Disney may have bought Pixar just as it lost its way."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","14 December 2006"," Great fun, with a nice story, and super good animation.
","In some parts while I am watching an animated movie, I like to close my eyes and listen, to pick out the voices. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Tony Shaloub, and George Carlin were easy. But Bonnie Hunt sounded just like Ellen Degeneres to me. Oh well, you can't win them all!<br/><br/>In this movie there are no people, not even animated ones. All the characters are cars, trucks, tractors, scooters, etc. Each has its own look and personality, and as it gets older, it ages in voice and wisdom. This is state of the art animation. All the scenery looks as real as an animated movie can make it, even down to the patterns of reflections in the shiny car bodies.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson voices the central character, Lightning McQueen, a rookie car hoping to win the yearly Piston Cup. The movie starts with the final race in Florida but an unfortunate development requires that they have one more race, a week later, in California. McQueen is good, but he has an inflated ego and doesn't want a pit boss.<br/><br/>Paul Newman is great in everything, and here he is the town judge Doc Hudson. McQueen has gotten lost on his way to California, is caught speeding in this little community on Route 66, and must repair some damage before he is allowed to move along.<br/><br/>Bonnie Hunt is the sexy Sally Carrera, and McQueen takes a liking to her. The funniest character is voiced by Larry The Cable Guy as Tow Mater the slow-witted tow truck that eventually befriends McQueen. There is a cute nighttime scene where Mater takes McQueen out to the fields where the tractors are asleep to do some 'tractor tipping' (like some boys do cow-tipping at night).<br/><br/>The critic Ebert has a very complete and accurate review. This is a fun movie which also has a message about modern interstate highways cutting through for speed of travel, and in the process causing once thriving towns to become virtual ghost towns.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. McQueen finally finishes repairing the road surface that he had damaged, makes it to California, and is trailing in the 200 lap final race. But Doc Hudson, former Piston Cup winner in 1951, 52, and 53 shows up, with headphones, and is McQueen's crew chief. With the help of some advice, quick tire changes, and some fancy driving, MQueen has the race won. But he sees the third competitor disabled in the infield, so McQueen loses the race by going to his aid, and becomes the hero in the process."

When they think of a theme they really run with it. Granted it may be a cartoon movie, but it really has something for everyone. I grew up in a small town. Everybody knew everyone. We all hung out at the local cafe. We took care of each other. Radiator Springs has that same feel. It is also heartwarming to watch the main character go from a self-centered jerk to someone you could actually call a friend. As I watch the movie, I can picture this type of scenario actually happening in real life. It is definitely a movie kids will enjoy and adults can appreciate (and enjoy with the kids because it does bring out the kid in you)."

","I took my two grand daughters to see the movie ""Cars"" We had seen the previews and thought it would great family fun. We all enjoyed it but I didn't think the scene ""beating the train"" was appropriate. Older kids were there also and it concerned me that the kids there may actually think they might be able to ""beat the train"" too. There were quite a few teenagers there also. I think a message of safety (stopping at the tracks rather than speeding across them) would have been much better and it wouldn't have changed the story line. There have been several accidents over the past several years involving trains, cars and teenagers. All said, it was a fun movie!"

But, this year I think they could have done better with the film, Cars. Don't get me wrong, it looked beautiful, but the story just wasn't that great. You could predict what was going to happen at the end. The voice acting was good, but Matthew might not have been the best choice for Lightning McQueen. Everyone else was right on. So, it had an okay storyline, some sweet voice acting, and AWESOME animation, but it was just kind of a let-down after The Incredibles and Finding Nemo.

In this film, I enjoyed all the characters, this is typical Pixar, all the characters have big eyes and clear voices.

I also liked the Italian cars, the yellow one is modelled on the Fiat 126. I also liked Sally, the Porsche 911 This is a good film, for the racing car fan, I think that Lighting Mccqueen is modelled on an American V8 Corvet! I also liked it when he saw a red truck, and said to him, ""Mack?"" and the truck said ""No I am a Peterbillt!"" I did not think that A Race car can repair a road !

"thermite-3","10","1","2","1 October 2006"," Story of a high-and-mighty talking race car who accidentally ends up in a small town furthest from his lofty aspirations.
","What a delightful story! The plot of this Disney/Pixar animated film is about a race car who, while seeking fame and fortune, finds along the way that meaningful friendship is more important than anything material.<br/><br/>This film is totally devoid of people! It is completely cast in automotive and aeronautical devices. However, it is not long before these cars, who have human traits and emotions, have captured your hearts and feelings making you forget that they aren't human. The race car, Lightning McQueen, on his way to California for a big race ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs, Arizona on Route 66 which lost its former glory after an interstate highway (I-40) was constructed, bypassing the town.<br/><br/>The townsfolk are a charming bunch of cars, each with a distinct personality who win the hearts of both McQueen and the viewer. Mater, the rusty tow truck with two buck teeth, is absolutely hilarious. He befriends McQueen who formerly couldn't stand rusty automobiles since he was sponsored by a rust penetrating ointment and had to do a commercial with those ""awful rusty cars"". There are many arch-typical personalities in the town that will warm the heart or make one laugh uproariously. There is also a love interest with Sally Carrera, a Porsche who settled in this town due to its charm.<br/><br/>The story develops masterfully. The animation is beautifully done and as previously stated, gives life and soul to the characters. After two viewings, I feel that there are still elements of the movie that I've missed due to the fact that there is so much happening at once, especially during the race scenes. I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages."
"Spinter","10","1","2","24 September 2006"," A triple-whammy: brilliant animation, witty script, strong and moving story-line
","I went to the cinema with hesitations. Although I had very much enjoyed previous Pixar movies (such as the two 'Toy Story' films, 'Monsters Inc.' and 'A Bug's Life'), I was distinctly dubious about a story involving cars. Toys and monsters and insects seemed somehow more easily anthropomorphized and characterized; but vehicles? Surely not! I was completely wrong. The range of fully realised characters in this film is at least as impressive as in those other movies; in fact, 'Cars' probably goes one better. From the cocky 'Lightning McQueen', to the rust-buckety old tow-truck 'Tow-Mater', to the gorgeous Porsche who has had too much of 'living life in the fast line', every single automobile acquires a convincing and ingeniously worked personality. The animation skills required to establish such a believable cast were married with perfectly chosen voices, which were all the more effective for being, in the main (only Paul Newman's excepted), unidentifiable and unpicturable. In short, the 'dramatis personae' worked superbly.<br/><br/>But characters need a story. Would they be supported by a good through-line or not? Again, the film triumphs in spades. The first act introduces us to the surprisingly ambiguous 'Lightning McQueen'. By ambiguous I mean that we want to root for him because he's obviously young, keen and enthusiastic, and not either jaded or cruel-hearted, like his two chief opponents in the world of racing. On the other hand, he's also arrogant, vain and selfish. You're not entirely sure where you are with him, but you want to see the denouement that you know to be in the offing: the show-down between these three characters which is to happen in California in a week's time. You want to see him get there and win what is obviously his to win.<br/><br/>In the middle act, he loses his way. He finds himself holed up in a 'hill-billy hell', where he feels his IQ dropping by the minute, a dusty and faded town called 'Radiator Springs'. Here he is impounded for criminal damage. The full weight of the law comes to hobble him: first he is 'wheel-clamped', then his gas is siphoned, then he is given a huge reparations job. How will he possibly reach California in time? Despite being up against the odds, oddly he isn't crushed by these trials, but blossoms in the unchosen company of friendly, unpretentious vehicles who live in this one-eyed, dead-end place. The scene in which McQueen first falls in love, then has his eyes opened to the lost values of 'Radiator Springs' - in a beautifully judged elegy to Route 66 - is a piece of absolute genius. Route 66 has been superseded by the interstate, on which, we are told, 'cars drive to make a good time, not to have a good time'.<br/><br/>Then comes the third act. But I don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it. Again, like the first act, it is surprisingly ambiguous. McQueen 'wins', but not in the way you might expect. The film turns out to be a paean of praise to gentleness and self-effacement. That might make it sound unduly 'pious', but it doesn't feel preachy because you have come to know and love the protagonist, and you know that this is what he needs for his journey to be complete. You hadn't quite seen that this was coming at the outset, but you understand in retrospect that it is the ideal fulfilment of his personality and his individual need. There is a genuine feeling of goodness and wholeness achieved, without cheese. This is a prize hard to attain in story-telling. In fact, it is so rare, that again I find myself reaching for the word 'genius'. Pixar have excelled themselves. I give 'Cars' full-marks and advise anyone with an imagination to see it as soon as they can."

","Another big movie from Pixar. I've never laughed so much on a movie the last few years... The graphic style is fantastic as always, technically it's - like always on Pixar films - a step forward from the last movie. Some scenes with trips on natural landscapes are amazingly close to ""real"" landscapes. The character drawings are very special. Before going to see the movie I thought, well, let's see how the are ""morphing"" cars into ""human beings"". And I have to admit that Pixar managed that very well, it was far beyond my expectations. Everyone and everything, down to the smallest detail, was moved to a ""car world"".. The gestures and facial expressions of the cars are superb. The characters are very funny though and the film has even an overall message which perfectly matches today's way of life...

","A good, solid production from Pixar, as usual. Great design, computer animation, special f/x, soundtrack, etc. But, having said that, I have to say I expected much more from this film and was slightly disappointed in the end. This mostly due to an overly simplistic script and a story that fails to engage the viewer and 'capture' him at any point.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the great animation, especially the landscapes, this film could even be described as boring at times. We can always foresee the next scene from the beginning to the end, there are no real relationships developed, no real characters (cars) we can come to care for, hardly any real emotions involved, all of which is very strange for a Disney motion picture which usually thrives on emotions. The only 'real' character in the film and therefore in my opinion it's best part is Mater, whose human actor, 'Larry the Cable Guy' gives an impressive performance.

","I adored this film. I have seen it 4 times and fall in love with the friendship between Mater and Lightening every time I see it.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film starts with the noise and attitude of a race car. As it begins, you see that everything in the story line is represented by cars or something attributed to cars: highway cones, tires, auto painting, fast food stops for Oil and even the 60's representation of the hippie mobile or the flys are actually little Volkwagon Beetles. They were particularly adorable. If you know the Pixar films, there are multiple items to watch for. Keep an eye out for the birds on the phone wires. Do you remember what film they come from?<br/><br/>Your expression of how things happened along Route 66 was particularly impressive. As you showed the mapping and the excitement of the new freeway, reality really did cave in on that precious little town. A few months ago I did a trip along that highway and saw a spot that looked so close to the area where Lightening drives with, well I'm not going to give that away.<br/><br/>Mater is by far my favorite character. I now receive Mater memorabilia every time I get a present. I think he is the most adorable of all the characters, adding Guido to that as well. Personally I think every person should have a Mater in their life to keep them balanced. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Routh 66 flashback. Having driven on that roadway, I remember how many times we would stop just to see the little towns along the way. We are in such a fast paced world right now that the slow, memorable moments tend to get kicked to the curb, so to speak. <br/><br/>Thank you Pixar for giving us something to remember how much life can change when we aren't looking.<br/><br/>Thank you for showing how it truly is ""OK"" for a person to give back when something has been given to us. I loved how you had Lightening give something back. What a great character building film. Again, Thank you so much for this story.<br/><br/>When is the DVD being released?"

At Radiator Springs, Lightning McQueen has to learn the true meaning of friends. Cars co-stars Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy. <br/><br/>In cars, every little bit of scenery will blow you away.

","Pixar studios has become such a leader in the animated film department, they have to challenge themselves because no one else seems to want to set the bar higher. Well, they do a wonderful job meeting their own challenge of creating a film completely filled with inanimate objects. Despite the fact that cars do not move of their own free will, Pixar populates this film's world with characters, personalities, and relationships that are tantamount to what car lovers do to their own vehicles.<br/><br/>Cars is no ""Finding Nemo"", ""Toy Story"", or ""Monsters, Inc."" Still, it is a solid, enjoyable film with superb animation and enough wit for both kids and adults alike. In the certain to be released (in the not so distant future), Pixar Box Set, ""Cars"" will not be the crappy movie that you have to take thrown in with the hits, because it deserves its own recognition.<br/><br/>Making talking cars look and feel like they have real issues and life problems is a massive undertaking. Yet Pixar's smart casting and keen eye for detail in their animation of lead characters really brings this story to life. Though the plot line is telegraphed from the beginning (there's absolutely no question what each car's story arc will be) it is an enjoyable ride getting there.<br/><br/>It helps that we, as a culture, anthropomorphisize our vehicles already. So it isn't such a stretch when a car comes on screen, that it already has a perceived personality in our minds. We have personified certain car makes and models with human characteristics and tendencies, and the people at Pixar play into these preconceived notions to situate the cars as characters. It's an auto lover's dream come true.<br/><br/>If it weren't for a longer than average running time (for an animated 'kids' film) and a plot that leaves no room for doubt, Cars would be talked about with the likes of animated cinematic greats. Though the backdrops aren't as lavish as ""Finding Nemo"" and the world of make believe not as spellbinding as ""Toy Story"", it remains a steady pace car and keeps Pixar batting 1000.00. i can't wait to see what they come up with next.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Cars is a great animation, if it wasn't for toy story Shrek or Over the hedge this could be the greatest animation movie in the history of film. I watched the trailer it looked quite strange that the plot was about talking cars but I saw it and the animation it's self is the best I have ever seen. As the light reflects of the cars it seems so real and an hour through the film I forgot it was it was an animation. Mater (fanastically voiced by Larry the cable guy) really lightens up the film because all films need a comedian. The only problems about cars is that it does drag on a bit I have never seen such a long animation film before, and in a movie there should be a bad guy or someone evil dude they didn't have any of them. I think the story is very similar to over the hedge if you replace cute animals with motor veichles, because Lightnin and Rj both discover that they can have a better life with the other cars or the other animals. I had a little seeking tear in my eye when I watched it because the village didn't get any customers or any business. On the hold it is a great film watch it."

","This movie is more character-focused than other pixar CGI-fests, but still provides its fair share of great laughs, action, and excitement. It's about a big-shot race car who, on the way to a big racing event in California, gets lost and winds up in a small town called Radiator Springs. Since he destroyed their road when he got there, he is ordered to fix it up. And while there, he learns that life is not all about winning races and receives a lesson in friendship.<br/><br/>The animation, like always, is great. The story is really great, the execution is great, and there are a couple twists and turns in there as well. Owen Wilson and Paul Newman do excellent in their voice-over roles, along with everyone else.<br/><br/>This is really a great movie, and I recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"sparkster24","7","1","2","5 August 2006"," A surprisingly good film which was well designed, well planned and well executed.
","The narrative is a typical storyline of Disney's (- who brought out Pixar a while ago): Lighting McQueen (- voiced by Owen Wilson) is racing in the Piston cup competing against 42 other cars. It is possible to draw a comparison between the Piston cup in 'Cars' to the F1 Grand Prix in reality. Lightning is a novice with bourgeois capitalist ideals. He wishes to win the cup and gain a better sponsorship deal than he has with his current sponsor Rust-eze. Because Lightning is obsessed about winning he (possibly inadvertently) pushes his team's tolerance to the limit. He has no loyalty, no respect for others and is focused on nothing but winning the races. In the 'final' race, Lightning ties with three other cars  ""The King"" (Richard Petty), who is due to end his career after the race and ""Chick Hicks"" (Michael Keaton). As a result of the draw, all three are forced to race again (- this time only as a three -) in a final decisive race in California for the prestigious trophy.<br/><br/>The van that transports Lightning to California (Mack) is made to drive all night long so that Lightning can beat Chick to the race track. Mack falls asleep whilst driving and Lightning drifts out of the back of the van eventually ending up in Radiator Springs in police custody. Lightning is sentenced to rebuild the road he has 'inadvertently' damaged (when trying to get away from the police) before his final championship winning race in California. This story then becomes a comic tale of Lightning constantly trying to run away and, at the same time, his relationship with other town residents including Sally a 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson a 1951 Hudson Hornet and a rusty old truck. Eventually Lightning learns loads of different skills for racing the biggest race of his life and builds up new friends from this redundant town.<br/><br/>The film is a gem for Disney even if a little too childish in my opinion. The narratives are well worked and executed to perfection and the scenery is very aesthetically pleasing. There are good interweaving story lines which all have hidden messages behind them and all of which are coherent and make sense.<br/><br/>However this film can be criticised. This genre has been exploited recently by other pictures such as Toy Story and Ice Age. In my opinion it becomes a little tedious to see the same thing developed in the same way with a slightly different setting over and over again. The fact it centered around cars also meant it neglected a large range of its perspective target audience. This is to say, in my view, the older generation who enjoy motor racing (- a major section of its target audience,) do not want to be moralised into choosing between benevolence and 'competitive racing' and thus would prefer a film like 'too fast too furious'.<br/><br/>Despite the above criticism it is actually very good film and thoroughly worth seeing. However, I'm sure ultimately it won't linger too long in the memory.<br/><br/>n.b. don't miss the end-credit outtakes which have loads of jokes."

","This movie is great and before I saw this I had my doubts.The thought of Cars with big eyes and faces with long hanging tongues just did'nt appeal to me-How wrong was I.

","Cars was great- it had a good moral, the detail of the graphics were extraordinary- it literally took my breath away. It had good characters, and the storyline was pretty good and related to life.<br/><br/>But it wasn't Pixar quality- don't get me wrong, the graphics were brilliant. But it just wasn't. Special. Pixar is pretty much famous for bringing imaginary things to life, and showing you what world must be like for- say, human beings, or monsters- and mixing in a good sense of humor.<br/><br/>This movie had humor and there were characters you could relate to. But it didn't open up a completely different world. It was our world- only people were replaced by cars. They didn't have a different way of life and somehow i just thought it wasn't as creative as the rest of the Pixars.<br/><br/>But overall it was definitely worth watching. It was probably the best animation that came out this year. But i'm just disappointed because I'd expect Pixar to come out with the best animation of the decade."
"JimD73","7","1","2","19 July 2006"," It's not Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but Cars is good family fun
","When it comes to animated movies, there is only one name that matters: Pixar. Pixar popularized the CGI method with Toy Story, which remains my favourite animated movie of all time. They have since consistently made smash hit after smash hit. Even if I don't think that Monsters Inc. or The Incredibles even compare to Toy Story, there is no denying that Pixar always manages to keep its own brand of magic in every picture they release. Despite all of that, the concept of Cars did scare me a little. It seemed a little too loose and almost unimaginative by comparison. However, with a chance to see it for free, I couldn't say no, and thankfully not, as even if it isn't quite in the same league as Finding Nemo or Toy Story, Cars is a pleasant timewaster for the whole family.<br/><br/>Like any other good Pixar movie, Cars is a coming of age movie, this time focusing on the world of race cars. In this world, the cars manifest themselves as conscious entities, with no drivers or anything of the sort. Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is the current hot rookie in the driving world, and is going after the Piston Cup, the greatest achievement for a race car, which would lead to numerous well-paying endorsements and fame beyond belief. During the final race, his tires blow out in the final laps because of his denial of pit stops with him in a great lead. He manages to hobble his way into an exact three-way tie with retiring champ King and the scheming Chick Hicks (Keaton), who has been stuck in the King's shadow for his whole career.<br/><br/>On the way to the tie-breaker race, McQueen falls out of his transport truck and, while being chased by the police for speeding, ends up destroying the road in the small town of Radiator Springs. Despite the advice of town leader Doc Hicks (Newman), who despises anything related to racing, McQueen is forced to stay in Radiator Springs to repair the road. It is in Radiator Springs that McQueen realizes that there is more to life than simply fame and fortune.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is contrived and clichéd. There is a love interest in the form of Sally (Hunt), possibly the only other normal car in the area (by McQueen's standards, anyways). He also finds a new best friend in Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). Everything else fits into the general mold that movies like this come in. The protagonist is a snob on the way to an important event, gets sidetracked unintentionally, wishes to leave at first, begins to identify with his new surroundings, finds some tie to his old life in the new town, is whisked away by others and doesn't want to leave. Sounds familiar, but for a kids movie, little things like originality in the plot are not mandatory.<br/><br/>What are important are good visuals, and Cars definitely has that. The environments are all nice and bright with extensive backdrops in the racing district, and appropriately drab in Radiator Springs. The car designs are good mimicks of real life, while at the same time giving a good amount of character depth in expressions. Of course, there is nothing dark in a movie for kids, so there are plenty of bright colours and cute characters (most notably Guido the technician). While it doesn't push the envelope for animation, it certainly doesn't fall short in any way, shape or form.<br/><br/>As for laughs, Cars does have a handful of funny bits. The most notable laughs come from Guido, who is easily the most memorable character in the movie, especially near the end when he performs his five-second pit stop or with any dialogue between him and Ferrari lover Luigi (Tony Shaloub). Mater also gets some good laughs in, representing the traditional redneck comedy you would expect from Larry the Cable Guy. One sequence in which Mater and McQueen go tractor-tipping proves to be very amusing. Throw in a good line every now and then (FREE BIRD), and Cars does have its fair share of laughs, though there are numerous laughless stretches and some jokes that are never fully explored (such as Fillmore the hippy van's organic fuel).<br/><br/>As for the voice cast, despite the great range of talents, they are somewhat unmemorable. Wilson does decent as the protagonist, Lightning McQueen, but isn't as unique as Tom Hanks was as Woody or Albert Brooks was as Marlin. Paul Newman is appropriately authoritative as Doc Hicks, but never rises above the character. Bonnie Hunt is, like Wilson, decent but forgettable as Sally. Larry the Cable Guy does embody the hick-town in his voice, and Tony Shalhoub gives the most memorable performance by far as Luigi the Italian tire salesman. Michael Keaton never really gets a chance to shine as Chick Hicks, so he really isn't to fault that Hicks is not a memorable villain. Despite their comic fame, Cheech Marin and George Carlin are almost unrecognizable due to lack of dialogue. There are some good voice cameos from the likes of Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and Dale Earnheardt Jr.<br/><br/>Cars isn't even close to being Pixar's gem. It isn't nearly as funny as Toy Story or as compelling as Finding Nemo. Even so, it falls into the general range that would include other animated films like Ice Age, with a solid number of laughs, a few chuckles and a good cute factor. Cars may not be the best, but it is a solid choice for family entertainment.<br/><br/>82%"

","Meet Lightning McQueen, world famous race car. His dream was to win the Gold Piston Cup and become the new Dinoco champion. In the latest race, the Dinoco 4000, McQueen was pitting against The King, returning champion, and Chick Hicks, a high-octane runner-up. McQueen gave it his all, burning up the race track, peeling rubber, kicking up dust, and finally edged his way to the finish line with two back tires blown out. Unfortunately, King and Hicks traveled at the same speed and the outcome was a three-way tie. A tie-breaker race would be held the following week in California. McQueen sat back and daydreamed about his sure victory, but soon had to go back to work as a celebrity, promoting his image and pose for thousands of media cars taking his picture. Afterwards, he was loaded into his trailer and pulled away by Mack the truck. As night approached, Mack wanted to stop at a truck stop for some shuteye, but McQueen was determined to get to California as soon as possible, so he made Mack drive all night. Unfortunately, fatigue soon overtook the big truck, as well as some cheeky, tricked-out hot rods, causing McQueen to roll out of his trailer onto deserted Highway 40. McQueen quickly came to and took off, looking for Mack, but found nothing other than an empty road and some rude big rigs. Soon enough, McQueen raced into a small town off Route 66. This was Radiator Springs, a rural, backwoods simple town run by classic cars. <br/><br/>The residents of Radiator Springs consisted of Sarge, an Army Jeep, Luigi and Guido, motors who ran the tire shop, Fillmore, a microbus who specialized in ""organic"" fuels, Lizzie, a Model T Ford, and Sheriff, a police car, who chased McQueen for speeding; McQueen tore through town, ripping up the roads. Literally. He was caught and locked in the impound lot overnight where he met a hick tow-truck named Mater, short for Tow Mater; McQueen was taken to traffic court and put on trial by a surly Hudson Hornet named Doc Hudson. Doc was about to let McQueen go, when in came Sally Carrera, a spunky Porsche, who suggested McQueen pay for his actions, which was unfortunate for McQueen since she was his attorney. So, the cocky race car was sentenced to repair his damage to the road by pulling Bessie, a rumbling, bubbling tar machine. His first repair job was crappy, because he raced through it. So, he had to start again. He tried to escape, but Sheriff and Mater brought him back. All the while, McQueen was desperate to head west and win that Piston Cup. To prove himself, he challenged Doc to a race. And it was then that McQueen got a very hard lesson in sharp turns when he skidded right into a cactus patch; That night, Mater showed McQueen his favorite past time: tractor tipping. It goes great until McQueen accidentally intimidated Frank, a very large, very angry farm tiller. <br/><br/>McQueen finally got with it and paved a smooth new road through Radiator Springs. He also learned of the hardships the town had faced: back in the '60s, the town flourished with tourists from far and near, driving down Route 66 heading east or west. It wasn't until they built Highway 40 that the number of visitors greatly decreased as this new highway went directly passed Radiator Springs and got the cars where they were going much faster. Back to the present, Luigi and Guido began dressing up the front of their shop to match the glorious new road, and McQueen helped them spruce up the town so it looked as good as new. He then got new tires from Luigi, tried Fillmore's organic fuel, bought a night vision windshield from Sarge, fueled up at Flo's, and even spent the night in Sally's Cozy Cone Motel. He had won the respect of all the residents...except Doc, who still seemed to resent him. It could be that Doc had been a famous race car like McQueen back in his day. He won Piston Cups from 1951-1953. In 1954, he suffered a terrible car crash and, afterwords his racing career was over. Anyway, thanks to an anonymous call from the surly Hudson, the media, choppers and Mack tracked down McQueen and whisked him off to California to compete in the big race. While racing around the track, McQueen took all he had learned about sportsmanship in Radiator Springs to heart and, when Chick Hicks attempted to cheat by wrecking and forcing King off the track, McQueen nobly came to the car's aide and sped across the finish line with him. Doc, Mater, and all his friends from Radiator Springs were there to congratulate him, for McQueen had finally reached the status he had longed for, and was a very happy car from then on. The cars of Radiator Springs were happy when McQueen told a lot of his other friends about their town and in no time, business was finally picking up again. <br/><br/>Cars. Another hit by Disney and Pixar! Visual effects are top of the line! The cars and all the scenery look so real, and so beautiful. It's as if it were filmed on location; Owen Wilson voices our hero, Lightning McQueen, Paul Newman is Doc Hudson, Bonnie Hunt (from A Bugs' Life) is Sally, Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater, the great Paul Dooley is Sarge, George Carlin is Fillmore, Michael Keaton is Chick Hicks, Pixar veteran John Ratzenberger is Mack, and the late, great Joe Ranft is Peterbilt the big rig. Joe Ranft passed away in 2005 in an auto accident. Ironic, I must say. The voice cast was very talented, this is one cool movie! If you like Disney/Pixar films, then this is for you. I do believe it's their last one together. From Toy Story to Cars, they've made real winners. See Cars today! I recommend it!"
"blalock_kelly","9","1","2","8 July 2006"," Well done feel good movie
","This movie reminded me of ""Doc Hollywood"" a lot. The cartoon version was well done in the graphics department, especially when seen on the big screen. It reminded me a lot of the old time Westerns in CinemaScope, but was more elegant in artwork, it was stunning. Paying close attention to detail in the backgrounds shows the film makers' sense of humor mixed with their sense of awe at the natural scenery of the American West. Having spent a lot of time in that part of the world, it brought home some very fond emotional memories of time spent in very little towns. (Along with some of the cheap thrills we learned to enjoy in helping to pass the time.) <br/><br/>Definitely could be interpreted as a commentary on the differences between our modern instant gratification GameBoy society, and the part of our culture which takes things on a different pace and with a different attitude."
"patherton-1","9","1","2","30 June 2006"," For big kids and rev heads
","As a rev-head this one was a must-see for me. Like Shrek, where you use your kids as an alibi to go and see a kids film you really want to see yourself. Like all the good CGI animated kids films, this one has something for everybody. The problem with CGI animated kids films, is that it's hard to find something original. Talking animals have been done to death, we've had talking bugs, talking toys, and occasionally people. Considering all of that, talking cars is a fairly original idea and the creativity put into these cars with personalities is exceptional. It's more than just crude gags about lubricants. The writers have really brought this world of talking cars alive with some wonderful quirky humour and ideas. For example, the scenes where two central characters pull nighttime pranks in paddocks, the human equivalent of ""tipping cows"", except instead of cows, they are big, dumb tractors, are hilarious. Sure, some of the humour may be lost on the non-car initiated but it would be hard to miss most of it. And, like all good ""big kid"" films, the underlying message is a poignant and feelgood one. Nostalgia, the simple life, self-discovery and friendship are all dealt with in this ripper little yarn with cute talking cars. Pardon the pun, but it's an excellent vehicle to deliver an excellent and entertaining message. Just when you thought silky-smooth and perfect CGI animated cartoons were getting past their use-by date, this one is welcome. Oh, and rev heads, watch out for some high-profile cameos, not just American ones."
"jantoniou","6","1","2","26 June 2006"," Good, but not great; strangely unfulfilling
","To mix my metaphors, Pixar has been something like the engine on a '57 Chevy: Big, good, and reliable. As many in Hollywood will tell you, the cost of entry in the game is the story, not the money any more. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is a good example (though ultimately a wretched green-screen joke, unfortunately) that anyone can muscle their way in with a Mac and a dream. Given this, Pixar's storytelling prowess has consistently rated second to none: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and, in my opinion, their best, The Incredibles, Pixar seemingly couldn't miss a mark in the 20+ years now of leading the vanguard of computer animation. And, with John Lasseter helming again in ""Cars"", such achievement seemed a natch.<br/><br/>But something in ""Cars"" is missing and I see a real chink in Pixar's armor being exposed. Certainly it's not for lack of love of the subject matter. Certainly it's not for lack of brilliant animation: Yet again the competition with its me-too Madagascar clones (how many CGI movies do we need of animals escaping from... whatever?) is left wildly in the dust. And certainly it's not for lack of voice acting quality, which Wilson, Hunt, Newman, Shalhoub, et. al handle amiably.<br/><br/>It's for lack of story, that ever-impossible cost of entry in the Hollywood game. For Pixar, the master of the story, to miss is a scary proposition.<br/><br/>The story, like Owen Wilson's Southern drawl, feels thin and weightless. Revolving around a town of broken dreams, Radiator Springs, Wilson's Lightning McQueen finds a kind of redemption around the motley crew and Doc, its ""doctor of internal combustion,"" gruffly voiced by a joyless Paul Newman, who seems to be constipated--or does his carburetor just need tuning?--throughout.<br/><br/>It feels like a kind of harp on zen philosophy--life's the journey and all that--that in the end feels rather dreary. Maybe Pixar's style has come to settling in like a comfy chair where one muses on life over a glass of brandy, but it doesn't work for a G-rated family flick. Maybe this is their ""Godfather III."" <br/><br/>If you watch the DVD extras for ""The Incredibles"" you'll see that Brad Bird was brought in to shake things up at Pixar, to consciously get them out of their comfort zone. He did so and did it brilliantly. ""The Incredibles"" didn't fail to key in on the meaning of life, personal identity, and conformity, yet it all worked together so brilliantly in the story that you barely even see it. That, dare I say, is great art.<br/><br/>And, dare I say it, Pixar needs to be shook up again."

This is what movie making should be today, visually stunning, heart-felt, and need I say, original.

"ackthpt","8","1","2","18 June 2006"," Once again Pixar Exceeds Expectations
","With Pixar's long relationship with Disney I've been expecting the inevitable decline of things associated with the big corporation which takes fewer risks than it once did, aside from shutting their old animation studios and banking on half-baked in-house computer animation. Simply put, Disney is tired and only rehashes stereotypical characters to bank on old successes. Pixar has delighted us with new characters every time (including in the sequel to Toy Story, BTW there is a Toy Story 3 on the way) by mostly abandoning everything it already knew and starting with a totally new story and totally new characters. There was no letdown in this film. Wise of someone at Disney to keep Pixar in the fold. I dearly hope that same wise influence keeps Disney's script writers out of Pixar.<br/><br/>Regarding the film, it's a fairly predictable story, as becomes apparent as time goes on, which is the only reason it I didn't give it a 10. As for their telling of the story, well, as was said of James Bond, nobody does it better. Eye candy galore, stunning vistas, utterly charming, magnificently hilarious and wonderful nods to the legacy of the automobile.<br/><br/>Take a close look at those bugs flying around and be sure to stick around for the early credits.

There are so many car images embedded in the film, and the cars are so realistic--sounds strange for an animated movie, but I'm a car guy and it was incredible! Also, the sound is fantastic, notice when Mack is dozing while driving down the road....that's the sound a diesel truck makes with it's Jake Brake--a device used for slowing big trucks down with the engine exhaust. Sally sounds just like a Porsche....the gravel crunching under the wheels, all of it is just flat incredible!

","I went to this moving thinking okay... it's just going to be another silly cartoon. I found this movie to be the best animated movie I have ever seen. It was well written, was good clean fun, exciting at times and even had some romantic scenes... This movie has something for everyone... including good morals. At times we got so into the story that we forgot we were watching a cartoon with cars as the characters. The cars actually began to seem like real people with real feelings and emotions. The facial expressions were amazing. My husband and I both definitely recommend this to everyone... young and old! We will definitely purchase this when it comes out on DVD!"

","GOLD GOLD GOLD! Pixar has done it. Toy Story was a smash, but, I surely didn't believe it was going to last. Bug's Life was cute, but, I thought it got lucky. Toy Story II broke my hatred of sequels, but, still has to be luck. The Monster's Inc. Nope, I thought, still has to be luck. Finding Nemo started to clue me in on maybe there was something out there about this new fangled computer animation. The Incredibles made me believe that it was the end, the finish line on an amazing run by an unlikely hero.<br/><br/>Then came ""Cars""...<br/><br/>I saw the previews, cringing at the thought of Larry-the Cable Guy, and thought, ""Too bad, all the funny parts, and there goes a golden star"" And, man I was wrong. Here is my list of why: 1. The race scenes were intense and heart pounding, even though they were animated. The sound pounded you as the cars flew by, every sound and feeling almost like i remember from my trips to NASCAR races. Yet, they were extremely creative. Allowing the main character to jump off a pile up using his tires was just hilarious and goofy, yet, it fit and wasn't over reaching. The trash talking between the competitors is something i remember from my years running cross country, and i got a good chuckle out of it.<br/><br/>2. The characters were colorful and interesting. They interacted well with each other and had an awesome vibe. The diverse use of vehicles for each character. Being in the service myself, and seeing the old Jeep Willys playing revelry in the morning to flag, then fighting with the stoned VW Mini Bus is cliché', but, it was funnier than hell.<br/><br/>3. Vibrant and colorful settings. Having been in Arizona for a few months, and seeing the desert, and the inherent endless desert highways, with the pit-stop towns and everything, totally a believable setting. And leave it to the imaginary geniuses at Pixar to incorporate old car parts into the terrain.<br/><br/>4. IT WAS A FAMILY MOVIE! and when i say that, a true family movie. there was humor that was great for the kids, yet, the innuendo was veiled thickly enough they didn't catch on, but, all the older participants were able to get a chuckle out of it. It didn't alienate anybody, which is why Disney is floundering in other animation.<br/><br/>So, Pixar, please keep it up. You have proved me wrong. Cars is an awesome addition to the Pixar/Disney family, and worthy of the name it carries. Cars was a throughly enjoyable film, creative and fun.<br/><br/>Go see it, if you're my age (19), with or with out a family, or little kids. This is a great movie that should be enjoyed by everyone."

Everyone knows that Pixar does great things with the credits. This time was no exception. Credits were as great as the movie but I couldn't see them because everyone started to get up and leave.

I was proud to stand up at the end of the movie and clap for an amazing movie and as I did, many others followed. Even the credits was spectacular.

","Pixar has done it again in a movie that rockets off at the starting line and flies by the checkered flag with lightning speed. Cars is, without a doubt, the best movie I've seen all year so far, including X-Men 3.<br/><br/>Cars follows the misadventures of hotshot race car rookie Lightning McQueen during his unfortunate captivity in the small town of Radiator Springs. There he meets up with a wide array of colorful characters, including a rusty pickup named Mater, a cute little baby-blue Porche named Sally, and the grumpy old Doc Hudson. Together, the whole town strives to turn McQueen's selfish and obnoxious attitude into one of caring and love.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the opening trailer for this movie in the Incredibles DVD, I thought that the concept of cars with personalities was kinda ridiculous, even for Pixar. But the entire movie had me from the opening sequence all the way to after the end credits. Like all Pixard movies, the kids will laugh at the slap-stick of Mater, while the adults will chuckle at the little one-liners McQueen throws in.<br/><br/>Also, as always, Pixar has a short little animated before the movie entitled One Man Band, which made me nearly fall out of me seat laughing.<br/><br/>In a world of cookie-cutter 3D animations about talking animals, Pixar and Cars stands out above the rest, and an Oscar for Best Animated Movie is almost a guarantee. You will not be disappointed in this movie."

There have been many that seem to have little thought about the story. As though they are pushed through to get to the movie houses fast. This movie has a great story, is well put together and keeps a little one interested the entire length of the show. So many funny jokes that are easy for my young one to understand.

"barryak","10","1","2","14 June 2006"," Not Just a Good Story
","We've all come to expect humane, heartwarming (how to say that without sounding smarmy?), positive story lines out of Lasseter & Co. No exception here. But the real star of ""Cars"" for me was a vanished America of two-lane blacktop, small towns, similar but unique roadside businesses, and the sense that something REALLY exotic lay out there in the blue haze just before the horizon. As a city kid growing up on the southern edge of the Great Plains in the '50s, trips to visit relatives in towns 100 or 200 miles away were odysseys. And each small town in between was as real (and as different from all the others) as Rome or Xanadu. So, ""Cars"" exhibits another of my favorite Pixar traits: obsessive attention to and faithful respect for details that are almost subliminal (shop signs, can labels, etc.) but validate each frame and inevitably add a layer of pure enjoyment to the film. And the landscape just outside Radiator Springs: the ""Chrysler Airflow"" buttes, the ""Buried Cadillac"" outcroppings, the Radiator Cap mesa ... Well, that just confirms my childhood conviction that some really wonderful sights were to be seen out there in the blue haze."

","The commercials/trailers for this movie did not entice me into wanting to see this movie.<br/><br/>My 7 year old son said that it looked ""so cool"". I was apprehensive as some of the animated movies that I have seen in the past few years have not lived up to the hype (Madagascar, Ice Age 2). Boy was I wrong about this one, from the very beginning, I was truly entertained with this film. It had jokes that my kids got and many jokes for the parents.<br/><br/>The story was very well done. I was amazed at the swift character development of the main characters. You could relate to each character. I had a hard time picking a favorite. But, if I had to, it would be Mater (or Mack) ..see how difficult is it? I think the biggest thrill for my family was the ending(s) with the other Pixar films. It was so funny. Especially the bit with John Ratzenberger. He has always been one of my favorite voices. If you look hard enough you can find him in the Empire Strikes Back :-)"
"jeromeerome","9","1","2","13 June 2006"," Perfect Blend of Technology and Story Telling
","Pixar pulled out all the stops when creating Cars. If you couldn't already tell from watching the trailers the computer animation graphics in this movie are absolutely beautiful. There are certain scenes like the drive through the forest where you forget your watching an animation because the environments are stunningly realistic. Of course most of us have learned over the years it takes much more than special effects to create a worthwhile movie.<br/><br/>As usual Pixar also succeeds in creating a compelling story driven by a wide ensemble of lovable characters. The story focuses on the journey of a red sports car named Lightning McQueen who has a great catch phrase ""Ka-Chow""! I must admit though as great a character that Lightning is the true star of the show is the rusty old tow truck Mater, voiced by Larry The Cable Guy. During some of the slow moments towards the middle of the movie Maters comic relief keeps pushing things along with lots of laughter. Especially his interaction with the tractors. I won't say any more than that to avoid spoiling things.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have less humor directed specifically at the adult audience members but that doesn't cut back any on the amount of fun you will have watching this movie. Of course there is a moral to the whole movie teaching you not to focus on a specific destination in life and wishing your life away. Instead take your time and enjoy the journey itself. Each and every day. A lesson that can be taken to heart by both children and adults alike. I recommend this movie to everyone looking to have some fun. If you liked any of the other blockbusters from Pixar you will surely not be disappointed by their latest adventure."

Good moral messages are missing from so many kids movies these days. The characters are great and creative. Larry the Cable Guy really is great. The movie was a big hit with my kids (10, 5, 4, 4, 2).

","Ever since I was little, I loved cars. I loved playing with little Matchbox cars to watching them cruise along the road. This Pixar movie took me by surprise as I didn't really go into the movie expecting much more than what the title and basic plot suggested, all I wanted to hear was Paul Newman's voice behind the Hudson Hornet and maybe catch some of those delicious CGI sceneries.<br/><br/>Everything; from the voice-overs to the CGI to the story to the colorful characters had something special for everyone. The jokes were genuinely funny as well as the lines some of the characters made and even the cameo roles.<br/><br/>While your average 2-4 year old might not understand most of it, you certainly will. The movie is chock-full of little surprises that'll make any car enthusiast chuckle heartily.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson who played Lightning McQueen, the racing car with a cocky attitude and adrenaline for gas, was actually very good in his role in my opinion. Owen played the act well right down to the end of the movie, which is sure to surprise anyone. All I can say is: ""Ka-Chow!""<br/><br/>Paul Newman, the legend voicing a legend, played his role of Doc Hudson to perfection. I'm not sure what it is; the tough gravel voice, the baby blues in the windshield, or the certain air of mystery surrounding his character, but Doc Hudson was my favorite Cars character throughout the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a very enjoyable movie. I can barely wait for the DVD but nowadays the DVD comes out just a month after so thats good. I can almost see myself shelling out another 10 bucks for this gem.

The film starts out with the fast pace world of racing, very good graphics, Pixar/Disney keep improving on an art that seems at it's height of performance, and the realism really draws you into the whole story, the textures are tremendous. Absolutely first rate editing.<br/><br/>The story has a great deal of heart and nostalgia, while some parts are a tad bit predictable, on the whole it's got a lot of surprised. The characters are warm and enduring throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>This film is a bit longer than many animations at just under 2 hours, and it keeps it pace well. My biggest thrill was the nostalgia and the warmth of the story, like I said it has a lot of heart and soul. This is a film meant to appeal only to children either, adults will find it just as entertaining, maybe even more so.<br/><br/>I don't want to give it away, go see this film today, if you thought Finding Nemo was warm and wonderful, you going to be overly joyed to see Cars."
"WikusVanDeMerwe","9","1","2","11 June 2006"," Fantastic! A seventh Pixar gem!
","Who cares about negative hype? Who cares about presumption? Who cares about others ridiculing the concept? <br/><br/>None of that matters once you've actually seen Cars!<br/><br/>Cars is very well done, in its spectacular (and well researched) details of Mid-Western and South-Western scenery, the cars themselves, the lighting and reflection/refraction that will make you say ""wow"" times over throughout, the opening sequence, etc., but also in its excellent Lasseter-style characterizations, story arcs, and interactions. This movie really has it all, despite the fact that humans do not exist in its universe. You really stop caring (if you even did going into it) that they are all cars after only a few minutes...And seeing the movie twice is a very high recommendation. Kids may not enjoy this movie as much as say, the original Toy Story audience that I am a part of (16-19 or so), to see it twice in a row, but it takes two or three viewings to get all of what Lasseter is doing and to truly marvel at how well done the animation is. Plus, it's enjoyable each time through!<br/><br/>On a personal note, I have to say that I am sick of people trying to constantly rank each new Pixar film based upon those before it. It's great that Pixar has a ""bar"", and I think that each movie they have released meets it, but arguing over the newest features as 'inferior' is a fool's argument. We pretty much know that Pixar productions are the best, and they are the undisputed masters of animation...(and please remember that, despite the movie being released now, the final rendering was down over a year ago, with many of the designs, animations, and effects being done in separate groups over four years of rendering production. They are already able to, and usually rendering another movie, at a graphical level above that of their films in current release...)<br/><br/>Anyways, I recommend this movie for about 7 or 8 year olds and up....Smaller children have a problem with this movie (I've seen it four times, and each time, younger children don't follow it too well) but it is still very family friendly. The storyline is great, the effects are fantastic, and the direction of John Lasseter makes this an extremely enjoyable ride!"
"Quinoa1984","7","1","2","10 June 2006"," Pixar knows how to do formula just right- a lot of fun in an ""old-fashioned"" story
","Cars is the kind of animated film that, considering how computer dominated the realm is now and might be for a while, knows what it is and is successful almost in spite of what it could've been. It could've been, for example, a clunker of a formulaic animated movie where not only do you know what will happen every step of the way after a while the imbalance of comedy and the rest of the more grounded parts of the story detract from any pleasure from seeing the movie work on its own. Pixar, and particularly its co-founder John Lasseter, are particularly based on the importance of the story- however much it might lend itself to others- and having the best cast to go alongside the most believable visual schemes. Cars worked for me as being something that is akin to those ""old-fashioned"" picture of its kind (which I mean here as a compliment and not as some kind of put-down like others might), where after a little bit in the story you'll know what will happen, but it's fun seeing what's done within the scenes and how unexpected bits of delight come from the characters.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, it's actually rather remarkable; this might be the only time, for example, I won't mind a Larry the Cable Guy performance in a film (playing a dim-witted towing truck). Practically every part, in this case, gets the right choices *along-with* having the star power. Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen, who has a big ego as an up-and-coming race car driver. He gets sidetracked, however, when getting into a big accident ruining a road of a small, near-deserted town full of quirky oakies and long-forgotten types. The amount of supporting talent is commendable- Bonnie Hunt, Cheeck Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin (was happily surprised at that one), and Paul Newman delivering a good show as a car with a shattered past. Through the story then comes the usual thing- Will Lightnign McQueen suddenly break past his young self-contriteness and find who his friends really are? The answer shouldn't have to be too mysterious to find, but that's not the point that Lasseter and co-director (late) Joe Ranft are getting at.<br/><br/>If the film does have a couple of liabilities- most of the songs are my least favorite of any of the Pixar films with the end-credits one the exception; a couple of scenes don't work as well even within the conventions- it's got plenty to admire. As usual the animation team at Pixar gives the audience what they pay to see with this kind of picture- plenty of fantastic sights, with impeccable details with little things like the road itself and the cars and buildings as well as the vast, cool vistas delivered. Thers's also a sturdy, good-natured message behind the story and scenes, with the nostalgia of a period evoked alongside that of the usual 'don't forget what's important' ideal for kids. And as someone who doesn't really watch Nascar or much of that at all (even for the crashes that remind painfully why less than 1% of the country does this), the racing sequences are tremendously well done, especially when sitting close to the screen. At the end of it, I knew I had seen a very good movie, even if in some little ways it doesn't completely POP like the best of Pixar's work. It's also the first really good take-the-entire-family movie of the summer, at least on a level of spectacle and all-around entertainment."
"randy512tx","4","2","7","21 July 2006"," Disappointing
","I guess Pixar finally fell into the old trap of getting wrapped up the golly gee technology and forgetting about a story. The technology is amazing but after the whiz bang of the first scene it didn't add anything to the film. The characters are very simple and not funny except for the Italian cars. Every part of the story is un-original and borrowed from other mediocre movies. I don't understand why writers of kids movies always fall back on the ""capitalism is evil and mean people are greedy"" plot when they run out of new ideas. Pixar is going to make money on this, but I doubt that they are proud of it. Every other Pixar movie I have seen has had a great story and still watchable after a few dozen viewings. A very poor choice to showcase new technology. Oooh look at the colored lighting, lens flare and reflections and different textures, it's better than most xbox 360 games but not much."
"efg1-1","3","2","7","5 July 2006"," Nothing too major here
","Both the kids and I were a bit let down by the show. The story was a rather boring ""life lesson"" without much kid humor and only a little more wit for the adult. The best way to gauge a movie is to ask whether you would see it again. No one voted yes. The two Toy Story (also Pixar) movies were gems and everyone enjoys watching them over and over at home--Cars will not be such a keeper. Not much in the way of a story and what was presented was much too long. Felt like the producers were getting paid by the frame. Of the voices, only Larry the Cable Guy put a smile on your face whenever he spoke. In other movies, the voices provide a huge lift--Eddie Murphy, as Donkey, in Shrek comes to mind right away; Tom Hanks and ""Cliff"" in Toy Story. Hopefully there won't be a sequel for Cars."

","It had to happen. Nobody's perfect (or near perfect), but Pixar has been very close. Until now. This movie reeks of a poor Dreamworks production. Weak humor, too many topical (and dated) references, and a lead that is as weak as the acceleration on a Ford Pinto. Where have you gone Woody and Buzz, Marlon and Nemo, The Parr family, Sully and Stanley, and Flick and his band of lovable losers? You felt for these guys; you laughed at and with them. Not in Cars. I saw this movie with the ideal audience: A drive-in in rural Arkansas, full of kids and NASCAR fans on a (relatively) cool summer night. No laughs. The trucks (and a few cars) started immediately following the end of the movie. Pixar fans know that this can be a great chance to continue the movie, but know body cared. They just wanted to get out of there and pretend the last two hours hadn't happened. I should have trusted my gut about Cars, the feeling of dread that followed seeing the initial trailers and not been suckered in by undeservedly positive reviews. Would they have been this glowing for the same movie if it had been but out by someone other than Pixar: I don't think so. Bypass this wreck."

","I've seen Cars twice now I didn't like it either time.<br/><br/>For me this tale of a jerk who makes good is a technical tour de force as the Pixar animators push the envelope as far as one can in rendering a realistic world in an animated film. I'm not sure if thats a good thing since the cartoonish nature of the cars grates against the realistic world. I found it jarring and unpleasant to look at. It also creeped me out since the eyes of the cars looked dead and unresponsive. Sure the lids lifted and they moved back and forth, but they never changed they always remained static and equidistant.<br/><br/>A HUGE problem for me is that the Pixar guys have made a world of cars that looks exactly like our world, but which is is only filled with cars, there are no people. This would be fine except for the fact that if you think about it it doesn't make sense, how could cars have made everything we see? You can't argue people since we see cars in places they should be in houses and in the race stands. Yes I know its a cartoon, but at the same time it destroys the one thing a cartoon must have to work on any level and that is internal consistency and logic. This film doesn't have it at all.<br/><br/>I hated that I felt that I'd seen this movie before a thousand other times in a thousand other movies. It was so bad that I was pretty much guessing what the next line of dialog was going to be. Worse this film felt like an eternity during its time on the screen. If you're going to give me left overs the least you could do is give them to me faster so I don't have time to notice they're stale.<br/><br/>Major disappointment from Pixar.

","Cars, like other Pixar films, is pretty to look at if nothing else. Unlike other Pixar films, there is no emotional identification with the protagonist, McQueen. Instead we are filled with the typical Hollywood ideal that ""things were better in the past."" Like other animated movies in general, there are cheddery-cheesy songs and about 15 ""time-passing"" or ""relationship-building"" montages. It was distracting most of the time, and predictable. There were also some scenes, especially involving Larry the Cable Guy, that were there for their giggle factor, not their substance. This also distracts us from the message, if any, the movie is trying to get across. The short of it is that the movie is too long for most young children to sit through (at 2:05 hours).

","As soon as I heard that the new Pixar film was going to be about cars and especially naascar, i was fearful, whereas the car circuit is big in America, it means nothing overseas. And I was proved right. When the lead characters motivation is to get a sponsorship deal, these people have lost sight they are making a film for children. When Michael Schumacher turned up at the end, I knew Pixar had officially jumped the shark. My 4 year old son has no idea, nor cares who he is. What a flop. The lead car is really unlikable, and all the voice work is really tiresome, as if no one wanted to be there. While i have to say the animation is probably the best I have ever seen, as the film is slow, dimly written,(there are no new jokes or situations in evidence here), it does amuse me the the first film released by Pixar since Disney brought them is this second rate flick that would be right at home on the Disney release schedule"

"GSmith9072","6","1","3","25 August 2007"," A Valiant effort
","As soon as I saw the teaser trailer for Pixar's next installment ""Cars"", I just knew they wouldn't be able to pull off the magic again. After actually seeing the film I found out they did, well, kinda-sorta. What I love most about John Lasseter's ""Toy Story"" was it's engaging premise, characters, and situations, wholly unbelievable yet you willingly went along with it. The result? It was immensely entertaining, even moving. With it's on point humor and 'realism', the film succeeded with leaps and bounds, not necessarily requiring an amazing story to launch it into brilliance. I immediately realized that making automobiles with windshield eyes and mouths truly exist in their own world would be a challenge. Many children have a natural fascination with cars, but not really in such the way it is done here. Pixar's usual amazing imagery does ""Cars"" a big service, but in the end, Lasseter manages to keep audiences engaged by humanizing the likes of Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy. You really get the feeling that this film was nurtured with the same TLC as some of Pixar's finest, but the subject matter, and certainly the clichÃ©d story, force the film to to run out of gas. Some of the characterizations are more matching to much of the non-Pixar releases; human ethnicity based and that being the reason for the laughs. Also missing is the correct amount of wit, inventiveness, and hilarious dialogue such as in ""Toy Story"", although it comes in sporadic amounts with hits and misses. ""Toy Story"" of course had nostalgia on it's side and cleverly transformed that into a play representation that both adults and kids could really enjoy. I'm afraid much of our emotional connection to cars are limited. And so, I respect ""Cars"", even though I really think it isn't that good, at least as compared to Pixar's other films. With Nascar boring unfortunates dragged to it's confines by interested fans around America, it is truly a miracle that ""Cars"" succeeds in the way that it does. It's good for one ride, but it's impact is lacking for another spin."

Cars is the same exception with every animated movie that was made this year, it had some very funny moments, great animation, but it just felt like once again, there was nothing special.<br/><br/>Cars is about this one car, McQueen, a very famous race car who is about to win the ""Piston Cup"". But when he is traveling on the road on his employee's truck, he accidentally falls off landing in a cruddy town where he ends up destroying the road. As a punishment, he must stay there until he perfects the road once again, but in the mean time, he makes some excellent friends and a lovely porche acquaintance, Sally.<br/><br/>The story is very sweet and the animation was great, not to mention an all star cast really brought the film together, but like I said, just nothing is surprising me any more.

No more pretentious actors trying to tell us how to conserve energy while they jet around the planet!!! However, I thought this was well cast.<br/><br/>The story was pretty much the same as Doc Hollywood, so if you have seen that one, you pretty much know how Cars goes. There were some humorous parts, although I thought they were more adult-like in nature. For example, the main character is wanting to win the Piston cup. Think NASCAR Winston Cup when you hear that. The main character makes some statement about the Piston cup, and the lovable Mater says something like ""you did what to your cup?"" The adults got it. I didn't hear any kids laughing...thank goodness.<br/><br/>The story is too slow. It seems too slow to me for adults, and there is no way I can see a child getting through the slow parts.<br/><br/>This review seems pretty negative, and I don't especially mean it that way.

","""Cars"" exists in a world in which people have been somehow eliminated - maybe the phenomenon we know as car accidents has nothing to do with accidents after all and everything to do with murderous rebellion.<br/><br/>Having tired of such humiliations as junkyards and faux-wood siding, it could be that cars have a plan to pull a ""Matrix"" on us and take things over for themselves! Okay, not really.<br/><br/>Such thoughts may do U-turns in your head as you sit through ""Cars,"" a Pixar animated comedy in name only. You've got to give your brain something to do to pass the time, because what's on screen in the surprisingly lifeless comedy certainly doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>None of the pop-culture-referencing wit from such Pixar classics as ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"" is there. Nor is there a heroic character to cling to. Directed by John Lasseter, the movie clunks along like a beat-up VW bus rather than the Cadillacs that Pixar has trained audiences to expect.<br/><br/>The problems start with the initial disconnect of a world that couldn't possibly exist. It's easy and fun to imagine the micro-cosmos of ""A Bug's Life"" or a realm of a child's imagination in ""Monster's Inc.,"" but a world in which cars gather at racetracks, filling up stands to listen to car announcers and watch cars race is too weird to fathom.<br/><br/>There's even a car that talks like Jay Leno and tells jokes on late-night TV. It's some consolation that, judging from the film, a world run by cars is still stuck with dull, irritating Leno humor.<br/><br/>The superstar racer is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a hotshot who finishes in a three-way tie for the championship. A tiebreaker is set for the next weekend in California. While McQueen travels on Route 66 with his not-so-trusty trucker pal, Mack (John Ratzenberger), McQueen gets lost and stuck in the forgotten desert town of Radiator Springs. As arrogant and uncompromising as Barry Bonds, McQueen wrecks the town's main thoroughfare and is sentenced to fix it before he's allowed to leave.<br/><br/>McQueen is miserable with his plight and tries to escape a couple of times, but soon the town grows on him. There, he meets a foxy vehicular love interest, Sally (Bonnie Hunt), and develops under the mentoring of the wise town elder, Doc (Paul Newman). Whether McQueen softens, discovers that winning and egotism aren't everything and helps put the town back on the map, you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Radiator Springs is populated entirely by ethnic stereotypes. You've got Italian tire shopkeepers (Tony Shalhoub and Guido Quaroni) who speak in thick accents and go on and on about their love for Ferraris; Ramone (Cheech Marin), a ghetto-fab Latino low-rider; and Flo (Jenifer Lewis), the loud black female who owns a gas station.<br/><br/>As if to offset any accusations of prejudice, McQueen's sidekick is a Caucasian stereotype, namely a slack-jawed, buck-toothed yokel tow truck called Mater. He's voiced by Larry the Cable Guy with such exaggerated moonshine-soused hillbilliness that he makes ""Hee Haw"" seem refined by comparison.<br/><br/>All of this sloppy characterization would have been forgivable if the cars had funny things to say, but the script is mainly a succession of bad car puns such as ""hood on a platter."" There's as much humor in any 30-minute segment of the movie as there is in your average 30-second Chevron talking-car commercial.

","I must admit, I wasn't expecting to enjoy seeing this film. I took my five-year-old nephew to see it today (he liked it...but he's five!) hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with ""The Incredibles"". No such luck. Whereas Brad Bird (The Incredibles writer/director) created and edgy, suspenseful, entertaining, and meaningful film, Pixar went back to its insipid Disney formula of mindless ""friendship and love is all you need for everything"" drivel with this one. Yes, the animation was stunning (do you expect anything less than the best from a Disney/Pixar film?) but as is usually the case with Disney films, they find a formula that people love and run it to the ground until it gets stale and people stop buying tickets. The whole movie centers around a civilization of cars with eyes, mouths and personalities. When I saw the previews while watching ""The Incredibles"" last year, I thought ""Wow, now even Pixar has run out of interesting ideas,"" and after watching this uninteresting film, I have to say I was dead-on. I wish Disney would start to look for more original films that aren't so saccharine sweet and incessantly family-pleasing. After force-feeding this junk to our children for so long, its no wonder obesity is plaguing American youth at record numbers. Maybe they should try something new, like telling stories about more diverse characters. Have a real Asian or Latin or African-American person write a screenplay and give Disney some long-needed variety. They can't possibly be content with peddling style over substance forever. Watch ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Stories 1 and 2,"" or any of Disney's pre-CGI era animated films and you'll already have seen more interesting versions of this movie."

","Although America's love affair with the auto is currently threatening the country's economic and environmental stability, the creators of Toy Story take us to an imaginative world in which there are no humans to upset balances, just cars grooving to the sounds of competition, love, and family values.<br/><br/>John Lasseter and Pixar's Cars is an enthusiastic animation about cars that act like humans on a highway, Route 66, that once embodied the American dream of the open road and limitless opportunities as we wended west in search of adventure and sunnier homesteads. The photorealistic cinematography alone is worth seeing, especially the buttes and plains that compete with the real Monument Valley and Grand Canyon for majesty.<br/><br/>But the heart of the film rests on heart, the need to find and nurture someone special, the need to love competitors and maybe sacrifice even for them, the need to respect the elderly, and the need to preserve the past embodied in the solid values of small town and big heart. This is all red-state red meat, and Hollywood may be pandering to its own neocon critics, yet the tone and themes seem just right for any of us who have had the luxury of small town community love. This film's Radiator Springs, long forgotten with the construction of interstate route 40, contains the enduring seeds of friendship and caring that the hipper LA, where Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is bound to compete for the Piston Cup Championship, has long forsaken.<br/><br/>Not forgotten but just hibernating is old Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), who has a few races under his hood and much to say about life to Lightning. So effective is Newman's voice, with its evocation of all the hot-shot characters Newman has played, that Hudson becomes a sage, elderly Butch Cassidy, car no more. As well does the film become much more than a brilliant animation: It delivers sentiment closer to us lovers of autos than toys or bugs or closet bugaboos could ever. We just love our cars."

TOY STORY was original for it's time, and I have nothing against it since it was a breakthrough in CG animated films, but Pixar seems to think people are oblivious to the fact that they have repeated the same story arc in most of there films.<br/><br/>1. There's the obvious GUY wants GIRL plot.<br/><br/>2. Jokes that try to appeal to both parents and kids. Key word: TRY.<br/><br/>3. The transformation from good hearted to HERO status.<br/><br/>It's a very simple formula, and this movie does have it's moments (just like any other movie), but really makes you realize that the CLASSIC aspects of animated film are fading away into oblivion.<br/><br/>Films like the Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast are REAL animated classics, and CARS is definitely just another film that will be forgotten as CG gets more and more realistic over the years. Just like how films with CG (Star Wars: EP 1) look terribly dated now.<br/><br/>Still go out and see it since it's a decent summer movie, but It's no classic. It's disappointing to know that Disney has lost its creative drive it had when it dominated the 2D (hand drawn) industry. Just IMAGINE how great a 2D film could look in these modern days. Go and watch Princess Mononoke (directed by Hayao Miyazaki), and you'll understand why 2D will always remain more genuine and timeless."
"thomas-gilray","5","1","5","26 June 2006"," Mediocre Story
","This film was off to a good start but within 25 minutes had sagged into a depressingly predictable storyline. Every twist and turn of the story seemed to think of itself as brilliant when, in in reality, it could invariably be seen from 20 minutes away. Each predictable plot shift seemed like a tired viewer shifting in his or her seat groaning with annoyance. The film was uninspired and tried to make everyone happy in the end. The film's protagonist was unlikable from the first minute to the last seconds and the antagonist was cliché. Cliché and unable to make fun of that cliché. ""The Incredables"" used contant clichés but danced around them humorously making fun of their every move with a delicate and dark wit.<br/><br/>I suppose this film was entertaining on some level and did have a few truly witty lines. But do not expect more then a couple slow chuckles helped along by a need to break the boredom. It has been about a week since I saw this film and I only remember one line from near the beginning. For a film that is meant to be humorous, one memorable line should be embarrassing for the filmmakers. Another in a long line of failed films that tries to be both funny and touching.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of the film is the excellent graphics. They were however only a small improvement from pixars previous films. The Nature scenes were astounding but the cars themselves were crude and seemed to make their situation far less believable. I could not think of the cars as people. The line between the cars as vehicles and cars as people themselves was not successfully blurred. 5/10 seems to be a little high in my opinion but this film does fit in well with many other films rated in that range. It is not without merit but certainly does not achieve what has been possibly pixars greatest storytelling feat... the ability for their stories to appeal to both adults and children. Cars is most sad because of its great potential but inability to deliver on the qualities that pixar has always been able to in the past. Rent this one."

With this unoriginal story you could put anything in the car's place and you would still get the same outcome, so why cars out of all possible things. We at least got a glimpse of a plausible miniature world in A Bug's Life, but this world makes no sense. How do they mate? How do they use the rear-view mirrors when their eyes are the wind shield? And why are even the flies a car?<br/><br/>But it all comes back to the story, because how many times have you heard this: a self-absorbed city boy lives his life in the fast lane without thinking about other, some day he gets out of his comfort zone and must learn about appreciating the small things in life and care about others, then he gets his chance to be the greatest person in the world but has learned his lesson.<br/><br/>Yeah, it was predictable from start to finish, but I wouldn't say it's all bad, because even though he meets some colourful characters whereas most of them are one-note I did like McQueen's romance with Sally and how he played out with the race car veteran Doc Hudson which leads to a foreseen but heart-warming ending.<br/><br/>It may be Pixar's weakest original movie, but it's not all bad, we'll leave that to its sequel."

","Cars is an exciting coming of age story about Lighting McQueen, a cocky race car who learns the essence of life when he mistakenly runs into the small town of Radiator Springs.
As a Pixar film, a lot of people argue that this doesn't hit the same level as their previous films, and while I do believe that to a small extent, I think it's a great movie! The characters are deep and the story is intriguing. As a kid this was probably my favorite film ever, so maybe some childhood nostalgia is mixed in with this review.
At its core, this movie isn't about racing, which is what I adore about this movie. It's a typical coming of age story except it's told with race cars.
However, this film isn't super spectacular like other Pixar films, because it fails to obtain the magic and joy within them, and instead focuses on appealing to Children ie: a bunch of potty humor.
That doesn't make this film terrible though, and it's still a fun family film that adults can find enjoyment out of."

","It's not a bad movie but as Pixar movies go this isn't one of their best. A lot of people say that it lacks the charm of they previous movies and I agree. It's not really heartwarming or funny. The story's about a hot shot named Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) trying to be number 1 at the races.<br/><br/>While on the road a mishap causes him to end up in a small town where he accidentally wrecks havoc in the confusion. The town agrees he can't leave until he cleans up his mess. In doing so he gradually gets to know the inhabitants of the quiet town and the history of the town itself. This also leads him to re-evaluate his behavior and past actions.<br/><br/>You've probably seen this story before but to be fair Pixar puts a spin on it. The idea of cars being the main inhabitants is interesting but aside from that how their world works isn't always well defined. There're not a lot of heartfelt scenes rather it's just quiet moments that don't always go anywhere.<br/><br/>I feel like the movie ends before we really see the full extant of this world and the characters. I guess you could say the pacing's on rocket fuel. With all that being said it's not a bad movie it's just not that interesting. If you have little kids they'll like it but for the rest only if you're a car fanatic."

It came from a long line of movies that involved characters physically moving from A to B while we have a character who was literally made for that purpose yet he finds himself grounded. There's a nuanced sense of character, creative dialogue and something to like regarding the story of how a fast moving world left the small towns behind.<br/><br/>There's a lot to bet annoyed about too (just check the cinemasins) but the usual disney magic shines though what is ultimately a failed experiment."

If yes, where do they come from? What's inside these living breathing cars? Do they bleed? How do they build all these elaborate locations and place all these tiny little things on shelves, seeing as they don't have any hands? Can a car feel pain?<br/><br/>The universe is simply one neat idea that's never examined properly. My friends and I spent far too much time riffing on all the implausibilities of the movie universe.

","23 June 2006. Cars sputters its engines out of the starting block, overly long, and not as funny as previously animated blockbusters, provides a continuing look at the progress of animation technique that threatens to become indistinguishable from live action. While the trend of this form of animation towards realism will likely pose serious dilemmas for future movie makers, currently as provided in Cars, the animation is at times superb and at other times flat and artificial. The inconsistency of presentation is a major distraction. Car does possess good substance, a decent storyline, with some cute one-liners for car racing fans. Yet the flow of the movie is oddly flat for the first third of the movie. The rapid fire funny scenes are missing that the audience has come to expect with no constant sidekick.

","Perhaps Pixar's most childish and least emotionally resonant attempt thus far, this animated feature is based upon a nonsensical concept that isn't even entirely consistent within its own internal logic and also borrows most of its plot elements beat-for-beat from 'Doc Hollywood (1991)'. For most of the run-time I was surprised to find myself bored by the predictable plot peppered with thin characterisations and no laughs whatsoever. The finale picks up a little and provides some passing entertainment, though. It also has the hero learn a lesson that isn't necessarily set-up as obviously as the others. The lack of any emotional impact is what really compounds the flick as one of the coveted studio's weakest attempts. 5/10"
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","1","2 November 2017"," Give Cars another chance
","Ever since Pixar first wowed cinema-going audiences across the globe with their feature-length debut Toy Story, the company has become the standard for cinematic excellence. Not only for their constantly groundbreaking animation and ability to entertain both children and adults alike, but for the quality of their scripts and the amount of genuine heart that pours out of them. Yet for every WALL-E, The Incredibles or Inside Out there's always a Monsters University, A Bug's Life or Brave. These films still get a pass because, after all, ""it's only a kid's movie,"" but the disappointment is all the more crushing with the knowledge of Pixar's capabilities. Cars is firmly in the latter category, falling into the traps of a familiar plot and a script that isn't quite up to scratch.<br/><br/>Cars' reputation has been damaged ever further in the decade since its release, and this is no doubt thanks to the lazy and bitter- tasting sequels and spin-offs, something the company has churned out at an increasing rate ever since Disney took over. I must admit that I didn't think much of Cars back in 2005. It lacked excitement and a character to really root for, and the story of a cocky upstart learning learning a valuable lesson to change their outlook on the world can be seen in countless other children's movies. However, on my second viewing I found moments of tenderness between the cracks, an old-fashioned romanticism to really warm the heart. The movie is about more than a young race car named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his quest to escape the forgotten town of Radiator Spings to reach the Piston Cup. It's also about the changing face of America and the way its capitalist nature is leaving the little guys behind.<br/><br/>One aspect of Cars that was never criticised was its cutting-edge animation, and the way it brought the loud, dangerous world of racing and the country's glorious landscapes to beautiful life. It is still utterly glorious to look at, whether it be a wide shot of a darkening horizon or a close-up of buck-toothed tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The small town off Route 66 is full of other colourful archetypes, voiced by the likes of Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin and George Carlin. The problems I had with the film the first time around are still present - the climax should be a lump-in-the-throat moment but is oddly devoid of emotion, and the film offers no surprises at all - but they just didn't seem to bother me as much. The hefty running-time (just shy of 2 hours) also whizzed by, despite the lack of genuine laugh-out- loud moments. So forget Cars 2, Planes and those awful-looking straight-to-DVD spin-offs you ignore in Tesco, and give Cars another chance."

"ElMaruecan82","7","0","1","26 October 2016"," Another form of 'existential road movie'...
","There's something very nostalgic in and about ""Cars"", starting with its very concept: cars living and behaving like humans, it's a fun idea but not revolutionary. To those who might not be familiar with it, it had already been efficiently used in a Disney cartoon about road rage and a Tex Avery's cartoon about a father whose son dreamed of being race car (ironically, Avery would do a similar cartoon about planes). Now it's one thing to make short cartoons out of such gimmicks but how does that stand for a ninety-minute feature? Well, I guess not so bad when your name is John Lasseter.<br/><br/>Still, watching ""Cars"", I couldn't tell whether it was the most ludicrous or greatest idea ever, I mean, the universe where the film is set is like a human world as we know it, it has roads (obviously) but also buildings, which leads to the question, who built these buildings? But don't you dare start asking question, if you ask yourself how they make cars, you'll never know if it's on a technical level or if you're a baby car asking your parents. Which leads to the question, yes another, these cars have feelings but how do they express them? Granted Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) falls in love with Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) but how will that show? I guess we'll have to accept them as asexual characters like Buzz and Jessie are lovers or Buzz and Woody friends, but at least the toys evolved in the real world. <br/><br/>Well, I'll stop here, the whole movie wouldn't make sense once you'd put some thought of it, because it's hard to make lives out of mechanical things and the logic of the film is limited by the story itself, but it makes the emotional achievement even more admirable, it's not meant to be ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"", yet it creates a unique world built on something we love as kids and love even more as adult; cars, so I guess this is why the film was successful enough at the box-office, it hit a sensitive chord. And let's not kid ourselves, from ""Christine"" to De Lorean, there's always been a special spot for cars in our heart, we love them and take care of them as if they are 'persons' and if anything ""Cars"" exploits this privileged relationship we have with cars, from the toys they were to the big engines they turned into. <br/><br/>And as a kid, I had plenty of toys and all from different types, if they were all like Lightning McQueen, it would have been boring but to make up my 'stories', I needed every possible model, I had the fire truck, the old car, the police car, the diversity made the pleasure and accentuate the fun of playing with them, and that's what exudes from John Lasseter's film, it's like big men using cars as props to their stories. In fact, it's like a Toy Story played by grown-ups and it works, You have the introducing and climactic racing, the chases and the adventure in a small town in the desert, that used to be one of the most visited places during the glorious days of Radiator Spings, and this is where McQueen is forced to stay until he destroys the road after being chased by the police car.<br/><br/>There, the cocky Flash McQueen meets a gallery of colorful characters, nothing new, the goofy tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy), the Fiat Topolino with the Italian accent, voiced by Tony Shalhoub and the old judge, voiced by Paul Newman and who has enough in common with Lightning to play the role he knows best: the mentor. When you have a former race car champion in a town, it's obvious there will be a few lessons to learn for McQueen before he can 'win' the race. When your hero says that he doesn't need anyone, you know it's a matter of time before he changes his mind, but even when we're fully aware of what's going on, the film manages to drive over these clichÃ©s in a fun and enjoyable way. It's a rather character-driven story and it takes its time to unfold its nostalgic power. I particularly liked the words of Sally about the way the subway ruined everything, and I could relate to it.<br/><br/>Many of my dearest childhood memories involves these long travels, and I didn't ask ""are we there yet?"" because I knew the places we were going to cross, but we hardly come cross these towns because of the subways. Here's another aspect that will appeal to adults while kids will enjoy the visuals and maybe the story, too. After all, ""Cars"", while not a masterpiece, shows you that there are more things to enjoy in cars than moving from a point A to a point B, and that's enough a point to make."

En route to the event, a series of unfortunate events sees McQueen end up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, Radiator Springs.

"C22Man","7","0","1","26 January 2016"," Simply a ''good' Pixar film
","Cars appears to be the odd one out in Pixar's initial run, in that it wasn't meet with as much acclaim as its previous efforts. It was still well received by most people, but many agreed that it didn't push the boundaries or really try something inventive like the other films. I kind of have the same reaction, in that I think it's a good film but it's certainly missing somethings that could push to greatness. The premise of a world populated only by cars is a creative one, but it's something that has been done before and even the idea of a big fish trapped in a small pond has been done numerous times by other films. Maybe that's the issue with the film, it does these ideas well yet never does anything special with them.<br/><br/>The film features Lightning McQueen, a headstrong race car, who on his way to a final wrecks the road of a town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs. The town sentence him to fix the road, which he tries to do before his big race and he of course learns a lot about small town life. On the surface this is a very simple story about knowing when to slow down, yet that leads to one of the films weaknesses in that it's very predictable. We know that McQueen is going to realise that he's too impulsive and that he'll end up falling in love with the town as well as the cars within it. So there are no real surprises here and you know the turns that this story is going to take which can make things boring. With that said, the methods they use to tell the story are very effective. I think one of the films strengths is its laid-back tone and part of that comes from the story of this small town. It's not often you see Pixar tackle this kind of story and I actually think it's a nice change of pace, while the calmer tone gives the film a lot of charm.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is a different kind of protagonist for Pixar and again it's nice to see them do something different. He's reckless and arrogant yet it's clear that most of that comes from the racing environment, while he is willing to learn and change which still makes him a solid lead. His romantic interest Sally is okay, she doesn't have much beyond being smart and bubbly, but she serves her purpose fine. Doc is the grouch with a haunted past and it is nice to have Paul Newman voice him, but he is a bit dull and when don't get enough insight into his character. Mater can be annoying, but he makes a good companion and actually gets a lot of funny lines. The rest of the towns inhabitants are underdeveloped but still fun, such as a hippie van voiced by George Carlin and a Ferrari loving mechanic. The score by Randy Newman is good, but the soundtrack is excellent. It uses a lot of songs that obviously revolve around driving but nearly all of them fit the film perfectly when they show up and give some scenes more of an emotional kick.<br/><br/>The animation is once again excellent. It impresses me how well balanced it is. The race tracks are very fast paced and stylised with a real feeling of adrenaline to them. While the beautiful and dusty landscapes of Radiator Springs are simply wonderful to look at, and the town itself is such an attractive looking place that it's difficult not to enjoy being there. It's always nice to see Pixar animate more modern things and they do a great job here as usual. The film doesn't really have a man villain, but Chick Hicks is the closest thing and he is boring. Michael Keaton's tries his best voice wise, but Hicks is just a typical mean rival and is only here for the morale to be hammered home some more. The whole concept itself is also an issue in that nothing about it is ever explained. We don't know where these cars came from or how they even do simple things like go to the toilet. Though I guess that's more of a problem with the idea not the film.<br/><br/>All in all Cars is another fun and easy to enjoy Pixar effort. I certainly agree with most that it isn't up to Pixar's usual high standards and I do feel that is because it doesn't try to really push itself in new directions. It sets up its story, as well as its morale, and just follows it by the books without challenging our expectations. Saying I do think it has more than enough going for it. Its lead is different to the norm, the many side characters are distinct, the animation is superb and it is enjoyably laid-back. Sometimes it is nice to have a film to concentrates more on life in a small place and seeing Pixar tackle such a subject means it is never boring. So while certainly not one of its best, Cars is definitely a very enjoyable piece from Pixar."

","Cars (2006) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Cocky and rather stuck-up race car Lighning McQueen gets a dose of reality when he ends up in a small town full of small cars who don't know who he is. Even though he's a week away from the biggest race of his career, he ends up being forced to stay in the small town due to his speeding. At first he's put off by Doc Hudson, a local judge, until it finally dawns on him that he's a famous champion who disappeared fifty years earlier.<br/><br/>CARS isn't the greatest Pixar movie out there but I might say it's one of the greatest in terms of visuals. There's no doubt that kids are going to enjoy this film as will their parents and it's the visuals that are going to keep everyone so entertained. What really amazed me was how detailed some of the animation was and especially the scenes set at the race track where we see the stands full of cars. The amount of detail in these beautiful shots were quite amazing and more times than not my mind was off the actual story of the race and I was thinking of what all must have had to take place in order to get these scenes looking so great.<br/><br/>Another major plus the film has going for it are the vocal performances. Wilson has no problems playing the stuck-up character and he really makes you believe the story about him finally changing his ways. For a vocal performance Wilson really sells the character. Bonnie Hunt is good in her role as the love interest and we get nice supporting work from Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, George Carlin and Michael Keaton. Then there's Paul Newman who clearly steals the film as the veteran car who might just be able to teach Lightning something.<br/><br/>I think the story, for the most part, is a good one and there's no doubt that all of the characters are written quite well. I think the biggest flaw with CARS is that it clocks in at nearly two hours so there's no doubt that some of the stuff in the middle could have been trimmed down. Still, the characters and the wonderful animation makes CARS worth watching."

","Something of a phenomenon when it was released, everyone was talking about this movie when it came out. But to be honest the idea of giving cars eyes, faces and personalities is not a new thing, I mean Thomas the Tank Engine already had that one figured with Bertie the Bus a good 50 years ago!<br/><br/>But anyway, what I think of the movie. It's actually not that bad, it's quite a chirpy, upbeat little story about a fast paced, high flying racing car that becomes stranded in a rural desert town and after being imprisoned there for some time grows to appreciate the quiet life that these other cars lead. Not a particular fan of Owen Wilson's voice, it does become grating after a while but the voice actors for the other cars aren't that bad. Very good animation, of course you can't expect anything less from Pixar, the folks that gave us Toy Story and Finding Nemo. <br/><br/>However, some of the jokes are a bit awkward, I dare say the only people who would notice are really car enthusiasts, but even then they're a bit outlandish. For example, at one point Lightning points out that the female car (a Porsche 996) is a Carrera. <br/><br/>What does that mean?<br/><br/>Does it mean she's got a 3.4L engine? Does it mean she's got a Tiptronic Transmission to allow for both Automatic and Manual drive? Was it a school she went to? What's the joke?<br/><br/>Yeah, jokes like that are a little confused at times, and even make car enthusiasts scratch their head in confusion because there's no punchline or closure to them. But that doesn't make the movie an abject failure, in fact I think it holds up pretty well. I certainly enjoyed watching it, not my favourite film in the whole world mind you, but I could still see it as a pleasant little piece that kids would enjoy.

McQueen ends up accidentally damaging the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. At the town, while working hard to repair the road so he could leave for the race, he finds friendship and love within the town's local cars.<br/><br/>John Lasseter and Joe Ranft did a a nice job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a roaring racing intro. The story does take several minutes to gain any steam after the race, but the plot does identify the issue when McQueen gets lost by the roadside and ending up in the town of Radiator Springs. The plot then takes a little intriguing turn when McQueen will have to repair the town street he accidentally wrecked and then wonders how he is going to get to the California race in time. <br/><br/>The entire voice cast did a nice job in their respective roles, making the characters memorable. Owen Wilson did a convincing hot-shot personality of McQueen, Paul Newman did a mysterious personality of Doc Hudson and Bonnie Hunt did a warming job in voicing Sally Carrera. I especially enjoyed seeing the various American accents spoken by the Cars characters and some of the human traits they exhibit, and also especially enjoyed the all-star voice cast in the movie, even including sportscaster Bob Costa in a role. <br/><br/>In addition, the music score from Randy Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a splendid job in capturing the racetrack, town and beautiful countryside. <br/><br/>This is known to be one of the longest, if not the longest, Pixar movie. It gives enough time for the characters to grow on you and generate your sympathy. The only downside is that I thought it lacked the excitement, suspense and fun of other Pixar films like Finding Nemo and the Toy Story trilogy. But overall, it's still a pretty nice, heartwarming Disney tale that is fine for the entire family to enjoy! <br/><br/>Grade B-"
"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","22 August 2014"," Driven by good pacing, some substance and amazing animation
","""Cars"" is a Pixar production that I think is mediocre. What drives this movie thought is the animation, the speed and attention to details. The animation is detailed with the vehicle movements and environment,it's cool and entertaining. In another words the CGI is just topnotch when this movie came out. When it comes to the plot, it's in a universe where cars are alive like humans except they are cars. And revolves around a hotshot NASCAR that lives in the fast-lane and has a cocky and a bit of a narcissistic attitude. Until he has no choice to be among different people and that changes his perception and mentality, while also changing him to become a better race-car. So yeah, this is a story that has been done before, I can actually think of couple of movies from the top of my head that has the similar or even same premise. Except this time it revolves around characters that are cars. I wasn't excepting much from this movie, nor did it exceed my expectation. But it's a very watchable movie, that is a fun ride...At least the first time around. I also thought the character development is good in this, not great but they did a pretty darn good job developing multiple characters. And by the end, I actually sort of cared for the characters. And making talking vehicles likable and have certain amount of emotions for is actually a commendable task in my opinion. I remember when I first saw a Chevron promotional animation as a kid and thought it would be cool if they made a movie out of it. And I would have eaten this movie up as a kid and for that I also give it credit, since this is suppose to be a family film. Overall, this isn't a groundbreaking Pixar movie or all that memorable. But the animation with a bit of substance actually makes this one a good watch.<br/><br/>7.2/10"

He befriends all the people over time.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>The only likable character is, honestly, Doc Hudson (The '51 Hudson Hornet Vehicle). At least he has an interesting and historically accurate back-story. Lightning McQueen, I admit, does become likable half-way towards the end of the movie. At first, it's really hard to care about it. But, then again, that's the point of the story.<br/><br/>Visuals:<br/><br/>The details in the CGI is astounding.

Much like the Twilight Saga Movies, the secondary characters are far better than the main cast.<br/><br/>Rewatchability:<br/><br/>Even though I said it's fun for a second viewing, that's about it.

"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","7 October 2013"," Definitely Not As Mediocre As I Was Led To Believe
","While not as transcending as their previous efforts, Cars still manages to do enough to keep alive Pixar's winning streak & presents its pioneering animation studio slowing down a little just to catch its breath after having left behind all its competitors down in the dust during its first decade of filmmaking, and is certainly not as mediocre as many have called it to be.<br/><br/>Set in a world populated entirely by automobiles & other vehicles, the story of Cars follows a racing rookie who, while travelling to California for the tiebreaker race that will determine the champion of the Piston Cup, finds himself waylaid in Radiator Springs & is tasked with repairing the damages he incurred on his arrival but ends up learning the true value of life during his stay.<br/><br/>Steered by John Lasseter (director of Toy Story, A Bug's Life & Toy Story 2), Cars opens with an exciting racing sequence that instantly puts on screen everything one needs to know about its world but once the main plot surfaces, it soon loses its firepower, crawls throughout the middle section but manages to find its pace again near the end to at least finish on a respectable note, if not a high one.<br/><br/>There's no denying that behind the scene work here is very impressive & is carried out with relentless dedication plus further advancement in the computer animation is highly evident in those landscape shots but this time, the script suffers for the story isn't engaging in any manner & unlike their previous efforts, appears to me more targeted at children because of which many might have a tough time sitting through it.<br/><br/>Not everything is bad in this world inhabited by anthropomorphic vehicles for it looks truly stunning on camera as the depicted locations are beautifully rendered, Randy Newman's score is fairly good, voice cast is pretty interesting & the final race does lift the entire film to an extent but there's a whole lot of superfluous content to go through before we get there & with no memorable characters, that road isn't smooth enough.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Cars follows Pixar's tradition of heading into the unknown but due to a lack of strong foundation this time, it doesn't really succeed with flying colours. Definitely not amongst their finest works but Cars somehow manages to stay afloat instead of simply drowning & in many ways, can be seen as a deep breath before the plunge for what Pixar unleashed in their next 4 features took their creativity & legacy to an all-time high."

","Everything that you expect Disney/Pixar to do well, they managed to do well in ""Cars."" The animation is absolutely superb and there's a valuable message included about learning to take life slowly, enjoy the scenery and those around you and not being fixated about winning everything and every time. All of that I can buy into without any trouble, and the movie even nods respectfully at the racing scene that inspired it by including the voices of drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti and Michael Schumacher.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) - a rookie car in the championship circuit whose on track to win the ""Piston Cup."" When the season ends in a 3 way tie, a final race between the 3 is scheduled in California, but on the way west, McQueen end sup trapped in Radiator Springs, once booming and now almost a ghost town because it was bypassed by the interstate. In Radiator Springs, McQueen (highly frustrated at first that he can't get to California as fast as he wants to) discovers a different and slowed down lifestyle and he starts to discover and understand virtues like friendship and loyalty.<br/><br/>All that worked very well. Surprising, then, that I have to admit that the movie never really struck home with me. Maybe it's just the difficult in figuring out how to rate an animated movie whose appeal is mostly to the younger set. It has a lot going for it. I can't argue with that. I just didn't find that it held my attention all that well. But if you like Disney/Pixar stuff, you'll certainly find that there's nothing wrong with this. It just didn't really make much of a connection with me for some reason. (5/10)"

","Of the several Pixar movies I've seen, ""Cars"" was the only one that left me flat. It's not an unpleasant or stupid film, just a clear dip from an otherwise very high standard.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a rookie race car en route to contend for the all-important Piston Cup when a highway miscue leaves him stranded in a near-ghost town along desolate Route 66. McQueen is hot to move on, but the town's resident judge Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) won't let him until he fixes its main street. As the days to the Piston Cup dwindle, McQueen loses his temper but finds his soul.<br/><br/>""Cars"" looks great, and there are some warm and funny digs at the world of NASCAR its fans will enjoy. The voice talent, including Pixar regulars Bonnie Hunt as love interest Sally the Porsche and John Ratzenberger as the truck who drives Lightning around, do their usual solid work breathing life into the characters. The visual design is hard to criticize; even the road textures and the chrome reflections appear perfect.<br/><br/>What's wrong with ""Cars""? It doesn't really have any of the ingredients I expect from a Pixar film. It's not laugh-out-loud funny like ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Monsters Inc."", it's not uplifting like Toy Stories 1 or 3, or wondrously engaging like ""Finding Nemo."" It's sort of like watching your little nephews playing with toy cars, diverting until you think about the scotch you could be drinking instead.<br/><br/>""Cars"" is a movie for ten-year-old boys. As Paul Newman's last movie, it has that in common with his first film, ""The Silver Chalice."" Newman's film career nearly sank after ""Chalice"" while ""Cars"" would be his highest-grossing film. Too bad his presence made little difference to most of his audience.<br/><br/>Newman brings a cranky brio to Doc Hudson, the vintage sedan whose gruff exterior toward Lightning conceals a secret. You can hear a scratchy frailness in his voice, but there's a lot of game, too. Newman the car-racing buff even has two credits in the movie, the second as a ""Special Racing Consultant."" It's not Butch Cassidy, but Newman would have enjoyed going out on four wheels.<br/><br/>The big problems for ""Cars"" is that it's not that funny and way too long at two hours. Plot lines involving Lightning fixing the road or worrying about landing a big new sponsor play as dull as they sound. Prior Pixar films worked a lot of witty humor into their basic concepts. How could you not laugh with ""A Bug's Life"" when a mayfly at a sad flea circus whined ""I got only 24 hours to live and I ain't wasting it here!"" This time you get such wan efforts as a double entendre about the ""gas"" being served at the local cafe and Sally leaving behind ""life in the fast lane"" for small-town life. It's funny because she's a car, I guess.<br/><br/>The flash and glitz of cars on the go is all this movie ends up being about. No deeper riches await additional viewings. It's a pleasant timewaster from a studio capable of much more."
"ben-hof","5","0","1","12 February 2012"," A good story lost in a nonsensical setting
","Having seen all of Pixar's previous works, and loving every one of them, I had expected Cars to be another masterfully crafted piece of family entertainment. Upon exiting, I was fairly disappointed. While by no means a terrible film, Cars didn't strike me as being of the high quality standards of Pixar's previous projects. Of course, the visuals and the animation were stunning, and the score by Randy Newman was great, but, impressive production aside, the film itself didn't click with me.<br/><br/>The story is a simple and meaningful one: that of a self-centred guy who learns that there are more important things than oneself and one's own selfish desires, and the value of friendship and working as a team. What didn't work for me in this story was the world in which it takes place – one where cars and other vehicles are beings in themselves that talk and have individual personalities. Now, I would be okay with this, were it not for the fact that the cars also function as people – and there are no humans anywhere. This doesn't make sense, as the world portrayed is an obviously human one – with farms, barbed wire-topped fences, and multi-story buildings – all things that make no sense for a world inhabited solely by cars. This untenable setting also causes problems with the events that take place over the course of the story.<br/><br/>However, I know a good many people who didn't have a problem with the plausibility and greatly enjoyed the film, so I guess if you are able to accept the premise and the events and settings at face value, this should be a greatly enjoyable film for you.<br/><br/>In summary, it's a great-quality production with a good story at heart, but it's what I would describe as a kids' movie, whereas the rest of Pixar's library are films for the whole family, that stand up to sophisticated, adult audience-level scrutiny as well."

","As a fan of Pixar's output I must say that, like many others, Cars is probably my least favourite movie of theirs. This tale of anthropomorphic cars, in which conceited racing car Lightning McQueen is taught a useful life lesson about humility by the inhabitants of small town Radiator Springs.<br/><br/>As one expects with Pixar, everything is technically flawless - one marvels at the look of this film, and the voice talent is all excellent, The story is well constructed and the moral, a good one, is delivered without being hammered mercilessly home.<br/><br/>Yet I don't know what it is, but I just can't warm to it. I can appreciate it, but it doesn't touch me in the way that Pixar's other movies do. Maybe it's just that I'm not a car person, because the mechanical Wall-E touched me deeply."

","As its a pixar movie, you can't even comment on the animation which is again magnificent. But is that enough for a lay-man who's up for a movie experience? The story is dull and boring. Concept wise the movie is really strong but script is lacking. Movie is predictable and the story keeps stretching like elastic. There are some nice moments and some gimmicks to make you smile but where is the magic of Pixar like we had in earlier movies 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo' . The movie visually is very appealing and kids gonna surely love it. Even for grown ups its a nice ride but not a great one. Surely is one time watchable easily with family.

","""Toy Story"" director John Lasseter has surpassed himself with another classic animated Pixar epic. ""Cars"" takes place in the world of competitive automobile racing. Like the ""Toy Story"" trilogy and ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars"" occurs in a universe without humankind. Everybody in cars is some model of automobile or an accessory that furnishes help for an automobile. The cars have expressive eyes in their windshields and mouths in their front end grilles. They display a limited ability to gesture with their tires as if the tires were arms. As many as a dozen scribes, among them Joe Ranft, Dan Fogelman, Kiel Murray, Jorgen Klubien, and Phil Lorin, including Lasseter, have concocted a thoroughly entertaining romp in the NASCAR like circuit about antics of an independent but immature rookie race car named Lightning MacQueen. Clearly, our impulsive hero draws his name from immortal cinematic speedster Steve McQueen. <br/><br/>The story follows the arc of Lightning's life from the moment that he arrives on the scene as a race car champ until he learns some of life's important lessons. Primarily, Lightning will grow to appreciate the meaning of friendship. ""Cars"" belongs to that category of sports movies about a callow protagonist who learns the painful lesson that winning isn't everything. Somewhere along the road, Lightning has to sniff the roses and acquire values that eclipse those feelings of lone-wolf selfishness. Lightning (voice of Owen Wilson) makes a spectacular debut on the asphalt. At the same time, he alienates his crew chief and makes the mistake of not swapping out tires when he is ahead of everybody else, including the racing legend known as 'the King' (real-life racer Richard Petty)challenges Lightning at every turn. Miraculously, Lightning crosses the finish line in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup Championship. The other two cars that make it to the finish with him are the King and an obnoxious race car named Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). Racing authorities decide to stage one more race to determine who is really the best. Lightning is in such a hurry to get to California that he makes his eighteen wheeler buddy who hauls him around to drive late into the evening. <br/><br/>During this long, late night haul, Mack the eighteen wheeler (John Ratzenberger) loses Lightning when its back-end disengages and our sleeping hero rolls out into on-coming traffic. Lightning has to dodge and swerve other autos and eighteen wheelers. Inadvertently, in his desperate efforts to catch up with Mack, Lightning takes a turn for the worst and winds up in the remote and largely forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Radiator Springs used to be on the main highway until the Interstate 40 bypass was constructed. Now the little town in the middle of the desert is slowly drying up. When Lightning roars into town, he is racing ninety to nothing to escape from a policeman. He gets tangled up in barbed wire and a statue and ends up destroying the asphalt-paved thoroughfare. <br/><br/>After our hero spends the night in the impound lot, he has his day in court. The town fathers—again a motley collection of cars—sentence Lightning to resurfacing the road. Although Lightning explains the urgency of his trip, the Radiator Springs authorities are just a little smarter than he is. The virtually friendless Lightning gradually makes friends, the best friend of the bunch is a tow truck operator called Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy)who follows Lightning's every move. Eventually, Lightning meets Sally Carrera, (Bonnie Hunt) a Porsche and they hit it off. She explains that she was once an attorney in Los Angeles who broke down in Radiator Springs and discovered the beauty of such an isolated town. Lightning labors under the misguided belief that he knows everything there is to know about race car driving until he meets Doc. Doc (voice of Paul Newman) is an old Hudson that won several Piston Cup awards, but an accident put him out of the racing business. Doc is reluctant to teach Lightning those life lessons that everybody needs to know to survive. <br/><br/>The animation is top-notch and occasionally could pass for the real thing. No, the talking cars never look human enough so that you don't notice that they are automobiles. Nevertheless, Lasseter and his scenarists have forged many interesting characters and given them some insightful dialogue. The humor is hilarious, especially the tractor tipping scene where Lightning and Mater sneak out to a farm late at night to scare sleeping tractors. The tractors here are the equivalent of cows. Clocking in a 116 minutes, ""Cars"" never runs out a humor and excitement. Adults will enjoy this opus about anthropomorphized automobiles much as adolescents because the writing doesn't stoop to conquer."

","It's odd to think my favorite Pixar film is the one everyone hates or finds inferior to every other film by them. Many people will not understand why I love this film so much, but I'm sure every person has my same love for a film not many people enjoy either. It is a very personal thing, but I loved Cars. It is as good as the first Toy Story movie.<br/><br/>Pixar pumps so much life into their films, and they seem to come out so quickly. Cars came out about a year after The Incredibles, and at that time I assume people expected saw Cars has an awkwardly made film. They're cars. They talk and they have heartfelt conversations. I think maybe talking toys, monsters, bugs, and a superhero family were a bit more understandable.<br/><br/>The plot is that Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson), a race car, just tied with Chick Hicks (Keaton) in their latest race. McQueen's pit crew is now traveling to Los Angeles for the tie-breaker race, as well as McQueen, until the truck carrying McQueen falls asleep and McQueen falls out the back.<br/><br/>McQueen lands in a near desolate town called Radiator Springs. It's an old fashioned town where all the cars know each other, they all knew their customers, and they were all active workers at one point. Ramone (Marin) runs the body shop, Flo (Lewis) runs a diner, Mater (Cable Guy) runs the tow-truck business, Sally (Hunt) runs a motel, Luigi (Shalhoub) and Guido (Quaroni) run an auto repair shop, and Fillmore (Carlin) runs an oil shop. The town is run by a grumpy old race car named Doc Hudson (Newman) who is hiding a secret himself.<br/><br/>The tow-truck Mater tries to become friends with a reluctant McQueen who just sees everybody as losers and himself as a winner. The film teaches a lesson in friendship and staying close to the people you love. The big moral; winning isn't everything.<br/><br/>Cars comes equipped with a ""back in the day"" style that works in its favor. In the fifties and sixties, like Sally said ""Cars didn't drive on it (the old highway) to make good time. They drove on it to have a good time."" Now that a highway has been constructed so that it runs right past Radiator Springs, it doesn't get very many, if any, customers and is almost running to the end of its lifespan.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the film spits two memorable tracks that flow perfectly with the film. Rascal Flats covers Life is a Highway, once sung by Tom Cochrane, and adds a very zesty and fast paced quality to the song. It's exciting and very fitting to a film like this. Cars also features the tear-jerker by James Taylor, Our Town. While playing it, it shows flashbacks when Radiator Springs' business was better than ever and very profitable.<br/><br/>I have a certain love-affair with this movie I can't explain too well. It's a campy and fun movie with a lot of positive, and sad, qualities. The characters, while cars, manage to enter your heart and never leave. And as always, Pixar does exceptionally well when it comes to animation and scenery. It can almost bring back such memories when you were seven years old, and your cars had a mind of their own. You'd race them around using your hands in your bedroom using your own personal sound effect system - your mouth. I'm not accusing you of doing it, I did it too. Cars revives those memories.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub, John Ratzenberger, George Carlin, Jenifer Lewis, Cheech Marin, Richard Petty, Joe Ranft, and Michael Keaton.

","As you may be able to tell by now, I'm a big fan of Pixar. I've watched almost all of their films, and I hope to re-watch (and review!) many of them later this year. So while I'm not a big fan of car racing, I was still looking forward to watching Cars. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The Story: Lightning McQueen is a rookie race car intent on one thing - winning the Piston Cup. While on the way to the final race of the season, he ends up stranded in the small town of Radiator Spring with an obligation to repair their road which he wrecked on his way through the town.<br/><br/>The Good: This film has several important lessons, including putting other before ourselves, respecting our elders, and setting a good example for those looking up to us. Perhaps the most important theme, however, is just to slow down and enjoy life. One of Lightning's biggest problems is that he's impatient and selfish. He's living life in the fast lane and he wants everything done his way. After he gets stranded in Radiator Springs he's forced to slow down and enjoy life and the relationships it brings him. A much needed lesson in the hectic consumer culture we live in today.<br/><br/>The Bad: This is a little edgier than Pixar's other films, though in comparison to many other films it's still fairly clean. Among the offensive elements are a few uses of language, a couple of slight references to drug use, and several of the race cars' very prideful attitudes (though these are resolved pretty well by the film's conclusion). Towards the beginning of the film Lightning races a train to a crossing and darts in front of it at the very last minute. While it is a very brief scene it is not portrayed as a bad thing, whereas in reality it is a very dangerous and foolish thing to try.<br/><br/>Conclusion: While Cars is certainly not Pixar's greatest film, it is a very enjoyable ride. There are a few uncomfortable bumps every once in a while, but on the whole Pixar has once again taken us on a smooth and delightful cruse."

","This was the seventh Pixar/Disney release in the cinemas, and it was also the celebration of twenty years of the two studios collaboration, and after seeing plenty of clips I was looking forward to it. Basically in a world where all characters are motor vehicles, in California, hotshot rookie Le Mans endurance racer car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is competing against two main competitors, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) and Strip 'The King' Weathers (Richard Petty), to win the Piston Cup. When the three racing cars tie across the finish line, they all start travelling to Los Angeles to the tie-breaker race, and with sleepy lorry Mack (John Ratzenberger) transporting Lightning, the racing car in unintentionally dropped off, ending up in the detoured Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. In his stride, he manages to damage the road, and he is sentenced by Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, in his final film role) to repair the road, which will take about five days, not very good if he wants to get to the race track. Lightning initially rushes the community service job to get out of the town as quickly as possible, but this just ends up keeping him there longer, starting all over again. As he stays however he makes some good friends who teach him some valuable lessons about life, including rusty pickup truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and the cute eventual love interest, Porsche 911 Carrera Sally (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt). After discovering the reason for the town being so quite, being cut off from the interstate and taken off the map, and also that Doc used to be a successful racing car himself, winning two Piston Cups, Lightning wants to help more than just fixing the road. After lighting the town up with some great neon lights, he is then finally found by the press and Mack who want to take him back to the racing track in Los Angeles ready for the big race. Lightning does initially keep thinking about Radiator Springs, but then he sees all his new friends, including the originally uninterested Doc, are watching him in the audience, and the race gets underway. Lightning remembers one or tricks he learnt in the town, and it comes to the final lap, where Chick rams The King so hard that he is very badly damaged in his crash, and Lightning sacrifices his winning place to help him across the finish line. In the end, winner Chick is booed and it is Lightnign offered the sponsorship from Dinoco (the motoring company from Toy Story), but he turns it down to stay with his Rust-Eze sponsors, and he makes sure Route 66 is back on the map, and obviously to get the affection of Sally.

I can sort of agree with the critics, this could have been a little better, but with a great cast list, some good in-jokes and heart, some good nostalgia of past Pixar successes (including ""Lightyear"" tyres and For the Birds cameos), it is not a bad animated comedy fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""Our Town"" and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film.

","Over the past decade or so, Pixar and Disney has combined for many hit movies with Pixar being at least seven. This movie is one of them. It has the same feel as a Pixar film even though talking animals are out of the picture. This movie is creative with the use of talking cars. It does not mean Hollywood is running out of ideas even though that might be the case.<br/><br/>This film is about a rookie racecar named Lightning McQueen. He had a three-way tie with two other mighty racecars. As he was going to the tiebreaker race, he gets lost and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Now he has to follow the demands of a small town and get back to the race in time.<br/><br/>Well, there is plenty of voice talent. I liked Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and the late Paul Newman.<br/><br/>The music is pretty good. I'm glad the song by James Taylor was nominated for an Oscar.

","Cars is a perfectly watchable Pixar Animation. There's nothing wrong with that, but after the high standards set by 'Nemo' and 'Incredibles', its natural to feel a bit letdown. The script never really explains this world populated entirely by cars, and these cars exhibit ALL the features of human beings, its strange really. Still, the animation quality is amazing, specially the scenic views of the South West United States. The plot is old-fashioned and reassuring, with the moral of enjoying life, rather than simply racing by. A pleasant watch but nothing great.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","In one of Pixar's most under-appreciated film, a race car gets lost on the way to the biggest race of his life, and winds up in a town where he learns the meaning of life.<br/><br/>With the opening montage of a race car getting himself geared up for a race, audiences are invited into a fast and flowing animation which doesn't match the peak of Toy Story or Wall-E, but is entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>Pixar have been there or thereabouts with every film they have released in the past decade, with hit after hit, and this family adventure is up there with the others, but falls slightly due to an annoying central protagonist and a fair amount of predictability.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen is stubborn, unfunny, egotistical and negative; everything that can be annoying about in a character is justified by the race car. McQueen is partly the reason why this film doesn't match the class of other Pixar films. Toy Story had the funny and courageous central character Buzz, Wall-E had a lovable lonely robot, and even without a great central character, others have fallen on support characters, such as Dory in Finding Nemo. Other cars which include Sally, Mater and Luigi save the film with funny physical moments, especially the tractor sequences.<br/><br/>The ideology of friendship is heart-warming and beautiful to watch all the way through as we watch McQueen face new challenges in his personal life.<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning as you would expect from the best animation team in the world. The direction does the graphics justice with a fast and flowing style from Lasseter.<br/><br/>The plot does follow many conventions, but has a laugh along the way and the likability of the support characters and the general ideology of the plot with twists and turns, quite literally at the end, are enough to cement it as a good animation, which is fun and likable for the entire family."
"TOMNEL","8","0","1","20 June 2008"," Though still a good movie, this is by far Pixar's worst.
","Cars is a good movie. It's got some really cool looking animation with detailed sets and well developed characters. It's entertaining and fun, and sometimes funny, though the funny scenes tend to appeal more to children's' senses of humor. The voice acting fits well and Cars has quite an ensemble voice over cast. So why is this the worst Pixar movie? Well, some elements of this film felt far-fetched to me, and I know I'm talking about a movie based around a world of cars, but still, some realism is needed.<br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is the fastest race car of them all. After a big race he is being taken to another race in a pick up truck when he falls asleep and rolls out of the car causing damage to a small town called Radiator Springs. In order to leave the town, he has to fix up all the messes he made, and in the process he grows a connection to the town, and makes some friends, something he didn't have many of before because of his hectic racing schedule. He becomes good friends with Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a simpleton tow truck, and he becomes romantically interested in Sally (Bonnie Hunt). Lightning has now gone missing, and is needed for his next race. Will he choose his stardom, or the cars he's come to love?<br/><br/>One major problem I had with this movie was Lightning's sudden connection to this town. It takes him no longer than 2 minutes to become connected to this town that he's only been in for a day...it's just a bit unrealistic, even for a cartoon. I also didn't like the cutesy pie lines thrown in, which weren't in any other Pixar film. Tow Mater, who Lightning doesn't even know very well, states that Lightning is his best friend. That either is a fault on the writer's part for trying to speed up the process of great friendship by 100 times, or it shows how everyone hates Tow Mater, and I'm pretty sure the latter isn't the case. Because this movie is only under 2 hours, it can only have so much time passing, but I just have a hard time buying the friendships that these characters make. Compared to the other Pixar movies the plot just isn't as interesting either. Luckily it has enough of it's Pixar charm to make it an entertaining adventure, if not a very lame one for Pixar's extremely high standards they've set.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins. Rated G."

","I loved this movie! I thought it was terrific! Great story line. Excellent animation blended with witty humor, and fun characters. But I have this knack of finding similarities in movies. As I watched this movie, something seemed a bit familiar to me, and I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Then it finally dawned on me.<br/><br/>This movie is basically the 1991 Michael J. Fox hit movie ""Doc Hollywood"", but in the form of animated cars instead of regular live actors. In Cars, you have Lightning McQueen as the main race car character, who is trying to make his way to the big race showdown, and in Doc Hollywood, you have Fox portraying a just out of med school rookie doctor looking to make big money in California practicing plastic surgery. Both are side-tracked by accidents in small towns and are forced into some kind of civic duty before being freed. Enter a new- found love interest into the picture, who the main character helplessly falls for, and he then has to define to himself what he really wants out of life. A life in the fast lane with fame and fortune, or a relaxing slowed-down life in ""Sleepy Town, USA"".<br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen the movie ""Doc Hollywood"". I suggest you rent it and see for yourself. I give both movies a 9 out of 10. Even though they are very similar.<br/><br/>Trent Argyle302@aol.com"

","This really is a fun movie for all ages. The animation is so great that adults will actually get a thrill from seeing the cars racing around like a digital form of the car sets they had as kids. Kids will enjoy the characters and there is enough charm and humor to give everyone a smile.The ""trivia"" section of IMDb says the McQueen character is based on an animator named McQueen, but I'm sure thoughts of Steve McQueen and his racing days were thought of, too.<br/><br/>Be sure to watch during and after the credits at the end. It's like finding ""easter eggs"" in software programs. There are fun mini-vignettes that are sure to make all the parents who have invested in other Disney/Pixar films smile knowingly. <br/><br/>It's a fun ride with a few rough patches. I didn't appreciate the repeated ""nuts"" jokes. There are stereotypes of Italians (funny accents, hinted at Mafia ties) and Puerto Ricans (funny accents, loud colors). Interesting that the largely homosexual population of Disney artists never pokes fun at other homosexuals. And the preachy ""progress made us by-pass small towns and leisurely rides to save a few minutes"" doesn't make sense at the end when you realize those extra minutes = several miles of gas guzzling, and the ""happy ending"" involves bringing more traffic, including more technology, to the town. <br/><br/>But past the hypocrisy is stunning animation, a cute story, and great acting by Paul Newman who makes the movie worth watching all by himself. An actor who makes an animated character memorable is impressive. Some catchy tunes, too, old and new, will have your engine humming.<br/><br/>In the old days the family would spend a day in the car watching the scenery. Nowadays, enjoy some time with the family watching Cars."

","When it comes to animated films, there has to be a perfect blend of elements to make the film work and entertaining at the same time, Cars does that. The animation on this film was superb, making these cars look real and interacting which each other was well done, the lighting was perfect and the smallest details such as dust clouds, reflections of light on the cars was great. The story though it may have been typical in some point, it felt really good, the voicing was well done (especially from Larry The Cable Guy) and the soundtrack was the best, reviving old classics such as Life Is A Highway and Route 66 to original works like Behind The Clouds and Real Gone. Probably the best thing about it is, being an amateur follower of NASCAR, is how they gave nods to some of the legends in NASCAR, like the Hudson Hornet, King Richard's car and even car #8 which is Dale Earndhart Jr. car.<br/><br/>Personally the movie is great, it's great to watch with the family and if you're a NASCAR fan you'll probably smile and add this film to your collection of NASCAR related stuff."

","Another great kids movie from the geniuses at Pixar but there is a few problems.<br/><br/>All the other Pixar movies seemed to be great movies for all but this one seems to be aimed at the young boys. Now i am not saying that people other than young boys won't like this but it feels like it was made for the guys.<br/><br/>The animation is superb which is what you expect from the people at Pixar. The movie has detailed environments and the cars look awesome. At one point in the movie you forget that they are just cars and look at them like they are living things.<br/><br/>There are some great tunes in there that are about cars. Like that 'Life is a highway' song. The songs match the movie very nicely.<br/><br/>Again we fall in love with the characters like we do in every Pixar movie. Owen Wilson done a great job as lightning McQueen and all the other voices did great jobs.<br/><br/>The story was good. A race car called Lightning McQueen gets accidentally lost in a town in the middle of nowhere which is called radiator springs. There he meets all different types of cars. Lightning McQueen must get to California before the big race starts so he can be signed on to be the new face of a car company and be a even more famous race car.<br/><br/>Although this doesn't have the warm fuzziness that the other Pixar movies do this still is a good kids movie. There are some laughs in there but not as many as there could have been. Overall it is a good kids flick. Even though it is my least favourite Pixar movie(Although i haven't seen A Bugs Life yet).<br/><br/>I recommend it if you want to see a good kids movie.

But unfortunately the movie doesn't do a damn thing new. For every question I asked above, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the answer. The movie also goes on for a little too long. At almost 2 hours, it definitely wears on you. Even though it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it still has a very vibrant feel, has some good voice-acting (though Owen Wilson needs some getting used to), and it's pretty entertaining. It's possibly the worst of the Pixar films, but that's really not saying much, since all Pixar movies are fantastic, and this just misses the mark. For example, pretend all the Pixar movies are in a Car race...The Piston Cup. The Incredibles finishes first, and Cars finishes last. But hey, only the big boys are invited to compete in this race, and it's obvious Cars is capable of competing, but it seems the Cars pit crew just didn't work hard enough."

","*** out of **** stars<br/><br/>Egomaniac Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a rookie race car with, sadly, no friends. He doesn't want a crew chief, and he talks to his re-fuelers and his tire changers as if they are very replaceable dishwashers. McQueen's dream is to win the coveted Piston Cup; the highest honor of the American race circuit. After a creatively juxtaposed tie with two top-notch competitors, a three-car race-off is scheduled in one week in Los Angeles. On the way to the event, Lightning impulsively detours from the interstate and - via historic Route 66 - ends up in the bygone town of Radiator Springs, where he is impounded for hot-rodding and is consequently delegated to perform community service by repairing a road he damaged. He also meets new friends who, over time, humble him. The most influential are a sexy Porsche named Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a rusty, redneck tow-truck named Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) and a mentor Hudson named Doc (Paul Newman).<br/><br/>Last year, I wrote a review for Over the Hedge. It wasn't favorable. In fact, it was downright sarcastic, mostly (in my opinion of course) because of its failure to deliver nuggets of humor that all ages could profit from, and for lacking a sense of adventure. After watching Cars, my confirmation of the downward spiral of animated films has been reversed. This is a magnetizing movie that has set a new bar in computerized craftsmanship, right down to the tiny flickers on the burnished cars. It is also charming and simple in character development and in teaching lessons in narcissism, friendship and humility. It plays as if shot with a camera. There are aerials, dissolves, fades, cutaways, pans and reverse angles. The characters are humorous and warm. Cars is not a movie that is occasionally ominous. There are no antagonists that exude doom (The Lion King, The Shrek films). The conflict is McQueen's journey to morally become a better car, which is good enough to take us along for the ride...under clear blue skies and crystal clear starry nights.<br/><br/>Bravo to Pixar for bringing me back to the light! I just pray there won't be a Cars II. Like Finding Nemo, Cars is just fine as a solo entity. I'd hate to see it descend into a botched trilogy as the Shrek story has. What I embraced most about the movie is it takes time to breathe, which, I suspect, won't sit as well with the kids. We see spectacular portraitures of grand desert landscapes, dreamy visions of ""The Mother Road"" Route 66, and best of all, we become intimate with the dusty hamlet of Radiator Springs. At times, we are slowly and comfortably urged to caress a town that once embodied a free nation that no longer exists. Cars should make us wonder, as Americans, why we left behind what once was, to have what we have today. Yes...I believe even an animated tale has the competence and backbone to do just that."

","The latest offering from Pixar is at two different ends of the scale, as it is both a disappointment and a success. Firstly, the disappointment: Pixar has taken a well worn genre (the old dog and rookie upstart routine) and instead of breaking through the barriers that constrict the genre, they have merely allowed themselves to follow its guidelines to a tee. It has thoroughly predictable characters and plot line and, at least to start with, the character of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is annoying and cocky as hell. It's not a good start.<br/><br/>Yet the film still ends up being a success. Why? Well, mainly because it is Pixar  since when have they given us a bad film?  and they know how to make films that last. Cars succeeds because although it stays within its genre constrictions, it plays with them enough to stay entertained. Add in some genuinely funny jokes and the best animation and graphics yet made and it's clear why Pixar still lead the pack in the animated film stakes.<br/><br/>But whilst Cars is a good film, it's not quite up to Pixar's highest standards. Naturally, the animation is staggering and once again resets the bar (how many times has that phrase appeared in reviews this year?!). Yet the story telling is not as refined as you might like. For a start, at two hours long, there is some unnecessary padding that could easily be removed. Also, as mentioned, the storyline is predictable enough so that there are few surprises. This makes the film seem a little more like style over content, which is not what Pixar is about.<br/><br/>The voice cast are all suited to their roles  Owen Wilson does cocky young thing in his sleep, and the use of Paul Newman as grumpy ex-race car Doc Hudson is excellent. Bonnie Hunt is McQueen's love interest Sally, and does her job well, but the problem is none of them seem inspiring or inspired. They're good, and they create a comfortable atmosphere, but not a vocally thrilling one. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) makes most of the jokes, and this adds a great deal to the otherwise straight laced story. The thrills come mostly from the visuals  the races are excellently done  and some neat touches are provided but sly alterations to real life (there are no humans in this world), such as a scene where McQueen and Mater go ""tractor tipping"".<br/><br/>The character of McQueen starts off as annoying, yet we know this is only because the more cocky he is, the greater his inevitable redemption will be. The story pans out as predicted but because of the magic of Pixar it remains thrilling throughout. So, by Pixar's standard, Cars is (hopefully) a minor glitch in their otherwise outstanding record. By the standards of the rest of the CGI films we have been given recently, it still stands at the top of the pile.<br/><br/>Rated: 7.5/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

"jeuneidiot","7","0","1","24 March 2007"," Hey, cars are a lot like people, maybe we could learn from them
","The people at Pixar are geniuses, plain and simple. Part of what makes them so wonderful is their attention to detail. From gravel bouncing along the side of the racetrack as the cars zip by, to the way dust moves when driving on dirt, to the flecks of grime on the car and rust on the fence, each detail is meticulous. They also have an eye for the ironic, tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating humor. It is obvious they enjoy making these films, as only a labor of love can succeed on so many levels.<br/><br/>That said, this isn't my favorite Pixar film as the story, stripped of its humor and auto setting, was less inventive than some. Lightning Mcqueen (Owen Wilson) is a rookie racer and pretty full of himself. He ends up lost in the dying town of Radiator Springs where he finds what he is really made of and falls in love with a hot Porsche. Also, he learns a little something from a former racer, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) who has become bitter with the outside world. Doc softens, Lightning reforms and becomes a kind, compassionate car and succeeds at everything he's ever wanted, queue the happy music. Despite the predictability of the story, the way it was told makes it well worth it. As always, make sure you watch through the end credits.<br/><br/>This movie is like a vanilla éclair. It looks beautiful sitting there on the shelf at the patisserie. The frosting has been applied with care and the éclair arranged just right in the little paper holder. When you take a bite the frosting is just sweet enough, the pastry is crisp and flaky and crumbles away like it should. The filling has the right consistency, but it is vanilla flavored, and the vanilla flavoring is just a bit weaker than you like, and you do prefer chocolate to vanilla, but it's still a good pastry. 7/10<br/><br/>http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
"MrGKB","7","0","1","7 February 2007"," Looks like a Lexus...
","...rides like a Corolla.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that ""Cars"" is a bad movie; it isn't. On the surface, it's exceedingly slick. The CGI animation is superb, a genuine feast for the eyes. The rendering and detail are immaculate. The voice work by notables such as Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, George Carlin, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and John Ratzenberger is excellent. The computer camera-work is, well, thoroughly cinematic, if at times utterly impossible. The storytelling is pure Syd Fields, ably crafted, moving inexorably toward a crowd-pleasing, thematically satisfying finish.<br/><br/>But there's something clunking under the hood, and all of John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft's love of automobiles and the joys of nostalgic motoring can't hide the noise. Simply put, ""Cars"" is the weakest product to roll off Pixar's assembly line so far.<br/><br/>Why? It's hard to put one's finger on the problem, even once you get beyond the glossy surfaces. Part of the trouble is the storyline and themes. Egotistical overachiever learns the value of friendship and teamwork, along with some nostalgia for better days gone by. Nothing out of the ordinary there, I'd have to say, and other than the twist of having sentient vehicles doing the honors, eminently forgettable. In addition, ""Cars"" seems perplexedly aimed at a somewhat older demographic than other Pixar films. There really aren't any characters a young child can identify with; ""Cars"" is decidedly teen/adult fare, with the occasional bodily fluid or excrescence to palliate the juvenile need for fart jokes.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the dramatic stakes are low. Lightning McQueen, Pixar's modern Speed Racer, is delayed from getting to his big race. When he makes it, will he win? Who cares? The audience has so little invested in McQueen that it really doesn't matter if the hotshot race car succeeds or not. In fact, his remarkable refusal to win the Piston Cup is so out of character as to be quite difficult to believe. Certainly no human driver in the world would have done what McQueen did, even in identical circumstances. The moral lesson of ""Cars"" seems downright quaint in this instance, if not outright forced.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, there's one further kink in the ""Cars"" chassis that interests me, and that is its lack of direct connection to the world of humans. Every other Pixar film has it; ""Cars"" doesn't. In fact, the only biological entities in the movie (not counting the flora) appear to be birds, and we see them so fleetingly that we really can't be sure they're not sentient flying machines like the tiny VW bugs. What I'm getting at is that ""Cars"" seemingly begs the question of its own rationale: where did this civilization of sentient vehicles originate and how does it maintain itself? Did humans create this world and then vacate the premises, after some clever terraforming for the aesthetic pleasure of their creations? If the cars don't have passengers, why do they exist in the first place? Mack, the big rig that hauls around McQueen's trailer, gives us a slim hint with his line about ""thank the Manufacturer!"" and Minny sighs, ""Oh, for the love of Chrysler!"" but that's about it. There's also a reference to Jimi Hendrix, along with a soundtrack full of human music, but other than that, humans are non-existent in the film. It's almost maddening if you think about it too much, and perhaps I'm just spinning wheels of pointless speculation. Regardless, for me, it's a noticeable ding in the smooth perfection of the ""Cars"" chassis.<br/><br/>All this may sound like I didn't enjoy ""Cars,"" but nothing could be further from the truth. I saw it on the big screen and had a great time, and finally picked it up on DVD as soon as it became ""last year's model."" To be honest, though, I'll be going back to that DVD more often for the two short features included on it: ""One Man Band,"" a wonderful cartoon with all the hallmarks of ""classic"" stamped all over its running time, and ""Mater and the Ghostlight,"" a turnabout-is-fair-play romp starring the most memorable (and likable) ""Cars"" character.<br/><br/>""Cars"" is definitely worth a watch unless you don't like animation, period, but I have doubts about its long-term mileage, despite the current high ratings here on the IMDb. ""Ratatouille"" looks much better."

","So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles? ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings. It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen. The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices. It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).<br/><br/>Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse. While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town. The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations. It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn't winning the big race).<br/><br/>The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival. There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo. A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman. You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie. Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, ""Cars"" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features. Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile. Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and ""drive"" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip. Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves. For a movie built entirely on driving, ""Cars"" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time. The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to ""drag"" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does. There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter. In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as ""The Great Race,"" ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" as its source of inspiration. Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.<br/><br/>The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film. These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer. But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, ""Cars"" is too often stuck in neutral."
"ShootingShark","7","0","1","4 January 2007"," Eye-Popping Hotshot Racecar In Hillbilly Hell Animation Masterpiece
","In a world of cars, Lightning McQueen is a self-centred young hotshot racecar chasing the prestigious Piston Cup trophy, who gets sidetracked in the small backwoods town of Radiator Springs a week before the race. Serving penance, he gets to know the folks who live there and slowly starts to re-evaluate his priorities and his aspirations.<br/><br/>The plot of Cars is kinda clichéd - big-city careerist finds wisdom and friends in unlikely places - but it's handled with such honesty and compassion it becomes a very touching story. It's an ode to Route 66 and a bygone fifties era of good-natured down-home American hospitality; the idea that the journey is more important than the destination, and was inspired by just such a trip that Lasseter and Ranft took to research the film. The Our Town section in the middle is one of the most wonderfully sweet and touching pieces of animation I've ever seen, and the filmmakers wisely take their time to construct the atmosphere and characters with real depth. The voice cast are great, the real find being redneck comic Larry The Cable Guy / Dan Whitney (who had never done a movie before) as the goofy, good-natured, tractor-tipping tow-truck Mater, who cops all the movie's best lines (""Ah'd give ma left two lug-nuts to work with sumpin' like d'at !"") and of course Newman, whose dramatic gravitas and racing pedigree lend the movie extra credibility. The animation is simply stunning throughout; for my money a watershed of what computer-generated imagery can achieve. Watch the sequence where Big Mack is hauling McQueen on the interstates - there are literally thousands of animated cars, all rendered individually with headlights, reflections, spots and scene lighting, all interacting independently - the quality of this work is amazing. The design of the cars too is simply wonderful - I especially like Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet), Ramone (a 1959 Chevy Impala), Fillmore (a 1960 VW bus), The King (a 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird) and Luigi (a 1959 Fiat 500). There is also a great song score, with standout tracks by Sheryl Crow and James Taylor, and many many hilarious moments, particularly the car-related pastiche of previous Pixar films in the end-credits. Several stars of motor sport feature in the movie, notably Richard Petty / The King (the most decorated Nascar racer of all time), Darrell Waltrip / Darrell Cartrip, and seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher. Tragically, co-director / writer / voice-actor Ranft was killed in a car crash in 2005, prior to the movie's release. A multi-talented filmmaker and highly respected storyboard man for Disney and Pixar, Cars represents the very best of his artistic genius, and is a fabulously entertaining film for everyone to enjoy."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","1","1 January 2007"," Great animation, but feels too long
","This animated film is about a race car being trapped in a small town when he is on his way to an important race. He makes a lot of new friends along the journey, and learns that life is not just about winning.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent in the film. Owen Wilson does a great job to bring the Lightning McQueen character alive, as he is lively and happy all the time. The car chases are well composed throughout, but I must say watching car chases for two hours gets rather boring. The ending is touching and inspiring, as Lightning McQueen learns about what is important in life. If the film was a just 90 minutes long, it would have been an excellent family movie."
"monoptic","10","0","1","31 December 2006"," This is how movies should be done
","I absolutely adore ""Cars"". I saw this movie solely on the strength of the few seconds that I saw of its UK trailer, the main focus of my interest being the computer graphics.<br/><br/>At a purely aesthetic level, there is not a single frame of this whole film that is not fabulous to look at, you can hit pause at virtually any point on the DVD and just sit and gaze at the stunning detail and gloss. ""Slick"" doesn't even come close to describing it.<br/><br/>But is SO much more than that.<br/><br/>Anyway, to the plot. This is a film you can really absorb yourself into, all the characters are well-formed and fit into the big picture well. There are no 'bad-guys' as such but those characters that are at odds with the main characters do get whats coming to them in the end, in a fun way of course. There is no violence in this film whatsoever APART from the realistic depiction of race-car collisions which is executed superbly I think.<br/><br/>All in all this is a brilliant feel-good movie that adults can enjoy as much as the kids (probably more than the kids to be honest, there are MANY visual and verbal gags throughout). I'm a 26 year old Brit and this (supposedly kid's) movie about NASCAR racing (something virtually alien to us over here) had me enthralled for the entire duration.<br/><br/>There are a lot of emotions in this movie too, its exciting, sad, very funny, and beautiful from start to finish, ending with a really uplifting positive note.<br/><br/>The casting is spot on too - as you'd expect from Pixar by now.<br/><br/>At the end of the DVD you'll be pouring over the extra features just to get an extra fix.<br/><br/>I loved every second of it."

","I'm beginning to thing that Pixar doesn't know that such words as ""bad"" or ""mediocre"" exist... The characters were excellent, the humor, both adult and child was excellent, the plot was beautiful... Cinematography was beautiful. The acting was spot-on. The music and the animations themselves were incredible. It's a bummer that I'm restricted to 1,000 words...<br/><br/>The characters of cars are incredibly well done. Each car, each voice, each store - everything felt like it had a history behind it, unlike many of Disney's current films, which generally seem to be drenched in superficiality and their characters, albeit traditional, are too stereotypical. Pixar has in every one of their films created memorable characters such as Mater, McQueen, and Sally; yet in each film the characters remain brilliantly unique and captivating. You can't forget how Mater is like a ""Ta-mater, 'cept without the 'Ta'"", or how McQueen is changed by the town, and the Cars in the town are changed by McQueen. The characters are so excellently entwined in the storyline that the plot IS the characters and their relationships. The small elements of the film brought it to life even more, such as the flies being cars, or the characters replacing common human lingo with ""car lingo"", or the tire marbles from the car tires. I thought the movie was excellent - one of the best that Pixar's done, thanks to the unforgettable characters and the extremely beautiful and lifelike animations. Even though Pixar's movies can't really be fairly compared to one another because they are each so different, I call cars their best film yet! Undoubtedly, if I could name a ""Film of the Year"", Cars would be that film."

But actually, a lot more come out then I expected! I'd say that the theatre was half full, and there were some younger viewers attending to watch the movie at this hour. Eventually this movie turned out great, with it's humor, the racing action, and references to Nascar and other car movies that includes ""Days of thunder,"" and ""The fast and the furious.""

"MaxBorg89","8","0","2","22 December 2006"," Not the best of the Pixar movies, but nonetheless an above-the-average animated hit
","Cars, Pixar's seventh feature-length picture, sees the return behind the camera of John Lasseter, the animation guru who gave us Toy Story, its sequel and A Bug's Life. Like the latter, Cars is slightly sub-par if compared to the rest of Pixar's production, mostly because of the not so original story.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a cocky race car (his last name is a reference to an animator, though one could easily think of Steve McQueen as well) who has finally received the opportunity of a lifetime: to compete in the Piston Cup final against the current champion and another fame-obsessed vehicle, the obnoxious Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). While he's trying to reach the city where the race is held, however, Lightning gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town that has been forgotten for a long time. Since he caused some damage while attempting to get back on the highway, he's forced to stay there and fix the mess. As time goes by, our hero will realize life isn't all about winning, a lesson learned with the help of former champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).<br/><br/>Technically speaking, Cars is an amazing film, with an attention to detail rarely seen in family movies. Some shots are even so realistic it almost looks like a live-action feature rather than a cartoon (the opening sequence has a really palpable tension). Being this Pixar, there are also the usual funny in-jokes (a brilliant scene spoofing Toy Story, A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc.) and clever voice casting, in particular Jeremy Piven, who basically reprises his Emmy-winning Entourage role (minus the swearing, of course), playing McQueen's agent, and Paul Newman, once again (see The Color of Money) playing the wise mentor who makes the protagonist discover the true values of life (and let's not forget the sports-linked celebrity cameos, such as F1 champion Michael Schumacher playing a Ferrari). Still, there's a little something missing, that unique Pixar touch that made other movies totally unpredictable. The romance between Lightning and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) feels like a deja vu, as does his friendship with the hilarious Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and by the time he enters the race he's been pursuing the whole time it's quite easy to figure out what's gonna happen next (A Bug's Life, while very enjoyable, suffered from a similar script-related issue). This minor flaw prevents Cars from being an instant classic, but it remains an exhilarating experience, and those who truly appreciate good animation will have a great time watching it."
"strider38","9","0","2","19 December 2006"," Definitely one to watch again
","When I was asked if I would see this, I had my doubts. In fact, I didn't go. I stayed home and watched my Abbott and Costello, thinking Pixar was on its last legs. I didn't see it until is came out on DVD, then I gave it the benefit of a doubt. And am I glad.<br/><br/>The morals in this story seem slightly ""We've seen all this before"" and it is partly true. Where the themes being to think of others before yourself, that accomplishments need to be more than just ""an empty cup,"" and all that jazz about who your real friends are, the usual. But the much-used morals, the kind that in the end give you goose bumps, are fully made up for by the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The animation is the traditional Pixar Perfect, of course. Although some are saying that the characters are not well developed, and as alive as the car in your garage, I disagree. The way the animation was done makes them look lively, and their voice actors did a good job in making them sound human. Not to mention the characters develop rather nicely, considering all they had to work with were cars.<br/><br/>Where some people find the humor is ""Cars"" to be without much taste, much of it being bad car puns and such, I find it enjoyable, there being some older humor, and some younger, making a good combination of laughs.<br/><br/>I find ""Cars"" to be a film that adults can watch with their kids without thinking that it is too fuzzy, or finding themselves clicking the remote to find out how much longer there is to go. I can promise you that you will enjoy it, despite your age or attention span."

The creation of characters is so amazing that few minutes into the movie you stop thinking of them as cars, and start thinking of them as people. The landscapes, the animation (just see the water splash on McQueen. It's AMAZING), everything in this movie yells excellence. In the second place, this movie will live with me because it's the first movie I took my daughter to see in the theater.

","Pixar was on a roll but this one seems too focused on one group--NASCAR fans. It's cute and clever and all but the first 5 mins of cars going round and round a track lost me despite the comic asides.<br/><br/>The flick only really takes off when McQueen gets off the beaten path and ends up in Radiator Springs. The characters come to life then but I kept thinking the Hudson Hornet was really Paul Newman reprising Judge Roy Bean. The whole small town everyone knows each other thing has been done to death and it does work. The whole ""Route 66"" nostalgia was fine but, let's be honest, folks, Route 66 as a concept is pretty hokey and there is a reason that it died. It's not just due to the Interstate passing these towns by.<br/><br/>Anyway, the flick is fun but it's no Toy Story or Monsters, Inc. It's more in the Bug's Life vein as a great looking concept but the story lacks a lot. Pixar can't always hit a home run with every release."

","This was definitely a good movie. Kept me smiling and laughing all the way through. Not only was the acting (voices) good, there was actually a moral of the story: don't lose yourself in all the fame and glory, and don't forget your friends, or how you got there. And it had a happy ending, which is always good. Especially for a comedy, it's got to have a good ending otherwise what was the point in watching the movie? Out of all the characters, Mater was my favorite. They picked the perfect person to do the voice for him, Larry the Cable Guy. He didn't have to create an accent or anything, that's how he really is. This movie is good on so many levels, for adults or kids alike. But what I really like is that all the characters in the movie were vehicles. The audience at the races, the pit crews, the lost couple and even the bugs. And when it came to the Tractor Tipping, I couldn't stop laughing. At first I thought the scene was out of place but it wasn't. Then the small movie with Mater and the Blue Light and the Screaming Banshee, was definitely something to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and likes movies that make you feel good afterwards. I've heard rumors about them making a sequel, I say no. Leave a good thing alone. Let Cars stand alone and leave the sequel in the dust."

On his way to try and find Mack again McQueen gets lost and end up causing a lot of damage in a town called Radiator Springs.The town, as a punishment make McQueen redo the road as he has pulled the entire road up. First of McQueen hates the town and does the road really quickly, so he can get to California quicker, but he ends up doing it again as he has left it all bumpy. After a couple of days McQueen begins to like Radiator Springs and Find's a friend in Mater (Cable Guy) and a love interest in sally (Hunt), but he still has one thing on his mind, The piston cup, will he be able to make it in time and will he be able to win the race, even without the help of his new friends. Once again Pixar have produced another good movie. The animation of the movie is superb and after a while, you actually begin to fell that the cars are actually real people. All ages will enjoy this movie as it has lots of different qualities to it, and also the jokes, can be understood by many ages. Also, the all star cast really brings this movie to life and makes you almost fell part of the story. Also the way the character looks gives you an idea of their personality and what type of car they are. This Movie has lots of different morals to it such as ""Don't Judge a book, by its cover"" ""Doing the right thing a losing is better than doing the wrong thing and winning"" and ""Don't drive while you are tired"". Although this movie is not as good as Toy Story and the Animation is not as good as Finding Nemo it is still a very good Movie and a Great Family Film."
"Robert_duder","8","0","2","24 July 2006"," Cute but a step down from the usual Pixar/Disney Masterpieces
","Cars seems to be all the rage right now and that's awesome!! For me though I admit I was a little disappointed considering Pixar films have always scored at least a 9/10 on my scale. Cars didn't quite capture the usual magic of say The Incredibles or Over The Hedge. First and foremost it dragged a little long being two hours is a quite a feat for Pixar animated film. I'm not sure that it needed to be that long and the middle of the film dragged significantly. I think that really was one of the major things that dragged Cars down. On top of that despite a really cute and interesting supporting cast the main character of Lightning McQueen wasn't as strong as he needed to be. While it's important and a Disney specialty to have an interesting supporting cast they shouldn't outshine the lead character and they do for certain!!<br/><br/>Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen, the hot shot race car rookie that ends up getting lost on his trek to the next big race. Wilson's voice is strong and fits McQueen well but the character is written with a bit of an understatement to him. He gets overshadowed by the supporting cast that has a lot more personality than McQueen. Paul Newman is terrific as Doc (in perhaps the veteran actors last role??) You can practically see Newman in the old, grumpy, and gruff former race car. The car's personality fits Newman's typical role perfectly. I admit one of the greatest moments in the film is in the last race scene when you hear Doc's voice over Lightning's pit crew head set...almost got me choked up. Bonnie Hunt is Lightning McQueen's romantic leading Porsche, Sally. I didn't recognize Hunt's voice at first but she does a terrific job voicing the intelligent and caring Sally. Larry The Cable Guy turns out probably the definitive Cars performance as lovable if not slightly missing a few bolts Mater. Mater is adorable and sincere and I thought Larry The Cable Guy's performance would annoy me like he does but he was just awesome!! Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Guido Quaroni, Jenifer Lewis, John Ratzenberger and Michael Keaton all provide their voices to various supporting members that are all terrific. The small town of Radiator Springs is endearing and the perfect contrast to Lightning McQueen's fast paced, revving personality.<br/><br/>I found Cars to be significantly slower paced than previous Pixar installments but it is true that characters and setting grow on you. I'm still not sure the film needed to be as long as it was. Still the story is there, the characters are undeniably cute and watchable and the Disney Moral of the story is still in tact. I can see why kids find themselves drawn to the characters each one being so different from the other and every person can find their favorites (Doc and Mater are my tops!!) Cars is absolutely one you should see, there is nothing over whelmingly disappointing about it, I'm just not sure adults will find it as entertaining as some of the other Pixar films as of recently. I don't mean to downplay the film, I just have to review it like I see it and although it has some major plus's Cars doesn't quite match some of it's predecessors. However my beautiful girl Sarah would vehemently disagree as she adored the film!! Cheers to her newest fave ;) 8/10"
"moutonbear25","7","0","1","8 July 2006"," Pixar on cruise control
","CARS Written and Directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranft<br/><br/>The crowd is uproarious. The stadium is practically shaking. Two checkered flags are waved and they're off  to a sad and unfortunately slow start. I say ""unfortunate"" because I am speaking of Pixar Animation Studio's seventh feature, CARS, and the Pixar name usually ensures sophistication, wit and insight in addition to awe-inspiring, revolutionary animation. Further to that, it usually means a darn good time but CARS drags its wheels, leading me to think Pixar might be due for a good tune-up. The problem is not with the quality of the animation, which bursts out straight away in the opening sequence. We are introduced to Lightning McQueen (voiced by the ever laid back, Owen Wilson), a spunky red sports car with a lot of scattered energy to burn and not enough experience or patience to see things through to the finish. He cruises past the rest of his competitors as he races for the Piston Cup, the highest achievement in race-car driving. The arena lights blare down on to the track and into our eyes as the cheers from the stands erupt to deafening new heights. Everything is as it should be but for one jarring detail. The patrons that fill the stands are other cars. Yes, people go to watch other people race against each other but this is a world inhabited by nothing but cars. It's like ""Planet of the Cars"" and directors John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft do very little to ground this reality. And yes, it's an animated film but I couldn't get past wondering how the cars managed to build the stadium and all the roads leading up to in the first place.<br/><br/>While on his way to another race in another town, Lightning gets lost and ends up arrested, or in this case impounded, in a middle-of-nowhere town after accidentally tearing up their road. He is sentenced to repairing the road before he can leave. Here he meets an expectedly colourful group of cars that run through a gamut of stereotypes, from the hippie minibus to the military standard hard-ass to the pimp-my-ride 59 Chevy. I have never seen the folks at Pixar deliver such one-dimensional three-dimensional characters. There is no good reason that these cars would inhabit the same town and so why would we even be there? The only resident that seems like he belongs there is a tow-truck by the name of Mater (as in to-mater). Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, Mater is the dimwitted naïf who unknowingly bestows wisdom upon others. He is hilarious without realizing and is the most believable element of this film.<br/><br/>The clichés don't stop at the characters either. The moral foundation of CARS focuses on being in too much of a hurry to get nowhere in particular. Upon being forced to slow down, Lightning learns that there is more to life than winning races and scoring cool sponsorships. When you aren't speeding down the highway, you can see the cars around you and maybe even become their friend or fall in love. Lightning brings some much needed life to this dreary waste of a town and the inhabitants show him a thing or two about loyalty and the simpler pleasures that come from standing still. A good chunk of this lesson comes from Lightning's love interest, Sally (a coy Bonnie Hunt), a car who studied law and climbed the corporate ladder before she realized she had no idea who she was. Ordinarily, I would find these themes engaging but cars are built for speed, not for taking the time to smell the motor oil. <br/><br/>The beauty of a Pixar film is best exhibited in their 1998 offering, A BUG'S LIFE. The ants and circus bugs that make up the majority of the characters have personality that more than makes up for the lack of time to develop them all. More importantly, the bug world is believable because it co-exists with a human world, bringing light to a universe that we ignorant humans don't even know is right beneath our feet. Even the entirely unreal monsters of MONSTERS INC have doorways that lead to an earthly plain. CARS had an inherently huge obstacle to get past from the start line but instead of pushing harder, Lasseter and Ranft left CARS on cruise control. The result is more a casual Sunday drive then a high speed race  enjoyable and pleasant but lacking purpose and drive."

","Well, what can we say? It's Doc Hollywood on wheels.<br/><br/>Only not quite. The Michael J. Fox original was the story of a lone man with no soul, who was kindly provided one by the inhabitants of small-town America. It's about the development of an individual.<br/><br/>Pixars' Cars, on the other hand, is the story of a small town in need of re-energizing, which is kindly provided an infusion of energy by a lone man..er, car. It's about the development of a community.<br/><br/>This difference affects not only the individual characterizations, but the overall thrust of the narrative, the humor, even the artwork. The foreground characters sometimes disappear into vast landscapes, particularly during an extended middle digression of some ten or so minutes in which Sally Porsche, our heroine, introduces Lightning McQueen to the virtues of small town life, meandering along Route 66, quaint hotels, and the painted desert.<br/><br/>For all its occasional preachiness about the glories of small-town life, and the need for inspiring heroes are good by virtue of their character rather than their athleticism, at no time is your heart in danger here: there's nothing like the poignancy of Buzz Lightyear's fall in Toy Story, much less Jesse's reminiscence scene in Toy Story 2. There's not even the real tension and family feeling of Finding Nemo. Cars don't have families, and struggle though they have to personalize these mechanisms, the Pixar animators simply can't add the rough physicality necessary to convey broad emotion to something which has to keep 4 wheels on the ground. It's fine popcorn fare, sometimes amusing, and harmless fun."

","Walking into CARS was like opening the door into the past and reliving those Dominican festivals of corn: a contest consisting of virtually hundreds of corn-made confections and dishes, some sweet, some salty, some spicy, some thick with butter and cheese and chocolate, others with little more than the grain itself. CARS is one of these confections: a movie that is so drenched in displaced sentimentalism given to machines that it gives even the most shameless incursion into schmaltz seem like an experiment in Kubrickesque storytelling. It is tailor made for corn, for emotions, for the family, for pummeling its message with the subtlety of an A-Bomb. Anyone feeling surprised at the plot developments ought to be shot on sight and thrown into the nearest gutter. This one of the sweetest, corniest movies I've come across, so corny that when I took in its visuals I reeled back and caught myself nearly passing out. I then thought about the one fat mouse telling Ratatouille in the promo for next Spring's movie of the same name ""If you can get past the gag reflex, it's not that bad,"" as he munched away at his grayish ball of... something, leaving Ratatouille even more determined to find great food in Paris even at the cost of his own life. And then there were moments when my corn-trip became real: I know it sounds like I lost my mind, but rivulets of butterscotch, peppercorn, and Mazola oil came flying out of the screen, engulfing the audience and myself as I sat near the door but could not make for it since I was firmly planted on my seat, being drowned in Life's Precious Lessons -- the Moral of the Story. It became hard to breathe and for a second or two I caught myself choking and sobbing a little. I counted the tears -- two of them, neatly creeping down my cheeks. And then the movie was over. Of course, when I met my friend for dinner, reeking of corn, she asked me, ""So what did you watch today?"" I told her, ""CARS."" She asked me, ""And...?"" I said, ""I absolutely loved it. It's fake as a pair of silicone tomatoes on your average Californian wannabe actress/model, pre-planned and pre-packaged in advance, but I loved it."" Of course, she didn't believe me for one second, but there it is. I do. I like it. Even if five people wrote the screenplay, and it runs just short of two hours, and the opening sequence, ""One Man Band,"" is as marvelously cynical as CARS is a portentuous pile of ho-hum. So sue me, I bought it like a clotheshorse on a shopping spree at a designer store packed with fabulous sales."
"sullibrandon","6","0","1","29 June 2006"," A Worthy Addition to the Pixar Library
","Pixar has done something that no other animation company has done in this day and age: created a string of six solid hits that have satisfied audiences and critics alike by giving critics the quality movies they crave, and audiences the captivating stories they desire. Whenever a Pixar movie comes out, the question is not, ""Will it be good?"" it is ""How good will it be?"" With Cars, rest assured, the answer is ""Very good."" The movie opens with a ridiculously fast race track scene that is animated to perfection. Lightning McQueen is our protagonist, though by no means is he a likable one. He is snobby, rude, and just plain mean. He ties the race, and he and the two other contestants must race it out in California a week later. On his way to the race, though, McQueen, due to his sleeping chauffeur Mack, gets diverted to the small town of Radiator Springs, where he must stay and fix the road that he destroyed in his attempt to escape from the town cop, who had caught him speeding.<br/><br/>Though the movie is a bit slow in building up to Lightning's entrance into the town, once he sets foot, um, I mean tire, into the town it is smooth cruisin' from then on. Pixar could have easily gone wrong here, by inserting a town full of cliché one-note hicks. Instead of this, though, we are introduced to a delightfully eclectic host of instantly lovable vehicles. Character development is one of Cars 'great strengths. Lightning's transformation from an uncaring big city race to car to someone we can actually care about is completely believable.<br/><br/>CGI is another one of Cars' strengths. Since Toy Story was released in 1995, the animation in Pixar's films has done nothing but continually grow. Each film builds upon the triumphs of the previous one, and the wonderful thing is, they are never the same. They have gone from toys, to bugs, to monsters, to fish, to superheroes, and now to cars. (And next year to rats, judging from the tantalizing trailer of Ratatouille.) Cars is just beautiful, the kind of beauty that makes you sit back in your seat and go wow. Most, if not all, of the scenery in cars is so wonderfully pulled off that it looks completely believable, with just a touch of Pixar's movie-making magic.<br/><br/>Here is another strength of Cars: The entire movie wasn't one big car joke. There were lots of smaller jokes and only two or three times in the whole movie was the joke funny because it was a car. (Though the tractor tipping was pretty amazing.) Other movies may have focused so much on the fact that these characters are cars, but with this movie, the fact that they are cars is just there, and is not a main point. There are fun visuals because of the fact they are cars, but by no means is that all there is to it.<br/><br/>Now for the flaws. Unfortunately, even counting all of Cars' great strengths, it is the worst of the Pixar films. The story itself is cliché right from the beginning. Though it is, admittedly, superbly pulled off, it never manages to make us forget that we are seeing the traditional big city guy comes to town and learns to love story. Another flaw is the large cast of characters. With over fifteen cars in Radiator Springs, not counting Lightning, Mack, and other cars that make appearances, there seems to be a crowding of the stage at times. The four main characters, Lightning, Sally, Hudson, and Mater, are all given due screen time and character development focus, but occasionally they seem to fight for screen time with some of the rest of the cast. The score of the film is generically underwhelming also; it lacks any distinctive quality at all. With previous Pixar films, the score and songs were distinctive. With Cars, it just seems like less time was spent working on it - annoying drawling country songs abound.<br/><br/>On the whole, my thesis remains: Cars is a very good movie. Solid script, solid visuals, and, actually, solid voice acting too. Owen Wilson as Lightning was questionable, but he turned out to be perfect. I completely forgot I was listening to Owen Wilson's voice coming out of a race car. And, as usual, Pixar has made the credits into a sort of mini-movie. Stick around during them, and you will be treated to car versions of Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Monsters Inc. They are simply hilarious. There is a little something after all the credits are over, too. Go see Cars. It is entertaining for both kids and adults, it has really cool CGI, and it teaches a valuable life lesson. What more could you want in a summer movie? Don't say Johnny Depp."

","Pixar done it again, Seven movies in a row and no flops in sight for me. The name Pixar is now synonymous with good story, great computer animation and overall entertaining entertainment for all ages and definitely worth buying a cinema ticket for.<br/><br/>I didn't have high hopes for this one and was worried that Cars might be the first ""not so good one"". The first half was quite a drag with the characterization build up that I thought it's my worst fear coming true. But then from the second half, it builds its momentum and race to the magical and touching ending.<br/><br/>Even tho It has all the predictable element for a kid movie but with Pixar, it will still makes you fall in love with the characters n storyline.<br/><br/>and It's not hard to see why John Lasseter was inspired to write this film after taking a break (a road trip with his family) from his hectic work. The way Lightning McQueen was blazing up in the race circuit was pretty much like John Lasseter's raise in the animation world. During the quest to be number one, one could easily forgotten what is really important and the importance of slowing down. Like any Road Trip, it's not the destination that matters but the journey, specially with your love ones."

","The movie ""Cars"" is very well done, and in typical Disney fashion, manages to tug a few heart strings and stir up feelings that almost bring a tear to one's eye - more from a feeling of well-being (the Aaaaww factor). However, halfway through the movie I realized that this is ""DOC Hollywood"" (starring Michael J. Fox) in animated form. The characters, the situation, the characters Lightning McQueen meets (with the exception of the pig) are so similar. Of course, there is no race in Doc Hollywood, but then, some of the situations like the way the race ends (that comes from the Great Race) and the sacrifice Lightning makes for the King (from Stallone's Driven)made for a pretty predictable ending. Oh well, it's still pretty entertaining and the animation captures the personalities of Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable guy and Paul Newman well, although I couldn't visualize Bonnie Hunt as Sally."

","I hope I can make this review brief, as in-depth summary and cumbersome film-making terminology would burden the less endowed. You've probably heard some negative press on Cars maybe in the form of bad reviews, but those people have no idea what they're talking about. Avoid them. <br/><br/>Simply put, Cars is great, but also has it's share of problems. Car's most impressive attribute is it's charm. Each shot in the movie is chock full of fun. Whether it's the amazing performance of Larry the Cable Guy as the lovable Mater, or cute jokes - the movie is lovable. The jokes are funny, and there's enough to entertain adults too. The animation and cinematography is unparalleled. The movie doesn't feel like a cheap rip-off like other studios *cough* DreamWorkds *cough cough*. Some would argue that this is a biased review, or 'fanboyish', but nothing could be farther from the truth. Cars isn't perfect. It's hard to compare Cars to The Incredibles or Finding Nemo, because the tone of each movie is vastly different. Cars is more of a 'moral' story, and a fun, charming movie. That is the movie's strength, and greatest weakness. Cars lacks a big sacrifice. There are twists and turns on Route 66, and little 'gives' but no big price to be paid. Although charming and heart- warming, it's not heart-wrenching in the way Toy Story 2 was, Nemo was, or the Incredibles was. The characters gleam and glisten, but hardly get scratched- internally or externally. The movie needed a nip and a tuck in it's pacing, a bigger sacrifice, and some more interaction between Lightning and Sally which holds it back from greatness. Timeless and fun, yes, but it will never be seen as better than The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. However, all in all, Cars is one hell of a ride."
"majikstl","8","0","3","19 June 2006"," Make and model citizens
","The sad reality is that the great American car has lost the one thing that made it most appealing: personality. Even as their commercials brag about the ""distinctive styling"" of this model or that one, it is painfully obvious that from the late sixties on, most cars look pretty much alike. Forced to shed their fins and their chrome and even their bumpers, little by little automobiles have become stylistically interchangeable, save for a Gremlin here or a P.T. Cruiser there being bold enough to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>I suspect that we have an entire generation of children who did not get to grow up looking at the new fall models and fantasizing about how human they looked. With wide radiator smiles, bearing chrome-plated teeth, and round, bulging headlight eyes with hypnotic stares, each car represented a sinister visage of devilish adventure or a teasing grin of motorized freedom. Today, look at the front of most cars and they resemble nothing more than a dead fish -- small gaping radiator mouths with flat, dead streamlined headlight eyes. Even models that have been resurrected from the dead -- the Ford Thunderbird and the Volkswagen Beetle -- are less reborn than merely zombified shells of their former selves, stripped down to banality.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is not all that surprising that most of the stars of Pixar's CARS are older models, representing bits and pieces of our automotive past. The premise of this animated fantasy is that the world has evolved so that the human and the motorized are now one and the automobiles that rule have both human personalities and human-like dexterity. In the story, racecar Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a superstar jock whose arrogant self-absorption is tested when he detours off the interstate onto the famed Route 66 and is forced to experience life in the slow lane. In the dusty, yet folksy and conveniently culturally diverse, desert town of Radiator Springs, he meets a variety of vehicles who teach him the meaning of life. It's sort of THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS meets Frank Capra. The film's message about stopping to smell the gas fumes isn't exactly Detroit fresh -- we've traveled this road before.<br/><br/>So the film is less about story and more about personality. And Radiator Springs certainly isn't short on personality, albeit stereotypical personalities. The local tow truck (a '50's Chevy Cameo) is a country rube (Larry the Cable Guy); the town father is a gruff but wise '51 Hudson (Paul Newman); the spaced out 1960 VW hippie van has the hippy-dippy voice of George Carlin , etc. All the citizens of the town have distinct automotive stylings matched by distinct (and obvious) voices.<br/><br/>Some of the casting in CARS is inspired, though, of course, one can quibble. For instance, with a name like Sally there must have been an impulse to cast a Ford Mustang in the role of Lightning's love interest. Certainly, lyrics like ""Mustang Sally, think you better slow your mustang down"" would seem appropriate for one who down shifts from freeway to blacktop. Though perhaps there is a sexual subtext to the Wilson Pickett song that Pixar wished to avoid, thus Sally is a Porsche, even though she has the all-American voice of Bonnie Hunt. Likewise, while a sleek 1959 Chevrolet Impala is perfectly acceptable as the low-riding Ramón (Cheech Marin), a '58 model would have been far more photogenic. And there is much to be said for the distinctive styling of the 1951 Hudson Hornet as the retired racing great Doc, yet I think casting the role with an equally legendary '56 Chrysler 300 would have added a great deal more elegance and stature to the part.<br/><br/>The role of Lightning is more problematic. Based vaguely on a Ford GT racer, the star of the film seems too generic; and maybe that is the point, that McQueen is so superficial his personality is no deeper than his pasted-on fake headlights. The film has the right idea when Lightning gets a temporary make over to resemble a ""Route 66""-styled Corvette. Indeed, Lightning McQueen would be so much more appealing played by a Corvette -- or a Shelby Cobra or a gullwing Mercedes Benz 300SL, or even a Volkswagen Beetle (but then his name would have to be changed to Herbie!).<br/><br/>And then there is the controversy over windshield eyes versus headlight eyes. By placing the eyes in the windshield, Pixar, no doubt, made it easier for the animators to play with expressions. But, I think there is something creepy about having two peepers floating around inexplicably in a rectangular sea of white. It's like some alien form floating around in an automotive helmet. Plus, on many of the cars, you get the illusion of their being four eyes on the car's ""face."" This fleet of vehicles are undeniably cute, but Chevron's famous spokescars in their commercials had so much more personality.<br/><br/>Though a tad too long, CARS is still worthy of a spin around the park. It is cute enough for kids and satirical enough for adults and it is steeped in an American Graffiti sense of nostalgia for a fading bit of the landscape. And it is sweetly devoid of road rage, taking the scenic route and not the cynic route."

As typical high-quality Disney material, the characters were rich with personality and emotions. As always, the talented writers, actors and director knew how appeal to the adults (especially those who merely are the 'chaperones') as well as to bring it down to a level for children to relate to. So much that I even CRIED twice during this animated cartoon!!! (of course I pretended to stretch while quickly wiping the tears with the swish of my sleeve) I fully recommend this movie - however, even though this was a movie my 3yr old enjoyed and sat through - the middle of the movie was slower paced, no racing fast cars. Also, the trailers added another 20 minutes to the whole movie experience, so if your child has short attention span, you might want to wait until trailers are ending before sitting down. The trailers were also pretty scary too - there was one trailer for a movie about a possessed house that trapped and ate anything that was nearby, scaring the crap out of the really young ones."

","I enjoyed this movie very much. I also plan to see this again. Lasseter and Pixar have both given me years of pleasure, so I think they deserve my honest opinion, though I'm not a voice that can sway the opinion of thousands (I think I can influence two, my sons, but even my authority there is not that secure). So while I DID enjoy the movie, there is a ""but"", and I'm stating this but because I do care, and because I do hope that Lasseter (and Pixar) would go on and do better things, because, in a nutshell, I think they have, and I think they should try again, though in the next movie.<br/><br/>So far, I think my favorite Pixar movie is The Incredibles, and the reason for that might be attributable to bringing in an outsider, Brad Bird, to write and direct it.<br/><br/>Since it's John Lasseter's first chance to direct since Toy Story 2, I think he learned one thing from his friend Brad and his idol, Miyazake, and it's the wrong thing too. He learned to make his movie longer.<br/><br/>The difference is, Bird's tale is pretty epic, with an out-sized villain, a flawed hero and his fantastic four family, and inspired supporting characters (I wanna be Edna Mode!).<br/><br/>Miyazake also has plenty to tell and his movies don't feel tedious. In fact they're perfectly paced at two hours, usually thirty or more minutes longer than typical American animated movies.<br/><br/>I don't know but I suspect Lasseter here had the same problem Jackson had with Kong. It's a labor of love and no one was about to tell them to their face, no, this or that decision is wrong.<br/><br/>I think they should take more risks. Incredibles was risky, but over time it still seems conservative, almost a safe bet. It's the least Pixar of the Pixars and it has plenty of things that make it not just my favorite Pixar, my favorite animated film, but also my favorite Superhero film, whether live or animated.<br/><br/>Miyazake, it can be argued, has not been taking risks lately, recycling characters and designs from previous movies. However, his latest, Howl's Moving Castle, has plenty to say about old age, and that's not a very commercial idea. His Spirited Away might rehash his usual themes of flight, pro-environmentalism, thinking of enemies as not-enemies, but I can't deny he still tells the story with exhilaration, as if he just woke up to these ideas the day before. He hasn't made a tired, ""phoned in"" movie yet. Before that, his Hime Mononoke is angry and violent, a protest against how we people think of the world as our personal toilet and concubine, to abuse as we see fit.<br/><br/>The variety of his stories have decreased. Critics would say he's lost his nerve. I would interpret it as being more ""focused"".<br/><br/>Lasseter, of the oddball humor, the perfectly paced story and the gentle, idiosyncratic characters, will have to reach further and risk his box office appeal if he wants to take the next step and grow as an artist."
