","I haven't seen an M. Night Shyamalan movie since ""Signs"", although I've heard each was worse than the previous ones. Strangely, this gave me hope that ""The Happening"" would be a turning point for the director that had won so much acclaim with ""Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>Sadly, this isn't the case. ""The Happening"" is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in a theater, and is a strong contender for the worst I've seen altogether. I've never even written an IMDb review before, but felt compelled to write one for this movie.<br/><br/>1) The acting is horrible. Sometimes you go to a movie and the cast has one lousy actor in it. This was the opposite. The entire cast is uniformly bad, with the possible exception of a construction worker in the beginning watching his buddies plummet to their deaths. These performances are a hallmark of poor direction. I know that Wahlberg, Deschanel, and Leguizamo can actually turn in good work under the right director.<br/><br/>2) Almost no one seems to react to what's going on around them in a realistic way. Only one person (practically an extra) ever really freaks out. Everyone else just kind of bumbles along until the wind catches up to them.<br/><br/>3) The premise is ridiculous. Supposedly, the plants are tired of us polluting the environment and mowing the grass, so they decide to start releasing toxins that cause humans to go insane and kill themselves. There are a few massive problems with this.<br/><br/>First, the movie presents evolution as something that occurs within the lifetimes of organisms, when it actually takes many thousands of generations. Trees haven't had any time at all to evolve that kind of defense mechanism, and grass isn't particularly concerned about being mowed. Otherwise, it would have evolved a toxin to kill off grazing animals thousands of years ago.<br/><br/>Second, the movie makes it seem as if the plants can somehow consciously communicate with each other. Although plants do indeed send out chemical signals, these signals are not under any kind of conscious control.<br/><br/>Third, the movie mixes up plant defenses with ecological phenomena such as algae blooms. Algae blooms occur when a variety of factors all converge to provide an ideal environment for overgrowth of algae. The algae population cannot sustain such large levels and eventually the excess dies off. Plant chemical defenses are not remotely similar. If a species of plants evolves a defense mechanism, all future descendants will have it, and it will continue working indefinitely. If such a mechanism appeared in grass, it would eventually make its way across the country. The effect wouldn't magically stop working just in time to save the protagonists of the story.<br/><br/>Finally, it doesn't make much sense for a ""toxin"" to cause suicides. That kind of behavioral alteration is usually seen in the reproductive cycles of parasites that infect their hosts' nervous systems. Plant defenses are either poisons (such as nicotine) or chemical signals that attract predators to hunt the plant's attackers.<br/><br/>4) By the way, the ""antagonists"" are plants. Although this could have been made to work somewhat like ""Andromeda Strain"", Shyamalan decided to add a bunch of foreboding shots of plant-life. It isn't easy to make trees and grass look evil, so wind kicked up each time people are about to die. The toxin would accumulate more in still air, so you'd be better off waiting for the wind to blow past you. Leave it to a science teacher to miss this point and make sure everyone ""stays ahead of the wind"".<br/><br/>5) The score is ham-fisted and overbearing.<br/><br/>6) So is the dialog.<br/><br/>7) There is no ""twist"". A random character we never care about reveals the cause of the mass suicides sometime in the middle of the movie, and he's exactly right. I was hoping the real cause would be the creepy lady at the end who hates the outside world, but alas no; she becomes a victim just like everyone else.<br/><br/>8) In a couple of scenes (at the very beginning and very end), we see one person who is not apparently affected by the ""toxin"". We never find out what happens to them, nor why they aren't affected. In reality, there would certainly be more people not affected, and the people who were would likely be affected in different ways. Psychoactive substances never affect everyone the same way.<br/><br/>9) Just before the final scene, we see Wahlberg, et al. back home three months after the attack. No one appears to have suffered any kind of psychological trauma. The little girl, whose parents are both dead, is going off to school, and somehow the Northeast is repopulated. I'd be very curious to know what they did with all those dead bodies. More likely, massive numbers of people who were not directly affected by the plants would have committed suicide due to depression. No one in their right minds would move back to the region, so the only living people in that part of the country would be clean up crews wearing Hazmat suits.<br/><br/>10) In the very beginning scene, the one person not affected by the toxin begins describing what she sees, but the camera never shows us. ""Are those people clawing at themselves?"" Where?! Sorry, you'll never see it. It's like watching a Bob Newhart phone conversation. In spite of the character's comment, you never see any of the victims clawing at themselves. Everyone who falls prey to the plant toxin freezes, then quietly (and expediently) commits suicide. It's a continuity error that occurs two minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>There are so many more things wrong with this film I don't think it's possible to list them all. The shortest list of the movie's flaws is, sadly, the movie itself. Hopefully this review will prevent you from seeing it, or at least prepare you for the inevitable disappointment."

","Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan: I adored ""The Sixth Sense"" and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. ""Unbreakable"" was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of ""Signs"" to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful build-up in recent film history. I even liked ""The Village"" and could easily dismiss ""Lady in the Water"" as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating ""The Happening"", especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures- the paranoid 70's sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing out of the way- ""The Happening"" is unbelievably, impossibly, ridiculously, hilariously, inconceivably bad. Normally I would refuse to rate any film that had any good scenes or that was well-directed less than four out of ten, but ""The Happening"" has to have one of the worst scripts among recent big-budget Hollywood films. It's absolutely shocking how retarded the logic behind this is and how poor so much of the dialogue is. This script began as ""The Green Effect"", a tremendously poor (trust me, I read parts of it) script by Shyamalan that was soundly rejected and eventually reworked into ""The Happening"". Having seen the critical reaction to ""The Happening"" prior to going into the film I found myself pleasantly surprised by basically the first thirty, forty minutes of the film. It was nothing special but it had something going for it, Shyamalan's direction was top-notch, and Wahlberg was playing the sort of goofy science teacher I'd loved (and loved to hate on occasion) in high school. <br/><br/>Then the descent began. The bulk of this film is some of the most hilariously awful crap produced by a talented filmmaker since Schaffner's ""Sphinx"". Shyamalan, who was using close-ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. There is one painfully, painfully long close-up of Mark Wahlberg pleading for time to think and then calling for his group to 'keep ahead of the wind' that is up there with Nicolas Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" in terms of hilariously awful acting. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film, with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second, culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. I don't blame Wahlberg for this, I blame Shyamalan. Wahlberg claims Shyamalan tried to force him into real paranoia so his performance would work better. What happens here (no pun intended) is that Wahlberg ends up looking amazingly uncomfortable for the last hour of this thing and struggles to deliver any reasonable line deliveries.<br/><br/>Okay, I do have to credit Zooey Deschanel for making this movie watchable. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well-drawn one at that- one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). There's also the score: oh my it's gorgeous. Seriously, ignore this film and just buy the score CD by James Newton Howard- it's brilliant. <br/><br/>""The Happening"" starts out well but ends up being an absolute embarrassment. I was prepared for a mediocre offering- perhaps a misguided effort such as ""Lady in the Water"". I was not expecting a disaster on the level of ""The Happening"". Its last forty minutes and especially its last ten minutes or so are among the worst I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Have you ever wondered if it was possible for a film to go from enjoyable to absolutely horrendous in the space of ten or fifteen minutes? ""The Happening"" is proof that it can, pardon the (intentional) pun, happen. <br/><br/>3/10"
"jeffrey-goldberg","1","482","750","11 June 2008"," A terrible screenplay and poorly acted
","""The Happening"", which was released here in France today is a terrible screenplay and poorly acted. The writer/director failed to make a complete film, which employs any semblance of cinematic language.<br/><br/>Normally well-written, taut and engaging screenplays, like good editing should be invisible. They should fit seamlessly into the film-making process, but unfortunately for ""The Happening"", the writing, construction of drama and dialogue are so bad that the awful screenplay is apparent from the very first scene. The introduction of the main conflict is visually well done, but the writers never bother to move the story past its main conflict, thus making the film flat line dramatically very early on. Essentially nothing ever happens except the main characters totally unbelievable reactions to ""The Happening"" (i.e. the main conflict).<br/><br/>We, the audience are not emotionally attached to the characters because the screenplay gives us no reason to be. The film's sub-conflicts are basically non-existent and the character conflicts (emotional relationships) are contrived and hollow. The screenplay provides no emotional outlet or connection at all. Simply said this is a screenplay that should have been better vetted for emotional connection between the audience and characters on screen. We don't care about what's 'Happening' because the people to whom it is 'Happening' mean nothing to us. Someone should provide the screenwriter with a copy of Aristotle's ""Poetics"".<br/><br/>The dialogue is over the top, simplistic, explicit and begs the question - does anyone really talk like that? Line after line the screenplay falls further and further apart. The characters tell us what we can already see. Therefore the screenplay doesn't trust that the cinematic language of images is doing its job. The beauty of cinema is that with moving pictures we can say thousands upon thousands of words with each frame and never actually employ dialogue. This screenplay obviously does not respect that logic and in many ways flies right in the face of it. The film would be a lot better if the characters just simply reacted to the events unfolding around them.<br/><br/>The acting is unwatchable. No one in this film gives a good performance. The acting, similar to the screenplay is devoid of emotion. No one is reacting like a real person. Each character seems to be emotionally empty. They don't seem nervous that millions of people are dying, they're not hysterical (which doesn't not mean they should yelling and screaming) or even realistic. They at no time in the film seem desperate with the desire and hope to live. At times they try to appear upset, but it is so shallow that the viewer is left flat. Each actor delivers their lines without any regard or reaction to the actor in front of them. It is so bad that it makes one wonder whether or not the actors were actually on set together or just acting with stand-ins.<br/><br/>The sub-text of the film, which is meant to lead us to the theme  mankind is destroying the planet, is blatant and lacks finesse. Pretty quickly into the first act we know that the plants are taking their revenge (I wish I was making this up, but this really is the plot of the film). The screenplay, dialogue and acting do nothing to merit the ending in which a professor on television is yelling about 'how we humanity are guilty for the recent horrors and need to pay better attention to our physical environment.' The films is just waving its fists and again telling us what to think rather than earning our trust. It tells us what its about. Basically the film underestimates us every step of the way.<br/><br/>The film never ventures into any kind of serious depth. It stays on the most basic, one-dimensional level. Plants are killing us - run away.<br/><br/>Blame for this film's failures should be squarely laid upon the director and producers. The director is guilty of writing and directing a very bad and unbelievable film. The producers are responsible for allowing the director to get away with this. Someone on the creative team and/or on the production side should have sounded an alarm when they read the screenplay. When the screenplay got into production one of the producers should have watched the rushes and pulled the director aside and said something.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" is a failure on the most basic and important of cinematic levels. It does nothing to win, earn and deserve the audience's emotional and intellectual trust. It doesn't employ image as its main storytelling tool. It just tries to be clever, but is actually quite silly.<br/><br/>I for one don't care who the writer or director is, they must listen to their production and creative team. Film-making is a collaborative experience, but in the case of this film it is clear that no one bothered to be honest with Mr. Shyamalan."
"hall895","4","151","229","30 January 2009"," It's not happening
","Who keeps giving M. Night Shyamalan money to make these movies? Seriously, what studio executive read this script and thought that making this movie would be a good idea? After the disaster that was Lady in the Water Shyamalan comes back with a movie which unbelievably, almost impossibly, may actually be worse. Lousy acting, laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow the story here is that starting in New York City and then quickly spreading through the Northeast everyone is suddenly killing themselves. Everyone drops what they're doing, seemingly goes catatonic for a moment and then offs themselves anyway they can. Fling themselves off the top of a building, shoot themselves in the head...whatever. What could possibly make people do this? Obviously it must be some kind of terrorist attack or so everyone thinks. There certainly is something bad in the air and people need to flee. And here we meet our main characters, a Philadelphia high school science teacher and his wife along with his friend and his friend's daughter. They get out of the city, inevitably get stuck in the middle of nowhere, the characters begin to do and say things which make no sense whatsoever and the whole movie falls apart as we watch people try to run away from the wind.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg has the central role here and his performance is truly awful. Certainly he isn't helped by the hideous script but it really seems as if Wahlberg can do nothing right. He seems rather emotionless for a guy trying to figure out why everyone's engaging in mass suicide. As his wife, Zooey Deschanel goes through the film with a blank stare on her face. Some of the corpses show more life. Most of the other characters we meet make a bad impression if they make any impression at all. Some truly bizarre people wander in and out of this movie. And all of them are forced to spout dialogue which is so bad it often becomes unintentionally funny. Somebody wrote that? Really? Ha-ha. But as bad as the acting and dialogue are it's the story which is the biggest problem. Once the movie reveals what actually is happening it becomes impossible to take the story seriously. Stupid. So very, very stupid. The premise makes no sense, doesn't work at all, and thus the movie is doomed to failure. I really can't fathom that after reading the script anyone actually encouraged Shyamalan to go ahead and make this movie. The Sixth Sense sure was a long time ago."

","I hate this. I want to tell you guys that this was Shyamalan's comeback and that this film is just as terrifying as you've been promised. But, I cannot.<br/><br/>The film starts off actually quite well. Minus some less than stellar acting (in fact, its horrible) and some just as bad dialogue, I really thought that maybe this film could pull it off. Disturbing death scenes ensue.<br/><br/>Then, bring in Mark Wahlberg. What happened to this guy? Nominated for an Oscar for his turn in The Departed, Wahlberg seems like a safe bet, but in actuality, he's playing a role that just isn't made for him. This role was made for someone nicer. Walhberg has been typecast time and time again as the angry and bad-ass guy, and now I see why. He's good at that and god awful at being nice.<br/><br/>No one else is particularly good either. Zoey Deschanel disappoints, John Leguizamo (Everyone in this movie has a name that's difficult to spell), and all of the extras are just as bad. There is not a single moment of good acting in this movie.<br/><br/>And all of that is because of how rushed this film feels. This is one of those movies that it seriously felt like the director was working on a very limited budget and then took the first take for every actor, none of them had a chance to get into their roles (or so I hope).<br/><br/>It's obvious who will get all of the blame for this (M. Night Shyamalan) and it's really too bad. I can't say that the plot is necessarily bad, it isn't, and with maybe one more draft the script would've been good. The faults of this film all land on Night's shoulders though. I hate to say it because I am very much not a hater of his (I love The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs) but I'm forced to say I hate this movie. Not so much for how bad it actually is (it's very bad) but because I really had faith in the director. The trailers almost felt promising and Shyamalan (am I even spelling this right?) promised me that I'd walk out shaking. Instead, I was shaking my head in disappointment.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to add on though, I can tell that they were going for a Hitchcock vibe and the best way I feel that I can describe this is ""a very bad version of The Birds."" That is all."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","1","92","144","29 November 2008"," This film made me confused, paralyzed, then I tried to hang myself afterwards
","M. Night Shyamalan's first Rated R film and he blew it completely, I remember this year actually wanting to see this movie, it looked really interesting and Mark Wahlberg is becoming a more great actor in his experience. The only problem here is M. Night Shyamalan, this man is constantly credited for Signs and The Sixth Sense... that's it, because that and Unbreakable are his only good movies. Honestly, he's just loosing it, I think he's become so cocky and now he's trying to have more of an edge with this R rating. His story lacks any sense, there are just so many things wrong with this story and not to mention the characters have no sympathy. Nothing was ever properly explained and there are tons of plot holes. The ending was just a cop out, it was nice to see that Shyamalan didn't go for his typical ""twist"" ending, but still this story just needed so much work and probably would've been better under someone else's name.<br/><br/>According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma, their friend Julian, and his daughter, Jess, board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind.<br/><br/>I feel so bad for saying this, but seriously, I was laughing at the suicide scenes. I don't know why, just first there is a police officer who shoots himself in the head, literally his forehead, why would you aim it that way? Also a trainer feeds himself to his tigers that rip his arms off instead of knocking him down and people film it?! There is a woman who is on the phone with her daughter, puts her on speaker in front of a group of people to hear her commit suicide?! Also, Julian just leaves his daughter to find her most likely dead mother in the hands of a woman he doesn't trust, yes, let's leave the daughter and most likely make her an orphan. Gosh, I could go on and on about how horrible this movie is, but I think I'd run out of room. Just trust me, the story is just horrible and could've been good if maybe made more as an independent film, but Shyamala-ding-dong just ruined it.<br/><br/>1/10"
"shariqq","4","495","858","12 June 2008"," It might be cliché, but it has to be said: The Happening is not happening.
","Shyamalan has proved to us earlier that he can be as good as the best with masterpieces of cinema with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Yet, since then, he has declined steadily. Signs and Village were good movies, but with Lady in the Water and now The Happening, he has touched a level of incompetence that could never have been expected of him.<br/><br/>The Happening is about a pandemic that is gripping north-eastern USA. It starts with a stunning sequence of events that show people succumb to an unspecified threat  the brilliance of this opening repeated only once more for a five-minute sequence towards the end of the movie. Unfortunately, Shyamalan's writing is a big let-down for the rest. As the focus moves from metropolitans to towns and from crowds to smaller groups, the sense of fear is lost  the biggest sin a horror movie can commit. In the oft repeated criticism for its director, this movie would have been best served as a half-hour episode of Twilight Zone to make it really work.<br/><br/>And to add woe, the actors do not do much to better the experience  Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are grossly miscast as the protagonists. Any of his previous leading men (Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Paul Giamatti) can be imagined to have done a better job for the Science teacher that Wahlberg plays. The camera scrutinizes the performance to a degree that requires an actor with strength in emotions  Wahlberg instead brings a physical presence that the role does not need. Zooey, on the other hand, struts around like in a Disney movie, not for once threatened by the pandemonium.<br/><br/>This time, though Shyamalan humbles his vanity  you don't see him on screen. He now should swallow his pride and leave the writing to the writers. Armed with a better script, we can still expect Shyamalan to make his future movies worth waiting for. For now it is only the memory of the opening sequence, which can be proclaimed as mind-numbing greatness, which is really worth taking away from this movie."

","Let me preface these comments by saying that I am a major Night fan. I look forward to news of his next project and love the stories of his supposed total control over his movies and carte blanche from the studios. If those stories are true, I have a feeling that era will be ending for Night with the release of The Happening. I ignored all the pre-release press I could before going to see this movie. I read none of the reviews, but one word I did catch was ""uninspired."" Unfortunately, that one word describes this movie perfectly. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought it was due to the acting and that maybe Mark Wahlberg was miscast. However, after another ten minutes I realized it wasn't the actors; it was the extremely lame script. Without giving away any details, this is a disaster film where the disaster ""happening"" starts with the first scene of the movie. Unfortunately, no suspense builds and there is absolutely no sense of dread or panic on screen and so none translates to the audience. Surprising, since the 21st century has provided us with too many occasions to study how we react in times of disaster, whether by nature or terrorism. It's as if Night ignored all this when writing the story. The characters sleepwalk through the scenes (and, no, it's not a symptom of ""the happening"") with no believable sense of the horrible events taking place. Granted, we don't need to see people running around in circles screaming and crying, but people do not stand in small groups after a disaster calmly taking turns talking one at a time. Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing, the film is a total bore for the audience and the source of ""the happening"" is laughable when revealed. I found myself repeatedly checking my watch, saying, ""I can't believe how bad this is""  not something I'd expect to do in a Night movie. Looking around the theater, I could tell others were sharing the same feelings. Most were scrolling through emails or texting on their phones.<br/><br/>During the movie, since I wasn't paying much attention to the screen, I started thinking that there might be a good reason why most filmmakers do not have total control over their films. When they do, they can reach a point that it seems Night may have reached, where they say, ""I'm going to make people scared when the wind blows"" and actually believe themselves. Maybe other producers or execs can step in at that point and bring the filmmaker back to reality. I'm not giving up on Night, but I'll feel better if his next film is not ""Written, Produced and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan."""
"Thesnake908","7","84","139","14 June 2008"," Shyamalan Delivers A Cinematic Masterpiece: An Analysis of the Film; TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS
","The film starts out with the big blue eyes of Alma staring at the camera. What is she doing? She is on the telephone with a man named Joey, without her husband knowing, Elliot. She isn't cheating on him, but, as Elliot explains a few minutes later, she seems, ""distant."" It is their growing distance that begins the ""event."" The colors on the mood ring, and their symbolic meanings, are as follows: Blue: Reserved, tranquil, calm, believed to keep the bad spirits away. Yellow: Sign of hope, happiness, unpredictable. Green: Life, nature, great intelligence, seen as a lucky color.<br/><br/>Elliot was extremely inward in his feelings about the relationship he shares with his wife. When speaking about the absence of bees, he exclaims to his students that, ""there are forces at work in nature beyond our control,"" and in this there is a double meaning. He can't control what his wife does, in fact he feels powerless and unable to do so. If blue represents tranquil, he certainly symbolizes one who is too reserved to speak up, which prevents him from regaining his wife's love back. This is where nature must step in.<br/><br/>But killing everyone around him wasn't the only factor in nature's method, it needed a vessel, a prophet if you will. Yellow represents happiness, exactly what is absent from Elliot and Alma's life; and what color does the ring turn when Elliot tells Jess puts it on in the diner? Yellow. What color are bees? Yellow, and what does Elliot say at the beginning of the film when he's in his class of students? ""The disappearance of bees is an act of nature, something uncontrollable."" If yellow represents happiness, he basically just stated that happiness has been absent in his life. The meaning behind the bees is double, not only is it connected with the actual science aspect of the happening, it's literally happiness that has disappeared from Elliot's relationship with Alma. When Julian decides to leave Jess with Alma and Elliot, he says to Alma, ""Don't you dare take her hand unless you mean it,"" Alma decides then and there to comply with nature's wish, to bring them together. When they approach the isolated, old lady's house, she says, "" ""Why are you eying my yellow drink?"" Making it clear that he is eying, or yearning for happiness. The lady invites them inside, and they're sitting at the dinner table. Shyamalan uses great lighting to make a strange plate in the middle of the table stand out to the viewers, and only if you were paying close attention to the cinematographic details would have realized it, but the plate and the cookies were more significant than you think.<br/><br/>If yellow represents happiness, and blue represents tranquility and protection from evil forces, then you must have realized what the plate stood for. The plate was circular, obviously, and had a blue border. In the middle sat yellow cookies, and when Jess attempts to snag one, the old lady (who is wearing a shawl which has flowers and other nature-esquire features on it, indicating that she represents nature at that point) snaps at her, saying, ""you mustn't take what isn't offered to you."" The old lady, nature, is guarding the plate. The lady just told them that if they want happiness they're going to have to earn it, and work for it in their relationship, so they must admit to their mistakes and stop looking for ways out of it. But if you look closer, you'd see what nature is REALLY protecting on the plate: Elliot and Alma. Alma agrees to look after Jess, by taking her hand after Julian warns her not to unless she wants to commit, like one would take another's hand in marriage. The plate symbolizes blue surrounding and shielding the yellow from the outside. Think back to when the two boys were gunned down on the porch of the isolated house, what did Elliot say to Alma? ""We have to protect Jess."" And when does the event finally disappear? When Elliot says he doesn't care about dying anymore, and loves her, and wants her. So he walks outside, afraid but determined, and she meets him there. They've proved their love to nature, and they walk outside and come together in the middle of the two houses. Notice that there was a telephonic-like thing communicating between the house? That represents their distance. ""I can hear you like you're right here,"" says Alma, just like their relationship. They were both physically present in their relationship, but in reality they weren't connected like they two people in love should be.<br/><br/>""What color was love?"" ""I don't remember."" Again Shyamalan effectively uses double speak, they have forgot what their pure love was actually like, but moments later they realize it emotionally remember and they risk their lives by going outside, to meet each other and die together. They've learned that their lives don't matter if they die alone, and they have found the love and happiness they had been missing the entire film. So they go to each other and break the barriers separating them, and the event stops, ""randomly."" Great, but what does it all mean. Well, in elementary school art class, what color formed when you were painting and you mixed blue and yellow? Green. Green, the symbol for nature, the underlying force of protection and life, was the reason the ""happening"" happened. Nature takes drastic measures to make apparent to Alma and Elliot find happiness together. I hope this made some sense to those of you bashing the film, because frankly it was brilliant, and deserves much more recognition and appreciation than what 99% of critics have been saying. Look deeper, there's more to it than what was supposed to be a scary movie."

Not even Mark Wahlberg, whom I rate as a great actor, could save this turkey.<br/><br/>I don't intend to include any spoilers, unless you include the fact that nothing of any note goes on in this picture. Equally the script seems to be written from the perspective of a naive 10 year old for a U-rated audience. The details concerning the relationship friction between the central characters seem so childlike as to be pointless.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel, who I enjoyed in Failure to Launch, seems completely miscast or just terrible. Her principle role seems to be to appear as a giant doe-eyed girl stumbling from scene to scene as though awakening from a drug-induced coma.<br/><br/>Shyamalan made a great first movie and I also enjoyed Unbreakable.

","When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening', I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all, I enjoyed all his previous films, save 'Lady in the Lake', and was sure he would deliver another breath-taking blockbuster. Sadly, I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey, it was not of the excellence I had expected.<br/><br/>The film sees some sort of mysterious ecological event leading to people committing mass suicide, the phenomenon spreading first from large cities then to smaller towns until it is clear a huge chunk of the East Coast is affected. At first, it is assumed to be a terrorist attack but, as more and more people are spontaneously kill themselves, it is clear the cause may be something else entirely...<br/><br/>One of the problems with the film was the quality of the acting and the characters themselves. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot, the science teacher who is our main protagonist, and he does flounder in many scenes as if he forgets he's playing an intelligent but ordinary everyday guy, not a gung-ho military hero who is cool in all situations. He could have injected more emotion into his performance. Zooey Deschanel plays Elliot's girlfriend Alma and she too fails to make the audience care for her with the way she depicts the character to be some sort of an escapee from a teeny-booper romance flick. To be fair, it is not entirely Deschanel's fault as Alma is a weak, self-centred character with the emotional capacity of a young adolescent (for example, she puts Elliot and a child at risk a couple of times with her stupid decisions and, at the start, when it's clear people are dying, she is in a huff because Elliot and his friend 'hurt' her feelings).<br/><br/>When it comes to the actual storyline, the plot does start off intriguingly and there are many chilling moments when we see people are coolly committing suicide like mindless zombies. However, the finale doesn't deliver what the build-up promised. There are no real explanations or solid end result. In many ways, this film is similar to Shyamalan's previous project 'Signs' both in terms of a mass disaster and no real end resolution to the events but 'Signs' worked better because the characters were more effectively portrayed and their personal storyline was enough of a finale to compensate. This is not the case in 'The Happening' where the storyline fizzles out.<br/><br/>Overall, this is by no means a terrible film. It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but 'Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. That said, there was not only moments that had me on the edge of my seat but also lines which were quite humorous. And certainly, it does make one think about the state of the planet in regards to whether humanity does have it coming to them and how we would cope in such an event. It is worth a look, especially in a week when the other premiere is 'The Hulk, a film aimed at keeping twelve-year-olds' entertained."
"TheMovieDoctorful","8","4","4","15 August 2016"," A Solid, Albeit Imperfect, Tribute To 50s Sci Fi B Movies
","""The Happening"" is arguably one of the most critically slammed blockbusters of the past 10 years. Beloved as ""so bad, it's good"" cinema at best and regarded as an abysmal failure at worst, it's regarded by many as the film that began M. Night Shyamalan's descent from beloved visionary to embarrassment of the industry. However, when one looks at the movie from the perspective Shyamalan intended (As a cheesy tribute to 50s Sci-Fi a la ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"") it's not half bad. Don't get me wrong, ""The Happening"" isn't a film like ""The Wolfman"" or ""Attack of the Clones"" where I genuinely can't understand why people think it's terrible; it has problems. BIG ones. But for what it was trying to do, the film succeeds more often than it fails. <br/><br/>One thing I loved was how ""The Happening"" never took itself 100% seriously. Clever themes on the dangers of uncontrolled fear, emotion overpowering reason, environmentalism and strength of community aside, the story is somewhat silly; plants releasing toxins in the air making people kill themselves. However, unlike insipid films like ""Winter's Tale"" or ""It Follows"" that seem to be under the impression that ""seriousness + themes=intelligence"", ""The Happening"" KNOWS that the concept is BS. I know this because of the film's frequent use of bonkers dialogue (""You know hot dogs get a bad rap? They got a cool shape, they got protein. You like hot dogs right?"") and intentionally campy (But not at all ""bad."" John Leguizamo in particular is outstanding as Elliot's terrified friend Julian, a character EXTREMELY out of his element in such a horrific and catastrophic event) acting reminiscent of B-Movie classics like ""The Blob"" and ""The Body Snatchers."" It's in the smart execution of an inherently stupid premise that ""The Happening"" shines.<br/><br/>And the execution is smart indeed. Hokiness aside, ""The Happening"" is extremely subtle in the delivery of its themes and certainly worthy of post-viewing analysis. Shyamalan's use of color to convey emotion (Blue representing calmness and yellow representing hope for example) is brilliant, and refreshing in an age where too many directors merely use a particular color scheme cause ""it looks cool."" Whatever issues one may have with the writing, visually it's an undeniably well directed film. Major props must also be given to Shyamalan for not being ""on the nose"" with the delivery of its themes or giving easy answers to questioning viewers. For example, while the film says that plants are responsible for the outbreak, there are several background visuals that many audience members may not even notice that imply that the film may not be talking about literal botanical plants, but by polluting, power plants (An idea that is also supported by easy to miss visual cues such as Elliot and his party hurrying past a real estate billboard subtitled ""You Deserve This!"") The film also toys with the possibility that the virus was released in the air long before the start of the movie, but only triggered/activated by negative emotion; that said, we never get a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" to said possibility.<br/><br/>The musical score is positively chilling, certainly among my personal favorites. There is an almost delicate beauty to it that slowly transitions into a much darker and more ominous tone. The music fits in perfectly with ""The Happening""'s truly horrific and disturbing kills. M. Night really makes the most of his first R-Rated movie, making the suicide scenes as graphic and uncomfortable as possible (One particular scene involving a zookeeper is downright cringe worthy, and I mean that in the best possible way)<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, ""The Happening"" is not perfect, and I recognize that it has some major problems. Zooey Deschanel is positively DREADFUL as Elliot's cheating partner Alma, almost unbearably so. Her delivery barely resembles anything even REMOTELY humanoid, and every time she opens her mouth, my immersion in the film is shattered. Also, while I can enjoy most of the dialogue as part of the 50s Sci-Fi B movie thing the film was going for, some of the characters can occasionally speak in lines so over dramatic I could have sworn they were written exclusively for the trailer.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think that these problems are enough to wreck the mostly enjoyable experience I had with ""The Happening."" It's no masterpiece, but it's a damn impressive tribute to a long forgotten age. Distracting flaws aside, ""The Happening"" is a refreshingly self aware but surprisingly clever B-movie directed with the skill of a true artist."
"bensthoughts","7","4","4","9 July 2016"," Highly Under-rated
","I'm not sure exactly why this movie has been bashed and low rated so much, maybe it's just a bandwagon thing? I'll admit it's no movie of the year and was a little cheese at parts. However overall it was actually quite entertaining, the plot moves along steadily and it was a standard 90 minutes. Anyway long story short my last point is that I believe M.Night was attempting to do a sort of throwback to the 50's and 60's era of film making. I see many Hitchcock styling within this film and I think he actually did an excellent job of creating a modern version of ""The Birds"" I mean let's face it this is the birds re-done. and re-done fairly well. The color, the music, the overall atmosphere, quite similar and well done. Maybe kids these days just can't appreciate this type of film, maybe they would low rank The Birds as well. As for the claims on ""confusion"" or not being realistic enough I don't understand that either. I think it is fairly clear that the cause is not going to be understood but likely has something to do with the plants and some sort of biologically active chemicals they emit. This is actually completely within the realm of possible. Trees and shrubs release chemicals into the air that can have subtle and sometimes overwhelming affects on human emotion and behaviour. Example is essential oils (the oils in plants that give them their smells)."
"philmographer","10","941","1783","13 June 2008"," Why this film is important...and why people don't like it that way:
","I was disappointed to see such harsh reviews from the critics when there are clearly much sillier and stupid films out there. ""Zohan"" was about 60% at rotten tomatoes, while ""The Happening"" was at 14%. The disappointment didn't last long when I realized, given the information above, if critics had liked this movie, that might have been a bad thing. I focused my attention on interviews with Shyamalan himself talking about the film instead of the pretentious critics who have grown accustom to hating his movies. I decided to take HIS advice and go into the theater looking for a ""fun B movie"". <br/><br/>You will find that, and so much more. This movie is not your average thriller by any means. ""The Happening"" holds a solid ""Twilight Zone"" feel without being cliché or overused. This might be why the average masses didn't like it. We are used to being fed sequel after sequel after remake after remake. Don't get me wrong, those are fun movies to watch but the ART of film is being lost. The stereotypic perfect leading man who is smooth, witty, handsome and quick thinking who always saves the day will not be found in this film. Nor will the overuse of incredible special effects, slashing and squirting blood and gore, erotic sex scenes, fast paced chases, or crude language. Yes, the content is uncomfortable and disturbing and times, but it has a point. It's not goring for the sake of being goring and it's not uncontrolled in it's violence. <br/><br/>This film is simple. It has flawed and awkward characters who don't always say the smoothest thing. Everyone is imperfect and they don't handle the situations in the best ""hollywood"" type manner. Shyamalan did this on purpose. This movie is not paced for the ""entertain me entertain me entertain me entertain me"" type audiences we have mostly become. You are given the elements, but it's up to you to be able to slow down and feel the emotions in order to appreciate the film. The parable and meaning are so much deeper and innocent than what is popularized in media today. It will challenge you. It will make you think.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" on the outside is a very fun and funny film. It is a ""B"" movie on the surface because of it's amazing simplicity, but by the end of the film you realize what it's actually all about. It's sad to see that so many people have completely missed it. <br/><br/>Bottom line: If you liked his other films, you must see this one, it falls into the ranks of everything made before Lady. If you didn't like his other films, stick to boring remakes and sequels."
"supah79","5","127","230","15 July 2008"," If it's intentional, it's still a bad film
","I'm a Shyamalan fan. He's not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it's twice in a row.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Beginning in Central Park NYC, people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational, even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it's not terrorists, but nature itself spreading this virus: yes, it's nature against men. And nature is winning.<br/><br/>I thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words: he shouldn't be in anything else than a movie about cops or (ex-)marines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel, who looks like she's a live-action version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?<br/><br/>The way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia, how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV, mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it's nothing major. Because there really isn't much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park (in hindsight) is telling. I really had my doubts about everything: the acting, the actions taken by the characters, the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act, the movie becomes more and more (non intentional) laughable and silly.<br/><br/>After seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive B-movie, in the tradition of Romero etc. If that's the case, then my original rating of 5 (outta 10) should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage, take a look at Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (although that's really a remake.) I don't like a these talented filmmakers who want to take $100 million budgets, to make movies who look like they've been made for $10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre. <br/><br/>The Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it's boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way."

","After the hype created by Bird Box, it is worth revisiting The Happening which was critically mauled upon its release.<br/><br/>The reason might be M Night Shyamalan who wrote, produced and directed this film. His success in movies such as The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable meant that critics were just sharpening their knives and waited for him to fail.<br/><br/>It starts off shockingly as people kill themselves in New York, such as throwing themselves off a building. The mass suicides soon spreads and the authorities initially think it is some kind of a biological terrorist attack.<br/><br/>Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher at high school in Philadelphia. When the school hears about happening in New York, it causes a mass panic.<br/><br/>Elliot, his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his young daughter Jess try to escape Philadelphia on the train. The train comes to a halt and they are stranded in the countryside.<br/><br/>Julian goes back to look for his wife who could not make it on the train. Elliot tries to figure out what is causing this phenomenon as they witness more disturbing suicides. He thinks there is something in nature, especially the countryside that is causing the happening.<br/><br/>Shyamalan was let down by Mark Wahlberg, the most unconvincing high school science teacher. Zooey Deschanel was not much better. I know she is supposed to have marriage problems but there was no chemistry here between the actors. Leguizamo would had been better as the lead.<br/><br/>The film itself is much better than its reputation deserves. There is an environmental subtext to it. It is eerie, disturbing and mysterious. I can understand what Shyamalan tried to do and he largely succeeded with a psychological apocalyptic horror. It would had been better with stronger actors."
"imagiking","1","25","39","8 February 2010"," The Happening: Woefully Acted, Barely Written and Just Absurd
","I suggested that my friends and I go to see this film in the cinema when it was released. As a result, I have never since been allowed to choose the film. <br/><br/>The Happening concerns a mysterious phenomenon which is leading to mass death and causing wide-spread panic around the world. Mark Wahlberg plays a high-school teacher thrust into the middle of this emergency situation with his girlfriend, played by Zooey Deschanel. They are journeying across the country to escape ""the happening"". <br/><br/>The premise is interesting to begin with, a message lying at the heart of the film. It is, however, taken beyond the point of redemption by Shyamalan. The script is simple, generic, unimaginative, boorish rubbish. Stupid, emotionless, and inhuman lines spoken by characters which might, with a degree of kindness, be described as two-dimensional. The relationships between them are entirely unbelievable and insincere. And the acting? Oh the acting... Wahlberg deserves a slap as the blandly irritating and vapid ""hero"" who appears to have only a single tone of mundanity available to him as a voice, and Zooey Deschanel is... well, simply, Zooey Deschanel isn't. Having Wahlberg speak to himself would have been less painful (oh wait, he does try that). The ""expressions"" of joy, fear, shock, and sadness upon Deschanel's face are entirely indistinguishable from each other, and indeed from emotion at all. Possibly the single worst ""performance"" I have ever seen. To make matters worse, both characters seem more attached to turning their heads to the side than they are to each other. You'll think they're trying to get something out of their ears. Perhaps its the sound of the dialogue, clunky and tacky as it comes.<br/><br/>Woefully acted, barely written, and just absurd, the only thing happening with The Happening is the steady flow of people leaving. Shyamalan continues his recent trend of awfulness, digging ever deeper his cinematic grave."
"febangel30","8","30","49","29 January 2009"," An Important Message....
","Although, several people did not like this film, I have to say that I enjoyed it tremendously. From the beginning of the film, you become hooked. It was incredible to see that only a few minutes into the film, you witness the strange event happening so soon. When the people in Central Park become affected by the chemicals, they look like they are frozen in time. Then the real horror begins. As I watched it got me thinking about years back when sea creatures began ""killing themselves"" by beaching themselves. There was no explanation for this event in the first place and it created quite a stir. Many marine biologists theorized that there might been some type of bacteria or threat in the ocean that caused it to happen<br/><br/>In ""The Happening"", you realize that the whole cause of the horrific events is the plants themselves and their sole purpose is to exterminate as many humans as possible. You realize that the plants are pretty much fed up with the human race's neglect towards the environment. As this epidemic worsens, you see the ugly side of people emerge. This movie teaches us all a lesson, be kind to nature and remember to talk to your plants...or else...J/K.... Seriously go watch the movie for yourself, you just might like it. :-)"
"kvinneslandr","8","370","733","13 June 2008"," For those with imaginations... and attention spans.
","I'm surprised this movie is getting as many bad reviews as it appears to be getting... but the occasional good review is very telling, especially Ebert's. I'd recommend reading his review because in my opinion he 'got it', and no need to repeat his observations here.<br/><br/>As usual, MNS comes up with a thinking-man's view of what exactly is disconcertingly eerie and/or profoundly horrible... that which you can't really immediately understand... and even more telling, that which is beyond controlling.<br/><br/>But if your imagination is such that the sudden downfall of society doesn't shock after the first random suicide of a person sitting next to you, or your attention span is such that watching a normally calming pan across a countryside turn into something deeply ominous for more than a few frames bores you, then this won't be a movie to your taste.<br/><br/>Within the microcosms created by MNS in his films, I never walked away with a feeling of having to suspend an untoward amount of disbelief... that seems to be a major complaint of many who are panning this movie, but I don't see it. I can only chalk it up to the 'cynical chic' of the South Park generation... those for whom empathy is an alien concept, to whom ennui is epitomized by screen images which don't provide visual bombardments even few seconds, and by whom mean-spirited irreverence is demanded in lieu of actual humorous or heartfelt dialog.<br/><br/>If the dialog seems simplistic, well, look a bit deeper and realize exactly what 'regular folk' might say or do if the events of this Happening actually were occurring... this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends... not with the bang of snappy repartee or quotable sound-bytes, but with the whimper of incredulity and dread.<br/><br/>Complaining about the acting or dialog in The Happening is like complaining about the 'jumpy camera work' in Cloverfield. In short, anyone who just doesn't ""get it"" to that extent really shouldn't be posting their opinions on movies.<br/><br/>Finding the truly human and poignant moments in the outwardly mundane yet intrinsically significant details of his landscapes and characters is one of MNS's great gifts, and he hits the mark here too.<br/><br/>The cinematography was superb, the actors all hit their strides, the story was compelling, the occasional odd character, visual pun, and good-natured joke worked well... no complaints on that score.<br/><br/>I even went in expecting to be underwhelmed by the acting of the two lead characters, but came out pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>But then again, I loved The Village, and found many good things about The Lady In The Water... so I guess mine will remain the minority opinion.<br/><br/>But if you have admired MNS's previous work, you will enjoy this film as well."

Although this movie was intended for adults, younger teens would enjoy this movie more. The movie also didn't have a great ending and wasn't a great moral to life but it was entertaining I half to say. M.

"globewriter","1","109","205","14 June 2008"," Awful
","I read with amazement that some people actually thought this smelly pile of rubbish to be good. Far be it for me to question the sanity of others.<br/><br/>I found it strange that the film opened here in Trinidad before the official release date of Friday 13th in the US ( gosh what a clever release date) but I am sure once the critics rightly savage the film on Friday it will be thrown straight on to DVD. Actually, in my view that would be a waste of a DVD blank. The premise of this travesty, in a nutshell - and not to put too fine a point on it - is that the plants get annoyed and decide to kill us. But they don't actually kill us themselves, oh no, that would be far too simple and a bit too Day of the Triffids, what they do is release a ""toxin"" in the air that makes us kill ourselves in a variety of creative and colourful ways. We throw ourselves off buildings, shoot ourselves, slash our wrists, get run over by lawn equipment and even bash our heads into walls. Oh gee..I almost forgot...we also jump into lion cages and tease them until they bite our arms off as it is captured on iPhone video. If we take this incredibly stupid premise that the plant version of Google Labs suddenly figured out this clever formula and pair it with some of the worst and most stilted dialogue I have ever heard and then throw in some incredibly bad acting we end up with a recipe for an instant headache.<br/><br/>When I say bad dialogue I don't mean just bad dialogue I refer to the sort of dialogue that would make your eyes roll back into your head and never want to emerge again. We are talking lines such as ""don't let the wind catch you"" and ""if I have to die I want to die with you"" and I, of course ,paraphrase because I was having a hard time staying conscious. This sort of thing might work if it is done tongue in cheek but M N S takes himself so damned seriously with what I gather was meant to be a morality lesson about the environment that I have to assume it was unintentional. <br/><br/>The acting made me think they just rounded up a bunch of people and dropped them on the set. Mark Wahlberg makes a fine underwear model but i swear his range makes Keanu Reeves look like Larry Olivier. Zooey Deschanel, the female lead, seems to have been given some sort of pupil dilating drops and then pumped full of medication before being let loose on the set. The only person who seemed to have escaped this film with her career was Betty Buckley who at least managed a camp crazy lady performance.<br/><br/>So, to summarise, people start dropping like flies within the first 5 minutes, then for the next 6 hours..OK fine...1.5 hours ...we have to listen to bad dialogue as people try to figure out what is going on and ""run from the wind"". I am all for freedom of expression but I shouldn't be lured into having to sit through a grade Z movie. I can see no reason for this ""film"" other than wasting time and effort and making cinema enthusiasts feel ripped off. I read with alarm that M N S is about to embark on making another movie. Please M. Night do film a favour and put down the pen, fold away the director's chair and step away from the camera."
"Runelady","1","56","101","25 July 2008"," The Happening is Definitely Not Happening
","M. Night Shyamalan started with a great idea for this movie: Mother Nature taking revenge on mankind for abusing the planet. This could have been a truly amazing film. What this turned out to be is something that should have been left on the cutting room floor to be swept away and left to rot in a landfill. In terms of quality, this movie makes Manos: the Hands of Fate look like the Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>The movie starts out okay. Mark Wahlberg plays a quirky science professor. His class discussions suggest some foreshadowing and expertise behind future events; however, these expectations fall dreadfully short from being fulfilled. Actually, all expectations for this film are refuted. The storyline is bland and has no real plot. Early in the film, one event sets the wheels in motion for the rising action. That's pretty much where the movie plateaus. There is no driving force to carry you through to the end.<br/><br/>The dialogue is synthetic and clumsy. If I were facing a life-threatening, environmental crisis, I would be discussing things relevant to the events at-hand. These people had the most odd, insignificant things to say. It was absolutely ludicrous. Some scenes were so bizarre that all I could say was ""WTF?"" <br/><br/>The actors' performances were equally as hollow as the individuals they portrayed. The characters have no depth and offer no additional substance to this film; no glimpse into something that might ignite a plot twist, or, even more importantly, A PLOT. The general over-all feeling was as if everyone were fumbling their way through the script for the first time. Mark Wahlberg is typically a very good actor. In this movie, his acting seems forced and unnatural. The closest comparison I can think of is watching his reaction to someone repeatedly snapping a rubber band against his face. Zoey Deschanel's character seems oblivious and disinterested in the events surrounding her. John Leguizamo was slightly more convincing, but very awkward.<br/><br/>I thought the Fantastic Four sequel was awful, but this by far takes the golden turkey for the worst movie I have seen in the past year. I would rather chew on broken glass and gargle lemon juice than watch this again.<br/><br/>My rating: 1/10 Stars."

","M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas, amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan, as was evident with The Village, or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequels(Indiana Jones 4, The Incredible Hulk), remakes and adaptations(Speed Racer, Iron Man), and the straight forward rip-offs(The Strangers, The Ruins), etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of these movies with the exception of the rip-offs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly, in my opinion, is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.<br/><br/>I loved everything about the story. The thing about Shyamalan is that people always complain about his movies being unbelievable or unrealistic and this simply makes me angry. A movie is not to be watched the intention of learning about the world, it meant to be watched to see a story. It doesn't need to be realistic, it doesn't need to follow some sort of snobbish standard. It's art for God's sake! Anyways, back to what I was saying about the story. It moves amazingly well and I was upset to see it finally end because I wanted it to keep going. There are a lot of shocking and very disturbing moments which is why I was surprised that more horror fans weren't impressed. After all of his PG-13 films, I thought this would have had very little violence and barely deserved the R rating because most of his movies have been pretty tame. I'll tell you right now that it definitely earned the R rating. It is one of the most gruesome and disturbing Hollywood releases I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I also wanted to mention how people have been complaining so much about the acting in this film. It was definitely bizarre and awkward but I thought that it followed along with the story and helped the movie create its own little world in that sense. I thought the whole cast did a great job.<br/><br/>Don't buy a ticket to this one if you want to see another rehash of something that's already been done. It is a truly different film and I think it is ahead of its time. Shyamalan is one of the only directors out there still doing original work, and he does a damn good job of it if you ask me."

","There is a lot to be said for a ""thinking person's"" movie, and that is clearly what was being attempted here. Just too bad it's not a ""watching person's"" movie as well.<br/><br/>The plot and resolution leave everything to be desired. People are killing themselves for no reason, the characters run, they recognize one single thing about the pattern of deaths, manage to survive one day, the suicides stop - again, for no reason - and a character completely unrelated to the rest of the film provides ""resolution"" by saying, once again, that no one knows why any of it happened.<br/><br/>In this sense, the title is perfect, since everything throughout the entire movie just up and happens, with no rhyme or reason behind it.<br/><br/>Now, all that might have worked out well if the actors weren't slightly less believable than flying pink elephants. Wahlberg and Deschanel were atrocious. Granted, Wahlberg is bad all the time, but he usually is surrounded by good actors that divert attention from his failure. Deschanel looked like a deer in headlights for 90 minutes, no matter the situation or the lines being delivered.<br/><br/>Even if you had good acting, there is still the trouble with the script. The characters don't speak in ""movie-type"" lines or even things that a normal person might say. It's glaringly obvious that the words coming out of their mouths are the product of bland, uninspired writing, much of which was simply thrown together to make things fit.<br/><br/>By the end of it all, you're left wondering why you should care about anything that just happened, how anyone could waste so much money on a clearly terrible movie, and if there's any chance you can get a refund on that hour and a half with which you could have done something useful."
"tinab1181","1","53","100","14 June 2008"," As bad as the critics say
","*SPOILERS* ahead First let me say...frankly I think if you go into The Happening expecting a couple of scenes where you will be subjected to something gory or the suggestion that something gory will happen shortly, and that is all you are looking for, I think you may like this movie. But otherwise, No.<br/><br/>Hilariously everyone slammed Lady in the Water, but I think that it has more merit as a complete movie and was at least watchable. Lady in the Water suffered because really it should have been more dolled up and sold as a kids' movie.<br/><br/>The premise of The Happening is that the plants in the Northeastern U.S. begin emitting toxins which cause people to harm and eventually kill themselves. It begins in the cities (where the largest populations are) and then finally spreads out to essentially the middle of nowhere. The premise could be promising but the movie is ruined by poor writing and a terrible attempt at a romantic subplot. The movie would have been more satisfying had Zoe Deschanel and Mark Wahlberg's characters killed themselves as well, so great was my apathy towards their relationship. The only character I had any empathy for was the little girl.<br/><br/>Someone on this site praised the Roger Ebert review of this movie, and man, I just didn't see the movie that Ebert saw. If M. Night Shyamalan wanted a character study set in an apocalyptic world where the plants are out to get us, then give us some decent characters. Don't give me people in a café watching on their video phone as someone at the Zoo feeds themselves to the lions or a young military kid chanting, ""this is my rifle..."" before shooting himself in the head.<br/><br/>Save your ten from your admission and go rent a Hitchcock. Shyamalan does an excellent job with his sets, but this one missed everything else. Basically from the moment we're introduced to the Wahlberg character I began my very own chant in the theater, ""this is soooo bad..."""

Alas they were right; I'm so sorry I doubted you Gregor Wossilus!<br/><br/>Everyone who commented on the terrible acting was right; Zooey Deschanel was MUCH worse than Wahlberg though. John Leguizamo was vastly disappointing. However Ashlyn Sanchez was pretty good.<br/><br/>I hated the score. It was so obtrusive in a bad 50s B grade way; dum dum dum duuuummmmm.<br/><br/>The foreshadowing was so overdone; ugh, that classroom scene.<br/><br/>The scene where the zoo keeper taunted the lions to rip off his arm was promising. I thought for one gorgeous second that Shyamalan was going to turn the film into a Return of the Living Dead-style gorefest. I laughed out loud and settled in for the ride...but no, this ridiculous scene was completely straight!<br/><br/>I agree with the other reviewers that the second half was eventless.<br/><br/>At least we had fun on the way home ripping into the film.<br/><br/>Bleh."

"bob the moo","Null","19","32","13 July 2008"," Shyamalan's stock drops further with a film that lacks tension, characters, good dialogue, drama, urgency or intelligence (SPOILERS)
","It is a normal day in Central Park whenever people start talking strangely, moving awkwardly and inflicting fatal injury on themselves. With the media buzzing with talk of terrorist attacks, mass evacuation of the central New York area is organised. Among those fleeing is teacher Elliot Moore, along with his wife and a few others. The theory is that the municipal areas are the targets but somehow the attacks continue in smaller areas all along the East Coast. Seeking refuge further and further from population centres, Elliot tries to work out what is happening  if only to stay alive.<br/><br/>It didn't help that I watched this film shortly after watching the much better The Mist, which has the same sort of theme in regards an unknown and deadly disaster. Seeing something hitting the mark highlighted for me just how badly short of the mark this most recent M. Night Shyamalan film is. Of course it didn't really need another film to highlight the problems because they are all up there to be seen by all viewers. The opening scene drops us into the middle of a disaster starting out in New York where suddenly people are killing themselves, jumping off roofs and so on and it does grab you that something big is happening. Problem is, it has nowhere to go from there apart from delivering a clumsy and obvious environmental rant that makes little sense or impact. The film tries to make things personal and tense by focusing on a small group of characters but it doesn't work and the visual effect of the wind (like Kermode said  ""who's making it blow?"") just doesn't work and you never once feel genuine fear or urgency.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the script is full of terrible dialogue and has no room or apparent need to have characters that the audience can care about. Many others have highlighted the terrible performances but in fairness with these lines and this direction, how could they have been much better? I say this as someone who likes Wahlberg in films that suit him but here he is clunky and unconvincing, totally hampered by the material handed to him. Deschanel spends most of the time gawking and offers nothing of interest while at least Leguizamo has the good fortune to get out early on  but even this is a surprisingly emotionless event. The fault for all of this must rest with Shyamalan himself because he has turned a mass disaster into a dull and lifeless affair; the good things he has done (Unbreakable and Sixth Sense) are slipping further back in time and if his plan is to fill his resume with stuff like this then I wonder how long he can continue to have the career he would like.<br/><br/>The Happening is a good idea but it falls down badly when it comes to the delivery. It lacks tension, urgency, character, drama, dialogue and intelligence and, one way or another all of these problems can fairly be laid at the door of Shyamalan. A roundly poor film despite the potential."

","This movie's so bad, you'll be thinking that Mark Wahlberg should've just stuck with rapping. I can't even describe how terrible this movie is. If you're sifting through reviews to find a reason to watch it, don't. It's normal for a film to have cynics and skeptics, but in this case every criticism is well earned. The acting? Nope. The plot? No. And the dialogue? Hell no. <br/><br/>This movie has absolutely no continuity whatsoever and the pacing is so bad that you'll have at least a dozen moments where you just sit and think ""Maybe they made this movie this bad on purpose. Like, to end up in the Hall-of-Fame for worst movies of all-time or something"". Because, trust me -- it's absolutely that bad! <br/><br/>I literally don't understand how this movie could make it from production to premiere without a wall of people protesting it for its awfulness. I wish I could grade this film with dookies instead of stars, because even giving it the lowest slotted amount of stars (1) feels wrong. I'd feel much better giving this film one giant dookie...Or ten. Or 50,000. I'm not even sure at this point, that's how bamboozled I am by this horrible movie. <br/><br/>I didn't even think it was worth a review until I realized I may be the difference between someone watching and not watching and so I feel it's my civic duty to not let that happen. Save your two hours and go watch paint dry. You'll be thankful you did."
"glen922","1","20","34","3 June 2009"," worse even than expected - so what happened?
","The expansive laundry list of the failures of this mind-numbingly miserable, preposterous excuse for a film, which essentially includes every conceivable aspect and component of it, have been well detailed in earlier posts. I won't waste much time reiterating those comments. I have to say that I disagree with those who, in spite of their overall distaste for the film, with which I heartily agree, found the first so many minutes to be watchable, or the score to stand out as a positive feature, or who found anything else positive to say about any part of this thing. Perhaps you're just being kind. No need. OK, Deschanel is a cutie, but that's it for this film.<br/><br/>So what happened to Shymalan? Sixth Sense was obviously a masterpiece. Unbreakable was brilliant, although the stilted dialog was starting to show. In Signs we still had a good story and very watchable thriller, but it was becoming clear that Shymalan had no idea how real people actually talked to one another. In these first 3 films we had Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Mel Gibson, top of the A-list talents, and one must wonder how much of the quality of these films was due to their great ability and superb performances rendered. Shymalan has not been able to recruit this caliber of actor since Signs, as no doubt actors and their agents do read the screenplays pitched to them. Not to take anything away from Hurt, Giammati, or Whalberg, who all have done and are capable of more great things, but they are a step down from the likes of Willis and Gibson, and this compounded with increasingly silly stories and atrocious dialog, the result was one mediocre, one bad, and one utterly awful film, in that order.<br/><br/>Another possibility is that Shymalan stole his first two or three stories, or has since lost an important uncredited collaborator or muse, and really never had any talent himself. In any case, that's probably it for Shymalan, and it's about time."

","OK, first of all I am a fan of M Night Shyamalan. I have seen (and bought) all his films except Wide Awake (and I don't count Praying With Anger) and I've enjoyed all of them, even Lady In The Water despite the ridiculous scenarios.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film since it had a really good setup. I watched this some hours ago with a friend of mine who also watched the last two Shyamalan films at the theater with me.<br/><br/>As I watched the film, when it got to the midway point, I started feeling fidgety. Not like I was uncomfortable in the seat but just... the acting and the dialog really wasn't good. But it wasn't as bad as nails on a chalkboard just knowingly unpleasant yet not damaging to the eyes and ears (if that made sense).<br/><br/>Despite the acting and dialog, the opening was pretty interesting. Seeing all those people fall off the building was KINDA cool.<br/><br/>Now I know that when it comes to Mr Shyamalan, there's always talk of the T word which I will try to avoid saying here. Honestly, I didn't care if there was going be one. All I wanted was it to be entertaining.<br/><br/>I didn't feel any suspense in the film until well in the last half when it almost seemed to get good at the isolated house but when the end credits came up I never got relieved of the suspense so I was left hanging. Also I didn't really get the ending until my friend explained to me when we left, after which I eventually got it.<br/><br/>And visually speaking, this hardly looked like a M Night Shyamalan film. OK the scene where a car smashes into a tree followed by a character getting out, sitting on the road and cutting himself with the glass in the same take was cool but overall, it looked like someone else was making it.<br/><br/>So overall, the film was a real disappointment and not what I was hoping for. But it's definitely NOT the worst movie ever, as I've seen far more terrible films that literally made my eyes and ears bleed.<br/><br/>Maybe if I see it again when I buy it on DVD and try looking at it in a different perspective maybe things might be interesting. Why would I buy it? Because I'm a film nerd and I like to have collections.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least I'm still looking forward at the Avatar The Last Airbender adaptation...<br/><br/>P.S. This is MY opinion. You can agree or not, that's your choice. Respect mine and I'll respect yours."

","*******************May Contain Major Spoilers*********************<br/><br/>Okay this movie has way too many flaws that you ask yourself if it's intentional then you start to realize it really isn't it's just a bad movie. I really tried to pay attention to all the details to reconstruct the plot but it just does not make any sense. Why the plant caused most people around Mark Wahlberg and Zoey Deschanel to commit suicide but they spared Marky Mark, his Lady and the little girl. Nobody knows it's supposed to be a mystery in the world of M Night Shyamalan. Well guess what Mr Shyamalan your movie makes 0 sense and don't try to come up with that excuse that it's supposed to be a B Movie or mystery with a twist BS. No, this movie is just plain weird. The actors are acting strange. People around the main characters don't know how to act. This movie gets 0 out 10 for acting. 1 out 10 for plot twist and 0 for the script. The only good thing about this movie is that is shot properly like any other respectable movie but the actual content of the movie is terrible. This movie script and direction made Mark Wahlberg look like an extremely weak actor with some of the weirdest line deliveries i have ever seen. I think at that point M Night Shyamalan felt too confident with his film making style that he thought people would be fascinated with his piece of art. And what's up with M Night movie thinking they are better than they actually are except for the 6th Sense and Unbreakable i have not seen one solid Shyamalan movie. In unbreakable and the sixth sense the plot twist made sense and were very clever although they revolve around the supernatural. This one not so much we are just going along with Shyamalan film making. <br/><br/>Bottom line don't watch this movie expecting much from it because there isn't. The plot doesn't make sense, the actors are terrible, the twist is revealed early on the movie even the way the plants are acting i mean the plants are just being plants for real there is no evidence those people dying is even related to the plant. Okay i stop this movie i just plain stupid at the end it's just a waste of time unless you are in to laugh at the incredibly bad acting in this movie it is really not worth your time."

","I must say the thing I enjoy about M. Night's films are, they are different, yet entertaining in an interesting way. They cause the viewer to leave the theater and think and discuss the point, message, or moral of the story. Although that may irritate some, for others, it's a fresh change of pace on the Silver Screen. Some just want to be entertained by a movie without a philosophy the film may carry. <br/><br/>With this in mind; ""The Happening,"" is the same way. One can't go into the theater and expect to see what they are used to seeing. Plan on something different, keep an open mind, and catch the vision of this amazing movie maker. <br/><br/>By taking a step out of the normal to make the film ""R"" rated, it was for a smart purpose in revealing the story. It starts off really creating an impression on the viewer about ""what is happening?"" The pace of this film is somewhat quick yet occasionally it does get odd. Overall the film as a whole is a success in my opinion, it delivers some scare, some intensity,some justifiable gore, wrapped around a story at heart.<br/><br/>My suggestion for one who wants to see this movie is, just go and enjoy. Don't be tempted like many others by comparing his films to the ""Sixth Sense."" This movie is not, ""The Sixth Sense2."" it's ""The Happening."" It does gives some intense scares, and is supported by a powerful musical Score. Another suggestion is, if you don't like his other films, don't bother with this one, and save your money because it is from the unique, Shyamalan, you know what to expect."

His review only states the obvious of ALL of M Night's films. If you haven't figured out by now that M Night is more focused on the human condition and how it reacts to odd or strange events rather than the event itself, then you need to quit watching movies. <br/><br/>To summarize Ebert, {not verbatim} ""This movie is not a summer mindless blockbuster and explores how these people deal in a crisis""... wow Ebert... um, which M Night movie are we talking about again?<br/><br/>Go ahead and try to be deep about this one... you'll only look foolish."

Seriously people?. I don't think people actually get M. Night. I have read reviews slamming the screenplay and acting. NEWFLASH: M.

NEWSFLASH: If you still think this movie is about global warming you shouldn't be writing reviews. I think some people didn't actually get the parable this beautiful movie weaves. Its a powerful message and I loved it.<br/><br/>To be fair, M. Night demands that you watch his movies in a certain way. He does not spoon feed you. He tells stories differently than the usual.

"Quinoa1984","3","13","21","11 October 2008"," not a real 'worst-movie-ever' like Lady in the Water... more like a high-budget/high-on-itself Ed Wood flick
","M. Night Shyamalan, sad to say, was a case of a fluke in Hollywood. This isn't to say that he hasn't had some good moments in movies like Unbreakable and Signs (more-so for the former), but The Sixth Sense, one of the great big wonderkind stories of the 90s has manifested itself with its creator churning out pieces of, frankly, crap upon its unwitting audience. This isn't to say that because his first few hits he wont make more movies- matter of fact he's apparently working on an Avatar picture (not the James Cameron one, the kid-anime one)- but following the Village, which took the ludicrous 'twist' ending to new horrific heights, and Lady in the Water which is, at least to me, a true unmitigated disaster unleashed on to celluloid, The Happening continues the thread of total nonsense in the guise of thoughtful blockbuster stuff.<br/><br/>Point of order: The Happening's title first opens up the potential pit-falls for jokes on the title alone (does anyone else not picture a 60s flower-power flick?), and indeed ""something's happening"" or ""it's happened"" or some variation is said enough times to merit a drinking game after it. But then the actual movie, from its opening scenes all the way to the last, are so ridiculous in nearly every step of the way for the same basic reasons that Edward D. Wood Jr's movies are still totally ridiculous failures: give actors a screenplay that is loaded with laughably hackneyed dialog (at one point the Zooey Deschanal character says, and I quote, ""Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented""), delivered by more or less (usually less) competent actors with straight faces as they are put into a stupid sci-fi premise. In this case a mighty wind of sorts, or rather some chemical coming from the plants that are angry or incensed via nature's wrath or whatever the hell, is attacking the cities and towns of the northeast and the Moore family (Walhberg and Deschanal and daughter) run from it.<br/><br/>Yep, that's right, a lot of the movie is just characters running from the wind- with the occasional pit stop for Wahlberg to talk to a plastic plant- and from scene to scene there is just one incredibly laughable inanity after another. To give some very minor credit where it's due, it's not always the fault of the direction; as was the case in the Village there are one or two moments that do reveal some sort of 'vision' in the works, a shot or two that stand out as impressive... and then we get put back into the ""what-the-bleep"" clockwork of this overwrought ""message"" movie that says, apparently, that what we don't know from nature and probably can't know since we can't really trust science will kill us. And all the while Shyamalan almost creates something inadvertently very entertaining; I can imagine the Happening becoming one of those classic bad movies years from now, so entirely dumbfounding with its totally serious-toned acting, dead-pan dialog and awfully staged violence (i.e. lion feeding, lawnmower) that one can't help but find it riotous.<br/><br/>Maybe Shyamalan can continue his career that way, who knows? One thing is for certain: the guy is NOT the next Hitchcock or the next Spielberg. He's lucky the wind hasn't knocked him off his feet completely."

","I think Shyamalan should be praised for the courage to still do this movie while knowing all the way that it will obviously multiply the army of his haters. And I fully agree with Roger Ebert: this movie has a special charm that will be effective for some. It’s a slow thing, with very little action and less explanation of what is it exactly happening. Still I guess it's one more worst case scenario for the humanity that does have some dim point in it. «Happening» is a strange movie, not cut by the common patterns of all pictures about death-threats capable of destroying mankind. And it has its certain audience of those who will admit they’d behave just the same way as heroes do. Perhaps this movie might serve as a test of a level of one’s cynicism and flexibility of some kind. All the reactions in fact lie between two basic: “oh what a crap” and “why not, if mutant lizard Godzilla, huge ape and little aliens had their chance to decrease the population of NY why freaked out trees could not?» Also I find duet Walberg/Deschanel very charming, unexpectedly charming I should say. Those two play love in a way that you truly believe there’s some.<br/><br/>After all I like what Shyamalan does and I hope he can and will do better. And that he would not loose the rest of his credibility in the eyes of the studios after this one."

","THE HAPPENING is a great example of someone coming up with a good premise for a story then sabotaging it at every turn . The premise might seem somewhat fanciful but given some intelligent development we could have seen a movie that was compelling . Instead we ended watching a film that has the audience pointing out what a ridiculous film it is <br/><br/>In his defence M Night Shyamalan knows how to draw his audience in to a story . The opening scenes featuring construction workers throwing themselves from a building do have an impact to it but once it's revealed what the cause of the mass suicide is then it quickly falls apart . The plants are releasing toxins driving humans insane . So why does the outbreak seem to start off in a city ? I'm just sort of guessing there's considerably less plant life in an urban setting than a rural one . Of course a city will have news media outlets that will report this as breaking news but it's never insinuated that the outbreak has started anywhere else than in the city <br/><br/>There's also a lack of imagination involving the victims . Construction workers throw themselves off buildings . Fair enough but if someone shoots themselves then someone else will pick up their gun and either shoot themselves with it or shoot other people . The symptoms of this toxin poisoning borders on an almost gestaltic effect . Everyone seems to get poisoned at exactly the same point in time and display the exact same symptoms which damages any credibility . If we all had food poisoning wouldn't we all be affected to a different degree in a slightly different time frame ? <br/><br/>Actually this leads to the film's main failing . No matter what happens to unnamed / minor characters the main protagonists Elliot Moore and his family remain unaffected even though they travel through the plant strewn countryside . Not only that but if there's any plot contrivance or exposition needed then they'll always make contact or be contacted or meet someone unaffected along with the fact characters come to conclusions that they almost certainly would have no knowledge of . Hands up who noticed that Elliot Moore is always in the right place at the right time when there's a plot turn explained ? One is continually reminded that you're watching a film when this happens and not a very good one either . By the time we get to the cop out ending you'll be beyond caring <br/><br/>I wouldn't say THE HAPPENING is Shymalan's worst film and it's better than LADY IN THE WATER and THE VILLAGE but only slightly better . One can't help thinking the film would have worked far better if there'd have been a bit more violence and nihilism along with common sense involved and you're left thinking that this writer/director had some good ideas throughout his career but continually shoots himself in the foot by thinking he's making a Walt Disney movie .

Every scene that was supposed to be either heartbreaking, terrifying or downright creepy was completely shattered by some mind-numbingly stupid response like ""cheese and crackers!""

It spins around in circles, taking itself seriously then suddenly busting out a line like ""You know hot dogs get a bad rap? They got a cool shape."" It's negotiable when this movie jumps the shark, but i'm going to give it more credit than it deserves and say it's when Elliot starts talking to a plastic tree.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough, the movie gives itself away after a grand total of 5 minutes.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I don't care who directed this movie, and I don't care what else he has made, it was bad.<br/><br/>1/10"

All you need to know is that there is an unexplained phenomenon that is inexplicably exterminating human beings in and around the North American region.<br/><br/>This movie is such an enigmatic horror movie that reminds me of Radiohead's music video for ""Just"" and also mirrors classic horror flicks of the 60's, specifically much like Alfred Hitchcock's many works, it also has that Stephen King feel to it. Shyamalan has gone back what he is good at; tapping at the power of fear. And fear is what you get, as The Happening creates a realistic state of imminent threat creating a paranoia that easily infects the audience. The film actually belongs to the Twilight Zone sort of sci-fi suspense; it is freaky and frighteningly mysterious, injected with a B-movie appeal but with a strong sense of realism.<br/><br/>The music was also an excellent mood-setter that appropriately enhances its very unsettling setting. The cast gave a convincing performance, with Mark Wahlberg, and the very charming Zooey Deschanel on the lead; they are supported by explosive performances by John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, and a very disturbing role played by Betty Buckley. Shyamalan's direction of making the movie simplistic, non-flashy, and just lets its realistic storyline simply unfold without any unnecessary visual gimmicks. The story simply doesn't even attempt to make a detailed accurate scientific explanation, because the main character in this sort of movie is the fear, not the science. The fear feels real up to the point that I feel like I couldn't just wait till the main characters overcome this threat they're facing.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just because I expected so little, but The Happening really took me by surprise, and if you ask me, this movie was way scarier than Sixth Sense. If you want a really good scare or a really good scream, and get to learn a little something as well, THE HAPPENING is something you should watch."

","In my opinion, one of the most genius shows ever made. why i think it points to the global financial crisis?<br/><br/>-It all begins in New York (the financial capital of the world).<br/><br/>-The disappearance of bees. (bees being the element of wealth transfer and growth and their disappearance in fold-ups of banks, investment houses, etc).<br/><br/>-The Cause of the toxin that switches off the part of the brain that keeps us from harming ourselves, which leaves people killing themselves (any economical crisis being the most important suicide factor).<br/><br/>-Phenomenon of people standing still and walking backwards (people stop to think, put a stop to many things, and often take a step backwards in life).<br/><br/>-In the movie, the toxin hits first the highly populated big cities, then spreads to all connected populations.

"Buck_Vinegar","10","47","94","15 June 2008"," People will talk about this film 10 years from now
","I don't know where else to write about this so I'm going to write about it here. First, I have enjoyed all Shyamalan's films because aside from being plain good movies, there's always a deeper principle to consider that makes his films more like fables or parables than just a plain old movie that helps kill an hour or two. That being said, watching the Happening and assuming it's just a movie about some people who get dead for no apparent reason is like reading Animal Farm and assuming it's a story about animals. Rather, it appears that Shyamalan is trying to make a much bigger point with his films, this one in particular, let me explain. In all of Shyamalan's movies, the main character is called to more carefully consider what's happening around him/ her, and in some cases, to take decisive action based on an enhanced awareness of the situation. Then, as with any fable or parable, the movie-goer may ask him/ herself if parallels exist in their own life where points made in the film may apply. Further, in each of his previous films, Shyamalan has always made some small appearance except in Lady in the Water, where he played a fairly central character. In that character, Shyamalan, through character he portrayed, had the opportunity to say that he had a story to tell, a story that he believed would cost him his life. Some said his lengthy appearance in that film was a testament to his ego, but in The Happening, he does something he had not done in his previous films - he did not appear once. Rather, it could be argued that The Happening is the story Shyamalan (or his character) was talking about in Lady in Water, the story with the point he wanted to make that he believed may cost him his life. Aside from the story, the things to take note of first are the opening credits with the numerous studios and companies involved in getting this movie on the screen; this was not a part time project, this was a major undertaking. Second, the acting; yes it's flat, yes it's understated, but the acting is not the point; (see also: felt-board from Sunday School) AS FOR THE STORY: Think of it in general terms: After a brief shot of the strangely vacant New York skyline, a woman dies after being stabbed in the neck. Workers fall to their death from high-rise buildings. Regular citizens, construction workers, and civil servants lose their lives. Several deaths then occur in rural Pennsylvania. Paranoia sets in, people are on the run, even if they don't know where they're going or what they're running from. Sound familiar? In The Happening, just after 8:30 am EST, woman in the park dies by stabbing herself in the neck. Prior to 8:44 am EST on 9/11 when the first plane struck the first tower, the first woman killed on board that airplane was the stewardess who had her throat cut with the now infamous box-cutter. As the story progresses, people deal with a threat that they can never actually see in a variety of familiar ways: some head out to the rural countryside, some become suspicious and hostile toward people they would have otherwise helped, some occupy their minds with various distractions in spite of an obvious danger (math problems), some subscribe to conspiracy theories (""it was the government""), and some elect an ""isolationist policy"" (Mrs. Jones). The one point Shyamalan strives to make clear at several points throughout the film is that THERE ARE FORCES AT WORK BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING. If you haven't guessed yet, **THIS FILM IS ABOUT TERRORISM AND THE PEOPLE WHO BRING IT**. The characters in the film can't see it, can't run from it, can't hide from it, and can't ignore it. The turning point finally comes when, in a conversation familiar to any number of soldiers serving overseas, Elliot (Wahlberg) is sitting in a dingy room having a conversation with his wife, isolated in another building (""I wish you were here..."") he decides that there is something, in this case his family, that he is willing to risk his safety to protect. At this point in the film, at a time between 9:30 and 10:00am EST, the attack ends in a field in rural Pennsylvania. This is the same time window and location of the crash of flight 93, the final event of 9/11. At the end of the film, in an interview similar to many interviews that occurred in the aftermath of 9/11, a scientist suggests that what has occurred should serve as a warning, but is discounted by the interviewer due to speculation that what occurred being an isolated event and would probably not happen again. But at the films' end, it does happen somewhere else; it happens in France, a country where neighborhoods exist that police cannot safely enter due to a violent Islamic population. Lastly, I see that the working title for this film was The Green Planet and it reminded me of a fact I learned while in Afghanistan: a small colored flag is flown over the grave of a man who died performing Jihad; the color of that flag is green. In this light and in the interest of his own safety,(see: Salman Rushdie) it makes sense for Shyamalan to execute this film in such an abstract fashion. The message may be debated but I certainly applaud the manner in which he carried it out."

","Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The people before you, namely, the producers, directors and writers of 'The Happening', stand accused of a major crime against cinema. These people have with malice aforethought, conspired to murder large swathes of the cinema-going population by boring them to death. They have willfully contrived to assault the sensibilities of innocent movie theatre customers with a barrage of visual nonsense. In an elaborate and wicked plot, they have, in order to carry out this heinous crime, employed various henchmen disguised as actors. Under false pretences and with the aid of publicity agencies, they have together managed to lure innocent cinema-goers into movie theatres and subjected them to 91 minutes of mind-numbing, stultifying torture.<br/><br/>Many are the reports of film fans stumbling towards cinema exits in an attempt to regain their sanity. To regain once again a reason for living. For there is no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that this film has left many people wondering if there is any point to living at all. 'If humanity', they have wondered, 'is capable of producing such infantile nonsense, then what is the point of being part of humanity?'. And indeed, as many have also asked, 'What is the point of going to the cinema?'.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I have laid the facts before you. If you insist in seeing the evidence for yourselves, I can only hope that you have the will and strength of mind to withstand 91 minutes during which you may experience the near-death of your cinematic sensibilities. I submit to you that there is only one verdict you must bring: that the people responsible for creating the movie, 'The Happening', are guilty as charged. Guilty of a major crime against cinema! I rest my case."
"eonbluedan-1","2","18","32","6 January 2011"," What the hell is this?
","After the soaring success and near hysteria over ""The Sixth Sense"", a hysteria I didn't think it worthy of I might add, M. Night Shyamalan has failed to achieve the same level of success with subsequent efforts. I think it fair to say, however, that with each one he has gradually succeeded in becoming one of the most frustrating directors in the history of cinema. His initial ideas aren't at all bad (on the contrary, the ideas for his films tend to be rather compelling), but I have become rather accustomed to the fact that he nearly always drops the ball, the only variable from one film to the next being when this is going to happen. I say nearly, because in fairness ""Signs"" was a pretty well-crafted, gripping piece of work, albeit with a rather tenuous conclusion.<br/><br/>It turns out, with ""The Happening"", the ball is dropped rather quickly, and never really gets picked up again. It opens well enough, the first five minutes throwing us straight into the bizarre events, and fully achieves the intended audience reaction of, ""What is going on?"" Then we're back to that frustration, with our attention very quickly being drawn to other issues, like the misjudged pacing, the 'made for television"" shooting style, the clunky dialogue that is often nothing more than plot exposition, and the pastiche performances that appear to have actually been directed to be as hammy and obvious as possible, because you don't get this level of awful by accident.<br/><br/>Even if an actor isn't particularly great, it takes a special talent to draw a performance from them that is as plastic as the plant they end up talking to. Mark Wahlberg is a perfectly competent actor; he won't be winning any ""Best Actor"" Oscars anytime soon, but it is fair to say he serves his purpose in a film, so you have to wonder how on earth it is that every line he delivers is stilted and unreal. At first I wondered if it was his discomfort with the material, but quickly realised this phenomenon applied to pretty much the entire cast; actors you recognise as good at what they do, looking completely out of their depth, a very strange experience.<br/><br/>A big issue I very quickly had with ""The Happening"" was the nasty sense I got of being patronised, and it even reached a point where I genuinely wondered if Shyamalan had decided with this film to do nothing more than make fun of his audience. As is nearly always the case, he develops ideas far above his station, and his view of himself as a visionary and hugely clever director gets the better of him. The problem being that this time, I suspect even he got lost in the ideas. With plot points and explanations (or lack thereof) being contradictory, it begins to feel as though he really never knew how he was going to resolve what he had set up in the first place, and so resorted to making it up as he went along. He ends up relying on the sound-bite that ""we'll never really know everything"", and expects that to be an acceptable coat hook on which to hang any unaddressed issue. This film does not give license for that, and the result is that he simply loses your trust.<br/><br/>So was there anything I liked? As I say, the premise is good, and the score works as best as it can with such an awful set of images. Note to director: Attempting to personify the wind with 'dramatic' shots of fields is not innovative, it's just stupid! After films like ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"", all of which hit a different level of failure, you would think he would begin to accept he is simply an ""ideas man"", eat some humble pie, and pass all future thoughts on to somebody who can actually turn his ideas, which are more often than not perfectly fine unto themselves, into good pieces of cinema. Of course he doesn't! Instead, we get ""The Happening"", with Shyamalan once again doing everything (writing, producing and directing), and once again messing it up very badly! Better luck next time."

There is no recognizable plot, but somehow is an underlying message to the American public to fight global warming so that we don't anger the local fauna.

"DICK STEEL","8","37","74","13 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Happening
","To me, this is not a movie about finding out what the issue at hand is, or trying to crack the mystery behind the phenomenon, or even about figuring out what the twist, if any, would be. It's a story about communication, how we, in today's context, are so reliant on mass media delivering every bit of incident deemed newsworthy, and providing that amped up ""insights"" to send us to paranoia. If you notice of late, we have been bombarded with crisis after crisis, or could it really be instead, the flavour of the moment that the mass media drums up? Avian Flu? Food Crisis? Fuel Crisis? Business Continuity? Terrorism? The list goes on, with news editors determining what to drum up, and where to send everyone crying out that the sky is falling. The Happening does just that, as we see newsflash after newsflash providing speculation after speculation that everyone listens, and accedes to.<br/><br/>But it's not just the mass media alone, but the story also puts the spotlight on how reliant we are on our mobile devices, so much so that they actually have already become second nature to us. If we want to talk to someone, we pick up the phone, or we text the person. Gone is the value of face to face communications, as we talk to one another through an electronic device and medium. And we all know what happens to these wireless gadgets come a crisis, when base stations get knocked out, and we feel incapacitated, and so alone. And the rare occasion when our little island experiences unexpected power brownouts and we lose connectivity, we go into fits and strangely enough, feel at a loss at what to do next?<br/><br/>We are creatures who must talk to one another, otherwise I guess we'll go insane, and not everyone's cut out to be a hermit living alone, making that informed decision choosing to be cut off from the outside world and be self-sufficient. Perhaps that's why isolation has been designed as punishment, and one probably might go a little bit cranky, losing social skills. Just like how the prominent old lady in The Happening become overly suspicious of every wee thing that doesn't go her way.<br/><br/>Shyamalan gave us probably the weakest protagonist in his tales to date. We are familiar with Mark Wahlberg in his many alpha-male action roles, like those in The Italian Job remake, or his sharpshooter Sniper. Here, his Elliot is a school science teacher who's the most clueless amongst all clueless characters in Shyamalan's fictional worlds. He absolutely, like the audience, has no idea what's going on, has no plan, and doesn't hesitate to tell everyone just that, exhibiting some classic deer-caught-in-the-headlights look with wide eyes and flared nostrils. Even Keanu Reeves pale in comparison to what Wahlberg managed to do here. Zooey Deschanel's Alma too plays Elliot's just as clueless wife, only that she's harbouring a secret that you can decipher the minute it gets suggested on screen. Throughout the movie, husband and wife has to sort of issues as the clock ticks down to doomsday, and just like The Incredible Hulk, this little love story slowly grew in importance.<br/><br/>And to pre-empt those who would dislike the movie, you're likely to find fault with the distinct lack of scares - OK, there's really one jump-from-your-seat moment, and various other scenes with an unflinching camera in the many faces of death - and the exclamation of ""you mean that's it?"" The build up is masterfully done, though the ending might be a little bit abrupt and I suspect there might be some cutting of corners which might find their way to the DVD. Forget the fact that The Happening had to undergo some massive rewrites by Shyamalan for it to be accepted by the studios. Forget that this movie contains elements of suggestion that it's eco-warfare and Mother Nature is fighting back with results as significant as that we've already seen and experienced, with unbearable temperatures and disasters of large magnitudes. Like movies such as The Mist, while it's about the great unknown, it also serves as a warning that one day, just one day, we might be faced with questions we have no answers to, and to compound the problem, we're no longer collaborating and communicating effectively to work toward a solution. And that is a scary thought indeed."
"polarbeargrizzlylove","1","9","14","23 September 2013"," What Happened?
","In this horrible global warming and nature spellbound movie, Mark Wahlberg (Elliot ),Zooey Deschanel (Alma), John Leguizamo (Julian ) and Ashlyn Sanchez (Jess); are survivors of an unknown attack that is said to have started in New York 's Central Park. The unknown threat is plaguing the planet with confusion and the current population is no longer thriving in numbers. They are trying to make it to the place that is not experiencing whatever is happening. The basic theme is the human population is being threatened by an unknown source and only the remaining population will be able to stop what is happening.<br/><br/>Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a teacher who should be a student of acting with this boyishly played role. His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) has joined Elliot with his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) in what is happening. Leguizamo must have been confused in the reading of the script, he is just not one to take serious for helping mankind. Elliot has baggage of his disconnected girlfriend Alma (Zooey Deschanel) who is tagging along and is of little help with what is happening. <br/><br/>This horrible rendition of global threats and population predisposition has no bar under the movie I AM Legend , in which we (the audience) at least had a hold of what happened. The dark comedy that Mark Wahlberg did not display control over got lost in a show tune at the door. Not to mention his bad acting. There are few scenes that have a tacky approach to what was happening in the minds of the reaming population that is still in the dark about what happened. The misuse and over usage of the word ""happening"" could have just been edited out entirely. Seriously the look on Elliot's face when calming his friend Julian down made me feel like I was going to hear the director say ""cut"". I do not know what's happening with that. <br/><br/>The location of the natural surroundings added a personal feel to the soon to be dollar movie. The angles of the camera gave the sense that the entire population was in a panic and at risk with what was happening. <br/><br/>The viewing of this movie can be prevented. If you want to know what is happening do not bother watching the movie The Happening. At the end of it you will find yourself asking the same question from the beginning. What is happening?"
"ReadingFilm","10","12","20","30 March 2019"," Night gets revenge on the critics a second time by murdering humanity.
","The premise of suicide-inducing spores in audiences inspired the same reaction (you should have seen the reaction of the opening night crowd in 2008), in hindsight it now years later feels prophetic and right.<br/><br/>* You laugh at the bizarre timing and black humor of the deaths but I might put it that it shows death so horrifyingly banal that it was impossible to not be funny. Still I wonder if they did any test screenings at all, they must have known exactly which beats were missold as comic.<br/><br/>* Night's 'it's a B movie like The Blob just have a good time' argument at the time didn't stop the hate. But isn't that exactly what it is? As perfectly Hitchcockian as it is it retains its own original brand with the Fujimoto images, Newton Howard score, and MNS staging, I see the classic here as within his continuum.<br/><br/>* The 70s use of happenings, meant some kind of a gathering usually for some mind-expanding LSD binge. So what is the ritual here? The parallel to the hippies with the title is very occult; you can't ignore that at all with the hippie grounding in Aleister Crowley and Satanism. Fringe thinking points to a pattern where all these secret societies push on about overpopulation and climate danger. So beyond being a nihilistic catharsis following the unfair critical pannings, see how it unfolded ever since: today's whole idea of collectives completely mindwashed without independent thought, and it's information that is the weapon and here they so scramble for some information. Any. But there's none. Why did it seem the government left them all entirely to their own devices to just scramble about, then die? Military and martial law would come down so very quickly on it, wouldn't it? He is even aware of this sort of thinking, adding: 'most people believe it was the government.'<br/><br/>The sheer amount of extras and how they are portrayed as stupid and helpless and in a panic clues us into how Shyamalan viewed this film as some sort of ritual cleansing against humanity. Its motive aligns almost exactly with current day fringe thinking how the elite plan to usher in a transhumanist utopia; then so the 'happening' requires a cleansing first, a celebration of the slaughter before we 'merge together into enlightened thinking'. The film ending on that frightening reappearance of the happening shows some kind of coordination in events. It's not one event but part of the all seeing eye, watchful and invisible, who guide us and know better. This force is both cleansing and uniting in search of the worthy.<br/><br/>* One of the chessmaster elders in the Village is here as the bumbling idiot hotdog guy completely powerless against the greater evil which is metaphysical rather than Village's wicked but well meaning human control structure. Love saves the heroes in both, as the wind seems to read their intent like the mood rings, so spares the good. But love's function isn't cleansing as in that, here it goes with a different beat... meaning<br/><br/>* We have Deschanel's coldness and lovelessness manifesting as this 'plant nuclear war' testing against the uselessness of her husband until he proves himself, so the love can go on. This parallels nature being a symbol of her womanhood corrupted and testing the worth of humanity. Deschanel's wide eyes as opposed to Bryce Dallas Howard are not unifying but chilling. A deleted scene clues in this was all about Night's inferiority complex and fear of woman. The hot dog guy talks to the plants as if they're his children. Wahlberg talks to the plant, but it's plastic; a joke about the plasticity and empty childlessness of his marriage. The lemon drink woman is Deschanel's future, just one scene with her and Deschanel instantly goes to reveal vulnerability and fear, apologizing for infidelity and embracing her feelings for him.<br/><br/>* But the madness of the ending. Will you ever anywhere else hear chilling piano music playing over the couple's supposed happy ending that she's pregnant? It made me sit up...implying almost subliminally the shame this disease of humanity will continue.<br/><br/>* The wind reading you ala the mood ring is further proven how there's always one who doesn't freeze into hypnosis and questions it. Which brings all sorts of transhumanist 'worthy of living' eugenics arguments to the table here, that only the most noble and enlightened get to survive.<br/><br/>* On a more positive note, how cool and beautiful is it they embrace in the wind at the end? Entirely removed from context, it's just people walking through a breeze. To me that's the power of Night's conceptual genius."

","All that's good lays in the beginning.<br/><br/>At the plot's level. YES, it's smart and paranoid enough to make a movie script out of the idea that nature might restore the balance by making the plants produce an airborne toxin that will short-circuit the human brain's neurotransmitters, reversing the self-protection instincts and thus conducing to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the clever part finishes here, at the premise's level. What could have been a Crichton-like microbiological hard-science-fiction deflates into a primitive hide-and-chase story that fails to evolve into a rigorous structure.<br/><br/>And within the first 15 minutes time-frame. YES, the two opening attacks, in Central Park and in Philly, are not only freaky, but also stylish. I liked especially the dry and cynical way to shoot the suicidal jumps from the scaffolding, and the policeman's gun that follows a deathly course from one person to another. But here is where good cinema ends. Following this, the script becomes illogical and messy, and the direction, although narratively skillful, turns sugary and pathetic (mainly in the didactic shots of hands holding each other, or people staring with huge saucer-eyes, as if trying to convey some tragic ""Ooops!""). The ending is boring and anticlimactic, not worth the pain of having followed until then a story that had started so well, only to fail into the most amateurish way.<br/><br/>And worse, the basic plot is TOTALLY illogical, beginning right at the start - for instance: could anyone explain why were those plants giving themselves so much trouble to short-circuit the cerebral neurotransmitters blabla (see above) when it should been incomparably simpler to concoct a toxin able to cause heart failure? Don't forget one of the cardinal rules of the Nature's ways: always go for the simplest solution!"

","I'm a sci-fi fan and its been a drought for us on original science-based fiction. Everything is a remake, based on a book or comic or a sequel. So it was with that objective in mind, I was eager to see the ""The Happening"". The premise of this movie had the makings of a top notch science-based movie. Leaving the theater, I am left asking what happened? This was not sci-fi, as the trailers lead me to believe, in even the most liberal use of the genre categorization IMO. Sci-fi fans will be much let down and should not see this movie looking for that element to be developed. <br/><br/>So its not sci-fi, it could still be a good movie right? Well unfortunately it is not. The trailers also made this movie look a bit like Signs, which many people hated but I liked. Signs is all I'm going to say about Shyamalan, I'm not going to get into the ""high-brow"" critiquing of the director or whatever. I never care about any of that, for me a movie is about entertainment and if its worth my time. For many of you, whether a movie is worth your money is probably also significant (since you pay so much for movies). This movie is not worth your time or money. It wasn't even worth the >US$3 I paid to see it in THX, DLP, DTS, reserved seating, etc and it definitely wasn't worth my time.<br/><br/>Movies, for me, are about story and how well that story is told. Effects, actors and the rest are all elements of telling the story and how they do is ultimately how well the story is told. The only time I was actually into this movie was in the beginning. I actually thought this would be a great movie at that point, but after around 10 minutes or so, that was it. It was then an hour and a couple dozen or so minutes of nothing. I wasn't drawn into the story, there was no air of suspense or tension, there was nothing. I know the approximate time marks because I checked my watch a half dozen times during this movie. I was so disengaged that I suggested to my girlfriend we sneak into the theater's bathroom for some actual entertainment, but she declined :(.<br/><br/>I have to compare this movie a bit to Signs, because that was what I went in thinking this movie would be like. So if you find my review totally off, then this is where the disconnect would be, but I don't believe I am anywhere off base here, as my girlfriend (who I saw the movie with) totally agrees with me. While many people didn't like Signs, I found that it created a nice atmosphere of tension with climaxes and plot elements which kept me involved and engaged. That was totally lacking in this movie. It was more like a superficial attempt to do that, using those jump out and say ""boo"" elements which are so trite and overused, but lacking anything that set the sage to have those ""boo"" moments mean something.<br/><br/>I felt that Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were underwhelming. Knowing Wahlberg's ability I almost can't help but blame other people. However, even with a bad script or poor direction I expected more from Wahlberg. This is one of those bad movies where you expect someone like John Leguizamo to be able to steal the show. Sadly, even he was flat and his character's role was slightly confusing. I wouldn't be surprised if Leguizamo's acting was hampered by his own difficulty with understanding his role in the story.<br/><br/>Instead of a 0, this got a 3 from me because there was some good. The first 10-20 minutes were interesting, there were some really beautiful shots and there was nice use of elemental effects. Nothing worth your time or money though, I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental, it was that bad."

It is, by a long stretch, the single worst attempt at a movie I've seen on my 36 years on this planet. I made it all the way to the end out of pure fascination that this attempt at a movie was actually released to the public, and it left me wondering if there'll ever come a point where the public can sue directors for wasting significant periods of people's lives after deceptively coercing people into sitting through this filth with no warning of how dreadful it is. It's not even an opinion either, this attempt at a movie is factually awful in every respect. Please, I beg of you, only watch this if you wish to take on a new low in your life, a bottom of the barrel benchmark in which frankly nothing else that you watch from this point onwards could possibly be worse. It's all up from here. This film should be deleted from all publicly available services with immediate effect, life is too short to waste some of it being subjected to this utter toilet of a film."

","I've never been much of a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films. 'His debut film 'The Sixth Sense' was a competent effort. 'Signs' started off interestingly as the focus was more on the psychological aspect until Shyamalan presents the aliens at which point it becomes just another silly man versus alien flick. Then there was the horrendous 'Lady in the Water' and now 'The Happening' is just as bad if not worse. The only thing that makes 'Lady in Water' better is Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti's acting. The same cannot be said about the performances in 'The Happening'. Mark Wahlberg's animated expressions look forced. I can see that he's trying to do something different but he's picked the wrong movie. Zooey Deschanel, is far from impressive. She looks confused and uninterested most of the time. Then again, with such dreadful writing, who wouldn't be. John Leguizamo does the best he can with a tiny part. The execution is average. It's not anything one hasn't seen before. Shyamalan grossly fails both as writer and director. The script might as well have been written by a six year old. I guess one good thing about this film is the eye-candy countryside setting. As pretentious as the 'The Happening' is, I found it to be unintentionally funny for the most part. It can be categorized as a so-bad-it's-good-type movie."

I am truly sorry MNS, but I will never see you again.<br/><br/>I have seen many miss-guided reviews saying that this is a ""thinking man's"" movie and the people who write bad reviews ""don't get it.""

","This movie can be summed up very easily, interesting but lacking plot. M Night spent too much of his budget on casting Wahlberg to afford sufficient special effects to give this movie a cleaner look. With as poor as the effects in this movie are it makes you wonder what they spent the 60 million dollar budget on, they clearly could not have spent anywhere near that The Matrix had a 63 million dollar budget...<br/><br/>This is a suspenseful thriller with a mediocre plot. By far it is M Night's worst movie. There is a reason why this movie was written, directed, and produced by him, because no one else was willing to take a chance with it and after seeing the film you will understand why."

","I didn't realise director's could get type-cast too... or Shyamalan just enjoys the spooky, supernatural, Twilight Zone stuff to the exclusion of all else.<br/><br/>Well anyway his enjoyment is infectious and I love the ride. There hasn't been another such distinctive and commercial director like him since Spielberg. A Shyamalan film is almost its own genre now - we know what sort of story to expect and we also know that we'll get a certain quality of direction and production that's beautifully shot, effectively scored and really immersive.<br/><br/>What critics often forget is that even a mediocre Shyamalan film is still better than 73.5% of other Hollywood output. They can't see the forest for the trees! The Happening is rooted in familiar Shyamalan territory, but the bark is worse than the bite - this is spooky more than horror (no bad thing) - but you'll still leaf the cinema feeling relieved and uneasy (but maybe because of Wahlberg's wooden performance - he certainly can't branch too far out of his comfort zone - pretty unconvincing here as a science teacher. Sap!).<br/><br/>So... not without it's faults but still lots of fun, and not nearly as silly as the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg is dead, long live Shyamalan! (Okay, that is too harsh)"
"flumpman-1","2","28","56","14 June 2008"," Not bad at all!
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but I have been intrigued by it for many months now for two reasons: <br/><br/>a) M Night Syhamalan generally delivers a good story with a killer twist <br/><br/>b) It looked quite spooky and bizarre in the trailer and I wanted to know what was ""happening"". <br/><br/>I was a little apprehensive about it as I thought Lady in the Water was plain awful but The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village were all very good and Unbreakable was interesting enough to keep my attention so I figured it would be a good story! I was right...<br/><br/>From the opening scene my attention was grabbed and I was thrown in full throttle as people started killing themselves for absolutely no reason. The first 5 minutes is deeply disturbing and brilliantly shot and for the next half hour or so it is intense and captivating in every way...but then that changes! Within 40 minutes you know what is ""happening"" and it is a little disappointing and not a great deal happens in the next 40 minutes (but there is one scene involving a lawn mower which is great). But then the last 10 minutes picks it up again and there are some real jumpy moments and then we get a nice ending and a decent closing scene.<br/><br/>All in all this is much better than I expected and some critics have slammed it - I personally would give 8/10 for the first 40 minutes, 4/10 for the next 40 minutes and 8/10 for the last 10 minutes which rounds up to a nice...<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>Go see it, it isn't all that bad!"

","This is the first film I have ever commented on, because usually I just read them, but this one definitely deserved my time- not in a good way. First, let me say that I consider the Sixth Sense one of the best horror films of all time, and I definitely love many of his films, and I I will give him a break on Signs and The Village. But this movie was M. Night Shyamalan worse work ever. And Im not over exaggerating.<br/><br/>I was very excited to see The Happening, the previews looked good and I was longing to see a good horror film, but what I got was an empty theatre and me and my friend laughing the entire movie. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, for a while I thought this movie might be a joke or something. The plot was stupid, the acting was horrible, nothing made sense, and the film was loaded with pointless characters that said a few random lines. I don't have one positive thing to say about it, I walked out of the theatre upset and angry.<br/><br/>This R rated film should have been rated PG-13, it should not have been rushed, and in all honesty, it should not have been made.<br/><br/>And if you like Mark Wahlburg-don't see it. ( Aside from his horrible acting, and I love Mark Wahlburg, watching him talk to a tree just completely ruined him for me.) Im not usually so harsh, but trust me on this...this movie was an embarrassment. I will admit that I thought it was hilarious though.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed...wait until it comes on TV."

","This latest movie by the redoubtable Mr. Shyamalan is being ripped to shreds. Seems Hollywood's former golden boy earns nothing but disgust and disdain nowadays. Say what you will about this guy, his movies are DIFFERENT. He does not follow the all-too-standardized templates, prevalent in every genre from action to horror to sci-fi. Are his films flawed and uneven at times? Yes, every single one has been. They all have this in common.<br/><br/>They also have in common uncommon storytelling, fantastic mood, appropriately chilling scores, and engender a sense of unease in the viewer that almost no other filmmaker has been capable of.<br/><br/>Were there mistakes in the plot, character development, editing? Yeah. And you know what? Nonetheless, I was enthralled. This man imbues his films, however flawed, with passion, something lacking in most big-budget summer blockbusters. Whatever his technical shortcomings, this is a filmmaker who truly loves to tell a story. Golden Boy status-worthy or not, I applaud Shyamalan and his latest movie. The man has got the cojones to think originally and make movies that no one else could, or would. ""The Happening"" rocks! -MKA, Ft Walton Beach, FL"
"asalem182","6","50","109","11 June 2008"," The Pre-Release Negative Buzz was Deserved. Sorta.
","I never understood why critics (and audiences) were so hard on M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly believe that Lady in the Water and The Village are his best films (sue me!). That's why I overlooked The Happening's negative buzz, and went to see it on its opening day. To my surprise, critics were right (for the most part), and Shyamalan has disappointed me for the first time.<br/><br/>The idea of an airborne toxic that causes people to unconsciously hurt themselves is genuinely original, creepy, and effective. Fittingly, Shyamalan comes up with the scariest death scenes in recent memory. My fiancée had to cover her eyes multiple times. Moreover, The Happening has a couple of excellent jump scares. Needless to say, Shyamalan is still excellent at composing his scenes. And as usual, James Newton Howard's score rocks. Unfortunately, that's were the good news ends.<br/><br/>The very first scene of The Happening puts you right in the middle of the action. But that's probably why the film runs out of steam so quickly. This should've been a 75-80 minute film. Basically, nothing happens in the second half. We're just introduced to a couple of freaky, freaky characters. Mrs. Jones in particular did get huge laughs at my showing. And BTW, I was perfectly fine with the explanation the film came up with. After all, this is a super-natural thriller.<br/><br/>Shyamalan was always able to get excellent performances out of his leads. I'd even say that's his trademark. However, Mark Wahlberg totally lets him down. He was terrible. He has same look on his face whether he's scared, joking, or thinking. The tone of his voice rarely changed as well. His turn single-handedly eliminates the emotional impact of a lot of scenes. Remember Lady in the Water's Healing scene? I cried like a baby when I saw that. The Happening has a similar ""redemption"" scene, but frankly, I couldn't care less. Deschanel was even worse. She was just standing there, reciting her lines. She got better near the end though."

","When he made movies that had an unexpected twist to explain the events in the movie, people complained and said that it was stupid. Now that he delivers a movie with unexplainable answers, people still complain and said that it is stupid. Shyamalan is a brilliant director and writer that stays a step of the audience. I agree that the acting was at times dry and dull but some how it fit the theme and tone of the movie. Before watching this movie, I steered away from any press, comments, or critics because I knew that Shyamalan would not fail to bring something new and different to the screen. I enjoy all types of movies but it is refreshing to see a director step outside of the box from the usual action movies, romantic comedies, over hyped indie films, parody movies, and computer animated movies."
"cherrywild","10","22","43","13 June 2008"," A Brilliant Movie that makes you think...
","Really, this movie was great! A bit of Asian philosophy, Bio-communication, Earthly energy and more. Many people are use to being told what to think these days that they become too lazy to even look for a well displayed message. So many people want to be told at the end of the movie exactly what happened in big bold letters, but life doesn't do that and really what happened to actually thinking and coming to a conclusion? I was so disappointed by some of the comments I heard after the movie ended, I just wanted to stand up and shout out that they didn't pay attention. I wanted to know if any of them have ever really thought outside the teachings of their bias schooling's. For me this was exactly what I thought it would be with even more of a message then I expected. It was funny in parts, gruesome in others and above all it made me think. This world is full of negative energy and egocentricity. Some people are so centered in on the ""individual"". What happens when people are so individual based (as much of the Western culture is)? They do for the ""me"" and not what is best for the ""all"", the planet which is the house for all is suffering. When people are so focused on themselves they do things without thinking about how in the ""big picture"" they are hurting others. Not caring for the planet is one of the outcomes of egocentric people. There is also so much negative energy that it creates more negative energy and it is really affecting people and the planet. I think his choice of the East coast area was a good one, because of the high population. The higher the population the more crime, hate and negative energy develops. This was a smart choice that makes the point easy to find, if the viewer is paying attention to all the details and then thinking about it. We need to think of others, respect other and love others. Realize it is not about ourselves, but about us all. We are all here together and if we were to realize this and work together we would intern take better care of our planet as well. Why? Because it is part of us, we can't live without it and if we truly cared about others we would care about the future of humanity. If we care about the future of humanity then we have no choice but to care for our planet, which is our life source. I love this movie. :)<br/><br/>I think the acting was exactly how it should have been for the type of movie he was making. MNS said himself this is a ""B"" type movie with a feel of a 50's thriller. Knowing that, the actors did what they were suppose to do. I can't wait to see it again on Tuesday!"

","M Night Shyamalan started out with The Sixth Sense, a chilling and moving ghost story. Then he made Unbreakable, an excellent superhero movie which isn't really a superhero movie. Then he made Signs, which is a good movie despite the backlash. Then he made The Village, which was not good. He then made Lady In The Water, an apparently dire film I can't be bothered to watch. Then he made this....thing. A mysterious force is causing everyone to commit suicide. This is a scary premise, right? Sadly, it's done no justice. But the film is scary. It's absolutely terrifying. Audience will be so horrified they will watch through their fingers as Mark Wahlberg tries to convince us he's a science teacher and lectures a student on science, scary scenes consisting of wind rustling the trees unfold in the most laughably unscary way, people die in a way which just isn't scary and a guy randomly rambles on about hot dogs. I could go on and on, but there is a word limit.<br/><br/>Although Shyamalan still has a gift with cinematography, that can't save this. Mark Wahlberg gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen a film, and sends the cringe factor right up. Everyone else is atrocious. The villain of the film is revealed to be wait for it..... plants! Plants! Plants. Seriously? Mark even tries to talk to one at one point. The script is one of the worst I've heard all year, and there are literally no defences to it at all. Shyamalan flops as a director for the first time, although this film isn't quite as bad as The Last Airbender. With numerous bizarre and random scenes, as well as plenty of terrible scary moments that could be from a comedy some may find this funny but for me, while Mark's science lecture had me cracking up, it just became a bit depressing after a while to see Shyamalan waste his talent in such a way. What happened? I urge you not to watch this film. Just stay well away from this. Throughout the film, whatever the title and marketing tell you... nothing is happening.<br/><br/>1/10"
"Aaron1375","3","5","7","26 June 2011"," Oh no! It's happening! M. Night is trying to make an R rated horror film and failing miserably!
","I think the only reason this particular M. Night film did as well as it did was the fact it was R rated. That sure was the main thing they pushed prior to its release, which should have been an indication that the studio did not really think much of this one. I sure did not after viewing this one. That is not completely fair, I was intrigued for the first fifteen or so minutes, but there really was not all that much happening in this one. It stars Mark Wahlberg whom for a time I kept going to his movies and I kept being disappointed. The last one I saw was ""Max Payne"" and I have not seen a film of his since having learned my lesson. I just do not care for him as he is the same guy in every film, a surly dour faced prick even when he is supposed to be a school teacher as he was in this one. Well things are happening as people begin dying, apparently killing themselves and in not so interesting ways. The scene where the people start falling to their deaths is almost amusing as it looks like something out of a Scary Movie film. John Leguizamo is okay in this movie and actually helps the film, but he is knocked out relatively early. So what is happening? Well I am not going to say, but the movie spells it out for you about halfway at most and it is completely idiotic. It makes the fact the characters are running here and there particularly stupid as well as the cause is all around them at some points and yet nothing happens to people in some areas while ten feet away it does! The film ends with a whimper, but at least there is no twist at the end, no M. Night this time went with the sort of twist relatively early. So while it starts out briskly it ends with a thud. It still irks me how pitiful that lawnmower scene played out as I imagined it a lot cooler and gruesome than it turned out. Me seeing this film again, likely not happening."
"gundognc","1","15","28","2 October 2008"," M Night Suicideporn's Disasterpiece
","M Night Shallamallamannamanallamana invites us to witness the next circuit of the downward spiral of his career. To say that The Happening is a bad film is an insult to bad films. Barring three good scenes, two at the beginning and one at the end, this film is awful.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* Marky Mark, a biology teacher is having problems with his girlfriend who may or may not be having an affair. You have to wonder if this has happened to M Night Shamelessman since this plot detail goes into almost every movie he makes. Perhaps he stopped reading after the chapter which said ""Creating drama through relationship problems"" in his copy of ""Introduction to Film-making"".<br/><br/>People in parks in New York and Philadelphia commit mass suicide in two very effective scenes at or near the beginning of the film. At first people think it is a terrorist attack and the cities are evacuated. Apparently there is a neurotoxin going around which shuts down the brain's ""self preservation function"", clearly there are lots of Americans wondering what it is like to shoot yourself in the head as these people don't just become a bit careless they go off on the whole Goth-self-harm kick in a big way.<br/><br/>Marky, his wife, best friend and best friend's daughter get on a train heading out of Philadelphia. After stopping in Sodomy PA the best friend leaves to find his wife, runs into the toxin and tops himself leaving Marky, his wife and the orphaned girl.<br/><br/>This is an apposite time to discuss what I suspect is M. Night Sillysod's primary reason for making this film, namely lashings and lashings of suicide-porn. We get everything here, people shooting themselves, stabbing themselves, slitting their wrists, jumping off buildings, hanging themselves and, memorably, lying down in front of a lawnmower. If you're considering suicide (and after watching this film you'd be forgiven for doing so) this movie really will give you a good idea of the options.<br/><br/>Marky works out that the neurotoxin is being released by the plants (biology teachers do that, right?)  and suddenly all those menacing shots of trees moving in the wind make sense; THE PLANTS ARE EVIL.<br/><br/>Yes, ladies and gentlemen this is the twist, apparently the plants have decided that we're a threat and have decided to eliminate us. As far as twists go this one is about as good as the one at the end of any book for children under the age of 4 (""Wow! Spot found his ball! What a twist!""). Frankly this film could have been improved by including a scene with a tree sitting in leather armchair wearing a smoking jacket saying ""I am, of course, delightfully mad!"".<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of films with twist endings, once you've seen such a film it is like a magic trick where you only see how it is done. Shallimoon's range of twists is fairly laughable in itself and includes the famous ""Oh my, you mean Bruce Willis, who clearly died in the first scene, is actually dead?!"" (Sixth Sense), the immortal ""Gosh, I can't believe that the baddie is the only other recognisable actor in the film!"" (Unbreakable) and the completely epic ""Oh my god, they're Amish?!"" (The Village). Mind you none have yet beaten the mind-blowing ""Oh my god there's no twist!"" from Lady in the Water which was actually quite surprising, although not really in a good way.<br/><br/>Immediately after the homicidal plant revelation the companions are chased by the wind. No, that's not a euphemism for the after effects of a particularly powerful curry and nine pints of beer, I mean that they actually spend some time running away from the wind which may be carrying lethal suicide inducing toxins. It's a funny thing about wind that it is normally difficult to decide where a particular bit of it starts or stops at a particular point. The film makers solve this by flying a helicopter near the ground but just out of shot so that the wind has a nice clean edge so that the characters can run away from it properly.<br/><br/>Eventually Marky, wifey and the child end up in a sort of micro-brew deliverance where they are threatened by lady-redneck who is, at turns, nice and psychotic. No problem, she's got by the evil wind-plant duo. Then, the whole problem just goes away and our heroes are okay. The final scene of the film replicates the mass suicide ones from the beginning but this time in France so we know that it isn't over yet. Perhaps this lays the foundations for ""The Happening 2: Still Happening"" - they should make this as a screwball comedy with Ben Stiller having been affected by the neurotoxin but unable to decide what method of suicide to use... with HILARIOUS CONSEQUENCES! *End Spoiler* This film really is dreadful. The acting is embarrassing and the script is awful. Possibly the only redeeming feature is that M Night Shantbeappearinginthisfilm doesn't make an appearance.<br/><br/>1/10"

The movie does make a lot of mistakes. Certain dialogues seem oddly familiar. The humour is at times contrived but, there are magical moments in the movie that reminds us how good Shyamalan is. After disappointing in "" the village"", and ""lady in the water"", ""The Happening"" signals the return to form of Shyamalan. Not among his best works, but one of his matured works.

","I love M. Night Shyamalan. He's a brilliant writer/director and I've been so impressed with his unique ideas or twists on previously attempted genres. This movie, however, I didn't really enjoy. Though, it is not for the same reasons as most other reviewers have stated.<br/><br/>The movie delivered no one-liners, no stand up acting from any particular actor/actress, and no real climax. Those are the good things. It felt real. The characters reacted in a very human way, no heroes, the lines didn't feel scripted. It felt as though the person sitting next to me would react the same way. Amazingly realistic. Almost too realistic. But, MNS has always been one to push the boundaries.<br/><br/>What I did not like was MNS's finding his way into the box of the environmentalist. Because of the huge ""green"" push and global warming phenomenon, we've seen a large rush of that in Hollywood. I thought MNS was better than that. Though the thoughts are underlying and he does a fantastic job of presenting the issue in a different light, we still see the ""humans as pests"" ideas and the overpopulation theories at work. I don't like the boxed up Shyamalan. Nothing against environmentalist but we've heard and seen enough of it. Keep it out of my thrillers.<br/><br/>The best part of the whole movie and probably the biggest reason to see it is the score. Brilliant. Simply stunning. The music made the movie. Had the score not been as wonderful, the movie would not be worth seeing.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10 in my book. But the score was the aspect that moved it from a 5 to a 7."

","It's easy for me to summarize this movie in a single word: annoying.<br/><br/>The longer summarization would be something like: 28 days/weeks Later and Dawn of the Dead (standard zombie movie concept, including the ending) meets War of the Worlds (the 2005 version, same, limited point-of-view) meets Signs (same mystery feeling is tried to achieve) meets The Day After Tomorrow (same idea, the world is taking revenge). Unfortunately, it doesn't work at all.<br/><br/>It's quite difficult for me to understand why 33% votes this movie a 10 at the time of this writing, there must be a lot of fans supporting Shyamalan, everybody I spoke to found this movie absolutely awful. With every movie, M. Night Shyamalan is looking more and more like an Edward D. Wood. He is seemingly not understood and doesn't seem to care about his audience.<br/><br/>In his latest film, a global event is happening. People start to kill themselves all of a sudden. Of course, it all starts in New York. Quite early in the movie, we learn that the plants are attacking us. They're mad at us, because we're destroying the planet (this message is supposed to seep trough, but unfortunately it's ""a bit"" to obvious). They're releasing a poison that is making us kill ourselves. They first start attacking large groups, then they start attacking smaller and smaller groups with their airborne poison and evil winds. The whole movie you hope there will be some Sixth Sense/Unbreakable/The Village twist to this whole nonsense. Near the end of the movie, there is some evil lady. I really hoped ""she did it"", but like all the other extra cast in this movie, the only purpose of her was to kill herself in some gory way. The concept of people committing suicide with anything in their vicinity works at the beginning but as the movie advances, it's looking more like slapstick.<br/><br/>The acting is shallow and at times just plain awful. Mark Wahlberg is totally miscast. Zooey Deschanel is just annoying. The whole emotional sub-plot between the two main characters is also just annoying and not to the point. The cast around the main cast just serves as suicide dummies.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, all remaining subtleness is erased and the general idea behind this mess is slapped into your face as a professor on a talk show explains: Humanity is evil, we should not toy with things we don't fully understand! The cliché doesn't end there, the ending is one from the books: It's not over yet...<br/><br/>For an estimated budget of $57 million, the movie looks cheap. Most of the money must have gone into the marketing."

Sooner they see on the news that the government denies a terrorist attack, and that the affected area has spread out to Rittenhouse Square Park in Philadelphia and then to the Northeast of the United States of America, from Philadelphia to Boston. Julian decides to take a lift to Princeton to seek out his wife Yvette and leaves Jess under the care of Elliot and Alma. The trio moves to a lonely area in the Arundel County where they meet the lonely and weird Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), who lodges them. But sooner the nature reaches them <br/><br/>I had good expectation with ""The Happening"", but unfortunately it is another mediocre work of the overrated director M. Night Shyamalan that became famous with ""The Sixth Sense"", a good movie that uses the twist of ""Haunted"" (1995) in a great screenplay. ""The Happening"" has an intriguing beginning à la ""Night of Living Dead"", i.e., something is happening to the population of the East Coast of the USA forcing them to kill themselves, and the media is only speculating what might have happened. Therefore, the suicides in this movie are very similar to the zombies in George A. Romero's classic  the menace does exist but nobody knows why. The development is reasonable, in spite of the absolute lack of chemistry between the miscast Mark Wahlberg and the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel. However the conclusion is simply awful and of course disappointing. As mentioned in the title of the review below, ""Shyamalan needs to stop!"" or at least to rethink his career.

Knight's previous efforts and perhaps are ready to make comparisons with some of his other 'hits' then prepare to be disappointed. Thankfully there's no ghosts, creatures, or aliens present in this one - and all the better for it, says I!! I have to admit that generally speaking I am not a fan of the director's output. Personally I find ""The Sixth Sense"" far from being the 'modern day classic' as some describe it; thought the 'twist' ending in ""The Village"" could be seen a mile away, and generally find the man's movies overrated and trite. In his defence however, I did like the pairing of Mel Gibson & Joaquin Phoenix in ""Signs"", which was an enjoyable outing - so it's not all bad! With this film though, there seems to be a general air of disappointment elsewhere in the IMDb comments, which I think is unjustified. Perhaps people feel let down due to the overall lack of an overt 'entity' that threatens the characters. Conversely, I found the invisible and natural quality of the threat quite sinister indeed and considered the environmental elements in the plot to be a very believable master-stroke. For a film that is shot almost entirely in daylight, and with nothing dark or monstrous or other-worldly hot on the character's heels, there is a remarkably strong sense of dread and fear of the unknown that saturates ""The Happening"" and works really well in the film's favour. Mark Wahlberg turns in a very human performance, miles from his hardened Bourne 'identity'(!) and the young child in the story was well selected and played. The entirety did not feel either overlong or overwrought, and levels of reprehensible over-sentimentality are kept to a fortunate minimum. If this is a mark of Mr. Shayamalan's future direction, then here's looking forward to his next project. ""Hats off"" to you, sir - for an engrossing film well made!"

","This movie is awful, but if you're looking for unintentional laughs you could watch this, because there are plenty. The writing and directing in this movie are what bring it down the most. I mean, overall, this premise is incredibly stupid, so I can't imagine this film would've turned out too much better, even with a far more competent director. However, there are moments of terribly awkward blocking, lots of boring framing, so much stilted dialogue that it makes my head spin, and actors that just plain can't act. However, despite all of it's flaws, I actually enjoyed this movie far more than I thought I would. Not in a good way, mind you. This movie is absolute schlock, and Mark Wahlberg knew it. It's so terrible that it crosses into the so-bad-it's-good category. There are moments that feel almost tongue and cheek, but I'm not sure if M. Night was doing it intentionally or not. It feels as if he's trying to play the film completely genuine, but it comes off as so ridiculous that it's impossible to take any of it serious. I mean there's literally a scene where Marky Mark is talking to a potted plant as if he's negotiating a hostage situation. It's bizarre, but it sure made me laugh."

Thanks to overly talkative stranger who knows no social boundaries!"
"harryhaller-59428","1","2","2","22 June 2017"," Stunning...and not in a good way
","First, a spoiler alert--I can't illustrate how truly awful this movie is without specific examples that include descriptions of the scenes and the dialog. Maybe just saying it's awful is a spoiler (this is my first IMDb review)...so I'll add that I can't say everyone will dislike it as much as I did.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the sped-up clouds behind the opening credits, which Night copied from what, like a billion cliché videos and films? It's all down hill from there. Just about one minute into the first scene, the nonsensical action, bad script and stilted acting burst out like water from a fire-hose. No more than a minute later, it's clear that this scene makes no sense, and the classic B-movie characteristics start to emerge like cockroaches in a bad horror film--the oddly loud overdubbed breath of surprise, everyone except the protagonist (who, we find out a scene or two later, is not the protagonist) being frozen as if time has stopped, the person right next to her can't hear what she's saying (hasn't everyone seen Carnival of Souls?), the ""suspense"" when the girl grabs a 9-inch hair pin from her coif and (much too slowly, even though it's only about 3 seconds) does the obvious with it...<br/><br/>Scene 2 opens with a construction worker telling a joke that makes no sense whatsoever. After the nonsensical joke, what is supposed to be a person but clearly is some kind of mannequin plops into a pile of debris. It happens so fast that no one possibly could tell who it was (you can't even glean a flash of what clothes the supposed person was wearing), but the character I would call Construction Worker #1 exclaims, ""Christ, McKenzie fell."" And so it goes...from minute to minute, second to second, it continues to get worse. Bad dialog, bad acting, bad directing. However, I must add that even the best actor can't act his or her way out of a script this terrible.<br/><br/>Despite what I wrote in the first paragraph, I'm going to recommend that no one waste even one minute on this film."
"dkinskey","1","17","34","16 June 2008"," I was beyond disappointed
","Let me start with the fact that I love Night. I love his movies and the camera angles he uses and just his overall technique on his previous films. Signs was good, and I personally enjoyed the Village very much, and then Unbreakable was very good in my opinion. I even enjoyed Lady in the Water, though I admit it was not a very well done film. Yet note that nevertheless, I have always enjoyed a Night film.<br/><br/>Until now. The Happening is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible and over the top. Blue eyes other there made me wish for her to die just so her aggravating acting would stop. The movie is not even scary. There is one time total I jumped during the movie. Once. During a ""thriller"". Me and my girlfriend, both of us Night fans, couldn't even think of more than a handful of really excellent shots in the film (I admit that we may be wrong here and distracted by how bored we were to notice any other nice shots). The shots and camera angles that Night uses is one of the big reasons I love his movies, and I won't bother to list here some of my favorites that he has used before. <br/><br/>Just note that if you go to see this movie hoping for something a little better than Lady, you will be disappointed. I hoped for something akin to The Village or Signs, and wished to leave the movie 30 minutes in (but I was resilient and stayed the course). It took me three days to come back to this site and write this review. I couldn't believe what I had seen and wanted to forget. But I can't. I keep thinking how he could have done a better job if he had just worked a little harder to write the script. Its a small wonder that he had trouble selling the idea. The script should have been reworked multiple times. <br/><br/>The dialogue was awful, the shots were nothing special, and the only worthy actors didn't get enough screen time. Night, what were you thinking?"
"patrickbabe","10","24","51","11 June 2008"," Cool and Trippy :)
","I was totally lucky to go see this movie at a special showing. All I got to say is it totally rocked like hot babes on the beach man. M.Knight knows his stuff dude, and he knows how to make a show work. Yeah, I thought there were some boring parts, but what show doesn't have those parts,(such as Lord of the Rings). There were some totally awesome scary scenes that had my eyes glued to the screen in without me blinking and stuff. I thought this show was rated PG-13 at first, then after a few parts I knew it had to be R which totally rocked. Mother nature can be uncool man. I'm glad I didn't bring my girl to this show cause she would have been totally freaking and wouldn't want flowers from me again. She probably would have wanted to leave and I would of missed a sweet movie. I know lots of people are bashing this show, but I think it is better than they are saying it is. I'll probably go see it a couple more times cause I missed a few parts when I had to use the John. I also spilled my Junior Mints once and so I had to kick them under the seat of the guy in front of me so I wouldn't get chocolate on my new flip flops. Go and see this show dudes, and judge for yourself though, but as for me man, it was so cool!! M.Knight should be happy with this flick, and I hope he gets lots of chicks digging it!! Way better than Signs or that chick in the water show. 10 out of 10 man."
"the_gr_oreo_laurieo","10","19","39","13 June 2008"," Loved it!
","I've been reading a lot of other comments about this movie, I disagree. M. Night Shyamalan is a different kind of writer, and his movies cannot be predicted by really anyone. The trailers depicted it as nothing really. They gave no indication to it's genre except sci-fi. And sci-fi can go so many different directions, from Event-Horizon and Star Trek to the cartoon The Iron Giant. The point of a trailer is to catch people's eyes; not to tell what the movie is about or else no one would need to go see the movie. If a person goes into the movie theatre thinking they know what it is about (and that is the reason they went in the first place because they liked the idea that they came up with and they want to see the movie), then they get disappointed and come to places like this where they can review it and they bash it. If your review is a legitimate review about the movie and not about the sad disappointment because of the trailer, then should have all means to write whatever you want about it. I just want people to understand the fundamental flaw of trailers. No one can tell the story of a 2 hour long movie in 45 seconds of a trailer, and if they do then the movie probably sucks anyway. Movies go into depth so don't rely on the trailers. The only thing that I knew going in to see this movie was that it was his first R rated film. And that can mean anything as well. I didn't take my predictions into the theatre with me and I loved it. Very original and the message is very relevant for today's world."

","Watching The Happening on the big screen tonight I had a feeling I was back in the Sixties looking at a souped up version of an Outer Limits episode that was given several million dollars to shoot. In fact maybe I ought to check their episode list.<br/><br/>The strangest terrorist attack on record takes place, starting in New York City's Central Park. People just go into slow motion, stop, become completely disoriented and then start killing themselves with the closest means at hand. One woman stabs herself in the neck with a spike, construction workers just start jumping off the buildings they work on, a policeman in Philadelphia takes out his service weapon and shoots himself and then others follow picking up his weapon to use.<br/><br/>All this is frightening stuff and when it starts spreading across the Middle Atlantic states, Philadelphia science teacher Mark Wahlberg picks up his wife Zooey Deschanel and leaves. Along the way they inherit young Ashlyn Sanchez from Wahlberg's colleague John Leguizamo.<br/><br/>M. Night Shaymalan usually does films with some spiritual meaning so I was surprised when he offered a scientific if far fetched explanation for what was happening. The plants on our planet have sped up the evolutionary process and now are emitting a disorienting gaseous toxin in the air. If that's the case the thing to do is head for the concrete however the Amtrak train taking Wahlberg and company away from Philadelphia let's them off in the woods between Philly and Harrisburg. I'm still trying to figure out why they didn't run into any Amish.<br/><br/>Science isn't Shaymalan's bag however and it shows. I don't think the concepts here were thought out at all. The ending you will find to be something of a surprise.<br/><br/>Best in the cast is Betty Buckley a strange hermit like woman who lives in the woods and offers some shelter for our travelers. But she's one strange bird as you'll discover.<br/><br/>The Happening was a major disappointment for me, I was expecting so much more and definitely something different."
"zstrankman","1","15","30","16 June 2008"," complete garbage
","My oh my this movie is BAD. I decided to write my thoughts when I encountered too many reviews from people who were saying things like ""cmon, its not that bad"" or ""M. Night back on track"", or my favorite ""people who hate this movie just don't get it."" Get what? The only thing I got from this ridiculous mess was 2 hours stolen from my life. I went into the film fresh, not reading anything about it or paying too much attention to the previews. The only thing I knew about ""The Happening"" is that it was Ding Dong's first R rated film. (Ding Dong is what my girlfriend and I call the director or, Shama-lama-ding-dong in its non-truncated version). Anyway, back to the movie. So ding dong has his first R rating. What will that mean for the film itself? I had no idea and I wanted it that way.I saw something so bad all I could do at the end was laugh and let my girlfriend know what a piece of crap we had seen.""That was ass"" were my exact words. Here are my reasons why.<br/><br/>1. The plot was completely ridiculous. Plants getting even with us by releasing a toxin that makes you kill yourself? Oh my. Ding Dong lost me with that one.<br/><br/>2. The acting was just awful. All parties are guilty. All. Terrible.<br/><br/>3. This next point just eats away at me the more I think about it. The R rating thing was a marketing tool I think. This must have been touched on in other posts or comments. Think about the violence. The man laying down in front of a lawn mower (although we never see anything too graphic we get to hear the squishing, chewing sounds), the woman in the beginning jabbing a hair needle in her neck, the old woman in the end playing wrecking ball with her head through glass windows. To me, it all seemed cheap. Like ding dong was saying ""look at this shocking, gruesome violence I can throw at you now that my movie is R rated"". And any substance the movie had was lost for me in those moments. The scene where the kids get wasted by the shotgun at that house had me almost laughing out loud. I mean talk about cheap thrills. What is and was supposed to be horrible and shocking turns out to be nothing more than MNS shaking his R rated butt at us. ""See, kids die in my R rated movies"". The scene did not add anything to the movie except getting those horrible child actors off the screen. And speaking of things that added nothing to the movie, I won't even comment on the old lady at the house in the end. Absolutely embarrassing.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the worst movies I have seen in a really long time. Avoid at all costs."

","Seriously, 844 10/10 ratings? I realize this site is overrun with ignorant kids that have absolutely no respectable insight into film history, but come on. This movie is absolutely abominable. I got a really good laugh out of a board topic claiming that the people that didn't like it are brainless. What's there to actually think about in this movie? M. Night Shyamalan's trail of movies is progressively getting worse. This is literally his most abysmal attempt at entertaining people with his imagination and failing miserably. There isn't a single believable character in this movie, the dialogue is hokey and unfunny, the story goes literally nowhere, after keeping the audience waiting for about an hour for something remotely interesting to happen, the movie just ends with the most predictable and slapstick possible ending, there's no trademark twist, every single death scene was dragged out apparently just to get the unnecessary R-rating, the bizarre ""phenomena"" isn't even remotely thought-provoking, the fact that it causes people to kill themselves isn't frightening because this poses absolutely no threat to the main characters and the single most important scene that involves humans being their own worst enemies is completely marred by a poorly executed buildup.<br/><br/>Kids, seriously. I realize you are narrow-minded about your opinions, but you will think twice when you get older and look back on this movie."
"valentinestanford","10","12","23","1 July 2010"," This was an awesome movie!
","One thing you can count on in M. Night movies: Everything is the way it is for a reason. You can count on always seeing exactly what you are supposed to see in his movies. Every emotion, each turn of the head, any lines delivered that feel a little off. None of this 'oh lets let the actors ad lib for 12 pages because they're a superstar and must know what they're doing' crap.<br/><br/>***Spoilers!***<br/><br/>The characters in The Happening actually acted like the normal people they were supposed to be. Some of the lines felt like they hadn't been rehearsed. Some of the reactions weren't what you'd expect from a seasoned Hollywood actor. DUH! Real people don't know what to say at every moment. The reactions were still Hollywood, but they were more real than most of the drivel we get these days.<br/><br/>This was one of those movies that made you feel like something was wrong, just off enough to make you uncomfortable, but not so much that you had to get away.

"b-sunjic","1","19","40","12 June 2008"," Not much happening
","No suspense, no mystery, no story: not much happening in ""The Happening"". OK, the basic idea of people mysteriously killing themselves seemed almost as promising as ""I see dead people"" did. But it's not evolved properly. Although you see lots of dead people, you're hardly ever scared. The reason for it all is introduced way to soon, the rest of the movie is people fleeing while reciting awkward dialogue under circumstances that mostly don't make sense. It seems M. Night didn't have anyone cross check his script or if he had, he chose not to pay attention to hints at logical errors. And although it's admittedly hard to do decent acting on lines like ""If we must die, I want to be with you"", performances of Wahlberg and Deschanel mark a career low. What's most annoying is the omnipresent preachy subtext of the movie, culminating in a sign that reads ""You deserve it"". Nothing wrong with having an eco-friendly attitude, but if you force it on people that blatantly you probably harm the cause rather than promoting it. So skip this one and spend the money on something nice - you deserve it!"
"ObscureAuteur","3","14","28","15 March 2009"," The one-hit wonder thuds out another one.
","The Sixth Sense was a fine movie, a truly great addition to the horror/supernatural genre that has so few really good movies (at least in proportion to the garbage). This movie is a waste of very expensive celluloid and I was amazed that Ebert cut it so much slack.<br/><br/>1. The underlying message is a simple minded, heavy handed green preachment. I am a person who regards humanity as the metastasized cancer of the biosphere so I am not reacting to that message as some sort of knee-jerk dominionist corporate booster. If only the environment could defend itself so purposefully. In any case it is not a good enough pay-off to justify sitting through 80 minutes or so of contrived ""suspense"", mediocre, at best, writing, and all the over-acting.<br/><br/>2. The so-called suspense strikes me as so much padding to a thin short story that might merit an appearance in a magazine or anthology. In essence it is a greened-up knock off of du Maurier's ""The Birds"" with plants instead of birds, padded out with horror sequences reminiscent of one of the bad Stephen King movies (e.g. Maximum Overdrive).<br/><br/>3. I felt sorry for the actors straining to emote out the frail gossamer of this story line. All criticism of the performances should be laid at the door of the director. If any of these actors are favorites of yours, I recommend self-induced amnesia.<br/><br/>4. It is a wonder that anyone interested in either art or commerce still funds this director's so-called projects after Lady in the Water, and more so after this turkey.<br/><br/>5. I am grateful that the offense was not compounded by a heavy dose of quirky ""artistic"" camera work as well. It is a perfectly good looking movie, what a decent budget and hiring the right people will get you nearly every time.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan remains, in my opinion, a confirmed one-hit wonder. If audiences and his backers are fortunate, he might someday become a two-hit wonder. Time is running out for him to move up to legend from mere cult in danger of becoming camp."

","OK people I UNDERSTAND. Lady in the water was definitely the worst movie of all time without any doubt. It would be absolutely fair to hold a massive grudge against m.night for that POC.<br/><br/>However, The Happening was a completely different thing. Now it is a little out of the ordinary- many people have commented about the acting. The way I saw it was that M.night Was trying to show characters who were a little awkward and perhaps ordinary, without the smooth as hell Hollywood dialogue we're used to. Give the movie a chance. Forget about lady in the water and try to be open-minded. Just makes the 7-star for me, there were a couple of memorable moments."
"zeedunn","Null","8","14","30 July 2008"," The Happening, science vs. supernatural
","The movie is freaky more than scary. There were times I found the script random. Some moments seemed like there should have been a punch line, which didn't fit with the whole ""serious movie vibe."" The plot moved slow but it kept me involved.<br/><br/>In this movie, people in Central Park are behaving oddly. Some are walking backwards. Others repeat the same sentence over and over again. One lady stabs herself in the neck with a needle. Then we meet our protagonist, a science teacher in Philadelphia. He is trying to get his students interested in science. He wants them to make theories up about the disappearance of bees. By this time, word of the strange ""happening"" has reached the school. The principal decides to close the school and let people be home with their families.<br/><br/>The teacher (Elliot), his wife, best friend, and daughter decide to get out of town. Maybe it will be safer somewhere else. Inter-family tensions are high, but they are determined to stick together. They soon find out that finding a safe spot will prove more harder than they imagined. This movie will keep you guessing all the way through. Can science save the day? This movie was very much like The Birds. The plot seems to weird to be plausible, but you are wondering if this could every really happen. All the technologies and things we humans rely on are of no use, and all the characters have to rely on is their wits and the kindness of strangers. Remember in The Birds when it ended you felt exhausted? I remember thinking, where can they go to feel safe? Birds are everywhere. How could you run from them? Would they be running forever? The truth is, no mater how much we might wish it to be true, safety is an illusion. There is no safety on this Earth. I feel that is an essential truth, and that is why I appreciate Shyamalan's work."
"oskarinn-1","3","22","48","11 June 2008"," Shyamalan should have given this concept more time... You will be disappointed for sure.
","One thing that really pleased me is the fact that this was released in Iceland, 2 days before it's gonna be released in the USA. We're getting your films earlier than you America :)<br/><br/>But on to the movie. While it is indeed entertaining in some ways it failed to please me. If I were to be thorough I'd have to write spoilers, I'm not going to. This movie has the unattainable goal of letting the viewer fill in the blanks. While that idea is neat what you are left with are way too many questions. Sure, that's a neat idea to go with BUT a neat idea like that has to be backed up with quality acting throughout the entire movie and there were scenes that didn't seem to have been given much thought. I also feel Shyamalan was a bit confused as to what kind of film he was writing. It was a mixture of material that just didn't work well together. There were many awkward moments and I can't say it's a very good film. However, the main concept was very exciting. I wish he'd taken more time to write and let the idea evolve. I like Shyamalan.. this just wasn't good enough for his standards. Feels like he was in a rush in completing this film.<br/><br/>Again, I hate I can't go into detail. But I think this one is something you're better off renting at the video store.<br/><br/>Edit: Spoilers start here ********************************<br/><br/>I wasn't going to give anything away but I feel I have to. But please stop reading if you haven't seen this film. The dialog of this movie is very bad. The acting is worse but I think it comes down to the casting. I love Mark Wahlberg but this movie just wasn't made for him, at least his performance was very weird. The screenplay was annoying.. There were awkward moments and even a product placement in the worst movie scene I've seen for years. Red haired lady picks up her phone and says ""Hey, look what my sister sent me"". Those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about. What a bad actress and a bad scene. <br/><br/>What I liked about this movie was the basic idea. Plants releasing deadly fumes and contacting one another, engaging in an extermination of mankind. That for me was very interesting. But for every moment of suspense (or what was suppose to be suspense) there was bad acting which killed the moment. Words that were coming out of the actors' mouths were just silly and the storytelling, to be blunt, bad. <br/><br/>However, one thing I've not heard many people talk about is the idea that the audience should put the pieces to together themselves. A lot of people (including myself) were disappointed that you're left with no answers but I don't think Shyamalan left everything in mid air for no reason. Throughout the movie there's talk about probability and some math equations and how an experiment is conducted - starting with a hypothesis and putting things together to see the whole picture. I think that was a subtle message to the viewer - he should put the pieces together. But, that being said. I still think there was too much nonsense going on there. Too many unnecessary scenes. Like the red neck army guys, what was that? <br/><br/>And oh, oh, oh... Did I see a boom mic when Wahlberg held his plastic wine? <br/><br/>There was talk about how we as human beings send out energy according to how we feel and that it could be picked up. This might explain why the plants behaved the way they did when our heroes decided they were not going to die without being together (and sacrificing the little girl (oh my, what an awful scene)). There were definitely messages in that movie that the average viewer does not pick up. But still... This movie flopped completely. I feel bad for Shyamalan because I think The Sixth Sense, The Village and Signs were all very good films.<br/><br/>As I said before... Interesting, neat idea but I honestly think George Lucas could have done better, even if all the plants had been CGI."

"katzinoire","4","17","36","16 June 2008"," What's (Not) Happening
","I had to try and think of what corny title a movie review would have as such, and that was the best I could come up with.<br/><br/>The Happening, in theory, could have been a film of great warning (stop messing with mother earth, or she will mess with you), with appeal, heroes and all sorts of stuff one would normally associate with a film such as this.<br/><br/>To start, the concept of plants emitting a toxin to affect pests is actually true. Of course, the pests are generally a thousand times smaller than humans, and less complex. But suspend that reality and think for a moment. Generally, due to human chemistry, a nice angle would have been to have some people immune from this toxin, similar to The Stand, where not all people were affected.<br/><br/>What the film lacks the most is basic, common sense. I will cite some examples that really stood out to me:<br/><br/>1. Worst. Parenting. Ever Julian takes time to tell Elliot that the reason his wife was held up was because she was getting a doll house for their daughter, Jess. He says this IN FRONT OF THE CHILD. He also points out he is leaving to ""find out"" if she is safe. Okay, if one was single, I could totally get that, but chances are, Jess' mom would most likely want Julian to stay with their daughter. And announcing that the mother is missing because of a gift she was getting said daughter in front of the daughter is asking for future therapy issues. And truly this act is against Julian's previous seen character-a protective father who would never do anything to cause his child to needlessly worry.<br/><br/>2. Alma, Thy Name Is Selfish OK, so the group was fortunate enough to get tickets to the train out of town. Instead of staying near her husband, Alma chooses to sit apart from him, because she is ""offended"" that he may have expressed concerns about their marriage to their friend. The man bought you a ticket out of town on a surprisingly roomy train given that Philadelphia is a pretty large place. And you nit pick that your husband confided in him?<br/><br/>3. Basic Idiocy I had to look this up before announcing my ire, however my instinct was correct. Any certified army vehicle in this day and age is stocked with an emergency kit enough for the passengers the vehicle is meant to hold. So this means that when the Army guy pulled up in his clearly Army level Hummer, it would have been equipped with a medical kit, and gas masks. Now apparently the two knitting octogenarians in Virginia had the sense to pop on gas masks to protect themselves-but an Army trained individual had no clue to think about that. Ditto that on carrying his gun fully loaded with extra ammo. You know the toxin will make people suicidal. You pack your gun. Real smart. The trees aren't getting all Rambo on you, so what's the point?<br/><br/>4. Why would the trees kill people considered allies? To make anyone want to turn in their environmental card, the toxin targets even the environmental friendly who have spent countless years speaking for the trees. The most appealing characters, the kind, but spacey Nursery Owner and his sweetheart of a wife end up in the group with the pistol packing army guy and we know from the gunshot count, they died. This makes no sense at all. If plants can communicate as suggested, wouldn't the nursery plants point out to their brethren that Nursery Hippy guy and wife were friends to the chlorophyll set? If they had survived the toxin, it would have made more sense to me, especially since the guy made it a point to tell his plants (actually calling them his babies) that they would be OK.<br/><br/>5. Split Personality Issues Josh and Jared, the amiable young teens traveling with Elliot, Alma and Jess are portrayed as jovial fellows, who try to make the best of their situation.

","I've missed the last few films from this guy. He started out doing clever things and has ended up just sketching the supposedly spooky. The only thing he has to offer now is some novelty in the threat. Here it is the plants that surround us. Actually, this is a pretty wonderful idea, rich in cinematic possibilities. It has the ability to link to a rich tradition of noir, the kind of noir where fate sweeps out of the environment and plays with innocent, ordinary people. Here, the effect is that the innocent people kill themselves within seconds of being infected.<br/><br/>Thus we have an almost perfect setup where great forces are unseen and discovered by observing their effect on humans. This is the small sister to the narrative technique of illuminating human dynamics (usually love) in the context of great world changes (usually war or oppressive rule).<br/><br/>So much could have been done, even with the detective thread. But neither the director, nor his detective (Wahlberg) understood the opportunities and seem to have intuited something spooky leading to an environmental message.<br/><br/>You know how some movies are deeply engaging because when you watch them, you are thinking about how you could do it better?

The behaviors of the people and the 'green effects' were by far one of the more original things I've seen in a long time which is usually the case with M. Night.

I am a person who likes to view snippets of time, life, and imagination and doesn't need book and Hollywood endings to bring me to climax. I learned how to do that in Junior High by myself.<br/><br/>Perhaps those that pan so vehemently should learn the same. Don't judge a movie by such intricacies but yet an overall feeling that it evokes. If none, then it is fair to raise your opinion, but to use industry jargon and motives just don't do well for most viewers.<br/><br/>By the way, you will see that most of the comments I make are about movies I like. I WILL pan movies I don't like but seldom spend the energy to do so and leave it to the star ratings mostly. Perhaps some should do the same.<br/><br/>Good movie. Great originality. Good presentation. Shocking. Leaves you begging for more and by the covers I've seen of DVD releases, there is an HOUR more of footage possible? Cannot wait to see if true.

","M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense maze ""The Happening"" did not happen to be a box office hit; unfortunate that happened. Because I did happen to enjoy Shyamalan's apocalyptic-type spooky flick of an eerie naturist phenomenon that causes Northeasterners to behave bewildered and then commit suicide. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore, the small town Science Teacher who gets caught up in the middle of this suicidal mess with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel). The Moores want less of this catastrophic fatal occurrence by trying to escape to where the happening is not happening. I have a sixth sense that Shyamalan is back at his supreme directorial game again by expertly helming ""The Happening"" with unpredictable elements that have you stomped on what is going to happen next. Not much happening with the acting here, but this narrative is more of a director's den than an actor's playhouse. So I am not going to further comment on ""The Happening"" because I think you need it to happen by hopping on over to discover Shyamalan's ""Happening"" cinematic journey. ***** Excellent"

A science teacher into mood rings? A Science teacher thinking that people on foot can 'outrun the wind'?

","I wish people would cut M. Night Shyamalan some slack, 'cause I'm going to. I've always found his films watchable and of a type that I'll call ""intelligent"" horror films. I'm perplexed--not that fans of, say, Freddy Krueger are non-plussed by Shyamalan's work, but--that those who praise films like ""Iron Man"" can point to this and say it's nonsense.<br/><br/>It's one of the few post-9/11 films that taps into our paranoia without exploiting it. What happens is the fun in the film, so I won't betray that. But as a filmmaker there's a constancy, a visual artistry, and a dread that makes Shyamalan a modern day Hitchcock. I think his work will wear better when we have some distance from the era in which they were made.<br/><br/>If I had a complaint, I think this screenplay could have gone through a rewrite once or twice more. Some of the ideas aren't fully developed (a subplot in which Betty Buckley returns to the genre many, many years after ""Carrie"" and she's riveting is one example) and while claustrophobia is enhanced by the intimacy of point of view, I'm trying to imagine the exodus from the train station as being so organized. I'd like to have seen something more epic in the panic to flee. And the resolution of the issues between Walhberg and Deschanel seems hasty and forced.<br/><br/>Still, we have some fine unsettling moments only a few of which are red herrings. And the cast is quirky and nervous in their performances. It's the first time ages that John Leguizamo has delivered something worthy of his talent.<br/><br/>I think people who find their way to this film will enjoy it. I enjoyed ""Signs"" as well as ""The Village""; ""Unbreakable"" a superior super-hero film, and while those films never matched the popularity of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I find that unfortunate. M. Night Shyamalan has brought some class back to suspense and horror films, and I hope people will applaud that."

"Red_Flag","1","14","29","14 June 2008"," The final breath of a filmmaker who was once quite brilliant.
","The year is 1999, a year of disappointments Anna and the King failed to do the original justice, the Blair Hype Project was well over-hyped and Sleepy Hollow seemed to be the start of the decline of Tim Burtons Career. So it's a wonderful feeling for a young critic to walk into a cinema and watch h a newcomer make a name for himself with the ultra scary The Sixth Sense. A year after that he gave us the rather brilliant Unbreakable followed by Signs witch was two thirds brilliant. The Village needed a little more work but even at that it was a decent piece of work. <br/><br/>It seems his decline in greatness has been rather abrupt. 11 August 2006 the eagerly awaited new movie from master director holds our anticipation in a tight grasp only to disappoint. Little did we know that his follow up movie would be even more disastrous. A tale that follows the imminent destruction on mankind, a film so poorly made that at one point (look out for this) while Elliot is talking to Josh in the modal home you can see the microphone hovering above them. Such a sloppy effort from the so called master director. With on/off pacing, a trademark twist that's barely a twist and a plot that shames that of prom night. The Happening is a real disaster.<br/><br/>So a good place to start for this review would be to find out just what the hell is happening right? Wrong! The plot is the main reason this film stumbles.<br/><br/>What's happening? It's a good question, and one that's asked by at least 10 characters, ensuring viewers will remember the title however hard they try to forget the movie. Is it a terrorist attack? Signs 2, perhaps? No, waitÂ… Can it be linked to the missing bees that Mark Wahlberg's unlikely science teacher was banging on about in class? Or is it the most ridiculous scenario imaginable, a concept so daft an eight-year-old child would dismiss it before settling on ""And then he woke up and it was all a dream""? <br/><br/>Unfortunately it's the latter, meaning belief is not so much suspended as rudely upended. And if that doesn't do it Â– trust us, it will Â– there's the risible dialogue (""Oh no"" gasps a permanently bamboozled Wahlberg, Bill & Ted-style, when a companion blows their brains out), the wooden acting and the most inane set-piece you'll see this, or any other, year: our heroes attempting to outrun the wind. <br/><br/>Shyamalan, then, has lost his way. The first misstep came in the last 10 minutes of the otherwise excellent Signs and the stumbles have become more and more pronounced. Yet he is a born filmmaker, capable of conjuring choking tension from a high-angled shot of a girl on a swing, a bank of rolling clouds.<br/><br/>My Final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. The trailer might look tempting but truth is there isn't much happening in the happening. As much as i hate to admit it, this will be the directors last film. The last nail in the coffin if you will of his career. As for Wahlberg he could do a hell of a lot better. Not worth checking out in all. Sixth nonsense. A discomfiting experience."

","Strange how such a low key little movie, can inspire so much hatred in viewer comments, but OK I myself hate Signs, to the same degree. However this is obviously a little genre movie, with nods to a lot of 50'ies B-movie Science Fiction - Wahlberg even speaks to a plastic plant that looks like a Triffid... And as opposed to Signs which was an awful religious sermon thinly disguised as Science Fiction, this clearly tries to take science seriously and deliver a message. Yes the message is spelled out pretty much at the start and there really isn't that much excitement and tension in the movie, but it still fits quite well with the overall mood of an indifferent society in decay. So give the vitriol a rest and enjoy it as an indie update of a 50'ies B-movie Sci-Fi flick. I bet that the upcoming 2012 will be loved by all the CGI-loving masses, but it really is still the same movie on a basic level as this one..."
"YvieS1","2","13","27","14 June 2008"," Not Happening
","The anticipation was astounding. My fellow film critic and I arrived at the Rave early to buy our tickets to ensure we'd actually get in before it sold out. The theater's manager wove in and out between the crowds, weeding out parent-less teenyboppers who were loitering, hoping for the chance to movie-hop into the film once it started.<br/><br/>Not that they would have missed much. After showing my ID and ticket stub to the usher who swiftly shoved us into the theater and directed us to seats of Everest proportions at the top of the nosebleed section due to the full house, I eagerly awaited for ""The Happening"" to begin.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say that it is my opinion that M. Night Shyamalan has lost his touch. Going from the groundbreaking The Sixth Sense (from which B horror films have continuously tried to copy its twist-ended style and have yet to succeed), the eerie, Hitchcock-like Signs, and the passable The Village (for the sake of this review we'll just skip over Unbreakable, as this writer sees both pros and cons of that particular film), the thirty-seven-year-old director has failed to impress this author with Lady in the Water, and now the utterly disappointing The Happening.<br/><br/>The movie itself falls so short of its expectations you can almost hear an audible thunk at the bottom of the Crappy Overrated Movie barrel. It is a movie where the audience later wonders why, exactly, it failed so immensely. After all, there were three acclaimed actors in the leadÂ—Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Leguizamo. The director has been extolled for his previous films, as mentioned above. So what went wrong?<br/><br/>One could easily say without much thought, ""Everything.""<br/><br/>For starters, the acting was not only bad, it was nearly non-existent. It's as though somewhere between now and The Departed, Wahlberg forgot how to act. Deschanel's lines are delivered with the same life and intonation one might compare to Ben Stein, while it seemed that Leguizamo's character was caught somewhere between pre-pubescence and a two-dimensional octogenarian. <br/><br/>Not only is the acting bad, there was little to no character development, and the chemistry between the leads is something akin to adding water to water: Nothing happens. Perhaps, however, the acting can be given something of a minute reprieve by the acknowledgement of the fact that the plot is not only weak and unbelievable, but essentially non-existent. The movie is nothing but a string of Wahlberg, Leguizamo, and Deschanel running from place to place and witnessing Shyamalan's creative methods of killing yourself, all tied together in a 60's sitcom-tidy ending that left myself and my co-viewer in awe and anger that we actually spent $9.50 for such a lousy flick when we could've gone and seen The Incredible Hulk. <br/><br/>In short, this 'event happening' has been most un-eventful."
"Daze36","9","13","27","12 June 2008"," Great movie, seemingly underrated
","I really really liked this movie. Its funny though because almost everyone else I saw it with thought it was crap... I saw this movie as original, fresh, thought provoking, and very creepy.<br/><br/>I liked the way the movie brought back feelings of fear which could only be felt in old horror movies (i.e exorcist). This was probably due to the fact that in this movie less was more (a lot like in Signs). The idea is sort of laughable, but it is a good idea. Just them running away from nothing is funny but still it gives off creepy vibes.<br/><br/>I really like that there was no ""cure"" to the plants toxins none of that stuff. It would have completely ruined the movie if you ask me. It would have turned into one of Hollywood's typical horrors. Movies like these which are odd really scare me more. I haven't been this scared in any movie for like 5 years now. The comedy is so well placed in parts where you felt great intensity that the fact that you were laughing left you with feelings of hysteria. Not only that it was really funny.<br/><br/>The acting many people had a problem with personally i thought it was more realistic than your typical Hollywood acting. The reactions were more believable than in most horror movies. I never had one of those ""don't go in there"" thoughts while watching this movie either. Again M. Night seems to leave a lot to the imagination, and the fact that the acting is tuned down makes me feel more submersed into the movie than in movies where there's a whole lot of screaming and yelling going on. <br/><br/>I am going to watch this movie again perhaps and probably buy it on DVD even. It's a must have. I haven't seen a horror movie with such impact for a long time. I really like the themes in the movie as well, like the fact that the most we have to fear is each other, because all of us together lead us to our deaths. I remember after this movie one of the friends who actually did like it as much as I did talked with me about the themes presented in the movie for a good hour. It really surfaced emotions, feelings and opinions. This is what a good movie should do. Of course a good movie is also often just a fun entertaining movie. But these movies are the ones I really appreciate. Bravo Shyamalan!"

","I'll never understand why so many people are down on M. Night Shyamalan, who I like to call my Savior of Modern Horror. I've only seen SIGNS, THE SIXTH SENSE (both exceptional) and THE VILLAGE (decent enough) but I love the way the man relies on tension and fear, trying to make you think a bit when telling a story, without blowing it up into mind-numbing action and special effects overkill. I am especially surprised when it's purists like me, who usually prefer the older styles of the genre and science fiction stories of the Twilight Zone variety, who are first in line to pounce. I just don't get that. The man is good at what he does (though I admittedly have yet to see LADY IN THE WATER, and I have trepidations reserved for when I do get to it).<br/><br/>In this terrifying story written by Shyamalan, a strange and unknown source is causing citizens of cities and small towns in the Northeast to begin rambling incoherently and then seeking to commit suicide, by any gruesome means readily available to them. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are a married couple swept up in the nightmare, who join up with strangers bonded together in their mad dash to try and vacate the infected areas, though the deadly plague keeps surrounding them. Is it terrorism? Something in the water? The wind? Nature gone berserk?<br/><br/>This is a scary concept that works, though I'm a sucker for desperate end-of-the-world movies of this type which leave us no sure-footed understanding or way to escape the horror. The only things I could find mildly lacking here was that Wahlberg isn't a great actor, and he wouldn't be my prime choice for a film like this. Zooey Deschanel leaves something to be desired as well, but the events that are going on around these two are suspenseful, intriguing and frightening enough that it doesn't interfere with the intense experience. Some of the kill scenes are properly disturbing, and I liked the ominous music score. There are a few silly lines now and then (""cheese and crackers!""), but this is a quibble. I very much enjoyed Betty Buckley's eccentric old lady character, and she was also an asset to the film. John Leguizamo touched a nerve in his part as a loving father/husband, and good friend of Wahlberg's.<br/><br/>M. Night is a master horror/sci-fi filmmaker, and we need more of him and his work, especially in this present day and age of mindless cookie cutter genre films that rely on an over-abundance of CGI and chess piece characters. I am completely baffled as to why there's such an outcry against his movies after THE SIXTH SENSE. ***1/2 out of ****"
"Jeffscr5","9","11","22","14 June 2008"," Why Elliot and Alma Didn't Die
","Shyamalan's films require an active audience. He is not going to force feed his message to you and recap everything you missed like in The Sixth Sense for two reasons. One, unentertaining didactic messages incite audience members to put up walls and argue against the message because it belittles or convicts them. Two, when someone arrives at the message by opening portals of their mind, drawing from their own experiences, they become invested in the message. Being invested in a message will hopefully incite action and application.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening is a prophetic warning and reminder to human subservience to nature and God. The words echoed by pretty boy student and distinguished scientist bookending the film tell us that our minds are simple and science can only take us so far. We may never understand God's intelligent design. However, what we can fathom is that God's design is complex and requires interdependence.<br/><br/>Interdependence is reinforced by a quote written on Elliot's blackboard by Albert Einstein, ""if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would have only four years of life left. No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man."" Man is dependent on these little bees that God has created to fulfill a very specific, yet integral purposeÂ—to pollinate plants so we may eat. Man has attempted to synthetically pollinate plants like bees, but it is not working. The honey bee population is depleting in North America, many believe it is because of the Colony Collapse Disorder. This disorder reinforces our interdependence in that our manufactured pesticides are killing the worker bees.<br/><br/>So why were all those people killing themselves? Essentially they were already, Shyamalan chose to show it as one immediate act rather than the slow invisible act. Dr. Roger De Haan wrote a book called, ""We Don't Die, We Kill Ourselves"" claiming that our nutrient deficient diet- pumped with chemicals, pesticides, and all sorts of GMOs has lead to malnutrition at pandemic proportions. Aside, from the two teenage boys, everyone who dies in the film kills themselves. Our attempts to construct nature and play the role of God is causing us to inadvertently kill ourselves.<br/><br/>Then Why did Elliot, Alma, and Jess live? As with all Shyamalan's movies there is hope. He's going to bring some difficult issues to the surface and tell us there is hope in the human condition. Where does our hope lie. In all of our positive energy, namely love, joy, forgiveness, and grace. In his explanation of the mood ring, Elliot explains that humans emit detectable energy. The toxins being released by the plants target the negative energy sources as a defense mechanism. Plants really only have two defense mechanisms thorns and chemicals. As explained by the scientist at the end of the film these plants were emitting a toxin that cause chemically-induced neurological imbalances that cause people to suddenly end their life by the nearest possible means. As the wind was blowing the toxins by Alma and Elliot their positive energy gave them immunity, they were of no threat to the environment. Their outward communications of love and forgiveness gave them positive energy. Similar to negative energy, positive energy is contagiousÂ—and by virtue of witnessing Elliot and Alma's expression of love, Jess had positive energy.<br/><br/>The film was originally called ""The Green Effect"". Green is the unnamed color for love on a mood ring as well as the universal color of embracing nature. It is by the power of love that the human race survives and flourishes. That love must be communicated and demonstrated in order for it to become contagious.<br/><br/>Shyamalan heavily points to humans inability to communicate and our dependence on media. When it was Happening everyone pulled out their cell phones and PDAs. They turned their televisions to a 24-hour news source to get the latest tragedy or theory. Our media has moved toward pumping out volumes of informationÂ—whether it be right or wrongÂ—they can give the information now and recant it later. CNN has caused this desire for us to get some news now, rather than wait for it to be analyzed and fact-checked. Paranoia and panic set in when we are unable to communicate via cell phones, radios, television to the outside world. Shyamalan points to the absurdity and unemotional fixation on mediated tragedy. Honestly, who takes video of a guy feeding his arm to tigers, doesn't try to save them but tries to hold the shot steady, then sends the video to their mother. That's our media culture, look at some of the content of some of the top videos on YouTube. CNN rarely fills its 24-hours a day broadcast with necessary and thoughtful news, more or less it focuses on celebrity gossip, crime, and tragedy. Negative energy. Side note on cell phones: the radio frequency as been linked to disrupt bees flight patters and cause disorientation leading to the colony collapse disorder.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is asking the world to undergo a radical change. To revert back to a Village-like mentality with open communication, interdependence on nature, and reverence to God. Could he come out on a podium and say this to us. Like him, I believe it's best for him to show it us. Then let us think about it for a while and hopefully decide to take action.<br/><br/>One side note:<br/><br/>-Shyamalan got Marky Mark to udder the words: ""I'm just putting out Good Vibes here"" to a ficus with out the Funky Bunch backing him on those Good Vibrations."

The journalist is not convinced: if it is indeed a warning, it would not only have happened here, but also elsewhere, and since so, we can give in to complot theories. The government did it!

I suspect that the actors are not necessarily that bad, or miscast, just over-directed by a director that has long lost his touch and vision.<br/><br/>We know that Hollywood is long out of new ideas, but the producer of this little gem might have put a little more thought into this endeavor.<br/><br/>Shyamalan made really good movies in ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"". What happened? He should move on and be content with being a ""one-hit-wonder"". ""The Happening"" was just offensive. I just can't say enough bad about this movie.<br/><br/>Reminds me of the sunny afternoon we walked down a busy Boston sidewalk and spotted a guy lying in an alley pleasuring himself. It took weeks to get that image out of our minds. I hope it doesn't take as long to let go of ""The Happening""!"

","I can't believe all the negative reviews this movie is having. And it baffles me when I read comments that over-analyzes the movie, saying ""this is not possible"", ""that is not likely to happen"", etc. First, it's a MOVIE, second, it's a FICTIONAL movie. If you start looking at movies that way, you're going to be left out with not much to enjoy. Doesn't anyone know how to enjoy a movie anymore? Have fun watching it? Can anyone see a deeper meaning, an image of what someone has to say anymore? Oh and why exactly a movie absolutely NEEDS a twist? Because it doesn't necessarily.<br/><br/>Maybe people has come to expect too much of Shyamalan. I guess that happens when you make an awesome movie early in your career. And probably the fact that I wasn't expecting much of The Happening based on all the negative reviews, helped me enjoy it. But nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie. No, it's not as good as others he's made, but it's far from his worse. The acting was decent (I've seen much MUCH worse), and I really liked the few shocking sequences (unfortunately, it seems that a lot of people has become too used to seeing shocking things, and therefore did not find those sequences very shocking, unlike I did). And the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, enchanting.<br/><br/>So basically, if you think of watching this movie, keep in mind to not expect too much, and just sit back and enjoy it. I think you will come out of it finding it wasn't THAT bad."

She looks more bored and disaffected throughout the entire movie than I was, and that's saying something. At least Mark Wahlberg was bad enough I could get a few laughs out of his performance. The ending is really dumb.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the characters go through this progression: ""It's the plants that are killing everyone. What? That's crazy. No really, it's the plants. Hmm, maybe it's the plants. The deaths seem to follow such and such rules. Oh nevermind, none of the rules matter. WHY CAN'T ANYONE GIVE ME A SECOND TO THINK??

"cashbacher","9","3","4","11 February 2019"," An implausible but perhaps not impossible scenario
","This apocalyptic tale holds your attention and is based on an extreme extrapolation of what happens in nature. As people that follow medicine are well aware, most of the drugs, both good and bad, have their natural origin in plants. Specifically psychoactive drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opium. It is also known that plants produce and release a variety of chemicals in response to environmental dangers.
The premise of this movie is that the plants in the United States are being subjected to a stressful environment due to human actions, so they respond by releasing a psychoactive chemical. When humans encounter the chemical, they experience an overwhelming compulsion to immediately kill themselves. Some of the suicides are horrific in nature, such as allowing themselves to be eaten by zoo lions.
The ""attack"" takes place in the New England states of the United States and the movie follows the adventures of Elliot Moore, his wife and the daughter of one of Elliot's friends as they flee the terror that is stalking them. Moore is a high school science teacher and he quickly learns that the attacks are triggered be specific circumstances.
The movie is at times very gross and explicit as people find very gory ways to kill themselves. There are moments that tensed me up and I am generally immune to screen fear. Human nature being what it is, you see the best and worst of what humans will do when in the grip of fear. There is also denial and the inevitable claim of government malfeasance before the movie ends on a pessimistic note."

"harry_a_roper","1","3","4","11 August 2015"," An unintentional comedy of errors
","This film was dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. It was like a joke film. Perhaps it was a joke film and I misunderstood the joke? Anyway, it doesn't really deserve the single, solitary star I have given it here, however IMDb unfortunately doesn't allow films to be rated as zero stars. Or even negative stars, which I feel would be more appropriate for a film of this calibre, or lack of it rather. Upon observing the film's cast list, the woeful quality of acting came as a genuine surprise to me. There were numerous points throughout the picture where I noticed a furrowing of my brow due to the confusion brought about by the frankly unnatural and unfitting dialogue from some of the characters. Every attempt to convey horror that the film clumsily stumbled through was more laughable than scary. And it would be wrong for me not to comment on the scene where Mark Wahlberg's character enters a sort of suicide hotline style of negotiations with a plant. What the hell was that all about? And then when the plant turns out to be rubber! Are we supposed to find that funny? I personally failed to see how a scene like that could ever succeed to add anything to a film which, at that point in proceedings, had already proved to be an unintentional comedy of errors. In fairness, the ending of the film did have some good points. Firstly, it signified the fact that the horrendous excuse for a film was drawing to a close. Secondly, the tragically comical effort at creating a suspenseful cliff hanger was nicely in keeping with the rest of the film's abysmal content. The most disturbing aspect that this film exhibits is the fact that M. Night Shyamalan obviously has some degree of ability as a director. The Sixth Sense, as an example, was a cracking watch. What was he thinking when he did this? Maybe his mind was on the global economic crash that was beginning to make headway during 2008 rather than focusing on writing some decent lines for his film. Probably not. Anyway, in conclusion, to reiterate my earlier sentiments, this film was dreadful."
"g-bodyl","8","3","4","15 November 2014"," Creepy and Chilling!
","I bet this review is going to receive plenty of backlash, but I happened to be one of those people who enjoyed the Happening in some capacity. While there were some flaws to be had, I was kept on edge for the entire film and I was given the creeps more often than not. The premise is also scary enough as this film is more of an environmental thriller that poses the question, ""What would happen if trees and plants decide to protect themselves after years of global warming?"" <br/><br/>M.Night Shymalan's film is about this invisible toxin produced by the trees and those who come into contact with it commits suicide. A science teacher named Elliot and his wife, Alma must stay ahead of the wind in order to stay alive and figure out why this is happening.<br/><br/>Now the weakest part of the film may have to do with the acting. Like many others, I agree that Mark Wahlberg was pretty bad thanks to his forced overacting. He is generally a great actor, but this performance was laughable. However, Zooey Deschanel was a good presence as always and she did a rather solid job.<br/><br/>Overall, The Happening may not be the greatest thriller ever made, but it was often chilling and always kept me asking what is going to happen next. The screenplay is decent, but some of the dialog seems clammy. But on the whole, the film does have an excellent premise. The first hour of the film was very strong, before it gives away to a weaker ending. But on the whole, I enjoyed it. I rate this film 8/10."
"rocknmonkeytown","1","12","25","16 June 2008"," And I thought MNS movies couldn't get any worse...
","MNS has had such a declining quality in his movies. ""The Sixth Sense"" was surprisingly really good. But after that, there was ""Signs"" that had more plot loopholes than swiss cheese. And ""The Village"" was partially ripped from a 5th grade book written in 1997 (check it out, it's called ""Running Out of Time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix). After that, I swore off his movies. And now, a few years later, I decide to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he's done better. Maybe not. I'll be honest the previews looked like it was going to be a good film.<br/><br/>The whole time I was watching that movie I wanted to rip my shoe off and throw it at the screen. The acting was so incredibly insincere. The dialog was obscenely bland and unrealistic. Even if Jack Nicholson was in the movie (God help him if he was) it would still be sub-par. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel probably were trying to make that movie better, but it's just not possible when there's not much to work with when the characters themselves are as deep as an ashtray.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well, I must admit watching people kill themselves was fascinating, but the way it was presented was just really for shock-value. And I really REALLY didn't think M. Night would stoop that low. And, as I'm trying not to make too much of a spoiler, while something ""happened,"" it seemed like NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED. Nada. Zip. The plot literally hits a brick wall like, halfway through. And then everything starts turning into a joke midway through the movie. It's impossible to take the movie seriously. And then at the end it tries to use the ""stuff that can't be explained"" and ""global warming"" excuse. That film made ME want to kill myself."

(Humans are a threat to the planet.)<br/><br/>OK, lots of movies have stupid premises, but this one also falls short of the mark in: cinematography, dialog, character development, and a cohesive plot line. At least 15 minutes of this film is nothing but trees and bushes waving in the wind menacingly. <br/><br/>I like both Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, but this movie had me hoping they would die soon so that I wouldn't have to hear either of them whine through the lousy dialog again. I'm pretty sure they both realize this script sucked and mailed in a performance solely because they were getting paid. With the exception of John Leguizamo's character and his on-screen daughter, every other character in this movie was completely pointless and a waste of celluloid. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, this movie wasn't a horror movie, despite some silly gore. It wasn't a suspense movie, because the premise was revealed right at the beginning. It wasn't romance, comedy, or drama. It was pointless and stupid. Rather than go see this movie, save yourself 91 minutes and set a $10 bill on fire...I guarantee you will get more satisfaction for your money that way."

Say what you will about this guy, his movies are DIFFERENT. He does not follow the all-too-standardized templates, prevalent in every genre from action to horror to sci-fi. Are his films flawed and uneven at times? Yes, every single one has been. They all have this in common.<br/><br/>They also have in common uncommon storytelling, fantastic mood, appropriately chilling scores, and engender a sense of unease in the viewer that almost no other filmmaker has been capable of.<br/><br/>Were there mistakes in the plot, character development, editing? Yeah. And you know what? Nonetheless, I was enthralled. This man imbues his films, however flawed, with passion, something lacking in most big-budget summer blockbusters. Whatever his technical shortcomings, this is a filmmaker who truly loves to tell a story. Golden Boy status-worthy or not, I applaud Shyamalan and his latest movie.

Because their performances either look like just a bad acting from a TV horror movie or purposefully bad from an SNL skit. And even if this movie was trying to be bad on purpose in order to be comical, it would still fail miserably. There is just nothing at all of any value in this movie. I mean there's just nothing good about, it there's absolutely no reason for you to watch this movie. Scene by scene by scene it just seems to get progressively worse. A lot of times, you hope that just the beginning of the movie is bad and that as it progresses, it will get better.

","I can't warn you off this enough, but I know you'll watch it for the sake of curiosity. It really is that bad, and somehow continues Shyamalan's trend of diminishing returns. But how can you get any worse than this hokum? The script is awful - every sub character's dialogue is either pointless, or over-the-top informative. The two college boys who get shot act completely out of character, and completely out of common sense. How and why do you bother trying to run from the wind? Why is the wind so selective all of a sudden? Small groups? Small groups???? Come on! Mark Wahlberg has carved out a good career and was great in The Departed, but here he is shown up as being as wooden as a fence post. And Zooey's character was just ridiculous - why does she have to explain her bog standard character foibles to everyone she meets?

Then, Betty Buckley comes up. Betty Buckley?! Why would anyone cast her? Not that she's a bad actress but I don't see her in this at all.

","Another absurd entry in M. Night's hall of shame. As a great fan of Shyamalan...'s annihilation, I feel it's my duty to report that he has once again lowered the bar for what is considered a product ready for exposure. I used to think that atonal music was the nadir of creative effort. Now I know that it's M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Well, ""effort"" might be hyperbole. First, can you imagine a lazier title than ""The happening""? A movie about a divorce, a plane crash or a bank robbery could also be called ""The happening"", right? These things also ""happen"", right?<br/><br/>What happens here is that people start to zombify and kill themselves. The movie's premise is a joke. Gaia is punishing humanity for exploiting the planet. This, we learn, is conducted by the flora releasing toxins that ""flips"" people's ""self preservation switches"" (you know, those red and green buttons on the back of your head), to which the leading lady adds ""it makes ya kill yerself!"". Inside sources have revealed that the science adviser had the same teacher as the makers of ""Moonraker"" and ""Fortress 2"". Music reminding the viewer of impending doom plays throughout, sometimes with shots of tall grass (the villain) shaking in the breeze (the henchman). The heroes run to escape the encroaching danger. They run and run. The acting, not noteworthy from the onset, quickly deteriorates into ""stare-a-lot, scream-a-lot, overact-all-the-time-a-lot""-o-rama when the troubles start. Wahlberg should be press-ganged.<br/><br/>The exposition is the most heavy-handed I've ever seen. Within the first 25 minutes, three TV broadcasts neatly explain ""the happening so far"". Each of these just happens to start from the top exactly at the moment when the protagonists come in ear-shot of them, and are turned off exactly when enough is revealed to move the story forward, but without revealing too much. In the last half of the movie, two radio broadcasts do the exact same thing (the heroes actually find a radio laying around in the wilderness, just where they happen to pass). OK, so this is an old movie trick, but FIVE times?<br/><br/>Furthermore, Wahlberg's character happens to be a science teacher, who happens to teach about bee extinction just as he is alerted to the fact that something is ""happening"". As he leaves the classroom, the camera catches a blackboard quote about human extinction likely to follow any bee ditto. A person he later hitchhikes with happens to be the green equivalent of the proverbial ""gun nut"", providing a good excuse to rattle off a number of theories about plant communication, sentience, revenge and whatnot - crowned with a completely plot-detached detour to the hippie's own greenhouse. Real subtle there, M. Night. As you can see, there are a lot of things that ""just happens"" in this fiasco.<br/><br/>The ending is also anti-climatic. The attacks just stop. There's actually more focus on the resolution of the protagonists' romantic difficulties than of ""the happening"". This would be the preferred conduct for a love story set against a larger backdrop, like ""Gone with the wind"", but this movie presents itself as a suspense story. The love troubles are mostly mentioned in passing - with Manoj's typical deaf ear for real human conversation - and are only given any actual attention by the main characters in the last 15 minutes or so. ""Signs"" did the same thing - setting the entire movie up as a suspense piece, only to quickly brush over the threat at the end. I guess this is a bizarre take on the twist ending: ""Fooled ya! This movie was about human relations all along!"".<br/><br/>The cop-out is justified by having some public figures proclaiming (on TV, of course) that ""we may never fully understand"" this happening, and some weak theory about the planet ""warning us"" is thrown about. So, Shyamalan is too lazy to follow up on the universe he created, and by only directing resolution to that of the petty quarrel, he is essentially telling us that the happening, the grand premise and TITLE of the movie, wasn't actually important, it was the characters' insights in the face of trouble? You see how dishonest this is?<br/><br/>The reason for Shyamalan's low standard of film-making is, however, only partly due to the talent vacuum. Perhaps more destructive is that his very name has granted him complete creative control over his projects. This is of course a double-edged sword. With no-one to override decisions, a director's habits are usually magnified, both the good and the bad. A good director might be able to make the movie he wants, without being forced to include a love story ""for the female audience"". For a hack director like M. Night, however, it means that he can get away with any kind of half-witted script without someone remarking ""Surely, you must be joking?"". If Shyamalan hadn't been ""the director of 'The sixth sense'!"" - which also was junk, but not as OVERTLY absurdist as his later outings - this script would be laughed out of every studio between Hollywood, Bollywood, Dollywood and the Dagobah system. The trailer (see it - Shyamalan trailers are hilarious for their clichéd attempts to convey urgency and dread) for this movie didn't fail to point out that it's by the creator of the almighty ""Sixth sense"", and even the tagline flaunts the creator's merits rather than the actual movie's. Also note how half the negative reviews for any Manoj movie includes ""Don't get me wrong, I loved 'The sixth sense'"" in the first paragraph.<br/><br/>There are three memorable shots in the movie, one of a number people jumping off a tall building, one of a couple of people shooting themselves in succession, and the third of a car driving into a tree. Unfortunately, neither of these scenes included Manoj's obligatory cameo, although I have the distinct feeling that they will symbolize the careers of everyone involved in this debacle.<br/><br/>No god damn stars."
"gaznev2000","1","10","20","19 June 2008"," Have i just watched the worse film of 2008
","O my goodness I really don't know where to start with this film, what was Shyamalan thinking. This film had a budget of $57 million and I can't see where has spent it. A quarter of the film is simply shots of trees and the only major stunts are the car hitting the tree and the people falling from the building (which coincidently are the best shots of the film). To move on I must comment on the plot which had more holes then in a tea strainer, do you think Shyamalan had writers block when he wrote this or did he have Al (tree hugger) Gore to write it for him trying to get us all scared that the Earth will kill us if we don't change.<br/><br/>I would go as far as to say that this is one of the worst films I've seen, on a par with 'I Am Omega' which had a budget of $1.5 million not $57 million, it sickens me as when I think what directors like Wes Anderson or Marc Forster could do with that kind of money its really disappointing. I used to really respect Shyamalan for how he approached subjects and plots which didn't conform to the typical Hollywood dribble, but i have no clue what he was thinking in this film.<br/><br/>Lastly I really felt sorry for Mark Walburg in which has to be his worst film, he seems to force the acting which doesn't look or feel natural at all. As for the child (Ashlyn Sanchez) she was terrible OK she is only 11 but Christian Bale was only 12 when he stared in 'Empire of the Sun' in which he was amazing. Saying all this John Leguizamo was probably the best actor, the best of a bad bunch, but I blame the script and director for that.<br/><br/>So only ONE STAR first one I've ever given"

I'm glad I had heard bad things, though, as it saved me from the total disappointment that would have occurred had I gone in with hopes raised.<br/><br/>I have liked every single Shyamalan film to this point and I love the way he uses a low budget, mind games and intelligent stories to captivate in a way more common to independent cinema that mainstream blockbusters.<br/><br/>This film had all of those ingredients. The story, when you sit back and look at it, is incredible and the suspense created without expensive effects and score is classic Shyamalan. What a shame, therefore, that the sequence, screenplay and storyline come across as that of an amateur author who, despite having great ideas, can't weave them all together. The whole point of the story may be that nothing is explainable, but that doesn't excuse the lack of fabric holding the patchwork together.<br/><br/>Wahlberg's acting doesn't help. As his only remaining group of friends are busy shooting themselves his bland and unconcerned utterance of ""Oh no"" says it all.<br/><br/>Finally, the happy ending. What was the point in that? Expecting a great Shyamalan twist, we have only the predictable coupled with a schmootzy pile of shite which would make chick-flick fans wince at the cliché.<br/><br/>All in all, a waste of a great idea.

You can feel his emotion, as well as all the character's emotions, throughout the film.<br/><br/>Director MNS causes many to ponder and think about his movies after they are viewed.

Nothing in the plot makes any sense whatsoever and the movie never bothers to let you know what it is all about. The characters seem to have no empathy or feeling for the tragedy occurring all around them. Then there is this farmhouse scene where the protagonist and his wife are in two farm buildings talking through a speaking tube and it makes no sense whatsoever. I could not believe I was actually watching a movie this bad. And just like in Signs, there is this unknown, extremely powerful, evil thing out there but the movie characters can keep it out by shutting a door? What is that all about. This movie is bad, bad, bad."
"jimmy_dean_war_machine","1","11","23","19 June 2008"," I paid for it, I can say what I want.
","Unfortunately, there's not much to say. I find it funny that critics who praise this movie fall into two broadly different groups: those who think the movie is intellectual, and those who say it's supposed to be a campy B-movie. Does anybody else find that odd? To the first group, I GET IT ALREADY! This movie sends the message that we're destroying the planet, and particularly disrespecting the flora (look! I can use smart words too!). So what? Good idea, bad execution. A poor attempt at edutainment is still poor.<br/><br/>To the second group, this message: You're mistaken, it's called bad acting. Believe me, Good Vibrations won't support Mark Wahlberg's dead weight forever if he doesn't stay away from these awful jobs. I wouldn't be surprised if ""it's supposed to be a B-movie"" was a rumor spread by M. Night himself as his latest cop-out.<br/><br/>And guess what? That twist that tends to reconcile his movies? Nonexistent. The audience learns about halfway into the movie (if even that far) that the enemy might be...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>plants. Yep. Granted, I won't break apart this idea as to why it's not possible, because frankly, I can't prove that it isn't. This is actually a good idea for a movie, it just didn't pan out here.<br/><br/>So the audience is thinking, ""M. Night WANTS us to think it's plants!"" Well of course he does, because it's the truth. His regular cameo should have had an appearance in this movie; he could have had a walk-on to say ""No, really. It's the plants"". At least that would've been proper comic relief.<br/><br/>You KNOW a thriller is bad when you crack a joke about the lame acting to your friend next to you, and the five nearest strangers chuckle. Not only did this happen for the showing I attended, but the whole unremarkable crowd was laughing together at times, WITHOUT ANY JOKES BEING MADE.<br/><br/>I would like to close with two things, the first being my only praise for this movie: Within the first five minutes, there is a scene where a group of construction buffs witness the death of one of their coworkers. This is one of the best acting moments I have ever seen- the men look generally horrified and dumbstruck. I can't describe the greatness of this scene and the hope it gave me for this movie. Unfortunately, the hope was short-lived. But with any luck, these actors (or at least the one with the walkie-talkie) will be recognized for their amazing performances.<br/><br/>My second closure is a short list of memorable lines: Unnamed Nature Guy: ""Hot dogs get a bad rap. They have a nice shape, they have protein..."" Unnamed Nature Guy: ""Do YOU like hot dogs?"" Elliot (this is the protagonist, but you'd be hard-pressed to remember his name, I had to look it up): ""I hear wind from outside."" No dip, Marky Mark.<br/><br/>Elliot: ""(insert some idiotic school science mantra)"" I can't remember the exact monologue for this one, but Elliot apparently needs to recite something akin to the Scientific Method just to figure out he should stay away from the wind and dying people just over the hill. You can't miss this scene, it comes off as ridiculous.<br/><br/>Josh*: ""Open up, B*TCHES!"" Josh*: ""Come on, you p*ssies!"" Jess: ""Auntyalmailoveyou."" This is my literal interpretation of the statement, which comes off so suddenly and blandly you'll do a double take.<br/><br/>*A final FINAL note about Josh; he was played by actor Spencer Breslin, who I previously worshiped for his role in ""The Kid"", which I love. THAT'S a movie worth watching, and is the only source of regret I had when Breslin's character was shot on screen. Believe me, there was no character-audience ties there whatsoever, no emotional connection, this was a LOL moment in the movie."
"RodVar","2","11","23","16 June 2008"," I regret to say...
","I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan for a long time. I've admired and highly enjoyed, all of his previous feature films, yes I have seen them all. <br/><br/>I remember when Lady in the Water came out, it was critically bashed and audiences did not like it much. I agree with most people, it does not compare to his previous films, but I really liked it and I bought the DVD. The fact that this was his first attempt at the fairy tale genre is debatable.<br/><br/>However, I regret to say that in the case of ""The Happening"" I must agree with most critics and audiences, IT IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE, at all. The story has lots of holes in it. We don't know anything about the character's back stories, yet they talk about certain issues the audience doesn't know about, like if we had had the information all along.<br/><br/>I respect both Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel as terrific actors, I love some their work prior to this (I can't say all of it because I haven't seen all their movies). But their performances in this film leave much to be desired: <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is not that bad, but a lot of his lines don't make sense or seem forced into the story. Here's an example: When the old lady, who just threatened him to leave her home, is about to kill herself and he says ""You see, I'm a teacher..."" HUH? But we've seen him deliver outstanding performances before ... Basketball Diaries and The Departed to name some. <br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel is like on a trip through the whole movie; and not not like person who is shocked by what is going on, but much like a little someone who is on something. I don't know why, she is so great in so many other movies.<br/><br/>I'm also sorry to say that Ashlyn Sanchez's performance is terrible, and she had been great on her small but highly important part on Crash.<br/><br/>I hope that M. Night Shyamalan's films take turn for the better with his next one."

"zardoz-13","4","7","13","26 June 2008"," ""The Happening"" is Utter Hokum!
","Since he made the ghost story movie ""The Sixth Sense"" with Bruce Willis back in 1999, writer & director M. Night Shyamalan has displayed a penchant for creating movies with paranoia, suspense, and surprises. ""Unbreakable,"" Shyamalan's sophomore effort with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, generated equal amounts of paranoia, suspense, and surprises, but nothing that topped ""The Sixth Sense."" Despite contrived scripting, Shyamalan's third epic ""Signs,"" a science fiction saga about aliens invading Earth with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, illustrated him at his zenith for forging paranoia, suspense, and surprises. Shyamalan botched his fourth film ""The Village,"" starring Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and William Hurt. This xenophobic parable about a faction of people that isolates themselves from society lacked the supernatural elements of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs."" Shyamalan loves to spring surprises on his audience, but ""The Village"" felt like he had yanked the rug out from under moviegoers. An atrociously cheesy ending undercut its paranoia, suspense, and surprises. Shyamalan recovered with ""Lady in the Water,"" a lightweight fantasy thriller about a misplaced water nymph from a bedtime story. She winds up stranded in a contemporary apartment complex swimming pool and the maintenance man (Paul Giamatti) has to solve riddles to get her safely back to her own kind. Whatever ground Shyamalan regained with ""Lady in the Water,"" he has forfeited with his latest exercise in paranoia, suspense, and surprises in his new movie ""The Happening"" with Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Leguizamo. ""The Happening"" is only a third as good as ""Signs."" ""The Happening"" unfolds in New York City at Central Park around 8 AM. Inexplicably, everybody in the park stops walking. Some begin to walk backwards after a moment. A girl on a park bench perusing a book pauses, pulls a metal pin out of her hair and plunges it into her throat. Less than an hour later, a worker hurls himself off a high-rise building under construction. As co-workers gather around his body, they glance up. More construction workers are diving to their deaths off the building. TV newscasts carry reports that an unknown airborne chemical virus has swept New York City and people are committing suicide. Authorities prepare to evacuate the Big Apple while they speculate about the source of the virus. Initially, they blame terrorists for the attack.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Philadelphia high school scientist teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg of ""Shooter"") tells his class that honey bees have vanished without a trace. He asks them to account for this phenomenon. One student believes the disappearance of the honey bees is ""an act of nature that we will never understand."" Elliot agrees. Scientists will theorize about the loss of the honey bees, he asserts, but nobody will know conclusively why the bees went bye-bye. Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan has thus laid the ground work for ""The Happening."" Mysterious events nobody can explain jeopardize civilization. Like hundreds of other people, Elliot, his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel of ""Elf""), his colleague Julian (John Leguizamo of ""Spawn"") and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez of ""Crash"") catch an Amtrak passenger train leaving Philadelphia. The train halts in a small town because the train employees say that they ""lost contact"" and everybody is set afoot. Television news reports reveal that the deadly airborne virus has spread across entire northeast. About that time one of the evacuees that our heroes are fleeing with devises a theory for the virus that sounds like the ravings of a lunatic. Elliot, however, believes that man's theory and suggests that Alma and he separate from the main body of people.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" develops loads of paranoia, suspense, and surprises during its first hour. Unfortunately, it blows it all for a revelation about the airborne virus that would make global warming champs cheer Shyamalan. Unless somebody has told you what triggered the apocalyptic virus which compels people to commit suicide, you will want to laugh out loud. ""The Happening"" is a horror movie with no tangible horror. Unlike like previous Shyamalan sagas, this sci-fi thriller has moments of gore and violence that drive home the lethal impact of the virus. Hollywood has made horror movies about virtually every known or unknown supernatural catastrophe that has threatened mankind, but ""The Happening"" has an invisible nemesis that you can only hear and then suspect the worst consequences. Shyamalan dissipates the suspense and paranoia suddenly when the virus loses potency without warning. ""The Happening"" qualifies as an inept B-movie horror thriller that refuses to divulge the source of its mystery because it has no answers."
"thelazer4000","4","7","13","20 June 2008"," Something Different
","I am a big Shymalan fan, The Sixth Sense was well done, and Unbreakable was something different all together with his take on the comic book hero. Signs was a brilliant film, sure there were some parts that were ""quirky"" but it still delivered. The Village was a buffet of great actors and proof that you can make a great movie for an hour and ten minutes. Lady and the Water was a pretty good flick, regardless of others have said, it is one of my favorite fantasy films I have watched since ""The NeverEnding Story"".<br/><br/>Now comes The Happening, an apocalyptic film about a family that goes on the run after what is initially reported as supposed terrorist attacks in New York. The first bit of it was very intriguing, it helped build suspense for what was going to happen next. Then came in Mark Walhberg's character, a high school science teacher who starts a open conversation with his class about disappearing honey bees. While I never thought Marky Mark would fit all that well as a ordinary guy in a flick but for the first half hour or so, he pulls it off quite well. But something happened, maybe it was the time schedule, or maybe a combination of both wanting to get this film out the door and the time schedule. The acting for whatever reason seemed to slip gradually as the movie progressed, the visual presentation of the film was still top notch. Then came in the gore, people jumping off roofs or shooting themselves in the face and many others, it begged the question if it was Night's idea alone to push the film to an ""R"" rating. It just didn't seem in place for a director that exploited on showing you so little.<br/><br/>There is no twist ending, and I don't expect to ever see another one from another sham flick again. The idea and concept of the movie as a whole was something amazingly different and unique in it's own way, but yet it still rang as another ""we need to watch out for the environment"" flick. You can argue that this film was a less action packed version of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but with better science....I suppose.<br/><br/>But in the end, for what it's worth, I still enjoyed the movie, I feel that the message of the movie could have been picked up without the extra violence. It is by far Night's weakest film, but when the Avatar trilogy is done, you can guarantee that I will be at the theaters to watch his next film."
"symbioticpsychotic","4","9","18","25 July 2008"," Painful at best
","I cant believe I watched the whole thing.<br/><br/>This film treats the audience like they are idiots. The plants are getting there revenge? C'mon, if you're going to do that, then remake Day of the Triffids. But you damn well better treat it with the respect it deserves. The plot was so thin I almost missed it as it evaporated in to the air.<br/><br/>The whole movie in one sentence: Nature seeks revenge, Marky Mark and hot chick attempt to outrun, will Planet Earth learn the lesson? That's it.<br/><br/>The only good thing about it was the Cello score.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the token crazy old lady who lives alone in the middle of nowhere, but even she ends up walking backwards. And whats with that? What's the freakin walkin backwards got to do with it? This had rip offs from Psycho to Doctor Who... And thats sad, when you have to rip off Doctor Who.<br/><br/>There was nothing there for any of these actors to work with, everything about this movie sucked. Hard.<br/><br/>I'm going to watch 'Shutter' now, and i will probably give it 7 out of 10 cause of how bad 'The Happening' was.<br/><br/>The Happening. Why not call it 'Oh, the scary Plants come get us Movie'. Are there any plants in New York anyway, wouldn't it have started where the was more flora? At least there wasn't an awkward sex scene.<br/><br/>Man, it all just sucked so bad."
"stalepie","9","15","34","13 June 2008"," I thought it was terrific
","I'm with Ebert. This movie is mezmerizing. The last 30 or 40 minutes are kind of a drag, I kind of wish the movie was shorter, but the good really outweighs the bad. Of course Hollywood has been really big on disaster movies in the past 15 years or so. It seems like there's three or four that come out every year, plus all the superhero movies and stuff that's about the whole world in the balance. This one thankfully is more intimate, reminding me only of Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Tarkovsky's NOstalghia and Stalker. i thought maybe it SHOULD have had a trick ending, but I can't think of what. There are some parts that are stupid, like when the old lady starts to smash her face into the windows. Also it's weird how healthy (genetically fit) everyone looks in M. Night's movies. In crowd scenes everyone looks really tip-top, and they're always so well dressed. but I guess that's Hollywood for ya. Anyway, it's his best movie yet, even better than Lady in the Water and The village. I hated 6th Sense and the others."
"terelr","10","12","26","16 June 2008"," Brilliant and Twist
","I believe a lot of the audience missed the twist which made this film brilliant. In the movie the media said the events were caused by terrorist then from nuclear power plants and the people in the movie believe it. Shyamalan showed how the opinion of people is influenced by external resources instead of thinking for themselves. Most of the audience picked up on that but that's only part of the twist. The other twist wasn't in the movie but in the audience and no one notice it thats what made it brilliant. In the movie the teacher (Mark) believed it was toxins released by plants that was killing everybody and that these plants were feeding of human emotions. Throughout the movie they were running away from wind, staying inside buildings, and blocking all the vents. Now how did Mark come up with the conclusion that the toxins were released by trees, did he think of that by himself or did someone (external resource) tell him that. If the man never told Mark he thought it was the plants that released the toxins, would Mark make the same conclusion, would the audience also make the same conclusion, probably not. As you were watching this movie did the idea occur to you that toxins was being released by trees because every time people died when the screen showed wind was blowing (a natural thing) through the trees or was it because the movie kept pushing the idea that plants were killing people. This movie showed how people always what to know whats ""happening"" or how that ""happen"" so people come up with ideas and theories to satisfy their curiosity and whatever theory makes sense true or not becomes accepted."

","Who ever says this movie is bad has some type of lack of creativity and mind. This movie is amazing. Not only is it incredibly suspenseful and entertaining, it has an important moral, as does all of shyamalans movies. He is an incredible director and story teller. Anyone who says otherwise is sadly mistaken. He creates a sense of worry and makes you feel very unsafe. That is what he does in this movie. Makes you feel like nothing is safe. The beginning is amazing. The ending is amazing. I don't want to give anything away but the acting is superb and the story line is nothing short of amazing and creative. This man is without a doubt one of the best filmmakers of our time.

","Walking in to this movie, I was not sure what to expect. I had read Ebert's review, and I was unsure of what was coming. To put it in a few words, it is truly an experience I will never forget. M. Night Shyamalan has brought us a masterpiece of epic proportions. The acting was impeccable. Perfect, beyond belief. Dialouge, poorly written, but it worked fantastically. Would you really be coming up with quotes everyone is going to repeat if you're facing an international crisis? Of course people are going to say lame things because that's what they really do. Very well delivered and thought out, and at points in the film, soooooooo hard to watch. In conclusion.....M. Night Shyamalan knows where his towel his."
"dead47548","3","10","21","13 June 2008"," A huge disappointment.
","As a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan and someone who thought this was going to be his best film by a long shot, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The concept of an event occurring where people are dying and being evacuated and panicking with no one really knowing what the cause of it is certainly is an interesting one and Night manages to convey that aspect of the film very well. He gives the entire film a very ominous, eerie feel to it that few filmmakers could come close to achieving and I don't think anyone could do as well as he can. The film itself is pretty terrifying for the most part and (not to spoil anything) he somehow conjures up the ability to make the simple image of grass moving a very frightening experience.<br/><br/>That being said, the writing is where the film ultimately starts to unravel. The dialogue is some of the most laughable and unnatural stuff I've ever heard in a film. I was shocked to see such a talented filmmaker write so poorly. And with such terrible writing, the actors don't have a whole lot to work with. It seems like they knew the dialogue wasn't real, but still tried to force it out and it all feels really artificial. Even the simple idea of trying to make Mark Wahlberg say big words in an attempt to prove that his character really is a teacher ends up making me laugh. Wahlberg himself is slightly above average and while Zooey Deschanel delivers easily the worst performance of her career (a shame since I love her to death), it's in the supporting roles that the acting truly turns disastrous. As always with Night, he tries to use some sense of humor to ease the tension of the film and it falls completely flat. The humor in most of his films is pretty terrible, but usually there is someone like Joaquin Phoenix or Paul Giamatti there to miraculously pull it off. Wahlberg and Deschanel weren't as lucky and even they couldn't make the jokes feel like anything more than an embarrassment from an incredibly talented filmmaker.<br/><br/>A lot of scenes just appear to be jokes out of some sort of parody film...until you realize that Night is actually trying to be serious. An example: a group of five (Wahlberg, Deschanel, a friend's child and two douchebag high schoolers) are knocking on the door to a boarded up house, trying to get inside for some food for the child. After the people inside tell them to leave, the douchebag kids start trying to break the door and windows open to get in. The barrel of a gun sticks out the window and aims toward one of the kid's heads. And, I kid you not, Wahlberg moves in slow motion, screaming the kid's name, as he takes the bullet in the back of the head. It's ridiculous and a real shame knowing what it could have been."

I'm in shock because of all the negative comments about this absolutely brilliant movie. I thought it was so profound and so important for everyone to see. Although I read only one page of comments, I so agree with philmographer and Chasndari03's comments and was so glad to see that at least some people saw what I saw--and probably what the director meant for us to see. As for the acting, nothing stood out as bad in my opinion. They all seemed like regular people, which I think was the point."
"cwadge","2","8","16","1 July 2008"," A no-spoilers review of The Happening and in turn Shyamalan himself
","In M. Night Shyamalan films, there is supposedly always some trademark plot twist for which he is now so well known. The credits still rolled dutifully by on the screen as I walked from the theater into the stark brightness of the lobby. That's when I had my very own twist; I believe came to really understand the drive and vision of Mr. Shyamalan.<br/><br/>People think he's about twists, but I would suggest to you that he's not. Instead, I'd have you believe that these gimmicks are actually incidental. That in fact what he's about are realizations. ﻿The story, the characters, the plot, the theme -- these things do not matter to him at all. Rather, it's the act of his characters coming to an epiphany. Everything else is disposable.<br/><br/>The glaring problem in all this is that those of us with even a basic measure of intelligence and the capacity for abstract thought usually have these moments of clarity about an hour in advance of the protagonists. Thus we cruise through the entire second half of the movie, which comes across to us as a total failure. ﻿The ironic thing is that in his misguided quest to show us other people's awakenings, he himself completely fails to perceive that it's not just about the protagonists. Giving away too much information at the wrong time or too little, and you lose the most important element in a story -- the audience. We are in fact the central-most thread of the story. We have to believe what the characters are experiencing, and feel some sort of pathos about it. That's why we still read Homer and Shakespeare after so many centuries. Story. Plot. Characters. These things touch us, carry us forward, bring us to a point where we care about these people and their circumstances, and we want to see their tales carried through to completion. Even relive them again and again.<br/><br/>What we seem to have with Shyamalan is a would-be storyteller who has not even the most basic idea of what a story is or how to involve the audience once again, as he did with The Sixth Sense. Whether he got lucky with that film or has since lost his vision is debatable. In light of ""The Happening"", I would say it's most likely to be the former. In conclusion, if you want two hours of pretentious fluff with no content and no storyline, by all means, go and watch ""The Happening"". I for one will be sitting out the next movie with the words ""M. Night"" attached to the bill."
"fatassfatty777","10","11","24","24 June 2008"," Unbelievable
","M. Night has come out with some very awful movies, but this is by far his best. The Village was awful, along with Lady in the Water. But this movie had a great storyline and was done so perfectly. Although, the acting could have been much better. The suspense was amazing and made me feel as if I was going to die if I didn't know what was going to 'happen' next. My grandpa took me to see this movie, and hes 74, he hates these movies, but he loved it. The way the movie ended with the way it began was fantastic. There is no way this is the end for Night, in my opinion, this is only the beginning. When the movie was finally over, I didn't want it to be, I wish it was longer. This movie makes you think, what would it be like if this happened? To be honest, it makes me not want to go outside anymore. I was actually covering my face during the movie as if the poison was going to come in the movie theater and kill me. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time, I strongly recommend it, even if you're not a fan of M. Night."
"YouFightLikeACow","10","12","27","16 June 2008"," A Beautiful Romance in One Heck of a Scary Setting...
","I knew right away when I saw the movie that there was going to be a cute little romantic subplot. And I think this was what truly drives this great movie. Yes, I loved it, and you can't make me not like it. Elliot and Alma's relationship is the best thing this movie has. All their moments together are so wonderfully executed, thanks to the two leads and their acting (Wahlberg is loose and comfortable, Deschanel is charming and my now my favorite actress). I particularly like the scene with the cough syrup and the scene with the ""who's chasing who"": you know what I'm talking about. The end stuff with the conversation between the houses was so beautiful, and the walking towards each other was the most beautiful thing Night has done (the music... wow. Kudos to James Newton Howard). The ending I thought was perfect... people didn't seem to like it. I thought it was fitting and appropriate. So basically, the love plot was the driving force, and the scene at the very end before the ending ending... with their hug and Zooey's antics... wow, that was so lovely. So I loved the movie really because of these moments. The chemistry between Mark and Zooey was pretty darn good.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong. The movie is pretty damn scary. The opening suicides are really well done and some of them just shocked me, even though I saw the trailers. The parts where everyone stands still, the loss of orientation, were very chilling. My favorite plot in the whole movie is the Julian subplot with his child. That is just so moving. And my favorite scene is the one at Princeton. It is the saddest thing I have ever seen, ever.<br/><br/>And the humor is still up there. Very funny stuff interspersed throughout. The pacing is good. But what really drives this movie, again, is the romance and the relationship between Elliot and Alma. I would watch it just for that."

Some of the effects are corny here and there but for the most part, as I sat and watched by myself in the theater, I felt tension fueled through the whole set. <br/><br/>The movie was bloody enough for my entertainment but under the surface of this flick, it's a creepy little disturbing masterpiece about supporting your own positive energy into the world.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to people with a sense of humor and a brain. Most of the reviews on this board come from dorks. The movie is pretty creepy. I wouldn't dismiss it for a second if you read a bunch of lame reviews. Check it out if you search for a thrill.

I haven't had this much fun in a theater since the sixth sense."

","I read a persons review of this movie on this site and felt hurt after have seen the movie by the things he said. M. Night's work seems to be getting better and better. I can almost compare this move with some good Asian horror/thrillers i.e. The Eye and A Tale of Two Sisters. There are plot twists in the movie but they were very subtle and you don't think of them until the credits roll. Though the argument between the two leads seems petty it seems to mean the world to them. As for the whole idea of the back story it seems very plausible of a situation to happen as this world seems to be going to hell. I think it might be close to a Zombie movie except for no flesh eating just people offing themselves. All in all a very top movie and think all should go and see it and make their own judgements. Enjoy people."

","Have you seen Snakes On A Plane? The Happening is basically the same thing. The previews make it look serious, but it was obviously created the way it was intentionally.<br/><br/>Everyone is acting like the actors/directors/etc don't realize their movie is made the way it is. But they do realize.<br/><br/>This movie is SUPPOSED to be funny. At all the funny parts. Even the lion eating the guy. Even the talking to the plant. Even the shot of the two ladies in the gas masks.<br/><br/>The director was trying to create a movie which had a plot that gave you something to think about but he knew this plot was ridiculous so he decided to have some fun with it and add some humor into it.<br/><br/>Why is everyone over thinking it? If you have seen the movie I Heart Huckabees with Mark Whalberg you will see that the sarcastic humor style is carried right over into this movie. The cinematography just adds to the humor. Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, they knew this movie was funny and it was made that way on purpose.<br/><br/>AND, while on this topic: What if the movie WASN'T supposed to be funny? Even if it WASN'T... it was... and it was not just funny, it was HILARIOUS. It was better than a lot of comedies. And therefore, it was a good movie. Judge the movie for what it is. Not for what YOU think it was supposed to be."

","MAY CONTAIN PLOT ENDING SPOILERS<br/><br/>The Happening started off extremely well. It immediately grabbed the viewer with the intense suicides in the park, etc. But honestly it ended so poorly it almost made ME want to kill myself. I saw this film because I felt that Mark Wahlberg could redeem Shyamalan's increasingly poor work... And I was wrong. Wahlberg is an incredible actor, but the best of the best could not save this film from flopping. The plot twists were original (at first) but the ending was predictable, even from the start. You're better off watching ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" as it has the same message. The only thing that was salvageable from this film was the brief humor in the scenes with Wahlberg. Overall, I'd recommend you stay at home and watch HBO for free instead of spending $10.50 on The Happening. I walked out of the theatre in a bad mood after coming in with such high expectations, so if you like films that put you in a bad mood, then this movie is for you."
"grantmalf","7","10","22","12 June 2008"," A quality effort.
","At the whim of a friend I went in to seeing ""The Happening"" knowing absolutely nothing about it. No preview. No reviews. All I knew was that Marky Mark was in it (whom I love) and M. Night Shyamalan directed it. I have steered clear of Shyamalan's work since Unbreakable despite the fact that there is a lot about him I like including his Hitchcockian pretensions, and his leanings towards suspense and horror. However, his films following The Sixth Sense appear to lack the intensity and intelligence of his brilliant debut.<br/><br/>Whilst ""The Happening"" is far from perfect it is a minor return to form, with its clever story and classy direction. The plot is extremely ambitious with a villain that is largely unseen and unknown. However the tension is well maintained throughout and there are a number of genuinely creepy moments. Shyamalan struggles to keep the plot moving at some points opting out for cheap news stories as plot exposition rather than using the characters to advance the story.<br/><br/>The film is terribly cast with Wahlberg and Leguizamo playing science and math teachers respectively. However, Wahlberg in particular settles more and more into the role as the movie unravels. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Shyamalan doesn't offer his regular brand of shock twist endings here, opting to leave a lot unexplained. This was both refreshing and annoying as it meant we were spared a lackluster ending but were left with one that seemed somewhat empty.<br/><br/>Overall, an intense if not flawed thriller on par with Frank Darabont's ""The Mist""."
"heidarsumar","7","10","22","12 June 2008"," A pleasant surprise
","I must say that I am not a huge fan of M. Night, and have thought his movies to range from poor to mediocre. As I sat down to watch this film I told my friend: ""I am 100% sure this film is going to be horrible"". I was wrong. I thought it was an engrossing film about normal people stuck in unusual circumstances. The characters had a certain amount of the depth (only a certain amount), and were more interesting than your usual run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster characters. This isn't really a film with cheap thrills. You're not going to get cheap scares, which is what I think most people are going to be expecting. What is going to let this film down is the advertising. I think you average below average intelligence, movie goer is gonna expect something else. An action movie, or something, but this is just a story about people. I thought the script was a pretty good piece of hand work. Relatively tight and interesting. I found it to have an element of being able to put yourself in these people's shoes. Something I had more difficulty doing in, say, Cloverfield. These characters have to make decisions about their loved ones. They have to face up to risking their own lives for those they care about the most. Cloverfield is a pretty similar movie to this on, in certain aspects. I didn't really relate to its characters, and found it abysmal. I related to these people, and that kept my interest going, because this is very much a character driven film. Perhaps if I'd gone in with expectations of something grand, I'd have been disappointed. There is nothing grand about the scale of this film. I think it is M. Night's best so far, but others might disagree, as I heard some grumbles leaving the theatre. This film is far from perfect. Whalberg's performance is pretty dire. But, I think he's usually pretty dire, if not given a strong actor's director. Also, the script is weak in some areas despite being rather tight. I think this film might flop, just because of its marketing and people's pre-conceived notions. Although it doesn't deserve to."

","I genuinely thought this was a good movie. And you must understand; I am by no means an M. Night fan. I liked The Sixth Sense, but let's face it; Signs was terrible. The Village sucked immensely. After surviving these two stinkbombs, I refused to even consider sitting through Lady in the Water. However, the commercials for this one looked promising; and I was not disappointed. Shymalan actually seems to focus more on intelligent story structure than plot twists for a change. The characters have real dimension and the film even makes a coherent statement on Global Warming! My first thought when the movie ended was ""who really directed this movie?"" I don't get all the negative reviews; it's not one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but it is an entertaining night out."
"Taishamcgee","10","11","25","29 June 2008"," The art of film-making is back with a vengeance.
","There have been few movies this year that I have wanted to see in the theatres. ""Don't Mess with the Zohan"" just didn't seem worthy of my $10.50 (the price of a movie in Wenatchee now. Absurd.) However, I have seen all of M. Night Shyamalan films in a theatre first, and I always intend to.<br/><br/>I owe M. Night so very much.<br/><br/>I would pay exactly ten times my admission price to see his work. Here is why: Every MNS movie is stylized in different ways. I never know what to expect when I go see a film of his. The Happening is no different. Initially I thought ""why is Markie Mark over-acting so much??"", but it quickly became clear to me that he was directed to do so, as was the rest of the cast through the whole movie. It works. It works magic. Zooey Deschanel is lovely and lovable, despite mistakes and foibles that any human dislikes in themselves, and so often despise fictional characters for possessing. Ashlyn Sanchez, the 8-year-old in the film, has a tough time grasping the style that MNS was aiming for, and it can be a little distracting, but I plead with you to give her a chance. She was attempting very difficult things, and not all kids are Haley Joels. In fact, all of the actors in the movie were ever so slightly off target regarding the style MNS was encouraging, all except John ""I'm freaking amazing"" Leguizamo. He was simply perfect. He clearly understood exactly what was expected of him, and he delivered a performance so sincere that it was haunting. The man is severely under-rated.<br/><br/>Every M. Night movie combines genres. The Happening was no different. He deftly combines sci-fi and horror (granted, that's not difficult) with a smattering of romance, comedy, mystery, and disaster. The one thing you will NOT see in The Happening is action. It is calm, collected, realistic, and quiet. And my heart was pounding the whole time. There were times I felt I could not breathe, times I felt I should remain perfectly still, and at times I wanted to run. I was fully engrossed in the universe of the characters, because it was very realistically set in a universe I might occupy.<br/><br/>Every Shyamalan movie deeply changes me in some way. The Happening was no different. The ""what if""s brought about by this movie are endless for me. The mental and spiritual preparation I have spiraled into in order to handle these ""what if""s has already effected me positively. You can laugh at me if you want, but to deny yourself the gifts that art has to offer is tragic and a detestable waste.<br/><br/>There are many people who are going to hate this movie. Those people should go see ""Zohan"". Or ""The Incredible Hulk"". The Happening passed up Iron Man as my favorite movie of the year so far. It was a tough call, Iron Man was expertly done. It simply did not change me in the way that only a film like The Happening can.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie if you can appreciate an unconventional style, and a premise so scary that it makes me want to purchase all manner of military survival gear.<br/><br/>I do NOT recommend seeing this movie if you need to see things smashed and blown up. Or if you need dialogue that doesn't seem like it's out of a radio play. Or if you are expecting any kind of terrifying plot twist. There is none. It is what it is.<br/><br/>Really, really good."

I could understand the main thing that has to do with the movie, which is human beings who stick together in order to face the unknown, but the fact is that the main issue of the movie is not justified. I mean, you can't be serious when you see a movie in which plants are the killers of human beings. But that is because of the same, there is a blank space in the script, and that blank space should be the the main issue that concerns the characters of the movie, and that's why we see poor dialogues and poor acting in it. i just don't see a story here, this is the script of the not happening."

","Some mysterious ""event"" causes people in the Northeast to start killing themselves (loved the Philadelphia Zoo scene!) and forces an unhappy couple (Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel) to work on their marriage problems lest they die. The audience is put on the ground level as people react in different ways to the impending doom and the need to escape creates heightened paranoia. The half-decent set-up combined with an unintentionally funny screenplay make M. Night Shyamalan's eco-disaster flick ""The Happening"" the most entertaining bad movie you'll see all year.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has developed into a truly unique breed of director over the past decade. He's capable of crafting a decent thriller (""The Sixth Sense"") but he's also been responsible for one the worst films ever made (""Signs"") and some of the dumbest movies I have ever seen (""Wide Awake"" and ""Lady in the Water""). Whereas his tactics in ""Signs"" made me angry, I noticed something in ""Lady in the Water"" that gave me a perverse sense of hope. That film was so bad, it was almost good. With ""The Happening"", Shyamalan has finally crossed that threshold, and he's done it without irony or camp. He takes himself dead seriously, and he's crafted the crap in ""The Happening"" beautifully. Special nods go to cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (who has become the premier photographer of trees and grass blowing in the wind) and James Newton Howard's excellent film score.<br/><br/>In Shyamalan's ""Twilight Zone"" universe, the scenes meant to be suspenseful or scary are instead hilarious, the moments meant to be emotional become banal, and the lines meant to be funny fall completely flat. The dialog in ""The Happening"" is so bad I think the academy should go back and take away his best screenplay nomination for ""The Sixth Sense."" Watching poor Mark Whalberg (completely unbelievable as a science teacher who figures out what is happening) give what is possibly the worst performance of the last ten years makes you wonder how Shyamalan was ever able to direct Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment to Oscar nods. Shyamalan leaves his cast, like the plants in the film, to blow in the wind without giving them a single helpful direction.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I have to admit I loved every stupid piece of this movie from Zooey Deschanel's high-as-a-kite performance to the mood ring to Mark Whalberg talking to a potted plant to the crazy old lady in the woods to the people walking backwards. Shyamalan has performed a miracle by finally crafting another film that is suspenseful, but in all the wrong ways. When I wasn't busy laughing, I was on the edge of my seat wondering when the film would finally dive off the deep end into complete idiocy, and it did in that ""rifle"" scene on the porch of the boarded-up house. Unlike an Uwe Boll who never showed a lick of talent, or a Michael Bay who has some technical skills but edits his films to the point of being unwatchable, Shyamalan has become an awful director whose films are completely watchable...and dare I say it...enjoyable."

"joy314","3","8","17","14 June 2008"," The only thing ""happening"" was audience disappointment
","I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's since The Sixth Sense. I've enjoyed all his films and even enjoyed - and defended! - Lady in the Water. But there's not a whole lot to defend in The Happening.<br/><br/>The basic overarching premise of the film is a good one. But that's where it ends. It's a one-note film that goes on and on with little plot or character development. And the script is embarrassingly sophomoric, filled with unnatural comic-book style dialog. It honestly sounded more like someone's college project than a professionally written script. It was painful watching Mark Wahlberg trying to make something out of the poorly written lines he was given. The only successful moments of the film were the ones where Wahlberg injects some humor into his delivery.<br/><br/>If Shyamalan doesn't want to hire some good writers, its time for him to find another line of work.<br/><br/>Addendum 7/10/08: I've read other reviews since I wrote this, both on IMDb and other sources. I have taken into consideration others' views and opinions and the notion that Shyamalan was ""trying to make a B movie."" I still stand by my first review. Even if that's what he was trying to do - actually, ESPECIALLY if that's what he was ""trying"" to do - its still a poor attempt. If you want to see a successful homage to a classic genre, see ""Far From Heaven,"" (a nod to the 1950's director Douglas Sirk) or ""L.A. Confidential,"" (a tip of the hat to the film noir/detective genre). But if ""The Happening"" is supposed to be an homage to the B movies of the 50's and 60's or even Rod Serling's Twilight Zone series, it is still profoundly lacking."

This is just his way of writing and making a film. As for the acting I thought it was good, I think it made Mark be more of a nicer actor. There were times that the entire movie theater I was we all jumped and it was a packed house.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","8","17","12 June 2008"," M. Night Shyamalan's less ambitious movie
","While none of M. Night Shyamalan's subsequent movies has attained the status of ""6th sense"" (and some will say not even close to it), they are still shrouded in a certain sense of mystery. To be considerate to people who have not yet seen ""The happening"", the less said the better.<br/><br/>Having said that, a brief recap of the premise does no harm because this is just things you have seen in the trailer and they are all disclosed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. The plot is remarkably simple. Purportedly, certain toxic substance released by plants has the effect of making people insane (to save a complicated medical description), starting with walking backwards, mumbling gibberish and ending in suicide, often in a most gruesome manner. The attacks start in the northeastern areas of the US, spreading from densely populated areas (e.g. New York), working their way to progressively less populated locales. The protagonists are running away from it.<br/><br/>Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) is a relatively young couple with some marital problems. In this Exodus, they are left with the charge of a little girl whose father, Elliot's colleague, has to look for his wife who happens to be out-of-town as the ""attack"" happens. Most of the movie is not unlike a road movie following the strange (and often scary) encounters of the couple and the little girl.<br/><br/>That is about all I am going to say about the movies. One consistent element of Shyamalan's suspense thrillers, notwithstanding the focus being naturally drawn to the clever (and some not so clever) twists, is the depiction of human relations (particularly within a family)  mother and son in ""6th sense"", father and son in ""The sign"", and quite a few of them in ""The village"". There is also a consistently warm, positive outlook that even though there may be problems, the goodness of human nature prevails. ""The happenings"" is no exception.<br/><br/>But most people will go to see the movie for the scare. Many of the gore come from people killing themselves. Shyamalan has never been one to splash the screen with gruesomeness. Although you'll see blood, literally, they are child play compared with most of the horror movies in the market. And he makes efforts to shield the audience from the worst  for example, the scene of a victim throwing himself at a pack of lions in the zoo and having his arm torn off is seen on the screen a cell phone, with the distance making it less revolting than otherwise. On the whole, he employs here less ""scare tactics"" (e.g. sudden loud noises) than you see in many other movies, or even his own previous movies. This movie is also sprinkled quite often with comical or humorous situations and one-liners.<br/><br/>It seems that Shyamalan likes to team up big-name male actors with relatively less known but talented) female actors. That seems to be the case if you consider ""6th sense"", ""The sign"", ""Te village"" and ""Lady from the sea"". In this one, Wahlberg needs no introduction. Zooey Deschanel I noticed and liked when I watched ""Bridge to Terabithia"" where she plays a guitar-playing school teacher. I like the performance of both in ""The happening"".<br/><br/>I have said a little as I can. I don't agree with the comments that stoop to gross exaggerations to get noticed. I enjoyed this movie. It is not as ambitious as Shyamalan's previous movies but basically does what it intends to do."

And what I expected I received and got a lot more of.<br/><br/>What I love about Shyamalan's movies is that they are scary in a creepy suspenseful way and he shocks you with the most truly terrifying real fear that most of us humans would experience in a situation like this. This is what keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time. During this movie you'll seriously be like 'WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING?!' and some people probably hate that kind of thing, but while others(like me) LOVE that kind of thing. Like Shyamalan says the kind of thing he finds scary is when he's writing something on a desk and he looks up to find the picture of his wife face down on the desk, then when he goes off to go get a drink or something he finds it laying back down again. People that IS scary. One thing that made me mad was right after it ended, was that someone said 'That was rated R'. I tell you people have sick twisted minds. I mean its M. Night Shyamalan! People always want non-cliché movies; but when one like this comes out, they want more blood and gore? Go watch Freddy Kugger for crying out loud!!! The acting in this was fantastic. Mark Whalberg does a terrific job from being a BAMF(Departed) to a sweet caring teacher who cares about people around him. Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and Ashlyn Sanchez do a great job as well.<br/><br/>This is a movie with a suspenseful creepiness that will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing the whole time. 10/10 for me.

","Elliott (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher with talents and smarts. When discussing the strange changes in the bee world, for example, he expertly draws his students into a scientific discussion of possible causes. One day, while he is at school in the Philadelphia area, strange, terrible things start to happen in Manhattan. Men and women suddenly stop in their tracks and collapse; others jump off tall buildings, stab themselves with knitting needles, and pull out guns to commit suicide. As word spreads, Elliott and his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) must get on a bus and travel into the interior of Pennsylvania, along with a fellow teacher, Julian (John Leiguizamo) and his little girl. Julian, however, is tremendously worried about his wife, who stays behind to check on her mother. No one knows what is going down but it looks like there is some kind of biological or chemical weapon that is being used to kill, perhaps by terrorists. All of a sudden, the bus stops and the crew tells the passengers that communication has been lost. Even more frightening, folks start to receive film on their cell phones of other acts of suicide, such as the man who jumped in the zoo's lion habitat. As Elliott and Alma hitch a ride with a trucker, Julian insists they take his daughter with them while he is going back, despite the danger, to look for his wife. Will anyone survive this ""Happening""? Wow. This is quite a special film, with an intelligent premise, a well-worded script, and a capable cast. Yes, quite a few folks think writer-director Shyamalan has gone down, in increments, since he burst on the scene with The Sixth Sense. Don't you believe it! The Village was a wonderful film and so is this one, with a unique look at the ""what if"" scenarios in science. Wahlberg, Deschanel, Leguizamo and all of the cast are quite fine as the chess pieces in a horrific match. If you seek superior science fiction films or are a fan of the director, don't delay.

"hahaha_ok","10","6","12","23 July 2010"," Is M. Night really going downhill?
","In light of Inception, I have been thinking a lot about movies. Friends and reviews for Inception have all said that it was a genius movie that left your mind blown, and the only way to pick up the pieces is to watch the movie again. Maybe I watched the wrong movie, but there was really no depth to the story, or pieces that needed to be glued together to understand it. The Happening, on the other hand, is a movie that can you watch over and over and see new pieces to the carefully crafted puzzle that M Night created.<br/><br/>What then is the plot for the story? Plants kill humans. I'll be the first to admit that on the outside this appears to be a lame plot, but once you really REALIZE what the story is about, it is an ingenious move on Night's part. <br/><br/>WHY DO THE PLANTS KILL THE HUMANS, is the question that one should ask themselves as they watch the movie. This is the whole key to understanding the superiority of the movie. For the normal movie goer (and I have asked everyone that I know that has seen it) the answer to this question is, ""It's because we are bad to the environment and they're taking their revenge on us!"" Is this really the case though? When has any of Night's movies been about what you see on the surface? Answer: never! <br/><br/>The plants kill the humans for three reasons, at least that I have found. One, a lack of love between each other (human to human. Examples of this are seen through the Zooey and Mark. It is reinforced by the old ""christian"" lady at the end of the movie). Two, we have become a violent people (opening scene, the newspaper reports, the video games under the television). And last, but certainly not least, we have taken God out of our lives and filled it with crap that doesn't really mean anything (the reoccurring theme of math through out the movie). <br/><br/>I could go more into detail about these three elements, but I have already written a novel. The great thing about this movie is that it you cannot passively watch this movie to fully understand and appreciate it. If you try to understand this movie, along with his past movies (and you don't want me to get started about lady in the water) you'll find that their is a writer/director out there that has the skill of a experienced craftsman to, not only entertain you, but present material to you that will ultimately inspire and change your life! <br/><br/>This movie is not a cheap thriller like inception that makes you think, ""am I dreaming? This movie makes you ponder your life and what you have done to other people, and if there is something greater and better to do. I take my hat off to Mr. Shyamalan and hope that he continues to do the movies as he does."

","The Happening starts early one morning in Central Park in New York City where people suddenly start committing suicide for no apparent reason, this strange outbreak of suicides continues to spread throughout the city, the state & the Eastern seaboard. High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) along with his best friend Julian (John Leguizamo) & his young daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) flee nearby Philadelphia but become stranded when the train service is discontinued. As the speculation grows over what is causing the mass outbreak of suicide it's seem the only thing known for sure is that it is caused by an airborne toxin, as the friends try to stay ahead of the toxin & survive it becomes increasingly difficult...<br/><br/>Apparently having the working titles Green Planet & The Green Effect this American Indian co-production was written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan & seems to polarize opinion with some incredibly scathing & unforgiving reviews amidst some kinder ones. While The Happening isn't perfect & it can sometimes be a very frustrating viewing experience I did actually quite like it for it's outlandish story the likes of which I have never seen before, surely the originality that The Happening offers is to be applauded & encouraged rather than ridiculed otherwise why are filmmakers &/or studios going to make any other type of horror film than teen slashers? For a start I really liked the central concept behind The Happening, the idea of some toxin that causes people to commit suicide is just great & it's a shame Shyamalan didn't have the balls to build on a terrific & memorable opening sequence showing people plunging hair pins into their necks & the startling scene of construction workers jumping off high scaffolding like lemmings. The film ditches the big city mayhem & fun for endless scenes of Wahlberg & family walking around the countryside far too early & the film suffers as a result. Just not enough happens really & I also wish it had been a bit gorier with some real bite to the suicide scenes. The film never really confirms anything & the main message that The Happening is trying to convey is that science doesn't have all the answers, there are things we simply don't & will never understand although I do like the idea of the environment fighting back against us humans who are destroying it. The script suggests terrorism, pollution, secret government experiments gone out of control & even nuclear power plants but I like the nature fighting back scenario the best although it is left open for interpretation. The character of Elliot is also a refreshing change as he's not some all action American hero but actually feels like a normal guy most of the time. On the downside it is slow going at times & the none event of an ending is very frustrating & there's no trademark Shyamalan twist in sight.<br/><br/>I picked this up on second hand Blu-ray & it said it contained scenes too shocking for cinemas or something which is odd since it's a fairly tame film, a woman plunges her hairpin into her neck, there are some dead bodies seen, a guy has both his arms ripped off by lions, a couple of people get shot & a cool scene in which a guy lays on the ground & lets a huge lawnmower run over him. There should have been more scene like these. The film does have a somewhat eerie atmosphere to it & there's a great scene which an avenue of trees is seen with people hanging from each one in a creepy moment, there's a cool car crash & an amusing part where Wahlberg talks to a plastic plant.<br/><br/>Apparently taking just 44 days to shoot The Happening is said to have been shot in sequence & it has nice glossy production values although the colour looks slightly bleached on my Blu-ray, the sky is white rather than blue for instance. The acting is alright, Wahlberg is OK while the interestingly named Zooey Deschanel is very pretty to look at & John Leguizamo has nothing more than a glorified cameo.<br/><br/>The Happening has a bad reputation but I liked it, I liked it themes & ideas & central concept although the execution wasn't always the best which does hurt it. This should have been gorier, had more of a satisfying ending & less time spent with Wahlberg walking around fields. I seemed to like it more than most though & would recommend it to those looking for something different."

","Oh the horror, the unspeakable horror! The Happening is horrible, but not in a good way. There are parts of the movie that are really exciting and intriguing, and M. Night Shyamalan keeps the viewer guessing, as he is wont to do. This is all, however, completely secondary to the unfathomable lameness of the ending (and, to a lesser extent, Zooey Deschanel's atrocious acting).<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>People are killing themselves, and the end of the movie gives us the answer to this suicide spree: Plants have ""rapidly evolved"" in response to humanity's disrespect for the environment, and these plants spend 25 hours pumping out lethal chemicals.<br/><br/>I wish I were making that up, but that's the explanation.<br/><br/>Apart from the obvious (i.e. that this is possibly the lamest, least exciting, and most laughably inane premise for a movie), I am absolutely horrified by M. Night Shyamalan's decision to include not the scientific fact of evolution, but a twisted version which conforms to the Creationist misunderstanding of the term.<br/><br/>Species do not simply make a collective decision to evolve in order to meet a challenge. Animals do not grow extra arms or legs overnight to fight off a competitor. Evolution is not a conscious undertaking, but an unavoidable phenomenon which emerges due to the combination of random genetic mutation in individuals and subsequent non-random selection in the areas of survival and reproduction. I shan't go into further detail since this is a movie site rather than a scientific blog, but suffice it to say that M. Night Shyamalan's understanding of evolution is feeble at best, and, if taken to reflect reality, makes the pro-evolution crowd look like bumbling imbeciles. We are not, I believe, but unless people like M. Night Shyamalan stop propagating these outrageously inaccurate misunderstandings of evolution, we will forever appear as such.<br/><br/>Returning briefly to the other parts of the movie, I suggest anyone interested in watching this car wreck of a film simply stop watching after about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Everything even remotely interesting has already happened at that point.<br/><br/>Pseudo-science, bad acting and inane storytelling earns a score of 1/10."

You're thinking ""surely it isn't as bad as all these reviews make out!"" or ""I like M.Night's other films - I'm sure I'll enjoy this one"". My personal reasoning for seeing this movie against advice from friends and fellow IMDb reviewers was ""now that my expectations are so low, perhaps it will surprise me"".<br/><br/>Let me assure you - ALL of the above are faulty reasoning. This film is terrible in EVERY way a film can be. The concept should be scary but is just ridiculous. The premise is revealed right from the start and there are NO surprises beyond this point. The dialogue is beyond Night's usual cheesy scripting and has crossed into the realm of amateur dramatics, and the lines are delivered by some of the worst actors on the C-list (Marky Mark minus his funky bunch, and the guy who played Luigi in Super Mario Bros).<br/><br/>Here is my spoiler - the film just ends without any resolution. You know how 'War Of The Worlds' ends.... when all hope is lost, the aliens just die from the common cold? I think M.Night has tried the same thing here and failed. Sci-Fi fans can still enjoy Spielbergs recent remake of the aforementioned because even when you know the ending, you are assured of a great ride there. The Happening is just a series of dull scenes with a reset button at the end.<br/><br/>Really... even if you are a fan of his work, you will leave this film hating M.Night for wasting 1 hour 28 minutes of your life that you will never get back.

A plants DNA would need to change over night to secrete such a toxin and you would need that to happen in all plants at the same time.<br/><br/>3.

"sschimel","1","6","12","16 June 2008"," The Autumn Breeze
","This is easily the worst movie I've seen this year, and one of the worst I've seen in a long time. I loved Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, and liked a lot of The Village, but when a sold out theater all laughs at the so-called ominous pans across the countryside, the added gore from the R rating, and some of the most execrable dialogue in years, you know you're in trouble. I can't tell if Shyamalan is a good director who can't write, or a good writer who can't direct. Actors who have turned in decent performances in the past here turn in some of the most laughable acting (and laugh the audience did). Mark Wahlberg was terrific in The Departed, but really needs a strong director like Scorsese. I liked Zooey Deschanel in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but she looks and acts a little schizoaffective here, certainly more neurotic than a mild flirtation would warrant. John Leguizamo was pretty good, but did his character succumb to the ""event"" or did he just commit suicide because his wife might or might not be dead and he left his daughter with friends for no apparent reason? AND WHAT MOVIE IS BETTY BUCKLEY IN? Ironic that she was in Carrie (movie and flop Broadway musical, in two different characters), because she appears to be playing a more Gothic version of Piper Laurie.<br/><br/>Sixth Sense worked because of genuine surprise at the ending.<br/><br/>Unbreakable worked because Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson were great, and because the story was interesting.<br/><br/>Signs worked because so much of what happened, happened off screen. The best supernatural/suspense/thriller movies work because they hint at what is going on rather than showing it. Jaws worked because the shark didn't and Spielberg had to vamp until they got it working. Alien worked because we saw so little of the actually monster. The original version of The Haunting (with Julie Harris) worked because it was subtle (as opposed to the remake which was over the top)."

You'll be able to see this stink bomb for free on Sci-Fi channel within a year or so. Or maybe the Comedy channel. Except for the Twilight Zonish mood of the film, this movie lacks the spirit and strength of M. Night's early work. Unoriginal scripting, weak direction, and abysmal acting make this film little more than a comic mockery of itself. Burdened by an unintentionally humorous script, and clearly not provided any directorial guidance, the actors look foolish. Mark Wahlberg has done better, and it was painful to witness the usually dependable Zooey Deschanel sporting a blank, pie-eyed gape of fake-looking befuddled astonishment all the time.<br/><br/>How do we strike back against our attackers?

"brimstone_fox","4","6","12","14 June 2008"," Really, Mr. Shyamalan? Really?
","Before I get into the body of this comment, let me just state that I am a serious fan of M. Night's movies, so much so that I feel perfectly comfortable with, and not at all disrespectful about addressing him by his first initial and middle name. No, I don't know him personally. And no, I am not a cyber-stalker. I don't make it my business to know about his personal life; I simply like the man's movies.<br/><br/>Unbreakable is probably my favorite, mostly because of his uniquely suspenseful and darkly dramatic approach to telling a superhero story. I also loved The Village, simply for the humanistic story of intellectuals who were willing to raise their kids in an Amish-style village completely cut off from the modern world, and doing so through the use of fear of the supernatural. I thought Lady in the Water was one of the most fantastic fantasy tales of the new millennium. And above all, I love M. Night's method of drawing us into the personal stories of his characters, allowing us to identify with them emotionally, and maintaining our interest through the use of compelling direction and storytelling.<br/><br/>That being said, I did find myself relatively entertained and preoccupied with phenomenally human performances from Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Leguizamo. Even little Ashlyn Sanchez gave a fine performance in the role she was given. The direction by M. Night was spot on, as usual, drawing us into the heart of the film. However, once we reached the heart of the film, M. Night's story became a sales pitch.<br/><br/>You see, even Mr. Shyamalan knew, in the telling of this story, that the event catalyst that drives the film would have to be explained...and that was where it all fell apart. Because the explanation that he offered us was so wholly unbelievable and contrived, he had to keep driving at that explanation to sell us on it. From the middle of the film right up to the end, we are fed some random guy's speculation, which snowballed into a science teacher's unsubstantiated hypothesis, and finally fleshed out in a professional botanist's biased theory as to why the happening occurred.<br/><br/>While M. Night tried to do for plants and trees what Hitchcock did so well for birds, the truth is that he pushed the explanation too hard. I felt like I was at a used car dealership, and I just spent a thousand dollars on a car that doesn't run. (After the cost of the ticket, a soda, and a box of Hot Tamales, it sure felt like a thousand dollars.) The direction and the performances were solid, but the story, though researched and scientific, was so unbearable unbelievable that it turned this devout follower into a skeptic."
"kluseba","8","4","7","13 March 2017"," A movie that takes its audience seriously and offers a lot of food for thought
","Shyamalan might be one of the most unstable contemporary directors in terms of quality. There are some of his movies which I disliked completely like ''The Village'' being wrongfully advertised as a horror movie even though it's a slow-paced drama. Other movies are quite overrated like ''The Sixth Sense'' that has its moments but isn't that compelling once you have figured out the predictable twist. Then again, Shyamalan has also directed some films that are close to perfection like the intense ''Split'' with its claustrophobic atmosphere. And then there are some of his movies that I like quite a lot but which are extremely underrated. ''The Happening'' is exactly this kind of movie.<br/><br/>What I liked about the movie is that it didn't include a twist like most of Shyamalan's other movies and that it doesn't really answer all the questions. Some theories are spread throughout the film and the movie has a strong environmental message but it's never getting too educational or pretentious. The film indirectly criticizes the media that are jumping to conclusions about terrorist attacks and toxic gases which end up influencing some tragic events in the movie. This film offers a lot of food for thought without exaggerating things and lets the viewers think by themselves.<br/><br/>The acting blends in perfectly. The actors are showing emotions of care and fear but we don't get the usual stereotypes of crying and yelling people like in so many other disaster movies. I liked Mark Wahlberg's performance as goofy but resilient science teacher that perfectly complemented Zooey Deschanel's character which was rather insecure and stressful. The two characters felt charming and realistic with their genuine flaws and strengths where an optimist had to deal with a realist. The side characters weren't particularly compelling but diversified enough to keep the movie entertaining from start to finish. We get introduced to aggressive survivalists, nervous soldiers and paranoid recluses among others.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the movie didn't have any lengths. It takes less than five minutes for the introduction and the conclusion and focuses on the body of the movie. Shyamalan takes us on an epic survival journey developing a gloomy and slightly surrealist atmosphere that gives the movie a very unique mood. It neither focuses on special effects nor on a dystopian atmosphere like so many other films of its kind and opts for a mysterious approach instead.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting, mood and script are compelling because they are creative, entertaining and unique. Most people criticized the movie because their expectations of a spectacular disaster movie with a surprising twist weren't met or simply because they didn't fully understand the movie and tried to interpret the origins and reasons behind the happening. As the movie mentions itself, some things cannot be explained and should just be taken the way they are. If you accept this rule and don't have any specific expectations, ''The Happening'' will surprise you positively. This movie might not be a masterpiece but it clearly is one of the most distinctive disaster films of the new millennium."
"TheLittleSongbird","2","4","7","11 January 2012"," Proof that a movie with such potential could fall so hard
","As I have said before, I am not a M Night Shyamalan detractor, I just feel saddened that somebody responsible for a masterpiece such as The Sixth Sense and a great movie like Unbreakable could fall to lows by being responsible for a movie as strange as Lady in the Water and as horrible as this. For me, Shyamalan's worst film is between this and The Last Airbender.<br/><br/>The Happening did have a brilliant idea, but sadly this is living proof that a great concept could fall victim to such poor execution. The only redeeming values were the score that brims with beauty and intensity and Zooey Deschannel's sympathetic performance.<br/><br/>Everything else however is a failure. The film doesn't look so bad actually in the scenery and effects, but because there is no life to the film I could never properly enjoy it. Plus there is some camera work annoyances that were one of many flaws for Lady in the Water, such as the focusing on nothing and half-faces, not to mention the ridiculously long keep ahead of the wind close-up.<br/><br/>I wish I had better news about the story, script and characters, but I can't. The script is incredibly contrived and ham-fisted especially Mark Wahlberg's lunatic conversation with a plastic pot plant which is a contender for Wahlberg's worst ever acting moment, and Shyamalan's direction is either unfocused with the uneasy mix of disaster thriller or 1970s eco-horror or over-ambitious with again the trying to cram in too much notion that eluded a vast majority of his resume after Signs.<br/><br/>The characters are stereotyped, with Deschannel's the only one I had any sense of care or sympathy for. The story is a mess, it may have started off intriguingly but suffered from a lack of suspense, dull pacing, the sense that the film doesn't know whether it wants to be disaster thriller or eco-horror and one of the most hysterically awful last forty minutes I have seen of any film.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg I am not a fan of, but he has been capable of some good, even great, performances namely in The Fighter and especially Boogie Nights. But he is awful in this, one minute he is dull and the other minute he is overacting embarrassingly, it is painful to watch really. In conclusion, a mess of a film and considering the potential it should have been so much more than it was. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

""Unbreakable"" was very good, ""Signs"" was decent and even the much-ridiculed ""The Village"" had it's charm, but this movie was so excruciatingly terrible that it almost has to be a cruel joke played on an unsuspecting public (although, with his latest slew of bombs, we now expect garbage). It's a well-known fact that Marky Mark can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but his performance in this is nothing short of genocidal. Watching the ""actors"" perform in this was embarrassing to watch, to put it mildly. For a movie titled ""The happening"", nothing happens at all. The movie just ends for no apparent reason. Essentially the same thing happens in ""Signs"", but at least that one was entertaining and well-acted. Even the little girl in that was Oscar-worthy compared to Wahlberg. Even the suicide scenes were hardly B-movie material. The scene where the lions rip the guys arms off was supposed to be frightening but the special effects were on par with a high school play. This director (I can't spell his name and don't feel like looking it up) should be ashamed. If he honestly put effort into this, his career is finished, or at least should be. Although, they keep paying Michael Bay to make movies, so I guess this guy has a long career ahead of him. Sigh."

","This comment has spoilers on it. Well, I think no one will be able to answer that question. Really, this movie has NO ending! I believe it was totally pointless to kill that old lady at the end, if it wasn't going to solve the problem. And the movie just goes from that scene to the 'Three months Later' one, but it never shows us what truly happened. And then, if the toxins were released where great groups of people were, Why did they attacked the old lady? She was ON HER OWN in that garden. That proved that we never knew what really happened. We don't know how they escaped from the house, and if Jess and Alma were outside, why the toxins did not attacked them? Were they selective or something? I actually believe that it was a good idea for the plot, I mean 'Toxins that make human commit suicide', is a good idea, and also it was that plants produced that toxin. We live surrounded by plants, so it would have been interesting to see how did they managed to escape form...the world. But it never happened."

Later on the in the movie, the acting becomes such a joke, the story and the characters become so extremely boring that all I wished for was the end. After roughly two hours of worthless motion picture, and an great example of the least talented acting display ever on film, the entire epidemic ends when Mark Wahlberg's character simply says ""I guess it ended over night.""

"hawksburn","1","4","7","9 August 2009"," Less a Happening, much more a Travesty.
","I stayed on watching the extra's being played over the end credits after catching this flick on a cable movie channel. They were the standard rote of actors saying how great the other actors were, how the crew was like a family and how the director was the greatest they'd ever worked with (in Wahlbergs case, the greatest director he would ever work with. Period. So he didn't like working with Peter Jackson on The Lovely Bones even before he got on the plane to New Zealand?!?). All tedious eye- rolling stuff. However one piece stayed in my mind and it was Shyamalan commenting about how he'd got this flash of brilliance that became the genesis of this movie whilst driving home one afternoon through the countryside past wide open fields & greenery.<br/><br/>Two things should be learned from this incident. One, don't quickly devise a story like this based on an extremely dodgy premise then immediately rush it into production. Give it a few years to develop. That should give you enough time to reach the conclusion that it's a lousy idea and it should be killed before any further money is wasted on it. Two, all you studio heads, stop green-lighting any more Shyamalan treatments. The guy had one reasonably good idea with The Sixth Sense (I mean seriously, I'm still bemused as to how 'most' people were shocked by the 'twist'?!?), followed that up with the somewhat overrated Unbreakable (which still had some interesting moments) but has steadily continued to adhere to the law of diminishing returns (and diminishing ideas) with each subsequent film. I suggest with this one he's not only hit rock bottom, he's actually managed to drill through the bedrock of self-respect.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of this picture captures your interest. The suicides, the panic & confusion, the isolation, all enough to get you hooked in, to keep you watching. That is until you reach the scene in the field where one group (containing our main characters) are walking ahead of another group (out of sight) which is where this film well & truly JUMPS THE SHARK. This where our group of friends tries to outrun the wind because the conclusion is reached that that is how the 'madness' (for wont of a better term) is being spread. I'll repeat that, the enemy here is seemingly the breeze (oh yes, plant-life has something to do with it but it seems the wind is in serious cahoots with the trees in assisting enactment of their malevolent purpose). If you can keep a straight face when the line ""Let's just stay ahead of the wind!"" is spoke then you must lack a funny bone. It's almost like the screenwriter handed the rest of the script to the nearest 12 year old to complete as part of a school project. Look, there's nothing wrong with levity in a (supposedly) serious film. It's almost integral, after all no one can take 2 hours or so of relentless doom. Heck, even 'The Road' has moments of humor in it but they don't detract from the fact that at it's heart it is literally a horror story. I read a forum comment by a person who seemed to be one of the few who enjoyed this film defending it by saying that the director never meant for it to be taken as a horror film. Yet in the extra's Shyamalan states that it was absolutely his intention to instill an atmosphere of fear & paranoia in the viewer for the entire duration. I believe he name-checked Hitchcocks 'The Birds' to support his statement. One can only surmise, looking at the end result that he has indeed failed miserably because what's on screen more closely resembles a classic Uwe Boll film than anything Uwe Boll himself has made lately. <br/><br/>The performances by the leads are awful. Wahlberg seems to think wide- eyed & high-pitched is the way to play up the fear & apprehension. Zooey Deschanel, one of the most beautiful & talented actresses on screen (criminally underrated most of the time if you ask me. Tho not this particular time) is just missing the entire time. Sure, her body is there and she's reciting the banal lines she's been given, but her mind is someplace else. Probably hundreds of miles away, strangling her agent. Someone. Please. Tell me what this is about?<br/><br/>Elliot: If we're going to die, I want you to know something. I was in the pharmacy a while ago. There was a really good-looking pharmacist behind the counter. Really good-looking. I went up and asked her where the cough syrup was. I didn't even have a cough, and I almost bought it. I'm talking about a completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup, which costs like six bucks. <br/><br/>Alma: Are you joking? <br/><br/>(Elliot nods his head) <br/><br/>Alma: Thank you. <br/><br/>Or this?<br/><br/>Mrs. Jones: (to Elliot and Alma) So what's with you two? Who's chasing who? Alma Moore: I'm sorry? Mrs. Jones: Ain't no time two people staring at each other, or standing still, loving both with their eyes are equal. Truth is, someone is chasing someone. That's the way we's built. So, who's chasing? (Elliot raises his hand) <br/><br/>I'm sorry. The script is full of nonsense like this, these are but two examples. They are far sillier when placed in the context of the actual scenes they are from. Without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in a very very long time made by a man who has been given the benefit of doubt for far too long."

(or at least Ari Gold will kick him in the nuts in the next episode of Entourage for making one absolute bombshell after the next) This movie is awful. The acting is terrible (and I normally think Mark Walhberg does a good job). The dialogue is atrocious and I really can't think of one good thing to say about this movie. (and I normally can find something I like in basically every movie I've ever sat through entirely) I've heard some comments say that this is supposed to be a B movie but the acting is so bad that it's not even comical, just ridiculous. There's no meaning, no journey, no lesson, no jokes, no action, no internal conflict, so what's the point? People watch movies to be entertained yet there's nothing here to find entertaining.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will never watch another M. Night Shyamalan movie for the rest of my life. I can't possibly imagine how someone could have produced this movie and I hope they never let him or anyone else do this ever again."
"dsa_ca","1","7","15","30 June 2008"," Paranoia and disaster (for the audience)
","'The Happening' was promising and will always be promising. But just the idea and not what it panned out into. I wish good things for Shyamalan. He made the most memorable horror movie I have seen (which seems to have become a baggage for him). But he has slipped right into the bottom. He just takes the germ of an idea which he keeps on blowing and when the end credit roll in, he is still seems to be blowing it! Someone should have told him to stop because he never finishes the film. In the end, we become a joke and in turn everyone will make sure he becomes a joke.<br/><br/>This was his worst attempt to make a thriller, worst than 'Lady in the Water' whose core idea was flawed, 'the happening' actually had something interesting and the audience were holding on for something to answer the occurrences of self annihilation among humans. They do not happen to get anything out of this mushy-romantic creep fest (the first of such a genre!), while Shyamalan even after he ends the episode of nature-revenge without any meaning to it in north-east America; he starts another one in Paris which makes the audiences smack there head time and again. With no core theory involved to tell the story, the movie should definitely counted worst than some of the eighties slasher movie, such was the sorry state of the film. The director does show glimpses of his talent, mainly when the main protagonists along with few survivors enter a model house of an upcoming real estate property full of plastic trees and wax food and all, where his characters show great paranoia with a good hint of humor placed around the situation they are in and the place where they are present at that moment. Such sequences of paranoia are sprinkled across the movie, but nothing to explain such behavioral pattern, the audience are the one who left paranoid. And finally the most paranoid of all 'the actors', Zooey Deschanel has to be the worst actress for this year, who acted so paranoid even before anything had happened from her first scene where she gets a call which she does not intend to take! She was worse but was not alone, surprisingly Mark Wahlberg was also below or the guy just needs to stick with straight face roles.<br/><br/>In the end, with its front leads coming up with below par scores along with a director whose career is in a free fall, the movie with its subtle messages for the citizens of the planet earth already blurred out, reaches its final conclusion, disaster and paranoia for the audience."
"Rob_Taylor","1","7","15","26 June 2008"," An M Night movie that sucks........What a Tweest!
","Y'know, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was actually quite excited. Apocalyptic (and post-apocalyptic) movies are one of my favourite genres. It all looked so good in the trailer....right up until the moment the trailer revealed that it was ""An M Night Shyamalan film"". They might have well announced the movie to be a SciFi Channel spectacular. The impact could have hardly filled me with more dread.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has to date produced two good movies, one OK movie and, now, three stinkers. The balance of his work has passed the tipping point now and, barring some miracle, I can't see him clawing his way back from this.<br/><br/>The Happening is primarily composed of a small band of ""survivors"" roaming the countryside wondering whats happening and why people are killing themselves. Eventually they twig (sorry 'bout that pun) that it's the very plants themselves that are trying to kill them by releasing a nerve agent into the atmosphere. Of course. this is all very telegraphed from the start (it is a Shyamalan movie, after all) and rather anti-climactic when revealed. Anyway, the survivors wander about, wondering about what to do and uttering such priceless lines of dialogue that it's hard not to burst out laughing at times. In fact, many members of the audience I saw it with were unable to contain themselves and chortled through much of it. At least they were having a good time! Of course, seeing someone kill themselves on screen is not meant to be funny. And the first few times, it isn't. But as time goes by, the script calls for suicides in increasingly bizarre and preposterous ways, leading you to wonder whether someone in the projection booth might possibly have spliced in a few feet of a Monty Python movie as a joke.<br/><br/>Of course, the joke is on those who've paid to see this (I'm lucky enough to work in a cinema, so I get in free). I would be sorely tempted to ask for my money back if I had paid for this.<br/><br/>Plot-wise it's a basic ""We hurt nature, now nature is getting revenge"" deal. But the reality of plants evolving a neurotoxin capable of killing off humanity is woefully optimistic. I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but to happen as portrayed in The Happening is nonsense.<br/><br/>Given the above, it's hard to make a suspenseful film whereby the main menace is a tree waving in the wind. Nevertheless, The Happening tries to do this and we are treated to any number of scenes of wind-blown plant life interspersed with the characters looking frightened. And when a character looks frightened at an innocuous object/item, its really hard not to snicker.<br/><br/>The acting is, for the most part, unbearably bad. Given the awful, discordant dialogue clangers that they have to drop during the film, it would be hard for even a veteran actor to summon any shred of stage-presence here. Mostly they just muddle through and then wander around some more. However, no one is going to win any awards for their roles here, and rightly so. Close-ups of Wahlberg looking, frankly, like an early-onset Alzheimer's sufferer, do nothing but move the audience to mirth. <br/><br/>One highly amusing acting point to note is Zooey Deschanel's incredible ability to act out most scenes as if she's pretending to be a Tarsier (google it and examine the resulting images, you'll see what I mean). Her bug-eyed staring is truly amazing and rather startling at first, then becomes merely amusing.<br/><br/>And that, sadly, is pretty much a good way to sum up this film. People wandering about, looking confused and wondering what the hell is going on. It's not gripping and it's not frightening. It's bizarre and ridiculous and will probably win an award for the funniest unfunny movie of 2008.<br/><br/>Not so much The Happening. More like The Not Much Happening. Imagine Day of the Triffids but without the Triffids and you'll get an idea how dull this movie is. It makes even the likes of Lady in the Water look like a frickin' Shakespearean masterpiece.<br/><br/>Seriously, avoid this one."
"Wickedjuggalette729","1","7","15","23 June 2008"," Don't watch this movie
","What a bad movie. I went there expecting a masterpiece and found a waste of time. The camera angles and everything are great as far as everything but the storyline. It is an interesting concept but one that should be a Discovery channel half-hour special. A movie without a bad guy or visual enemy. They run away from the wind for crying out loud. Plants decide they don't want us around anymore and they start releasing a poison (which they don't even provide a visual for). It only strikes in like a 5-10 state radius. There can be no hero or heroine in a movie of this sort, you just watch the main characters run away from something they can't see or fight. There is no solution, the poison just stops."
"LoneWolfAndCub","8","7","15","22 June 2008"," A solid return for Shyamalan, but not without its flaws
","After the lacklustre 'The Village' I wondered if M. Night Shyamalan still had it in him to make a good movie (no, I have yet to see 'Lady in the Water'). Furthermore, before I finally got to see this, the sheer amount of negative reviews were disheartening to say the least (I loved the trailer). I went into this on neutral grounds, not expecting good or bad and I was pleasantly surprised. This latest effort is an eerie and intelligent film and although not perfect, it is definitely head-and-shoulders above most crap that makes it into the cinemas.<br/><br/>The film opens in Central Park, New York with two young females sitting on a park bench, reading. All of a sudden, everyone stops and one of the women stabs her neck with a hairpin. Enter the 'happening.' From here on we witness numerous cases of random suicide in the public and eventually find ourselves with Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), a high school science teacher. He is evacuated with wife Alma Moore (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). Their train comes to a sudden halt and they are lead off and basically abandoned. Left to fend for themselves, they set off to find a safe place and wait out the disaster.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very successful and well-made. Syamalan's directing is great, the movie proceeds logically at a smooth pace. Likewise, his script is interesting although it somewhat loses steam right at the end, which is unfortunate. The suicide scenes are incredibly shot and unsettling. There is a particularly effective one at the start, involving a gun that is passed on from person to person as they shoot themselves. This, and various similar scenes, are some of the most effective scenes I have seen in a film for awhile. On the note of effective, another sequence towards the end is a big ""punch to the gut."" It comes almost out of nowhere and is disturbing and caught the audience in my theatre off-guard.<br/><br/>However, as previously mentioned, this is not without its imperfections. Mark Wahlberg completely overacts in the lead role. His reactions to many scenarios were silly and killed any seriousness of his character. At times it was hard not to laugh at it. And that is unfortunate, because I really like Wahlberg, he is an incredible actor and could have really got a decent performance out of this movie. Having said this, Zooey Deschanel was great, she is proving herself as an outstanding actress. John Leguizamo is his usual awesome self in a supporting role (which should have been fleshed out a little more). In fact, this movie could have benefited from a more developed plot. An extra 20 minutes of character development and plot would have really helped make this more than a entertaining 91 minutes at the movies. Here, Shyamalan has touched upon the issue of Man vs. Nature in an unique and oddly plausible way. More depth could have pushed it into the realms of greatness.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, The Happening is one of the superior movies in the cinemas at the moment and a standout amongst the crappy teen horrors and remakes.<br/><br/>4/5"

I almost thought Al Gore had a hand in this production because of the whole save the earth, go green, global warming thing. now people are going to go see this film and panic just like they did with ""the day after tomorrow,"" and start thinking that ""if we don't save our earth, the trees are going to kill us!"" it's bad enough we have a country and world full of gullible people, now to add fuel to the fire, our greens are now out to kill us with a poison because we humans are ""killing our earth!""

","I'm sorry, this movie was terrible. I figured it out as soon as they showed the rustling trees in Filthadelphia before the people there died. There were a few jumpy ""BOO!"" moments that scared some people in the audience, but anyone who has a decent brain will cringe at the horrible dialog, acting, plot, and overall production of this movie. Basically plants get angry off at people in the northeastern US and kill a bunch of people. A handful survive, and then later on things get back to normal. However, then Paris gets hit and it starts all over. If this is an attempt to scare people into becoming environmentalists or activists against cutting down trees, it's grasping at straws. Seriously, I don't know what Shyamalan was smoking but he should take it back because it obviously gave him a bad trip.<br/><br/>I think you can have more fun watching the BME Pain Olympics video.<br/><br/>I want my $10 back."

","This is not just light, silly popcorn fare, as some people would present it. Expect to see something disturbing, something that sets your nerves on end. It may take shocking, unflinching scenes to reach certain people and put them in a state receptive to the speculations planted along the way which allow us to reflect on the mystery of the story's threat and by extension the fact of human influence upon the environment. The tone set and the gradual reveal of each new stage of trouble makes the Twilight Zone premise play as plausible and the inevitability of horror is riveting. After the first coda, there was one yahoo that booed at the screening, but his second noise after the final coda seemed less critical. A misanthrope at the end personifies the worst of community spirit but so much has been woven by the time she turns up that she is clearly part of the film's fabric and thesis. The film should at least appeal to people who like to slow past an accident knowing they may see something awful. Awful but very well done and unflinching. We become our own worst enemies, on more than one level. The film seemed to fly by, as well. I recognized an actor from Clerks in a silent bit role that must have included some dialog when he signed on; it plays as a bit of a distraction for me but it wouldn't register for a non-clerks fan. What we may gain is a sense of loss as each fleeting character is introduced and confronts death. I had thought the movie would be about a mere prank, but it is not. I hope the makers of the proposed remake of the Birds give up when they see The Happening. Maybe not give up on life, but just their own stab at man-versus-nature. The Happening is a keeper, ultimately not as dark in its resolution as The Mist but likely to be appreciated by the same audience."

And what about those completely hollow characters? And the weird 'framing' of the scenes? The trailer may have indeed been the best thing and left you with lots of questions but that's about it. The death scenes were also great and could stir up some emotions (hint : tree - car - ...) but to put your focus on some gory scenes?

","This has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through. I have never liked any of M. Nigh Shyamalan's movies, but at least the others were tolerable. Not only was the whole plot in the movie completely retarded, but the actors seemed like they were just reading right from the script (which was also lousy). During the movie, A group of people were trying to escape the ""attack"" and decide to stop at the driver's house to pick up some of their belongings. When they get there the others walk around the plant farm waiting, then the guy comes strolling out of the house and says ""does everyone like hot-dogs? cause we're bringing hot-dogs"" (...With millions of people dying from an airborne attack, i guess i'd be worried about hot-dogs too.) Not only that, but the guy also makes sure his wife brought mustard! WTF?! I highly recommend everyone save their money and not go see this movie. We should pool our money and spend it on something more useful, like paying every film company to never allow M Night Shyamalan to ever direct a movie again."
"chazmuse","8","8","18","15 June 2008"," Unusual and Unexpected... in a good way.
","An interesting film to say the least. We saw a more unusual style and story breaking through in 'Lady in the Water'. 'The Happening' goes one step further.<br/><br/>I'm a huge MNS fan, and it was a real treat to see something slightly different. Although not quite as strong and as deep as many of his previous films, it was an interesting experience. I finished watching with a satisfied sigh.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that Shyamalan attempted to exaggerate certain parts of his typical style (his unusual sense of humour in films etc.). It's not a film that you should see while expecting a completely Shyamalan-esquire experience. In a lot of ways, it's a new version of Signs on a bigger scale with a slightly different style. Interesting and more basic, slightly less realistic... and a very good film providing you clear your mind of trailers, reviews and your own expectations before watching."
"jhobdell","7","8","18","14 June 2008"," Good, but...
","I'm really not sure about this one. Obviously nothing Shymalan does is likely to live up to his initial, innovative success with The Sixth Sense, but they're all very imaginative and original. The premise underlying this one is particularly chilling, I think, because it has a basis in reality. I don't think anyone has ever lived whose bones never break (the basic premise of Unbreakable), but evidently plants are capable of changing rapidly to defend themselves, even if the extent to which this idea is carried in Shyamalan's new film seems quite ridiculous.<br/><br/>Personally I'm not sure about Wahlberg's acting - he seems either lethargic, apathetic or simply not involved a lot of the time. That said, there are some great moments: particularly the scene where he and the little girl, Jess, comfort each other, seen from a distance. I think the best character has to be the psychotic old Mrs Jones.<br/><br/>The full horror of what happens when subjected to the 'threat' is always hinted at but never fully revealed, in line with the certificate no doubt. The ending is suitably chilling for me, but overall the driving force behind the idea for the film is clearly the environmental band wagon.<br/><br/>It's a good film, but there's a slightly galling aftertaste."

","M. Night Shyamalan's newest Movie The Happening is poking fun of our society. Each day people kill themselves and we don't care to know why! The moment someone is about to kill themselves their whole world stops. Seeing all the suicides focused in a general area experts don't know the cause and guess. The movie depicts suicide as wave of wind that we cannot control. Since all the suicides in the movie are spontaneous without reason the movie highlights the worst of the problem. The characters confusion when confronted by dead suicide victims is to run away from the problem and isolate themselves from others who might have the suicide sickness. That's our societies apathy towards this wasteful loss of life."

","I had to jump into the fray & defend this film. While it is not M.Night's best, it is still moving, evocative, fun & thrilling. M.Night Shalomaleckem is an art house filmmaker. His forte is painting a scene, a mood. No better filmmaker can capture tension laced with melancholy like him. True, this film lags in terms of plot & I've seen better acting. But if you approach his movies with your mind and heart wide open, and let yourself feel, you'll be moved by the beauty of the images, the always stunning soundtrack & the thoughtfulness that's pervasive in all his films.

I know I'm rambling, but maybe people should not expect to have the thrills and chills handed to them on a silver platter.... and open up their minds and maybe think a little....then maybe more people that diss M.

","Finally saw 'the happening'. And if i have to describe the movie in a word, i'd say 'Charming'.<br/><br/>I was extremely excited because (fortunately) i hadn't seen any of the promotional materials and all i had was a vague idea of what the story could be.<br/><br/>After the debacle that was 'Lady in the water' (I'm a huge night-fan, in spite of which i didn't feel like defending it), Shyamalan has indeed returned to form, not fully though, but nonetheless, he's back. And he makes it very obvious that he's less of himself, much less.<br/><br/>This was a very conscious effort from night's side. You can see the carefulness in the way he's moved the story. He hasn't tried to do anything too much. Just when you think he's going back to his preachy self, he slips in a joke. There are several other instances where he stopped himself from going overboard.<br/><br/>A very 'aware' effort, and it has worked. It's rare when a movie exactly meets your expectations. Mostly, i'm disappointed, and rarely i'm surprised (by indie flicks) these days. Happening met my expectations and satisfied me.<br/><br/>What makes us forget about the few negatives is - 'The entertainment quotient'. ____________________________ Plot from IMDb: A paranoid thriller about a family on the run from a natural crisis(airborne toxins) that presents a large-scale threat to humanity.<br/><br/>:__________________________________________<br/><br/>I think 'the airborne toxins concept' in itself is overwhelmingly fresh, and was made believable by Shyamalan's tight screenplay. What works in his favor is the episodic structure of the screenplay, in the sense that we travel with the family and then it's about stuff that happens at point a then b then c and so on. So you don't really feel a lag as the scenes are always at a new spot, and you don't know what to expect.<br/><br/>There are some brilliantly executed sequences in the film: -The opening sequences- numb central park/construction workers fall etc -The aftermath at Princeton. -The lion cage mms. -The boys at the farm house porch. -The creepy lady house scenes.<br/><br/>As for the negatives- There are several visuals and situations that will remind you of previous night movies. This is another evidence of night playing it safe. He has compiled some of the ideas on the basis of what has worked in his previous films. There is just a hint of cheesiness at some points. For instance, a news reporter saying 'we'll never really know what caused the toxins', reminded me of how, in the village, night gives an 'all-justifying' speech to that junior ranger . And Night needs to get new boom mic operators, it's the 3rd freaking time! But the thing is, none of these things really matter to us as we tend to enjoy the film for what it is- A breezy eerie entertainer.<br/><br/>And it's definitely Shyamalan's least pretentious flick. It never takes itself too seriously. There are some witty moments which i enjoyed.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was solid. He was a very different Shyamalan protagonist as he did not seem to have a drastically disturbed life like the predecessors. He seemed like a down to earth character. Zooey was cute, naive and lovable. Very unaware of her unique beauty.<br/><br/>CG schmoogy! who needs it !I think i saw a couple of matte BGs but either way, the whole movie looked very organic which helped the cause and was a welcome change to my eyes.<br/><br/>Now for the reason as to why i really liked the film- The concept. The airborne toxins from plants.<br/><br/>WTF!<br/><br/>It's a sexy plan, but i wonder how many film-makers would be able to make a story out of that one! There is no definitive physical villainous structure in this film, he had to make that element out of thin air (literally!)... and he did! I love the guts night showed with this film. I think that's the reason he went safe with the treatment. The concept is so out-of-the-box that the audiences need a bit of familiarity within the story. I love the man for pulling this off. And the message of the movie is something i believe in firmly, you mess with nature, and it'll kick yo' ass.<br/><br/>Night's back on track baybee! Not his best (And it'll be a helluva task to beat 'Unbreakable'), But nonetheless, A good solid movie.<br/><br/>Verdict: Personally, This reminded me a little of 'War of the worlds'. And i was wondering, what that movie couldn't do with zillions fueled into it, this movie could! 'The happening' has a heart, a soul and a charm.<br/><br/>I've read what the critics had to write, and most seemed to have written it before even watching the film. It's amazing how the reviews are of Shyamalan rather than the movie.<br/><br/>I'm giving a confident thumbs up because the theater i went to was packed, and the audience response was extremely positive. They traveled with the characters and liked it, if not loved. Several 'aaah' and 'oooh' moments. And i think the ladies especially will like the ending portions a lot.<br/><br/>'The Happening':- Charming! 7/10<br/><br/>Special Note:<br/><br/>Joey : Manoj Night Shyamalan<br/><br/>-haha a masterstroke"

","I just came from the theater. All I can say is that I wasn't quite sure what the director was up to for the most part of the film. I mean many of the scenes seemed like some weird black humor to me and I couldn't stop laughing in those scenes, but I noticed that I was the only one who was. I just couldn't take seriously what was happening on the scene, it seemed like some B-quality movie, but since it got me to laugh I actually liked the movie.<br/><br/>There are two sides in this movie. On the other hand its very serious dealing with some deadly serious things which ain't funny at all and in a very convincing manner, but on the other hand there's a story about two lovers and a child and they act like in a comedy and the things that happen to them are also very funny. But the serious part of the movie really convinced me. It comes straight to your face and it is not nice to watch. I couldn't stop thinking that this movie has b*lls. I mean no movie is so cruel and ruthless.<br/><br/>I do think this movie is sort of an argument for the climate change and I was very convinced. I've watched several documents on the climate change and after that seeing this movie it sort of throws the whole cruel fact to your face that if we refuse to do anything about it, sh*t will hit the fan and it will hit it hard. Although the way it hits the fan in this movie is quite absurd it still gets the point trough.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure about the movie until the end. The ending was good and that serious part of the movie was good but the story of the people was a joke and I genuinely laughed when I saw it. Anyways, the ending had b*lls and make up for the bad story about the people."
"simonparker1990","1","10","24","27 June 2008"," First Lady in the Water, and now this?
","M.Night Shyamalan caused a lot of controversy amongst cinema goers nowadays. What started as a hugely promising career (with The Sixth Sense) has rapidly gone downhill, his last movie Lady in the Water being loathed by the majority, and loved by a very small minority. I'll confess to being unsure what to make of his movies. The Sixth Sense in my opinion was overrated, Unbreakable was a classic and his best, Signs had moments of brilliance but a bad ending, The Village was so focused on its twists it got dull quick, and then there was Lady. Lady was something I watched five times and each time changed my opinion. I hated it first time, loved it second time, was confused by it third, and the past two times I've just been left a bit blank by it. Its a misconceived movie for sure, but its very well made. And now we get onto The Happening, something that I was dreading seeing. The critics have slaughtered the movie and the early screenings were full of negativity. Still I went into the cinema two days ago, only after being turned away for seeing Wanted, and watched it. Now I expected it to be bad, I never expected it to be this bad. I did enjoy myself while watching the movie, but unfortunately it was because I was laughing at how bad it was. The Happening is simply a disaster on every level. The script, acting and directing is just terrible. The movie is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen and bare in mind I have seen Meet the Spartans. Mark Wahlberg is diabolical, Zooey Deschanel seems bored and confused by the experience, the storyline just seems confused, the ending stinks of anticlimax, and there are so many scenes that aim for serious but are stupidly funny because of it.<br/><br/>As I previously said the acting was horrendous. But was this really the actors fault? I am unsure as of yet, the script is horrendous but I am sure the actors could have made a bit more effort. Mark Wahlberg is very lucky to have any credibility left after this movie. If he hadn't have delivered a killer of a performance in The Departed I would avoid all future movies with him in. He is just terrible. Miscast and terrible. A scene where a companion shoots themselves sees Wahleberg response being ""Oh no"". I burst out laughing there and then. A later scene where he talks to a plant, yes you are reading that correct, just left me gob smacked. Zooey Deschanel at first is even worse than Wahlberg. Her opening scene is horrendous, in fact I was worried for Deschanel as it seemed like she had forgotten completely how to act. She does get better towards the end, but the script drags her down and her final scenes just annoyed me. The always reliable John Leguizamo does a decent job in his all too few scenes and his final sequence is one of the very, very few highlights. Yet he is in the movie for about half an hour, it annoys me as if Shyamalan had sense he would have realised Leguizamo had a better character and the audience would have been more interested in watching his story. Oh and the worst person in the movie, has to be the random crazy old lady played by Betty Buckley. Had the script and storyline allowed she could have had a decent character here, but she is just absurd and has the worst scenes in the movie by far. That and her and Wahlberg have the worst scene of the year, which basically ends in Wahlberg uttering in false amazement, ""What? No."" <br/><br/>The Happening has so many more problems than the actors though. The first problems begin when we actually see the people begin killing themselves, while on paper standing still and uttering mad things then killing yourself might sound decent. The way it is done on screen is laughable. A scene where people jump of building sites aims for horrifying, but just ends up ludicrous, I found that scene funny as did the majority of people in the cinema. The storyline itself just gets worse and worse, when we find out what the actual ""happening"" is you just roll your eyes in disappointment. Not only is the ""happening"" never properly explained, but it seems to change constantly, one moments it involves small groups of people, the next that idea is thrown out the window and we have them running away from the wind. I really had no idea what was really going on near the end, it wasn't confusing just misconceived. The movie has next to no thrills, the running away from wind sequence is laughable and the suicide scenes gradually get repetitive. And then we get to the ending. There is one scene near the end featuring Wahlberg and Deschanel walking towards each other in the wind, I won't spoil it, but that one scene actually gave me hope. Had what I though was going to happen actually happened the movie might have had a tiny bit of redemption. It looked like the movie was actually taking a risk. Alas it doesn't and we end up with an ending miles worse than Signs could ever offer. The movie is a giant anticlimax, and the very final scene just amplifies this all the more.<br/><br/>Based on The Happening I would actually argue Shyamalan should consider another career path, or at least realise he cannot write a decent script and stop writing them. All involved in this movie should just move on quickly and pretend it never happened. This is the first true failure of the summer, and what a huge failure it is. I recommend you watch it, but only to see one of the greatest failures of recent years."

","I really didn't feel like I got my money's worth out of The Happening. At 91 minutes including titles and credits, this film is very frugal on content. The central concepts of the film are really quite interesting and hold a lot of potential that was not really satisfactorily explored. Every promising lead seems to peter out before it carries us anywhere. I spent the whole second half of the film waiting for the 'aha' moment when the final plot turn would be revealed, only to be disappointed with a few weak pointless closing scenes and then the film just ending.<br/><br/>The character performances were solid for the most part, but then there were many character development threads which just seemed to lead nowhere. This just adds to the ungratifying feeling one is likely to take away from The Happening. To me it felt more like a movie project than a feature film.<br/><br/>Probably some viewers may also find some of the scenes in the film unnecessarily gratuitous and graphic, which just distracts us further from the interesting ideas around which the film is constructed."
"gregorwossilus","1","39","122","10 June 2008"," It's going to kill Shyamalan's career for good!
","I had such high hopes for this one since I like those Stephen King like horror-mystery-sci fi-pieces. Unfortunately Shyamalan hasn't learned from his previous super-flop ""Girl in the water"" and again delivers us a mildly suspenseful thriller about something attacking people on the US east coast, turning them into suicide candidates all around. Mark Wahlberg plays a teacher in the middle of it all fleeing the town to the countryside in the hope that the evil something has not reached the boonies yet. So far so good, the plot is nothing super impressive but promising enough to entertain genre-fans like me. And the trailer looked promising, too. But Shyamalan still is in preaching mode, something he took up with ""Signs"". He loads up his picture up with meaningful nonsense dialogue (unfortunately he again wrote the thing as well as directing and producing it). That is something which takes you out of the suspense again and again. And that is NOT good since one realizes the major shocking scenes already were in the trailers... In the second act he not only loads ""The Happening"" up with more meaningful, clunky dialogue but even more weird, meaningful characters who simple DO NOT work. As the movie goes on and on it becomes more and more ridiculous with sloppy mistakes in simple logic: Everybody is infected and dies, but TV stations and radio keep broadcasting, Wahlberg asks his female companion if she has cellphone service in the middle of it all - surprise! The world is in chaos, or so I thought! No wonder the cells don't work! DAAA! With the third act introducing a granny from hell in some remote farmhouse ""The Happening"" finally collapses. It's a true shame since we so far could accept it as a b-level horror-thriller with little blood but at least some honest attempts for suspense. But granny doesn't make sense, the way our heroes behave towards her makes even less sense and is totally unbelievable... And by that time one just wants to grab the director by the throat and scream into his face: ""Leave me alone with your somewhat strange and condescending philosophy of life and the world! You're the only one who believes in it! Spare your audience!"" One last thing about the score by James Newton Howard, a great talent in terms of movie scores. This time he's so over the top with his music it's just annoying. He pumps emotions into every scene maybe because he knew the movie itself couldn't deliver them...it's just unbearable. ""The Happening"" unfortunately could end Shyamalans career. After this one couldn't blame any studio for rejecting working with him."

","I'll begin by saying I am a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan films. However, each one is getting worse than the one before it. The Sixth Sense was amazing, Unbreakable was very good, Signs was good, The Village was good, and Lady in the Water was pretty descent. Now we have The Happening. I had high hopes; the trailers and movie posters looked awesome, but trailers have a way of taking substandard movies and making them look like blockbusters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story idea, and the execution thereof. It was a creative idea and kept me interested through the entire film. The filming style was trademark M. Night Shyamalan. I guess what I was looking for was the twist ending that we have come to expect with his early films. We have been conditioned to expect this from him, and we just did not get it here. However, what we did get was a gripping story about a horrifying event and the struggles of a group of people trying to survive it. There is also a subplot dealing with love that was done fairly well.<br/><br/>I have seen it as a rental, and I am glad I did not go to the theater and pay full price, and I am not in any hurry to own it. I would like to own it, to complete my M. Night Shyamalan collection, but I'll wait until the DVD price comes down a bit. I will give this film an extra star because M. Night Shyamalan is from my hometown of Wayne, just outside of Philadelphia, and like all M. Night Shyamalan films, a good portion of this takes place in the Philly area. My rating is 6 stars. It was cool but didn't have any lasting power like M. Night's earlier films. <br/><br/>See my profile to understand my rating philosophy."

Even though this movie offers a possible explanation of some events in the world, nothing makes it worthwhile. I'll give Shyamalan just one more chance to make a good movie; if his next one sucks, then I am totally shutting Shyamalan out of my memory. Maybe he was a one trick pony.<br/><br/>Long story short: avoid this one.

After renting it from PPV, I am extreamely happy that I did not see it in theaters, due to the extent of the movie.<br/><br/>Over all the movie was good, but this is so unlike M Night to make. This movie had way to much violence. The most disturbing parts of the movies was how everyone killed them selves. I recommend to M Night that if he wants to keep making successful movies, to stop making ""R"" movies, that has more then normal blood.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie, overall was alright. It is so M Night to do, but it is not like him to add the content he did. The acting on the scale to 1-5 is a 4. it was good, the people made it seem real. The main character that was a kid, was extreamely good. Which you seem to see less of in kids.<br/><br/>This is a review by bkopicz3 or ""Review B"""

I know this was really a bad movie.I did not get the role of the GF of our hero . I was really pondering the question .What she's doing and why she's so stupid .

"mattwaterhouse","2","5","10","1 July 2008"," Painful and hilarious
","It was the plants, punishing us for polluting the planet. There, I just saved you from the most pointless 91 minutes of your life.<br/><br/>Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.<br/><br/>I really have trouble with M Night Shyamalan, firstly because I have real trouble spelling his name, and secondly because he is so inconsistent. His recent films have been either severely below par (eg. Lady In The Water) or average at best (eg. Signs) and he has turned from being a promising young writer/director into a provider of weak cinema. The obvious fact is that he got lucky with the Sixth Sense, followed it up brilliantly with Unbreakable, and then kept trying to write more elaborate twists and turns in his movies. He is still riding on the Sixth Sense's reputation as a classic, and hopefully the fact that The Happening was god awful will knock him down to earth and make him go back to the drawing board. This worked with him before, in the distinctly un-Shyamalany Stuart Little, so hopefully it will work again, and PERMANENTLY.<br/><br/>The Happening, which is by far the most unassuming title in the world, is about a an unexplained epidemic of suicides in built up areas of North East America. A school teacher attempts to flee this epidemic with his wife, colleague and colleague's daughter and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Yes. Hilarity. The mass suicide scenes are shot so badly that they are funny. Mass suicide made funny, and not intentionally. Great. I'm speaking generally, there are some scenes that are very well done, like the builders jumping from the scaffolding, but the others, especially the guy who tries to make a lion eat him, are awful. This said, there are three set pieces that are brilliant. I've mentioned the builders; the second is where the colleague drives with some other people into a town looking for his wife, and they are greeted by the sight of the town's inhabitants hanging from lampposts. Brilliant suspense is created, and a real sense of doom when they notice a hole in the roof, punctuated by the car being crashed into a tree. The old, crazy woman is brilliant too, and the scenes in her house were genuinely scary.<br/><br/>But what made this film so poor was the acting. Mark Wahlberg can act, The Departed, Boogie Nights, Four Brothers, they all prove it, so there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for a wooden performance that makes Hayden Christiensen look like Al Pacino. The sad thing is, in comparison to everyone else in The Happening, he is actually pretty good. Zooey Deschanel makes no effort, her part could have been filled by a corpse. John Leguizamo was very average, he had his good and bad moments, and the girl who played his daughter was similarly OK. Everyone else is instantly forgettable, except the aforementioned old crazy lady, who makes the last few scenes tension filled and gripping. The script the actors had to work with was boring, stale and... You know what, I'm not even going to go there. IMDb won't let me swear, and I can't talk about the script without using the dreaded ""f"".<br/><br/>The bad far outweighed the good. I left the cinema feeling like i would never get the time i had spent watching this sorry excuse for a film back. Don't watch it. It will only help Shyamalan get good again. Hopefully."
"JimmyConway2","3","5","10","30 June 2008"," Unfortunately the worst film I have ever seen.
","I went into this film wit high hopes. M. Night Shamalyan being one of my favourite directors I assumed he wouldn't disappoint. Also, after his great performance in The Departed I was looking forward to seeing Mark Wahlberg again.<br/><br/>I'll start with Mark Wahlberg. His acting in this film was so bad I found myself laughing in the cinema (The only other film I have ever done that in was Battlefield Earth, I tried so hard to contain myself this time but it really was that bad). His facial expression did not change throughout and his delivery of the already plain dialogue made the film sound dull, lifeless and sarcastic as if the director didn't know whether this film was a black comedy or a thriller.<br/><br/>M. Night Shamalyan. What a shame. This guy is not short of a thriller genius, up there with the likes of Wes Craven. In his last film, Lady In The Water, he tried to play it down a bit, make a bit more of a mild thriller. Well, it still attracted audiences and made some money but the general reception was poor. The film was carried by another underrated performance by Paul Giamatti. I really don't want to say this about him but it seems like he wrote the script for The Happening in about 15 minutes, wrote the first draft and then never even read it through once. I know this didn't happen but this script was awful...AWFUL. It was one dimensional, predictable and dull. It had pointless bits that could have been missed out and bits that should have been put in to explain the story, or lack of story. The idea was there but it was delivered in such a rushed way that it was like he didn't really care what the end result was. His direction was just as bad...<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film. I was highly disappointed. I really did give this film a chance but in the end it really was, unfortunately, the worst film I have ever seen."

The cause of the deaths was obvious to all but the cast so the plot was a farce from the very beginning.<br/><br/>The MP private was a stereotype of a cliché, as were the Nebraska red necks, and so on and so. And the sub text, the plants are getting their own back, reclaiming the planet? Oh my, didn't see that coming.<br/><br/>A typical M Night performance.

M. Night's comically poor grasp of how science actually works is highlighted when Wahlberg's character, in a moment of high pressure, recites a version of the scientific method to himself to figure out a problem I'd sussed at least 30 minutes before - hint: if the experts on TV say there is a wind-borne toxin killing progressively smaller populations of humans, you better believe I'll be running far, far away from anyone else and sealing myself into an air-tight place to wait it out. There are other moments of unintentional comedy, too - the 'out-running the wind' scene comes to mind.<br/><br/>I have seen a review on-line which 'outs' The Happening as intelligent design propaganda - it had not occurred to me as I grumbled about it afterwards, but it certainly fits the thinking of this anti-evolution pseudo-science.<br/><br/>For the reason's above, the film lost me early on (and from the audience reactions, most of the other cinema-goers too, most of whom were students), and never threatened to win me back. There are some good moments - the building site scene sticks in mind, but with characters acting so stupidly and unnaturally, I couldn't empathise.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because I actually like Lady in the Water - Paul Giamatti had a large part to play for his wonderful performance; Mark Wahlberg (I still remember with pain his efforts as leading man in Planet of the Apes) and co. remained laboured and wooden throughout, and with a script like this, it would have been beyond the gifts of far more talented actors to make anything of it."

"dbborroughs","6","6","13","15 June 2008"," Even though the scary moments are wasted thanks to poorly drawn central characters this is the best the director has done in quite a while
","M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece of a misfire about the end of the world.<br/><br/>The plot of the film has a sudden rash of suicides on a colossal scale spiraling outward from New York's Central Park. People freeze for a moment and then when they begin to move again do themselves in. In Philadelphia a school teacher and his wife decide to flee into the country with friends, but the danger is following them.<br/><br/>What can I say I'm both floored and angered by this film. The premise and the scenes of (self) destruction are some of the most terrifying and unnerving scenes put on film. Shyamalan wins back a great deal of the points I held against him with some of the best horror scenes of the year. Its creepy. Even the neatness with which some people kill themselves is unpleasant. Many of the scenes are some of the best of the year.<br/><br/>However before you run out to see this let me add a huge BUT the central characters, aided and abetted by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel who play them, sink this film. Actually pretty much most of the ""character"" and non event scenes are really weak, its as if they were cut in from another movie completely. Some have complained its the performances that sink the film, I would argue that the writing does more damage then the poor performances. Its just that this is not a film for the sort of characters shown to us to inhabit its space. This is a film that should have had no stars and should have been almost documentary like in the telling. The conventions of typical character driven cinema don't work with a story like this. If we had somehow been allowed to remain thrust into things with out an attempt at making people we can follow in a nuclear family sort of way this would have worked so much better. Do we really need to know about what may or may not have happened at Deschanel and Wahlberg's wedding? not really. This could have been a nice companion piece to last years The Mist, but its not. The reason we need a non-conventional means of telling the story is that once we know whats happening, nothing is really done with it.(If nothing else you need a non-conventional story telling because the thing-the monster- is invisible or nothing) There's this run up to the end of the world but by putting a conventional couple into it you realize that its only clever to a point and that it really doesn't go anywhere once its all set up. Its like having someone telling you the start of a great adventure story-that hooks you with a great set up only to the storyteller wander off with out taking it any farther- leaving you to go what happens next? Better than the last couple of films made by M. Night Shyamalan, but not one I would say to run out to see in theaters. Worth a look on DVD or cable.<br/><br/>Best way I can describe it- when it works its a nice companion piece to Shyamalan's Signs (or the parts that worked before the illogic took over) 5 ish out of 10 for the creepy parts"

","It's been a while since I've felt so obliged as to write a review on here. This film truly isn't worthy of one. All I can say is that it is really awful. The dialog is laughably ridiculous (people in the theater in the screening I attended were actually laughing throughout) and the acting equally as bad. I was really hoping to see MNS return to his former grandeur with The Happening and I had faith in him. But this movie is so tawdry and boring that it is beyond salvage. For those calling this a ""thinking man's movie,"" I hate to see how elementary your ""thoughts"" are.<br/><br/>I have a Ph.D. and there's nothing I love more than a movie that truly invokes thought. This piece of detritus certainly does not. It is plagued by a rushed storyline with absolutely no climatic redemption whatsoever. Clever marketing might yield exceedingly good profits (which could save MNS from this being the nail in his coffin) until word-of-mouth exposes the fraud this film truly is.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed in this movie. I remember feeling this cheated after being completely dissatisfied and disgusted with Lady in the Water; it's equally as bad with The Happening. Don't waste your time, money, or energy with The Happening...Because Happening, it simply isn't."
"bollycritic","9","8","19","15 June 2008"," It was not meant for a mass audience...
","That is the reality. Shyamalan is basically trying to package a warning/message in a commercial cinema package, and it won't work. Especially to our highly consumption based, capitalist society. I remember a guy leaving the cinema in front of me saying, ""That was stupid. Plants are stupid."" Sure dude. I agree the chances of this story unfolding in real life may be remote, but remember that the world around us is not truly in our control either. There are ramifications for everything we do to our surrounding. People of faith also realize that sooner or later, we'll all be faced to realize that the world is not our possession. The film is NOT preachy, as some people contend. Obviously, these individuals have not seen Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. Happening has a slow, languished pace that makes you think, and that's not something audiences enjoy doing. They'd prefer the trees turning into monsters that attack the main characters. True, there are many things that I did not understand after the first viewing, and the film is not perfect, but that's what good cinema is all about. It invites you to return multiple times to explore new themes and challenge what you previously liked or disliked. Looking forward to my next viewing. <br/><br/>Side Note: For the record, of all of Night's flicks I agree he went horribly wrong with Lady in The Water. Signs was superficial and does not hold up on repeated viewing, but this one is great."

","I went to the 12:05am premier of the movie at my movie theater, and people (including me) were actually laughing out loud at the lousy performance and plot of this movie. At the end of it shouts of ""I want my money back"" could be heard throughout the theater.<br/><br/>First, let's take a look at the plot. Nature is trying to warn humans about treating the environment responsibly by killing people, well, making people kill themselves. That's right, nature is outraged and now your shrubbery is no longer safe. This is the biggest tree hugging hippie movie to date, and it's quite disgusting.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'd like to say a word on the acting. I really haven't seen a movie in my life with acting worse than in this movie. None, and I mean none, of the the roles in the film were convincing. Mark Wahlberg had a stupid up-talk problem where he had an upward inflection in every sentence. There was an Army soldier in the movie, and he looked like an 18 year old video game nerd who just came from his grandma's basement. Soldiers are supposed to have leadership training and discipline, and this guy was more scared than anyone else and didn't have a clue what to do.<br/><br/>It seems that every movie that M. Night Shyamalan has made has gotten exponentially worse. The Sixth Sense was good, and The Village was pretty good, but after that it was all over. He shouldn't be allowed to make another movie. Ever.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it was the biggest waste of seven dollars and 91 minutes in my life. To say I was disappointed would be like saying Hitler didn't really care for Jews."
"americanmoviedirector","10","7","16","16 June 2008"," A Magnificent Spectacle
","The Happening has achieved the position of one of the most beautifully coordinated and thought-provoking stories ever told. When i walked into the theater, i was expecting nothing short of perfection by M. Night Shyamalan whose movies (with the exception of his sporting try at a fairytale, Lady In The Water) are frankly beyond stunning. When i walked out of the theater my perception of movies had polarized. No longer were movies something to do on Friday night, no longer were they something that attempted to capture my attention for an hour and a half, no more were they just mindless pictures with sounds. They had now reached a level of unparalleled conception. No other form of media could challenge films in getting a message across or telling an entertaining story. There was meaning beyond what music, video games or even books could achieve. Meaning, normal people could not comprehend, especially the ones who go out of their way to belittle someone's artistic expression by giving vacuous reasons to why they believe, in their simpleton minds, it was not worthy of their approval. How can you trivialize someone's craftsmanship when in reality you have no experience in the field whatsoever. But by paying for a 10$ ticket you feel its your place to criticize and denounce someone's obvious hard work and zeal. Its your fault for even deciding to go to an excellent, captivating movie in the first place. Its not equitable of you to prevent people from experiencing this new truth just to fuel your rampage of ignorance. I highly advocate that next time someone offers you something visionary, keep your opinions to yourself unless you have valid justification to support your harsh accusations."

","Hi guys...Sorry I made such a bad film. My heart just wasn't into it since FOX wouldn't let me write myself in as a major character. I'm sorry for the insipid dialog, slow pacing and overall retarded premise. I really phoned this one in. First, I must give an overdue thanks to Dan Lauria (The Wonder Years) for introducing me to Hollywood and helped me get my first gig with the film WIDE AWAKE that starred Rosie O'Donnell. Dan's a great actor and I never once gave him a part in any of my films because I believed I was a better actor.<br/><br/>Now, since I'm being forthcoming, let's take a look at my other ""great"" achievements: The Sixth Sense = Truth be told, I read this book by Richard Matheson called Stir of Echoes and I stole the entire story and just renamed it.<br/><br/>Unbreakable = well, I stole that from my kid.<br/><br/>Signs = I stole this from an assortment of David Koepp material. He even later discussed me in various interviews of how much I seem to borrow from him. Well, I love the guy's work and will continue to steal from him in the future.<br/><br/>The Village = While digging through my kids' bedroom, I found one of their school books and loved the cover which features a young blind girl, in a red cloak...the book's called RUNNING OUT OF TIME. It's published by Scholastic. I'll admit that I stole the entire story and retitled it. The author got upset, sued Disney and they paid out 10 million dollars. Then we collaborated on a public story saying that we had ""creative"" differences and my contract was severed. Oops.<br/><br/>Lady in the Water = I thought for my next, I should steal from the foreign market...I found this BETA tape of a film called The Time Travelers and I wrote the same story, in English, and called it my fairytale. Nobody understood it because nobody went to see it.<br/><br/>Now, we're stuck with The Happening = I stole this from a classic novel called Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham.<br/><br/>I am not a good filmmaker. I got lucky because I suck wieners like Eli Roth."
"aos181","7","7","16","13 June 2008"," One simple message at a time
","As a Shyamalan fan I have an almost automatic bias. I love all his films including the infamous Lady in the Water. The reason is that he always brings something unique to the able. I believe what messes up the perception of his films are the way that they are marketed. All of his films are simple dramas covered with a touch of science fiction.<br/><br/>With that said I disagree with most critics when they say the first half was the better of the film. The first 20 minutes have cringe worthy dialogue but some cool deaths. Things that detract from this film are some badly rendered sound affects(the gun shots), and the odd score(though it improves at the end.) <br/><br/>Now onto the things that are good, I am a drama person and I know where nights coming from. Though I am an atheist I appreciate nights religious and spiritual overtones because there in total context with the situations. Wahlberg is sometimes stiff but he has his moments, especially towards the end. Zooey seems kind of odd but too lovable to hate. But the my favorite person in the film is Leguizamo, who brings a very likable nature to his character and I wish he had been in the rest of the film. <br/><br/>This film is a kind of throwback to twilight zone and old school b-movie horror films but it has shyamalans in it everywhere. The throwback redeems the score up to a point though I wish it had been toned down. There are some unique ways people kill themselves. But what I appreciate most is that the situation is a kind of scientific possibility and I think thats what makes the film. Never have grass and trees seemed more threatening then when wind is just blowing. <br/><br/>People are gonna hate this film but they are gonna turn to another mind numbing super- hero movie (The Hulk) and love it to death, (Don't get me wrong I wanna see Dark Knight badly, but at least its actually has some roots grounded in reality and suspense). But what I love about Nights films is that they always have a reason to exist, and this one does too."

","Wow is M. Night Shyamalan the most misunderstood director in history. His critics seem to want him to make a certain kind of film and are really not happy when he doesn't. This is the seventh film I've seen of his and although I'll admit it's probably not up there with his best ones I still found it very enjoyable. All his films have a different quality that make them stand out and are not as predictable as most of the films that get made in that genre. I'm pretty sure this was meant as a black comedy but it was also quite disturbing and creepy. I liked Wahlberg's wide eyed performance and the way he played it for laughs a lot of the time. I hope Shyamalan is strong enough to ignore the haters and continues to make interesting and entertaining films."

Unless you're extremely bored don't bother watching its a waste of one and half hours of your life. If the acting was better then maybe it would be a fairly decent film. Its cheesy and dull.<br/><br/>One compliment I can give this film is it is not predictable. Mostly because you can not see where they are going with it or maybe because you won't be that bothered."
"ironhorse_iv","5","3","5","3 March 2014"," What happen to M. Night Shyamalan? The Happening happen and it was a huge disappointment.
","Director M. Night Shyamalan use to be a really director, but as of late, he has been producing a lot of awful movies. Is he really trying to make us kill ourselves, after watching his films?! I use to love his films, but The Happening is one of the biggest letdowns, I ever witness. The film is about a mysterious event happening all over the East Coast of the United States, where people all over are killing themselves for no reason, and there's no explanation to these mass suicides. Nobody can stop it, and no-one can escape it. It doesn't stop, High school teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) from trying to escape its death grip. With his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sachez), they hope to survive by escaping the cities and try their luck elsewhere. The movie takes mostly a Hitchcockian approach to the horror, in which, the suicides happen without much explanation. You see, the movie even references a lot of Hitchcock's films. M. Night is even famous for the Cameo like Hitchcock. M. Night Shyamalan plays Joey, with whom Alma had an affair. Although his character is never seen only his voice. The movie could be describe as a badly written, 'The Birds' meet 'Psycho'. There is some examples in the film that were very smart writing such as the mood ring symbolism. There is a lot of use of the color, yellow that can represent a lot of things like being positive in life, than self-destruct. Some people think it has this 'Cold War' or 'New Terrorist or it's the Government"" hidden message coming out of this film due to the talks of extreme talks about government trying to depopulation their population, but I can't find the bearing to this film. Without spoiling the plot, I think the opening lecture by Elliot Moore gives too much away of the plot too early. The movie is really out there with its Gaia's Vengeance's plot. I like how all the suddenly, these 'things' evolve to emit neurotoxin. All species of it. Simultaneously. The Happening has this post environmentalism theme that seem a bit too preachy. I don't get why people in the park would get attack, because it's seem that the park is helping nature. I don't think M. Night Shymalan knows how science works. Science solves the mystery, not give up explaining it. Science Cannot Comprehend is just a lame excuse for bad writing. Then there is way too much exposition speak throughout the film, as if the audience was too dumb to know what is already happening. I wish, the movie explore more of the conflict between Elliot and his wife, maybe it would help the story better. The whole cheesy power of love will stop the tragedy is not well-played. This movie could had work, if only the deaths weren't so cheesy. For some reason, the film's R rating was a huge marketing ploy because before this movie, most of M. Night's horror films were PG-13. M. Night can see that with an R rating, he was able to get away with a lot of things that he would had to tone down if it was another PG-13 film like extreme violent, gore, or digging into more serious disturbing adult themes. Rather than making a serious, in depth horror film. He made fun of the horror genre, by going with an 1960's sci-fi/ horror cheesy B-film style with over the top's deaths like a man getting eaten by a lion or another man getting run over by a lawnmower. Even the children getting shot is pretty dumb. It was supposed to be shocking, but it wasn't. Anybody can see it, a mile away. M. Night really try to make the wind seem scary, but its fails to be. If anything was scary, it was the crazy doll lady. Mid-through the movie, it seems like we jump into another horror movie with her. It was a bit distracting from the main plot and never really goes anywhere. I felt like it was supposed to symbolism, where Alma and Elliot's relationship was going, but it's never truly explain. Most of the people in the film, give out dull expression when seeing people getting killed. The worst is Alma. Zooey Deschanel's acting is so bad, I just hoping she was going to die in the film. Mark Wahlberg isn't as bad, but his delivery feel like he was neutered. He didn't had any balls in it. I understand why he was so monotone in his underacting because of the plot needed him to be, but gees it was too passive aggressive. Still, he had some of the most quote silly lines ever like 'What? No!' or 'Come on, take an interest in science'. The rest of the characters in the film are just awful cartoony people such as the hot dog guy and the cheese and crackers army dude. The camera work is just bad. I like how the characters don't notice the bodies hanging from the trees until the camera reveals them, even though they had been driving straight towards them for a good 30 seconds. I dislike how in the end, half of Alma's face is missing from the frame. I was redder than roses, redder than poinsettias seeing that. Overall: I would watch it, if you like 'so bad, it's good' type films. It's pretty much laughable. Besides that, we sensed it, we saw the signs, but this movie doesn't have anything good happening."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","5","26 December 2013"," Boring to the extreme
","So we have a premise where a mysterious disease is spreading throughout the world and we start to follow a group of survivors as they try to save themselves from the spreading destruction. Fair enough, it's another disaster movie with close calls, intense escape situations and general panic and mania amongst mankind. I've seen some good example of this and I'm open to seeing another one.<br/><br/>Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has no idea how to direct a film such as this one. The start of the film actually isn't that bad and some of the imagery of people losing their minds is actually very effective and creepy, as it should be. But then the film focuses exclusive on Mark Wahlberg and his group of survivors and it becomes so unbelievably dull to watch. All the tension bleeds out of the movie while we're forced to watch his monotone delivery of lines while he strays between his two basic expression, neither of which isn't that emotive or expressive. And I'm not saying that I Wahlberh can't be entertaining. He's decent enough when he's in an action film or something that requires him to actually do something. But in a movie where the actual threat isn't that visible and most of the film's quality has to come from the actors and their ability to convey the feel of danger, he's not your guy. And unfortunately none of the other actors are good enough to pick up the slack.<br/><br/>And then there are the sins of Shyamalan. He spends far too much time following these people as they flee aimlessly from one place to another. The threat itself is poorly established, makes no sense and is kind of silly when you stop to think about it. The problem is that this film takes itself far too seriously. Had it even hinted at the possibility that it had been made with some tongue in cheek, it would have been far more tolerable to watch. It's no surprise that this film has been parodied and mocked to the death.<br/><br/>Long story short, this is a bad film. It has no direction, no goals, no aim. It's a poor man's attempt to film a horror film without understanding horror at all. The sooner we forget its existence the better."
"adeyfk","7","3","5","28 August 2012"," Real SCI-FI isn't always about special effects.
","So SCI-FI films generally fall into three categories: social and human commentary, spaceships and war, and, shockingly awful. This film is definitely the first. This film, whilst not ground breaking or at the top of its game is still well worth a watch. The emphasis of this film is on how we as humans react to something intangible yet deadly. I think that the film is well written, and really starts to look into what we as humans would do faced with imminent death. Don't get me wrong, there are holes galore in this film, but it still manages to show how the most ordinary of people can rise to the occasion when pushed, and how this would not be in a Chuck Norris kind of way but a much more natural dealing with the situation in the best way they can. Wahlberg and Deschanel give good performances of two people with their own issues that they have to deal with and put aside given the situation they find themselves in. There are other reactions that are very human and as with a lot of human decisions, seem to make no sense save for the person making them. This is one of my favorite aspects of the film, how you sit and watch a person make a decision and say to yourself; ""I'd never do that"". That's the rub though, until faced with a real situation you'll never know how you would react. This film is thought provoking and will leave you with questions about yourself and how you would react. So, not great but a good solid film."

Whether he's in the train station, car, talking to a woman, he always has that surprised, somewhat disoriented look on his face. And to add to that, he has absolutely no emotion in his lines.

","The Happening opened today, 11th June, 2008 where I live and this is my no-spoiler review.<br/><br/>Walking forward, as opposed to backwards, out of the cinema I came up with some alternate taglines for The Happening:<br/><br/>Forward Ever, Backward Never<br/><br/>The Answer, My Friend, Is Blowing In The Wind<br/><br/>If you have to see one movie for the summer you must see The Happening. That sounds like a marketing line from a biased reviewer but it is just my honest opinion. The Happening was a haunting movie that was fun, gruesome, intense, dramatic, sad, chilling, disturbing, intelligent, believable and yet sprinkled with humor. Though The Happening is an R-rated movie you would love, it is not for the squeamish regardless of age. I am not sure if Shyamalan wanted to prove something to his critics but he wasted no time in getting to the point. It was pure cinematic efficiency. As usual, Shyamalan's characters were mostly believable except when there was a need or two for an unbelievable one. The atmosphere created was one of suspense and hope. You will jump, believe me, you will. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto under Shyamalan's direction was once again outstanding so please, finish your popcorn early. But that wasn't all as Shyamalan called on James Newton Howard once again to settle the score, and settle it good.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, Betty Buckley and M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off and pulled it off in style. Mark Wahlberg was outstanding with Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo giving good support. Ashlyn Sanchez has a bright future ahead. Betty Buckley was simply bloodcurdling. M. Night - minor spoiler ahead - did not appear; at least physically.<br/><br/>I can't figure why, but The Happening is a movie that is strangely satisfying in an unsettling way.<br/><br/>But in the end they wanted more. <br/><br/>2008-06-12 - update: - I want to see this movie again and who is this Joey character anyway.<br/><br/>http://akalol.wordpress.com/"
"Screen-Space","2","8","20","12 June 2008"," Those scary trees, that creepy wind.....
","No doubt hoping to tap into the enviro-panic that is gripping the world, M. Night Shyamalan has created a still-born, lifeless dud with The Happening, that would have served the environmental debate a whole lot better by not imposing its footprint on the world at all.<br/><br/>The opening scenes - all of which we've seen in the trailer - set up a jarringly compulsive premise that had the heart pounding (it earned the film all three of its stars from me). At some point the distributor Warner Bros should have realised the guy cutting the trailer should have been put in charge of the film - he gets more tension from three minutes than M. gets from 90 mins.<br/><br/>As the character-driven narrative starts to take over, it quickly becomes clear that nobody in this film is in any way relatable - from Mark Wahlberg's gaspy, drippy school teacher to the blank-eyed gaze of Zooey Deschanel to John Leguizamo's know-it-all blatherer, all the way down through the vaguely-comical support players (a loopy, cross-eyed plant merchant; a Gomer-Pyle-esquire army private). M.'s best work - The Sixth Sense, Signs - found the balance between genre suspense and characters that engaged and enthralled. The Happening is guilty of the exact opposite - creating a menace that actually dilutes the tension as more details are revealed, threatening a group of heroes who become increasingly less interesting and believable as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Most disappointing is the apparent dissapation of M.'s skill as a craftsman. Even those who thought his past films underwhelming bits of storytelling would concede that they were good-looking, well-composed examples of a director who knows how to frame the action and find the essence of his scene. Not so here - the colour palette is bland, the staging unimaginative and static, the sense of tension arbitrary and sporadic. It feels like he doesn't want to push himself or perhaps lacks faith in the material. Had it not been the work of a writer-director, I would've blamed the mismatching of filmmaker and material.<br/><br/>Having been a fan, I hope Night hasn't had his day, but The Happening represents something that will trouble his supporters. This is the sort of premise that should be a walk-up start for the director of The Sixth Sense, should provide ample opportunity for thrills and chills for the director of Signs. That it fails so completely begs the question - where to from here...? Oh, and given its enviro-message, its fair to ask - was this film's production fully carbon-neutral? I'm not cynical enough to think M. would latch onto a hot-button issue like global warming just to sell a few tickets, without practicing what he preached...would he...?"

","I felt John Leguizamo's performance was the stand-out performance in the film. The line where he tells Zooey Deschanel ""Don't hold my daughter's hand unless you mean it"" was so powerful and every scene he was in, every line he delivered was filled to the brim with emotion. He's such an incredible actor.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, I enjoyed it very much. I thought the characters and storyline had a lot of heart and while I can see where people would criticize the dialogue, I think it personified the quirky characters Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were portraying.<br/><br/>And that old woman!! So creepy!"
"cherold","7","4","8","20 August 2013"," poor, misunderstood The Happening
","I went into this movie knowing all the negative reviews it had received, but I watched it anyway because I find general reactions to Shyamalan's films don't always coincide with mine. I liked the Lady in the Water a good deal, and while I thought Unbreakable was overrated, the only one of his film's I would have been better off not watching was The Village.<br/><br/>While it's certainly not his best movie (which is, and probably always will be, The Sixth Sense), I liked this from the freaky beginning scenes in which people inexplicably begin killing themselves. There's something wonderfully low key about it all, as though people are too confused to even freak out. <br/><br/>That's one of the things some of the other people here have criticized - people not freaking out - and I think that's because people have come to believe movies are reality and if people don't act like people do in other movies then they're acting unrealistically. I wouldn't presume to predict how a situation like this would play out.<br/><br/>Another thing that I like is the lack of certainty about what's going on. Many of the reviews here ignore that, just describing this as a man versus plant movie, but that's just one of the suggestions made during the film, and while the movie clearly has an environmental point (and regretfully sheds some ambiguity at the very end), it is not as simple- minded and clear cut as critics suggest. It would be more accurate to call this a man against wind movie, since it is something unknown in the air that is causing this, and I like the fact that the threat is unseen and unknown.<br/><br/>The approach is clearly lifted from Hitchcock's The Birds, and it's interesting how everyone was willing to accept the vagaries and poor science of that movie yet lambastes this one. <br/><br/>As with Lady in the Water, there is something notably non-Hollywood about the way people react in this film. No one knows what to do, no one knows what's going on, people constantly make bad decisions and there is a distinct lack of heroism. And I like that. In a way, I feel Shyamalan is an indie filmmaker who engenders Hollywood expectations. I feel that many of the film's critics want both this film and Lady in the Water to feature Tom Cruise jumping off of buildings and blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>I also quite like the odd minor characters. It's interesting that the most helpful people in the movie are kind of disturbing. I've seen movies where the hero was helped by someone great, or helped by someone who turned out to be dangerous, but I've never the hero helped by people who were just the sort of peculiar people you would inch away from if you didn't need their help.<br/><br/>While I don't understand the hatred of the script, I can see some point in complaints about the acting. Zooey is like someone with a piece missing, almost sleepwalking through the film, and the movie either needs her more engaged or needs to make us understand what's behind that. And while Mark seems fine in the lead role, I will admit that I was not strongly invested in the characters. But then, that was also true in The Birds.<br/><br/>I think what keeps getting Shyamalan in trouble is people don't understand what movie he's making. Both this movie and Lady in the Water were accused of not being scary enough, and if Shyamalan was trying to make them really scary, he failed. But I don't think he was doing that. I think he is more interested in Hitchcockian suspense than in pure horror, and I think the Sixth Sense is, in a way, his curse, because everyone says, ""do that again,"" and that's clearly not his goal.<br/><br/>This is not to say the film had no flaws. There were definitely moments that were unrealistic. The suicides were sometimes too imaginative to be likely, and at times behavior seemed designed specifically to get the characters to a particular point rather than because it made sense (i.e. the train drivers' actions).<br/><br/>In spite of some issues though, I found this movie very entertaining, and enjoyed it seemingly for many of the aspects that others found so unlikable. <br/><br/>My takeaway is this: I can never listen to anyone else when it comes to Shyamalan. Now that I realize that, I guess I should even go ahead and watch The Last Airbender.<br/><br/>(FYI, Were I to order the Shyamalan movies from best to worse, I would say The Sixth Sense, The Visit, Signs, Lady in the Water, The Happening, Unbreakable, The Last Airbender, The Village.)"

","It starts off with some wackos croaking themselves in mildly off-beat ways.<br/><br/>A fairly promising start, a mystery of why the mass suicides, and how to stop them. Unfortunately, things bog down and go nowhere in a hurry. Repeated shots of some meadow, with a breeze blowing. Dull, expository speculations from characters are substituted for action. Stuff that nobody would ever say or think, even if they were high on something. People wander around, more deaths are talked about, and it's all punctuated with weak performances. The actors look like they have no idea what they're supposed to do. People peer blankly and witlessly at bizarre things they see. Actors walk like a stiff, slow robots that need a lube job. Zooey Deschannel, a fine actress in other films, is wasted in a role where she mumbles and stares glassy-eyed (and she's the least awful in the cast). The whole thing is silly, but does not even achieve a ""so bad it's good"" level.<br/><br/>It's all a conspiracy! Somebody (you simply won't believe how idiotic it is when you find out who) is mad, and they're not gonna take it any more. I couldn't take the boredom any more, either. I shut it off about an hour in."

","The Sixth Sense was my favorite movie EVER (and that's out of 55 years of movie watching) - but The Happening is waaay down on my list. I wasn't merely disappointed, I was incredulous! When the credits came on I was like, ""Are you kidding me?!"" I kept waiting for the requisite protagonist genius solution; the guy was a math teacher.. one of the victims kept repeating ""calculus, calculus"".. ergo, the hero would, in a flash of inspiration, solve the problem with an equation and rush to initiate the antidote. But no, this was an antagonist who wouldn't be stopped. I felt that the ending was an easy cop-out. Godzilla finally dies at the end... oh no, wait, it was just an NDE, here comes Godzilla again! Credits. It's like countless films that reanimate the monster/murderer at the end just so a sequel could be made - except in this case there will be no sequel - it was just a lazy way to end a movie. Not that films should necessarily be predictable, but in lieu of a twist here and a surprise there, at least throw us some juicy morsels of gratification! This movie lacked depth, intensity, revelation and satisfaction. For the most part, I thought the actors did their jobs well enough, but in scenes such as the one where a group of virtually nonplussed people are watching a man being torn apart limb from limb by a lion in the zoo - I thought to myself ""Are they zombies? I mean, seriously, no one puking or passing out or biting their fingers with pale faces and wide-eyed looks of horror?"" It was more like ""Oh no, tell me it isn't true!"" I'm just glad that the library paid for this one, because my dissatisfaction would have been nine dollars worse if I had gone to the theater. FYI, I still have faith in M. Night; I sure hope his next flick will be closer to The Sixth Sense on my list, and I can just forget that this one ever ""Happened""."
"KyleH87","7","4","8","4 November 2008"," It's Not Nearly as Bad as So Many Say It Is
","The Happening is a very pivotal film in M. Night's career. It has one of the most unique stories M. Night Shyamalan has ever presented. His other stories are very good as well, but most of them are based off of concepts we've seen in movies many times before, such as aliens or ghosts, yet are looked at from a slightly different point of view (i.e. Signs, The Sixth Sense). The Happening, on the other hand, is a concept I've never seen before in cinema. The entire movie has a very creepy feel to it, not in the sense of a horror movie, but in a completely different sense that I can't even describe.<br/><br/>I try to understand why so many people loathe The Happening, and overall I think the main reason is that it could have been better. I agree with that, but at the same time, I think many people blow the movie's flaws WAY out of proportion. The biggest flaw is Mark Wahlberg's corny acting. In most of the movies I've seen Wahlberg in, he's very convincing, however, in this film, he's not. There are parts that almost seem like he's purposely trying to overact, and it's frustrating, considering that he is the main character. Although at the same time, there are some very convincing performances delivered by John Leguizamo and the lady who plays the wife, which make up for Mark's poor performance for the most part. Another flaw is the mediocre dialogue, although it's not anywhere near the worst dialogue in a movie I've ever heard, as I have definitely heard much, much, much worse (every crappy horror movie ever made comes to mind).<br/><br/>If this film were directed by some new director nobody's ever heard of, then I really don't think it would have gotten nearly as many bad reviews as it did. However, considering that this is an M. Night Shyamalan picture, people were expecting a masterpiece. People are expecting an incline in the quality of M. Night's films, but instead, they're only seeing a decline. Storywise, I'd definitely say The Happening is an incline in Shyamalan's career, but when it comes to the dialogue and some of the acting, I would agree that it's a decline. The story, although great, is a bit of a challenging one that many people may be thrown off by, and this may be another reason why so many people have a hard time with this film. Keep in mind, however, those of you who haven't seen it yet, that the flaws of this film are really blown out of proportion by critics and are not as bad as they are made out to be."

","Spoilers! Before I even put the movie in the DVD player, I looked at my wife and said ""I hope it's not aliens"". Well it wasn't. And I somehow wished it was. The plants! Really? As soon as the plant theory started to surface, I started thinking ""I hope not, that's retarded"". But it was a M. Night movie so I was waiting for the twist to tell us what it really was. Unfortunately, it never happened.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the premise of the movie was a good one to start, but I would've preferred the ending stay a mystery with a lot of different theories.<br/><br/>And towards the end, the movie started to get really condescending. When I watch a movie, I don't want some director getting up on his soapbox and tell me what a terrible person I am or how screwed up the human race is for ""wrecking"" the planet. It just turned into a greeny, environmentalist propaganda piece and suffice it to say, I am telling everybody to skip this movie."
"tieman64","Null","4","8","3 September 2008"," Hitchcock meets Twilight Zone meets CIA casebook
","Baffling: across the east coast of the United States, large groups of people have mysteriously begun killing themselves. It is initially believed that a foreign ""terrorist group"" has released a chemical agent into the atmosphere, but as ""The Happening"" progresses it becomes apparent that the ""terrorist"" in question is really Mother Nature herself. Earth's trees and forests, we learn, have become sensitive to human activity, and so have now begun releasing ""suicide inducing toxins"" as a form of self defence. Large groups of people set off the attacks, and so humans must travel in small groups so as to avoid triggering nature's newly evolved defence mechanism.<br/><br/>Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""The Happening"" can be read through at least three prisms. On one hand it's part of a series of post 9/11 disaster movies (""War of the Worlds"", ""Mist"", ""Cloverfield""), but is atypical in the way its political allegory pushes further than its siblings. Whereas your typical post 9/11 monster movie watches as hapless whites are stomped on by faceless bogeymen - terrorists which these films always demonize - ""The Happening"" deals with what military tacticians typically call ""blow-back"" (violence directed at the civilian population of aggressor governments). Here, Americans are literally set upon by ""terrorist suicide bombers"" because they indiscriminately, and egotistically, ""trample on territory that does not belong to them"". Overlap Shyamalan's foliage with the West's recent Middle Eastern Crusades, and you have a clear message; the trees want payback.<br/><br/>Shunt aside power-politics and ""The Happening"" is also part of a recent chain of either environmentally conscious films or films which posit Nature as a cruel asphyxiator (""Wall-E"", ""Avatar"", ""AntiChrist"", ""The Happening"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"", ""Grizzly Man"", ""Into The Wild"", ""Deamland"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Happy Feet"" etc). While all these films mean well, it's disconcerting to see how quickly and efficiently our fears are transfered from one thing to another. From ""fascist"" Germans, to yellow invasions, to ""communist"" Russians, to Middle Eastern ""terrorists"" and now to the environment itself, an unseen enemy is always created to keep populaces in a state of fear. This fear is then used to enforce restrictions, unifying men by threatening their very survival. But now we have the perfect bogeyman, the perfect scapegoat, ubiquitous, perpetual and all-encompassing. Environmentalism is not just about hugging trees. It's a political project, a full-bodied ideology that presents itself in terms of progress and aspiration. But this ideology is built on the idea of a collective threat that makes ""security"" its basic principle, making ""the struggle for survival"" the central aim of our social and political life.<br/><br/>The outcomes of all this environmental fear mongering will probably reveal itself in a couple decades. While such lines of discussion encourage us to realise that there are always consequences to capitalist relations - the demands of capitalism being inherently unsustainable and downright apocalyptic - the real trend seems to be toward outright denial (we hurt the environment more, the MORE we're aware of our actions), toward darker, more insidious mechanisms of control, and toward a ""monetising"" of environmentalism; a shallow green capitalism, where green initiatives are used to squeeze but more profits, and where ""clean"" wind energy on one side of the world is powered by the toxic mining for magnetic metals in China. Build a wind turbine and you kill two hundred people and render a square mile toxic and uninhabitable for 20 years. But hey, you make a buck.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was one of the best recent alien invasion movies, if you can overlook its absolutely distasteful ""religious subplot"". Night's a die-hard Christian, and so it's also possible to view ""The Happening"" as another fundamentalist tract (sinners punished by a vengeful God/Nature?), though such a reading is so thin as to be pointless.<br/><br/>Beyond all this the film works well as an amalgamation of pulpy science fiction, ""Twilight Zone"" episodes and Alfred Hitchcock (specifically ""Birds"", ""Psycho"", ""Frenzy"" and ""Marnie""). Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan knows how to elevate pulp, how to imbue pulp with his own concerns (for better or for worse), and more importantly, how to toy with his audience with but the simplest of tools. And like Hitch, Shyamalan's shot selection is super fine-tuned, restrained and precise, every camera move, composition, angle, motion and sequence impeccably planned. Both directors also offer a masterclass in how to classically build thrills, and neither goes for elaborate special effects or fast cutting. Shyamalan's scores also often reference Bernard Herrmann, a composer oft associated with Hitch, and like the Master, has a penchant for on-screen, walk-on cameos.<br/><br/>8.5/10 - A nice throwback to 1950s science fiction. There's also something audacious about Shyamalan's insistence on making a film in which trees are the ""monsters"". It's a difficult premise to pull off. Worth two viewings."
"peepzcallmerob","3","4","8","1 September 2008"," Nothing happens in The Happening
","Yes. This movie is disturbing, but for all the wrong reasons. No. This movie is not good. I can almost see what probably went down when Mr. Shyamalan got the green light to make his first ever R-Rated film. It must've been on the lines of a child at a candy store, but instead of taking all the candy he could with his hands, he was finally given a bag. Now he could try some different candy, give his taste buds some variety, and even be bold by trying things no other kids would.<br/><br/>But there's a reason why no one else does what M. Night Shyamalan does, because it doesn't work. Ever since his stunning thriller, The Sixth Sense, his touch for directing and writing has been unraveling very quickly. The Happening is not scary, and it's almost painful to notice how hard Shyamalan is trying. What Hitchcock did with The Birds was something only a master could pull off. Shyamalan attempted to mimic Hitchcock's tension of the unpredictability of the nature of birds and the rest of the wild with images of the wind blowing against the trees and making the tall grass sway. Seriously? Are we supposed to be scared of wind? Because this was his first R-Rated film, Shyamalan constructed a series of very disturbing deaths, which I assume he spent almost all of his energy in. If he wanted to make these death scenes a memorable aspect of The Happening, then he succeeded. Did he purposely make the rest of the film suck to accomplish that? Who knows. But the truth is there are only a handful of bright moments throughout this extremely dull film.<br/><br/>One of the bright moments would be the occasional comical relief one-liners that brought out some laughter throughout the audience. But I would say that half of the time there was laughter, it was the result of horribly written dialog and completely ridiculous reactions between characters. That's an alarming sign for a bad film, when it's unintentionally hilarious. The only other bright moment I can dig up is John Leguizamo's performance. While the rest of the cast was forcing every line written in the script, Leguizamo was able to make his character jump off of the page and seem natural. Almost any film would be blessed to have the talents of Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel in their cast, but this film is a great example of how important the screenplay is. I cannot fault the actors with their choppy and two-dimensional performances, simply because of the horrendous script.<br/><br/>Overall, there will be a minority who will find the movie entertaining at best. Popular opinion will say The Happening is boring, stupid, and a waste of an hour and a half. And even though The Happening packs a very strong environmental message, Shyamalan seems to assume his audience is unable to detect the message unless he states exactly what he's trying to tell you. Isn't that a Screen writing 101 no-no? SHOW don't TELL. Well, Shyamalan might have to go back to class. How bad is it? Let's just say the racism message in Crash was less subtle than the environmental message in The Happening. But I guess Shyamalan didn't want to risk his message going over anyone's head. So the moral of the story is: If you mess with the environment, it will retaliate and kill you. Shyamalan tried to scare people to do the right thing. In my opinion, Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth is a lot scarier than The Happening."

It wasn't.<br/><br/>Other people have already pointed out the major flaws - the terrible script, the miscasting of Mark Wahlberg, the god awful acting at times, the overuse of the wind - and I wholeheartedly agree with all of the above. I just couldn't believe that the person responsible for films like The Sixth Sense could have got it so wrong.<br/><br/>If indeed this was supposed to be a B movie style film, that's all well & good - but that doesn't mean it can get away with absolutely anything. (I admit that comment is also aimed at Quentin Tarantino a little too, for Death Proof.) It's such a shame, because I really do like the idea, and some of the images in the film (like people walking off of the roof like some sort of human lemmings) were amazing & disturbing. I didn't even mind the somewhat heavy handed message, which I know riled some people. It was everything previously mentioned in between that was awful.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I watched a film that actually left me feeling angry, as it did my partner as well. After we finished watching this, we almost started an argument with each other, just to release the tension this drivel had caused. So there you go, not only is it bad, it can cast a cloud on your relationship too.

","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPLOILERS!<br/><br/>Just an awful movie. Honestly, I've seen better indie films than this. At least those had swearing and nudity. For M. Night's first R film, he went at it like a Christian who doesn't swear and working up the nerve to use them. With ONLY Shyamalan writing and directing, it almost was an indie film. SPOILER: Nothing bad at all was said until the last 20 minutes. For starters, it was a good idea,but he didn't go anywhere with it. The trees were being threatened by too many people together at once! KILLER BREEZE! The bushes are plotting against them! I was annoyed and amused by the sadly true social commentary that if anything happened that kills more than 15 people its terrorism. The plot had potential. But sadly, it seemed like he threw it together in a month. Probably the only scenes he had done before the beginning of June we're the clips from the trailer. The bee theory was randomly thrown in there just to add a few more minutes. I saw the story about the bees disappearing maybe two weeks before the movie was released. The guy talking to the plants in the nursery is acceptable, fine, people do that. But once they got to Wahlberg talking to a field and reasoning with a plastic plant, you begin to wonder if the movie was meant to be scary.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plain low-quality of almost the whole movie. The microphone came into view in 4 or 5 different scenes. then at the end with the french subtitles, they were a little too far down to read all of the bottom line. I don't know we just got a bad copy and it was on the projector wrong or if its like that nation-wide.The second time the microphone came into the shot i looked around to see if anyone else noticed it and some guys in front of me were pointing it out. Worse, you could see the sound guy jerk the thing from person to person depending on who was talking. SPOILER: In a later scene when a women stand up, i was watching the mic thinking, 'shes gonna hit her head'. Some guy behind me had the same idea and said ""bonk!"" After they figure out the trees are taking out larger groups and break up, you don't need a real great eye to notice the circular pattern in the field from the helicopter above them. When they start running, they yell to each other, and you can barely hear them because they had to mute out the helicopter 100ft above them. Then there's the inconsistency of the crazy old lady they find being alone and dying. Finally, at the end, the women sitting in the bathroom in silence was awkward and went on for too long. It would've been find had there been ANY TYPE of back ground music, but they didn't have it in the budget. <br/><br/>Now for the cast. That had to have been the easiest money Ashlyn Sanchez ever made. She had few lines and she either ran or was carried away. Mark Wahlberg is terrible in this movie. He's standing in the field for 3 minutes with the killer breeze coming at them, yelling for his girlfriend or wife or whoever she was t give him a minute to think. Meanwhile while thats going on, the twitchy little army guy is unloading like 13 bullets into his group. I know people are going to say ""he reloaded"". But if you can think of nothing else but killing your self, chances are you're not counting how much ammo is in your clip.<br/><br/>The only reason i gave it two stars is because its a great movie to go see a second time and do some Mystery Science Theater 3000 with.<br/><br/>True and honest, as soon as the movie ended, i called out ""that was a funny movie!"" There was a point when everyone laughed in the theater. The only disturbing part was when they drove the Jeep into the tree, because i know someone who died driving into a tree.<br/><br/>I have to end this by saying, boom operator Michael Scott, needs to be fired! and dock the rest of the sound department's salary. Also, do most movies have payroll accountant and assistant accountant in with the movie credits? I think they just need to make the credits longer."

"gishmayo88","2","4","8","22 June 2008"," Is this supposed to be a parody?
","I'm not a fan of M. Night Shyamalan but somehow I've seen most of his movies in the theater. Don't ask why. Frankly, I don't know myself. I can't say I like any of his movies (yes, even the Sixth Sense). But there's something about them that works on some level. Again, don't ask me on what level that is. I don't know. Maybe it's the tension or the editing. But I have a hunch that the reason I keep watching Shyamalan's movies is because the audacity of this man must be seen to believe.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things Shyamalan does well technically. Writing isn't one of them. It seems like in most of his movies the cinematography and camera direction are pretty good, but how can you even begin to discuss those aspects when the movie's structural flaws are so glaringly obvious? Any discussion of this movie must begin with the weaknesses of the script and the knee-slapping hilarity of the premise. Have you ever see that episode of South Park where the townspeople are running away from global warming, which is literally chasing them down the street? Well, imagine a serious version of that. And no, The Day After Tomorrow doesn't count as serious.<br/><br/>I think Shyamalan could quite possibly be the worst person in the world at writing exposition. Just count how many newsbeats are in this movie. Whenever something needs to be conveyed about the plot, Mark Wahlburg stumbles across a television or a radio. I had my head in my hands every time John Leguizamo mentioned a statistic or whenever Wahlburg spouted some half-baked analysis of the Airborne Toxic Event (to borrow a phrase from Don Delillo) that's supposed to pass for science-speak. The most cringe-inducing dialogue, however, occurs when Wahlburg talks to the trees. I'm pretty sure it happens a few times. He gets this ominous look in his eyes and starts thinking out loud. And if those are the thoughts he finds suitable enough to speak, then I don't want to hear the rest.<br/><br/>I definitely wouldn't want to recommend this title to anyone, but it really is so bad that it needs to be seen to believe. No one could ever do the badness of this film justice in a review. Every film student should see this movie. They should have classes on this movie so that aspiring filmmakers know what not to do. I never thought it was possible for a single movie to get so much wrong.<br/><br/>This one's a must-see for lovers of all things unintentionally bad."
"CheshireCatsGrin","2","4","8","22 June 2008"," More wooden than Pinocchio
","I have followed this film since the first copy of the script was leaked out on the internet. I had high hopes that once it went through a few rewrites it would actually be a good film. I had been disappointed by Lady in the Water and The Village, and wanted to see another quality movie by the man behind The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.<br/><br/>To say I was disappointed by The Happening is the understatement of the year. The original script was actually better than the film. It gives the term ""B-Movie"" a bad name.<br/><br/>The wooden acting destroyed this film. Wahlberg plays a high school teacher. His character is beyond wooden. He just recites his lines. I am surprised he took this role. He'll be lucky if it doesn't set his acting career behind eight years. Zooey Deschanel's Alma is not any better.<br/><br/>MNS is known to work his actors hard in rehearsals prior to filming. He wants to make sure they will give the presentation he wants to see on the screen. This leads me to believe the horrible acting was done on purpose. The poor execution of the script also led me to this conclusion."
"niquita_G","2","4","8","22 June 2008"," You can't always trust previews (possible spoilers)
","Watching the previews for ""The Happening"" made me excited for the chance to see it. It seemed to be a return to the glory of early Shyamalan films. I promise to get back to this point but first let me say I believe M. Night Shyamalan has inadvertently branded himself as a twist ending director. After Sixth Sense and Unbreakable it seemed that would be his legacy. Signs and The Village followed the same formula, but for many the endings could be seen long before the movie was over. The Happening lacked the twist ending which isn't inherently bad... but many of the people I was with even believed it lacked even a basic plot. I won't go that far, but there were quite a few things to be were of. For those who haven't seen it I won't go into details, but please if you're planning on taking kids or those who get squeamish urge them not to go. This is not a movie for the faint of heart. The newly re-introduced red R rating means business this time around. Its surprise scary moments come from bloody, grotesque imagery that feel forced when contrasted to the fluid creepiness I found in Shyamalan's early films. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschannel's dialog felt force and I think the best actors of this film was the wind. I understand Shyamalan's inspiration was to take a page from 50's B movies, but I fear he has fallen quite hard with this one. For me at least this movie made Hostel and Dawn of the Dead (04 version) appear tame. For those of you who like it I'm glad you came out liking it, but from now on I'm waiting for Shyamalan's movies to come to cable...I think it's the last time I'll ever put faith in a trailer. It's a hard lesson isn't it."

I immediately called my family and told them to never bother with this movie. Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your money. Not even on a 99 cent rental.

I'm not sure what he was thinking or if it was the crappy direction but his portrayal of a science teacher was absolutely ridiculous. He uses a wimpy voice and countenance which contradicts the hero, in charge attitude he tries to convey once ""The Happening"" happens. The dialog was tired and at times, just plain silly.

He has the capability to provoke your mind into thinking of supernatural and/or extraordinary possibilities for certain life occurrences. This film is about a possible consequence for human being's negative actions against the Earth.

","Brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan who had the inkling of an idea, pitched it to the studio then realised he had nothing else BUT that idea but made the film with no script, no plot and 1 idea which never turned into anything.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel & John Leguizamo are the stars here, but Leguizamo is killed very quickly once ""The Happening"" starts and is utterly pointless. He is only there to bring the young girl to the group, nothing more.<br/><br/>Alan Ruck also appears in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" role as the principal of the school were Wahlberg & Leguizamo work as teachers. Basically this is director Shyamalan's incredibly preachy message about how badly we're treating the planet & that we should do more to save plants.<br/><br/>It's that bad an idea that plants have identified humans as their biggest threat and are now emitting toxins that kill them or cause them to kill themselves. All it does it give them a reason to leave New York and get stuck in the countryside where Wahlberg thinks he's figured out what's causing the deaths. He also thinks its to do with the sizes of groups people are in.<br/><br/>Eventually the ""Happening"" or event as they refer to it on the news ends as suddenly as it started and we're left in the slightly emptier city where Deschanel is clearly pregnant with Wahlberg's baby and Leguizamo's daughter has been adopted by them both.<br/><br/>The film ends (if you can call it an ending) with the same thing happening somewhere in France. Awful film, really weak idea to base it on, it isn't explored enough or explained clearly enough and people are killed off way too easily. Avoid like it's trying to kill you!"

"JackyBryant","1","6","14","16 June 2008"," With such hype I expected disappointment, but not this much...
","Considering M Night's initial track record of favorable critical reception and consumer interest, expectations were considerably high for this film. His first two films, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, were refreshingly unique and were considered the start of a promising, and long, career in film creation, with some critics and industry notables dubbing him the next Hitchcock and even Spielberg. But now we can see with his diminishing box office success, and really rapidly declining favor with critics, beginning with Signs and gradually plummeting with The Village, Lady In The Water, and now this atrocity, that his comparison to those directors couldn't have been more far off.<br/><br/>The Happening is basically The Emperor's New Clothes of films. I honestly don't understand how anyone could have approved this script for a production when it is so poorly written. The critics who have come down on this movie have come down on it extremely harshly and deservedly as well.<br/><br/>This movie has so many shortcomings it's almost tough to list all of them: bad acting, plot-holes, defies laws of nature and physics, poor direction, anticlimactic, extremely preachy and obnoxiously politically loud, ultra-boring subplots, ridiculously clichÃ© and contrived characters, awful attempts at humor at several points, etc.<br/><br/>The only thing that was 'Happening' during the movie was many loud laughs and boos. During many of the scenes due to ridiculously poorly written dialog, people in the audience burst into laughter. I found it hard to laugh considering I was physically sick with disappointment. At the end of the film the entire theater erupted into boos sadly, and three people in front of me walked out about sixty-minutes into the film. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was in a group of several people.<br/><br/>M Night has lost it clearly, and he shown no signs of getting it back either. Sixth Sense, I always thought it was a ripoff of the book 'A Stir Of Echoes' (written in 1958, later made into a movie Stir of Echoes starring Kevin Bacon) by Richard Matheson (legendary writer responsible for I Am Legend novel amongst others). M Night was accused of plagiarizing elements of 'Lost Boys' by Orson Scott Card as well for parts of Sixth Sense. With yet another movie under his belt that has tanked enormously and been slagged by critics, a movie that is seemingly all his own production, writing, and directing, I unfortunately have to come to the conclusion that unless he's heavily plagiarizing superior writing, he's up the creek without a paddle as far as making a decent film goes."

I especially laughed/cringed at the scene where Wahlberg stops running across a field with a bunch of other ciphers and pleads ""Just give me a minute to think!"" over and over, until he finally thinks that maybe they can outrun the killer wind...then of course, they wait for the wind to start blowing across the field before they start running.<br/><br/>And yes, that's essentially the fearsome element of this movie: wind.

There were some really cool parts, but then there was some parts that i had to scratch my head. Overall i am glad that i saw this film, but i just feel that this move could have been better."

","This is as good as anything I've seen from MNS, and better than several of his films. I'd compare it to ""Signs"" in many ways. It has a mysterious atmosphere throughout and presents a subtle yet powerful concept of nature vs. Man.<br/><br/>I watched it despite all the drones who panned it (including IMDb's editorializing with the ""comedy"" category). Some say the first half is good, then claim it deteriorated toward the end, but that makes no sense to me after seeing the whole thing. It has his typical dreamlike quality which somewhat intensifies, but it never seems cheesy, etc.<br/><br/>Are the masses unsatisfied unless they absolutely know the enemy? My theory on the negative reviews is the psychology of refusing to be objective once a negative idea is planted, and/or anti-environmental mindsets that pervade America.

Hopefully he will have shaken off his creative ghosts and gotten over his over-inflated ego before his next project debuts.<br/><br/>I agree with the other reviews insofar as this film was badly mis-cast. Wahlberg and Deschanel looked terribly uncomfortable in their roles. They seemed to struggle to really develop their characters. As others have pointed out they seem to have forced their performances the same way Shyamalan forced the tension in an attempt to get some sort of audience reaction. The story's mis-timed suspense and the forced performances by the cast created an out-of-synch nightmare.<br/><br/>With all due respect to the cast, they seemed to have been left out of Shyamalan's inner intent and seemed to struggle with filling in the gaps left by the story's shortcomings.<br/><br/>An event of catastrophic proportions was ""happening"" all around the characters but they didn't seem to react appropriately. Shyamalan should have reviewed footage of 9/11, terrorist attacks in Israel and other ""happenings"" around the globe and applied those human reactions to his characters and not create some caricature of human nature."

Humans have been systematically destroying the planet and the planet is fighting back. Why should the characters know all the answers? We expect our protagonists to be smooth and know everything and to save the day. Why do we not accept that the characters are flawed and human and do not know all the answers? The cinematography, the soundtrack, and the editing all help to escalate the sense of panic in the story, which is what makes a good story.

"littlewitch_jr","10","5","11","20 July 2008"," The MOST unique and diverse film I've ever seen. I love it!
","This was the MOST unique movie I've ever seen. Seriously. <br/><br/>I loved this movie (though I may be a little biased as I love Mark Wahlberg as an actor). But I do honestly think it was a fantastic movie. For me my heart was pounding, I was a little tense and I definitely was eye caught and concerned for the characters on-screen.<br/><br/>And the movie is not just HORROR, we're involved in all different genres in one film. Which makes it a diverse movie with not an overload of screaming and blood. It was such an odd atmosphere to be part of really. The movie gets pushed down so much yet I think the movie deserves more credit than what it receives - people just seem to not like DIFFERENT and NEW things (due to the fact it's not an adaption or remake).<br/><br/>I think anyone who really delves into it will enjoy it more and EVERYONE will have different points on it. It's just full of things that are there for the individual mind to figure. When I got to the end I found myself questions/wondering about certain things and I began to realise that there are so many deep things written inside this story.<br/><br/>Acting: I thought the acting was really good as opposed to those saying it was worst they've ever seen. Best acting especially done by Mark due to the fact he is in about 90% of the movie (near the end was a very strong bit) PLUS just because they are not hysterical or witty doesn't mean they are bad or because it doesn't have all these catchy lines, sex scenes, extreme visual effects, blood gore blood gore!<br/><br/>Scene with Elliott talking to the plant: Elliott talking to a plant is not stupid or crazy... You know plants/trees/ all of nature are living things. Therefore talking to it is not stupid. You do talk to your dog sometimes don't you? you can not understand the dog but you still do it because it's alive and you care about it. Even I would do it - If I felt that it was the trees making these things happen and I was alone for a moment seeing the plant.. I possibly may feel the need to at least try to communicate with it. We only know two ways to communicate.. through speech and action (movements). He did both. <br/><br/>Now to the SCARY: Visually, it's disturbing when you see the suicides. They are just...teeth gritting and stomach wrenching - the quickest way out is not the least ugliest. <br/><br/>The movie made an excellent performance in making an audience (me) feel scared or feel at least worried. And yet there is no zombies or certain evil creature running around killing everyone. In fact it's only trees, breeze and rustling noises. And that seems difficult to pull off but M.Night (I'm not a fan of M.Night but I do love this movie!) and his cast/crew did it perfectly!. So we can not literally see our killer because it's in fact ourselves physically. And to top it off it's even more scary to think WE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THE FORCE behind it. QUOTE in movie by Elliott (Mark Wahlberg) ""We'll fail to acknowledge that there's forces that work beyond our understanding"" < for me this is what the movie revolves around. The realism of the event may be a scare factor too.<br/><br/>So.. Obviously I love the movie. I'd recommend it for mature and open minded people who are not expecting too much. Though, I did expect it to be really good considering Mark Wahlberg and the idea of him widening his range (he's become so diverse) but I didn't let myself run away with it before I saw the movie - because high-expectations can be the death of most movies.<br/><br/>10/10 from me. Next up - MAX PAYNE!"
"theskulI42","3","5","11","8 July 2008"," Shockingly inept in every facet
","The Happening (2008, M. Night Shyamalan) It's been long-established that my experience is limited to one film pertaining to possibly the most infamous director of our generation, M. Night Shyamalan. He's a director that seems to inspire hyperbolic opinions in both directions, with The Sixth Sense being the only film of his that a solid majority of people seem to agree is any good (it's also the only film I've seen). But no one can decide 'masterpiece or 'disaster' for Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water...okay, maybe not Lady in the Water. Well, his newest film, The Happening, is another one to argue about.<br/><br/>The film, like all of Shyamalan's films, has an intriguing premise. For this one, it involves a mysterious airborne toxin of some sort that is making people kill themselves. The plot line follows a small group of people including a science teacher (Mark Wahlberg), his underdeveloped wife (Zooey Deschanel), his coworker, a math teacher (John Leguizamo), and a plant dude with a beard (An Actor Dude with a Beard).<br/><br/>Shyamalan's direction and editing is almost hysterically stiff. He seems to have absolutely no idea how to frame a shot, and he seems to cut to reaction shots at the most bizarre times, resulting in a visual style and rhythm so awkward that it literally elicited derisive laughter from me on several occasions. The acting is as poor as the direction, as the entire principal cast delivers their lines with such unsureness that they come off as thought this is the first time they've read the script (which is horrible anyway), with Mark Wahlberg giving one of the worst performances I've ever seen in the history of cinema. Outside of Boogie Nights, I've never been too impressed with Wahlberg as an actor, and I thought he was easily the worst part of The Departed (despite his baffling Oscar nomination), and here he gives as cringe-worthy a performance as you're ever likely to see. The rest of the cast from the usually marvelous Zooey Deschanal, to the usually solid John Leguizamo to literally every single minor character in the entire film.<br/><br/>The film does contain some interestingly-structured death scenes, including some nifty shots (the early shot with the construction workers plummeting on the building comes to mind) early on to set up the ""terrorism"", but even these are poorly-done, as his framing is amusingly prudish and stagey (the cop and cabbie shooting themselves in the head early on being the most egregious offender, as they brace themselves as they fall to the ground despite supposedly being dead, and of course the camera is within inches of them, making it all so upfront). Also, since these scenes only last half a minute or so, he supplants this hole with intolerable relationship trauma, as our main characters fill lots of screen time just bickering at each other, and by the time the woman in the Jeep with Leguizamo began screaming, the film turned from silly to obnoxious, and as we waste more time going over the same bullsh-t over and over, it went from obnoxious to interminable, and by the time they're getting threatened by crazy old ladies, it's just run off the rails and embedded itself in the ground.<br/><br/>Basically, it's like Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, except that all the actors suck, the director sucks, the movie sucks and instead of reanimated corpses that crave flesh, it's...plants. The film is so silly, so amusingly inept that it vaults itself over true intolerable badness like Diary of the Dead and Prom Night, and triumphs over In the Name of the King to win the Unintentional Comedy sweepstakes.<br/><br/>{Grade: 3.5/10 (D+/D) / #46 (of 53) of 2008}"

","If you happen to be a fan of Fox's Family Guy, you may have seen the episode where they make fun of Stephen King's later works. The scene depicts Stephen King sitting with his agent/editor. Stephen says: ""and now for my 300th novel, a couple are attacked by a..."" he looks around the room frantically and picks up the desk lamp... ""a giant uh... lamp monster... Ooooooo!"".<br/><br/>The editor replies ""you're not even trying anymore are you?"" then he sighs and says ""okay, when can I have it?"" <br/><br/>""The Happening"" made me think that a scene similar to this must have played out between M Night and his production companies. This movie is to Shyamalan what Star Wars Episode 1 was to George Lucas - a sincere disappointment.<br/><br/>It was such a shocking departure from his usually tight scripts, tense direction, and haunting atmosphere. It was a clunky, awkward movie - brimming with bad exposition dialog, confused character motivation, blatant plot holes, and seemingly first-take acting. On leaving the cinema, my wife and I commented that it seemed more like a first-draft screenplay than a polished, finished version... like something that was hacked out overnight to meet a deadline.<br/><br/>There are a few interesting concepts, and a couple of touching scenes, and as usual in Shyamalan's works, the music was haunting. But for the most part it was simply awful. Up until now I was a big fan of Unbreakable, Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Lady in the Water. I even thought everyone's favorite M. Night movie to hate - the Village - was okay. But ""The Happening"" is truly best avoided. A crying shame."
"digilucy","3","5","11","19 June 2008"," Even with a student discount I felt done...
","I was originally drawn to this movie because of the concept of a toxin that distorted the chemicals in the brain leading to suicide, as told by a friend of mine.<br/><br/>Now I'll admit the concept remains fantastic, however, all factors excluding the concept were quite awful.<br/><br/>To start with the script was dreadful. Inappropriate and uninspiring, it was highly unbelievable. More so however, was the way that even the best lines were delivered awkwardly. Why they chose Mark Wahlberg as lead is beyond me, I'm afraid. Several badly delivered lines/moments saw chuckles and cringes from fellow cinema goers, not least while a mass suicide provoked the hilarious drawn out moment of ""Just give me a second to think! Why won't you just give me a second to think?!""<br/><br/>The attempts at humour were at best uncalled for and at worst distracting and perplexing. For example, proving your sanity by singing outside someone's ranch would tempt me to reach for my shotgunÂ…(if I were American that is; us Brits have nothing more than a bread knife and scone to attack one serenading outside our place of residence.)<br/><br/>The relationships were never fully explained or elaborated on save for an irrelevant mood ring being a symbol of a hazy and obscure relationship between the protagonist and his complex wife.<br/><br/>I can't believe a personal favourite actor of mine John Leguizamo was involved in this cinematic tragedy. All the way through I just kept thinking ""If Cronenberg had done this it would have been amazing!""<br/><br/>If you still insist on paying to view this film I will say that some of the imagery was superb, the first scene was great and the soundtrack was fantastic.<br/><br/>For me, I'm afraid, I wish this film was not Happening. If I were you I'd save myself for a re-make 10 years down the line when someone actually says ""That film in 2008 had a really good concept, we should make it, only without it being rubbish!"""
"sjsully","1","5","11","18 June 2008"," One of the biggest bombs I have ever seen!
","Okay, so I am giving this a 1. It was absolutely horrendous. Would I recommend this movie to people? Absolutely. Why? Because it was probably the most entertaining bomb-of-a-movie I've ever seen. Trust me, you will laugh-out-loud. <br/><br/>It was so bad that I am still waiting for Mark Wahlberg and M. Night Shamalyan to say, ""just joking, guys!"" But no. I've seen interviews with both the actor and director - on separate occasions, and it turns out that what the movie was marketed as and from what these two discuss in interviews, we can gather that ""The Happening"" was and is an earnest attempt at making a thriller. Both Wahlberg and Shamalyan talk about the premise and the seriousness of the story, and so on. But I kid you not, a thriller is not what you get. It's a comedy because we recognize how earnest this attempt was at making a thriller. And our realization of this while watching the absurd film makes it all the more entertaining and funny. Oh I definitely smell Razzies.<br/><br/>The premise isn't even that bad, I have to say. Plants/nature turning on humans because of our destruction/lack-of-respect, etc. But the delivery... oh my! The acting is something to behold. It will have you believing that these actors may have in fact been lobotomized or invaded by kindergarten students during the filming. Particularly Mark Wahlberg. Okay, now some people might say that he is supposed to be a an innocent/naive-type character. Umm, no. His delivery of lines is on par with Keanu Reeves on a bad day. Is this the same actor that did 'The Departed'? Might not be Mark Wahlberg's fault. Perhaps it was the writing, directing, or editing: which, when combined, leaves the audience on several occasions in absolute hysterics. And I'm specifically talking about the parts that were supposed to be scary or suspenseful. So what gives? My guess is that M. Night lost his mojo a bit. He couldn't step up to the plate or knock down a three when called upon. If he was trying to make a comedy, however, I give him full credit. My uncontrollable laughter throughout was worth the full price of admission.<br/><br/>Now, I have to say that I've been a fan of M Night Shamalyan for quite a while now. Obviously the ""Sixth Sense"" was genius. By industry standards M. Night was pulling off an Orson Welles for the most part when he brought it out. By word-of-mouth, that movie made a mint. And for good reason. It featured multi-layered writing and flawless directing and people took notice. Then he followed it up with ""Unbreakable"", an even better film in my opinion. Sheer genius actually. His take on the ""superhero/comic-book"" genre was of the highest quality; it was original, sharp, and he got the best out of his actors. The problem is, his writing and directing at times is so ridiculously good that you think he can do no wrong. ""Signs"" was a bit of a letdown. I felt he was relying on the special effects and the alien a bit too much in the third act. ""The Village"" was unbelievably good. He took a slice of the time (post 9/11 world) and created an allegory of American society. I know I'm in the minority here with regard to that movie, but I felt he nailed it. So he is highly gifted in his craft, no doubt. Again it's the expectations. This happens with all great directors. ""Lady in the Water"" was an embarrassment to say the least. I don't know what happened there, it was just plain boring and nothing seemed to happen. The editing, the acting, the writing, all bad. Was he, perhaps, a bit too self-involved? I think so. Now we get ""The Happening"", which is the strangest movie of the bunch because it doesn't know what it is or what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? What is it? <br/><br/>Do watch the movie, though. I am telling you, it is the best ""worse"" movie you will ever see. Heck, I may give it a 10 after my next viewing. If I can just figure out what the hell I watched."

","After watching The Happening, I was completely shocked at how awful this movie was. For one thing, the acting in this movie was pathetic and even more horrible was the actual writing and dialogue performed by the actors.Scenes in the movie were acted so poorly that at times when your supposed to be upset or scared, I just laughed because it was over the top awful. Normally in a M. Night film, if there is something to say negative about it, it is normally not the writing, but in this movie he completely botched that up. On top of all that, the movie doesn't delve into what the inhalant is. They say indirectly that the plants and trees are the cause, but they could've gone deeper. For example, if you have been in contact with the inhalant, can it be cured with a vaccine, or if someone tied you up for example, could you stay for an extended period of time being contaminated. The ending leaves you with almost nothing to answer these questions. Normally, you would like to see a cure for it, or at least a attempt at one. At the end of the day, I would save your money and see something else, or take ten dollars and flush it down the toilet."

","Dear M. Night Shyamalan: On June 16, 2008, I had the opportunity to see your latest theatrical release: The Happening. In the past, I have seen all of your major theatrical releases including The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, and Lady in Water and therefore feel that it is my duty to convey some critique prior to discussing The Happening.<br/><br/>In 1999, I had the utmost pleasure in watching The Sixth Sense. In the months that followed, my friends, family and colleagues were overjoyed that a new voice had entered Hollywood. Your voice was creative, imaginative, and original which, at the time, seemed like a tall order. Looking at the onslaught of unoriginal garbage, remakes, and sequels Hollywood continues to produce (Two Hulk movies in 5 years c'mon), you were going to provide a fresh and unique voice. Following The Sixth Sense, your new fan base, including me, eagerly awaited your subsequent films. As noted, The Sixth Sense was good, Unbreakable worked, and Signs was suspenseful until the last twenty minutes. Then something happened. The Village was questionable and substandard and Lady in Water was unwatchable. Therefore, I questioned your talent. Then you wrote, directed, and produced The Happening.<br/><br/>After two box office failures (The Village and Lady in Water), the M. Night Shyamalan franchise needed a resurgence, a project to raise it from the depths of obscurity. The Happening, your first R-rated film, was your attempt and it failed miserably. First off, at no point was there any chemistry between Zooey Deschanel and Mark Wahlberg. At first, it seemed intentional considering their strained marriage, but never could the audience feel any connection. Second, when making an R-rated movie, cursing is permitted especially when it is a common term. The use of ""bumbletown"" rather than ""bumblef*ck"" is completely ridiculous. Third, the plot, characters, and dialogue felt like a late night movie on Cinemax. Who wrote this?...Must of been one of your two young daughters. Finally, with your career in the balance, you bank on global warming and murderous vegetation. Really??? All in all, Al Gore couldn't even sit through this film.<br/><br/>So, on June 16, 2008, I wasted 89 minutes of my life because of your clear lack of understanding what audiences want in a movie or because you would rather pad your pocket than produce quality work. The Sixth Sense seems now a lucky stab, a one in a million. Therefore, I request that you enclose $31 for my friends and I who attended The Happening. We believe this is only fair because you received $62 from our viewings of The Village and Lady in Water. If you are a dignified person, you will send the money."

This background idea is the only good thing of THE HAPPENING. All the rest is just pathetic. The film is too slow paced, and almost nothing really happens, as it is totally non-suspenseful and really boring. And what about the sub-plot concerning to the main characters' affections?

If that was the idea, your writing didn't demonstrate that.<br/><br/>What I got from what you were writing was, at best, sophomoric and, at worst, silly: something in the plants is carried by the wind and it freezes people and forces them to KILL THEMSELVES?! That's up there with the horror radio play about the mysterious fog that turns people inside out--and that was intentionally funny.<br/><br/>Your writing also has some degree of sloppiness. The worst line in the movie was about how Julian's wife was going to ""a town called Princeton"" as though nobody in the Metro Philly area or beyond has ever heard of Princeton before. A small line, but sloppy, nonetheless.<br/><br/>If you want to bring ideas that what you characterize as ""spiritual and. . .emotional perspective"" into movies that have a mass-market appeal, which is how the studios are selling your movies, you need to write--or have someone else write--these ideas better so that they are better understood by a mass-market audience.

It turns out the R-rating is well-deserved.<br/><br/>This movie has two major flaws: <br/><br/>1. It's unnecessarily gruesome. Very little was left to the imagination.<br/><br/>2. It's pedestrian. There were no surprises. About two-thirds of the way through the picture, the viewer can put two and two together. It's a see-through plot if there ever was one.

Doing some research I find a articule that says that the movie was made this way on purpose by the director. But even knowing that, this movie is just bad. Ignoring the performances that obviously they were supposed to act like that. The story, the development of that story, the script. The happening is just bad. And not that kind of bad like The room that has a lot of personality, no,it is just a bad movie without personality."

"matty_mushroom1983","9","2","3","21 November 2015"," Nearly everybody who watched this had misunderstood it's genius.
","I swear this movie is a satire on Stephen king, purely in the aspects of acting and direction. If you've watched enough Stephen King, you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>As for the story and plot, a more serious note is taken.<br/><br/>See, to most people, The Happening made no sense. ""Oh plants killing people, right, sure""<br/><br/>But it actually makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>If you don't get what I'm saying, I urge you to watch it again with this in mind: Plants are living organisms. Organisms have two instincts; survival and reproduction.<br/><br/>In order for these first two instincts to succeed, it requires a third instinct: defense.<br/><br/>Still confused?<br/><br/>Let me answer a few common questions. ""Why so sudden?"" Well it's not sudden. A plant has few forms of defense, and one is to release toxins. Collective flora is damaged and seeks out the cause. It releases toxins to battle the cause, and every time a toxin doesn't work, it's mutates the toxin hoping to find the right compound before it's too late. The toxin helped against pollution, but not enough. The toxin didn't work on material man made objects like the concrete of the power plant (the vision of which was a glaringly obvious clue) so the flora tries again, until it has found one that causes allergies. This isn't enough, and further toxins cannot defeat the human immune system. Eventually after 100,009years of humanity, flora formulates a toxin that works, and releases this toxin in areas where human activity is high enough for the plant to recognise the energy (hence the man talking calmly to his plants).<br/><br/>You do the rest"
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","3","2","3","8 March 2015"," An example of ineptitude creating comedy in every minute of its running time.
","A film with a chilling concept that was ineptly handled â€“ Hostel. The idea of getting lost in some city â€“ a place which is so texturally rich like a big dark fantasia, which a film like Don't Look Now (1973) understood â€“ and succumbing to its vices and being subjected to a vast network of sadists which prey on tourists and offer these victims to a higher bidder is fascinating; it exploits our ignorance of these foreign countries and obliviousness when stepping into them, that feeling of being seduced by a great landscape and not knowing what waits behind that. In this film, you have a concept that is perhaps mildly intriguing? Something, somewhere, somehow, is driving people to suicide. Now, the fact that when these people are caught in this trap and mindlessly work to kill themselves they are benevolent, not trying to harm other people is different. Usually in these apocalyptic scenarios you have a direct threat which is visibly coming at you that you can defend yourself against, in the absence of that maybe people are more likely to turn against each other, the panic never abated by any comfort in the knowledge that you know what wants you dead? People, their human drama, their interpersonal relationships, their motives, their conflicts, their being interesting humans pitted against things, whatever that may be, this is what anchors any concept. And it's completely lacking here. Mark Wahlberg can be a wonderful actor, when the film understands who is he and what he is capable of. He's an actor that exists within such a limited spectrum, that he's basically always Mark Wahlberg, but a director can take that and deconstruct the character of Mark Wahlberg, and put him in a narrative that challenges him. Paul Thomas Anderson understood this, and with Dirk Diggler gave us a truly memorable character. Are we supposed to believe that Wahlberg is a science teacher?<br/><br/>This problem, of confused characters that are like children in a school stage play, extends to pretty much the whole main cast. Zip Zip Zooey Deschanel, is the biggest supplier of comedy, or excruciating agony, depending on one's perspective. Why did she do the things she did, and say the things she said? She is the biggest chasm in the film, which creates the divide between comedy and sincerity, because we generally never know which mode the film is operating in. As far as I can recall, Zip Zip Zooey's character is introduced with that wonderfully-naÃ¯ve-for-a-5-year-old line about 'all that evil being invented in the world' or something. I'm trying to understand the logical though process behind this dialogue. So that is clearly supposed to be dark bell hearkening man's evils, but it's hilarious. Comedy that is supposedly intentional, like the scene in which Wahlberg talks to a plant, is entirely misplaced because at that point it disrupts the (non-existent) atmosphere at point where countless characters have died and the ones who are left should be at the peak of human exhaustion. <br/><br/>I don't think anybody was particularly motivated when doing this, and if they were they're great at concealing it. In fact Shyamalan seems to be the one who has the most half-hearted convictionÂ…because he wants to chastise us about our negligence toward nature? The film's explanation is that the plants are releasing toxins as some sort of defence mechanism against humans, and the more humans who are grouped together in any one place, the more toxins is released? A student filmmaker could have employed this with more subtlety, and in fact Shyamalan has some pretty cheap tactics, including multiple lingering shots on the branches of trees, swaying in the wind (what if they're sentient, eh?), blatant juxtaposition in the form of a greenhouse in the foreground and big looming nuclear power plant in the background, and a scientist appearing on TV right at the end just to reiterate everything that we had figured in the first 20 minutes. This film was released in 2008. I get that global warming (and our general destructive tendencies toward nature) has been a pertinent issue for a long time, but as a hot news topic, it passed in 2006 with an Inconvenient Truth. What is Shyamalan telling us we don't already know? If I want to be chastised by a director, I'll put on a Michael Haneke film. So what you have is this narrative about plants retaliating against us, but nothing is explored beyond that very premise. In one of the opening scenes, in which Mr Jock is doing science stuff in class, he basically explains away the mysteries of nature as just that, something beyond our understanding. And in the great climax of the film, all the science-y stuff that was established is undone in one stupid act of sentimentality in the cheap guise of a Spielbergian triumph of human will and love. <br/><br/>There were some mildly interesting character elements scratching under the surface. Both Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo are teachers who only seem to be able to process the world through their chosen subject. Mark is constantly approaching everything through his scienc-y stuff, and in one situation he tries to (desperately) make scientific calculations in order to figure at how to proceed, as an entire group of people are killing themselves. Leguizamo is a Maths teacher, and can only effectively deal with something when talking about Math(s), as when he tries to calm a person down by giving them a maths problem. So what you could have had here is two dysfunctional guys whose severe problem is that they retreat into their profession in order to effectively cope with whatever is happening, because it's all they know. Instead you have to men who throw elementary bullshit at you, because that's smart right? And if they're smart, that means they're sympathetic, right?"
"Cedric_Catsuits","Null","2","3","23 July 2011"," Hilarious
","If unintentional humour and bemused actors are your thing, then don't miss this one. Clearly not a comedy, but it's impossible to take seriously. Wahlberg and Deschanel play their part by maintaining straight faces in the most absurd situations, as the best roles were reserved for the grass and the trees.<br/><br/>One can only assume everyone involved in this thought it was just too high brow for them, and rather than admit they didn't understand, decided to play along. If you've watched Punked or Candid Camera, you'll be familiar with the puzzled expressions. <br/><br/>It is an awful film and deserves the 1 rating, but it's in the ""so bad it's good"" category - so pour yourself a pinch of salt, stick your tongue in your cheek, and sit back and enjoy."
"AvinashPatalay","Null","2","3","9 March 2011"," The weakest link
","My hunch is that ""The Happening"" will go down in the history as the worst of Shyamalan's outings (unless ""The Sixth Sense"" director decides to pull-a-rabbit-out-of-the-hat). Notably ""The Happening"" also marks the UTV's (a big production house from India) foray into the big-bad-world of Hollywood. I would be surprised if they are not left with a feeling that closely resembles a con-game. <br/><br/>For starters the apocalyptic premise is so lame that it barely manages to hold attention. The writing and screenplay will have to shoulder the blame. On that note, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should only hold the directorial reigns and relinquish his writing skills to the worthy. The direction has its set of crests and troughs (the latter rule the roost actually). More time should have been devoted to explain the concept on which the entire premise suspends on. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, an accomplished actor in his own right is completely miscast. Russel Crowe/ Bruce Willis would have been a better choice. <br/><br/>John Leguizamo does puts up an honest performance (though had shades of Paul Giamatti). <br/><br/>""The Happening"" is extremely graphic, perhaps the first from the director. Background music is engaging. <br/><br/>Verdict: Don't watch even if its free to air on telly unless you revere Mr. Shyamlan as your personal Jesus Christ or live in misnomer that he is the next best thing that has happened to Hollywood since Spielberg."

Maybe that was the issue and he just wanted to get out of the nightmare as quickly as possible. I watched this movie with that in mind and STILL sat there with my jaw dropped at just how bad it came out.<br/><br/>Sorry M. Night fans, but you have to admit, this is just bad bad bad.

"ricsim78","2","2","3","3 July 2009"," Great idea for a movie poorly realized and acted even worse!
","I must say I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. M. Night Shyamalan made me a fan back when I first watched ""The Sixth Sense"" (one of my favorite movies of all time, and one of my favorite movies about ghosts), ""Unbreakable"" was a unique and awesome movie, and I enjoyed ""Signs"".<br/><br/>Then he made a stinker called, ""The Village"". Another unique idea, decently acted but it just did not have the same impact as his previous films. Afterwords he nearly loses me as a fan altogether with, ""Lady In the Water."" (One of the biggest problems is that he decided to write himself into the movie and basically ends up being the savior. That is a bit vain!) Well acted, interesting characters, but poorly executed. If his films were a roller coaster, it would be one that started at the top and now is at the very bottom.<br/><br/>So finally, his chance at redemption comes to theaters, and his first R-rated film to boot. The Happening is finally happening! The first half hour is the movie is good, and interesting.<br/><br/>Then, like his movie quality, it all goes downhill from there! The acting? Unbelievably bad! Mark Wahlberg, whom I have always liked, is definitely miscast and his acting is painful to watch. Then you have Zooey Deschanel who is basically just there to look gorgeous and smile a lot. You never get the sense that she is actually in danger, and she is another person I am a fan of that just seems like she is out of her game and just along for the ride. John Leguizamo (think they decided to cast everyone who has names that are hard to say or pronounce) is the only exception, he plays a slightly different role than usual and does a decent job. Not that he did an exceptional job, but decent enough and would have been fine had everyone else been up to par! Not sure who is at fault, but I have seen all 3 do much better jobs elsewhere. <br/><br/>The extras? No better but some of them show up the higher profile actors. This hurts everything in the movie and takes away from the movie. You are so stunned by the acting quality it is hard to pay attention to much else, besides except Zooey Deschanel (looks, not acting!)<br/><br/>Besides the acting, how about the movie? Unique idea, poorly realized and the script is an abomination. <br/><br/>Not sure what his next film will be like, but yeah this one was maybe the most disappointing of all of his movies. I still have hopes he can bring us at least something as good as ""Signs"" and maybe to the level of ""Unbreakable"" but I think a ""Sixth Sense"" level is out of his reach anymore.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 is all I can give this, as there are worse movies that came out, but not much worse!"

","SIGH. I held my faith in M. Night Shyamalan for as long as I could but I give up. It's been like a downhill slide all the way. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies; Unbreakable was intelligent; I still think Signs is cool; I even thought The Village was okay. Then came the WTF movie Lady in the Water. I didn't watch it because it didn't sound interesting to me, but everyone going ""wtf"" didn't exactly help persuade me otherwise.<br/><br/>And now, The Happening. This was supposed to be Shyamalan returning to form with a cool sci-fi thriller premise, but geez, it falls flat in so many ways that this might as well have been a Sci-fi channel original movie with generic director, screenwriter, and actors.<br/><br/>Omg, how miscast is this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays earnest so painfully that he comes across as a douche, all wide-eyed and speaking deliberately in a ""hear how earnest I am"" voice. Zooey Deschanel, in all her sprightliness, comes across more like Wahlberg's daughter than his wife. And John Leguizamo as a math nerd? Well actually he was good enough to pull it off, but the character and all his math-spouting just got annoying.<br/><br/>Like The Village, this movie starts off more intriguing than how it ends. Why were people killing themselves? And the frozen people? Quite classic. Then the reveal. Oh, it's... plants. I can buy the explanation, actually, even if it sounds like Al Gore produced the movie, but it just didn't make for a very good movie. I mean, the characters were just running from the wind. Not gusty tornado-type winds or anything, but just everyday wind-blowing-through-the-trees wind. I just couldn't feel the menace from the shots of trees. And geez, you'd think these people had never heard of SARS and how everyone took to wearing masks for fear of contracting something airborne. For fuck's sake, they don't even have the sense to hold their breath to go from one house to another.<br/><br/>SIGH. What a waste. There were moments of cool, like the various ways in which people killed themselves and Betty Buckley's insane but irrelevant old recluse, but the lameness is just overwhelming and unredeemable."

"rotf_ny","6","8","21","11 June 2008"," Far from terrible
","Caught the New York premier last night. One of Night's (who struck me as rather humble) first comments was that it's a B film. And so it is, with some truly scary moments and some ridiculous, campy ones as well. There some definite holes, truncated arcs, unlikely character interactions and unexplored conflict but overall it's a fun picture that keeps moving quickly (for the most part). Calls for the end of Night's career are premature. This picture is not meant to be at the same level as Sixth Sense or Unbreakable; it is a different type of film. Whining that it's not ""as good"" as The Sixth Sense et al is missing the point.<br/><br/>We begin with the good citizens of New York City mysteriously offing themselves, and there is speculation of a terrorist attack (isn't everything due to those guys now?). The deaths are pretty gruesome and there are some great tense moments early on. When the news reaches Philly they decide to close the schools and everyone bails out of town. Science teacher Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) meets up with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and friend Julian (John Leguizamo) plus Julian's young daughter. They embark by train, which soon has to stop in podunk when all communications are lost. Continuing by car and on foot trying to stay one step ahead of the phenomenon, various bit players die as they go. The teenagers getting bucked down is a rough moment.<br/><br/>JL's stint is cut short when he leaves the group to try and find his wife, hitching a ride in to the affected area. I would have liked to see him live a bit longer; as such his purpose seems reduced to dumping his kid on Alma and reigniting a fight between Alma & Elliot.<br/><br/>The film stock is changed during certain scenes to remind us of cheesy thrillers of the 70s I suppose, such as the lawnmower bit. The hara kiri by lion is good for a laugh also. As a bonus you get to watch this scene on the new iPhone in a commercial, I mean product placement.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is very good and has some funny parts as well such as when he tries to make nice with a plastic plant.<br/><br/>Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones provides a fantastic, freaky turn as a reclusive widow but exits with a whimper. Her death should have endangered the lives of Elliot & crew but instead Night was content to slit her throat on a windowpane. Still creepy tho.<br/><br/>The 'love conquers all' scene where Elliot and Alma brave the toxic air to declare their affections up close defies logic. But maybe that's the point, love defies logic. Additional relationship tension would have helped this scene.<br/><br/>Night is not subtle here, the environmental message is right in your face. At one point a sign for a new home development reads ""YOU DESERVE THIS!"" - I got a chuckle out of it anyway.<br/><br/>The overall suspense level could have been better maintained by delaying the revelation that plants are responsible for the airborne toxin. The tension in Elliot and Alma's relationship was handled with kid gloves and therefore a missed opportunity to add some drama.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat ambiguous which I liked. I suspect it won't play well with American audiences however. The middle of this country likes its' gun totin' justice to be served. For a film with modest aims it's fine, just don't go expecting Citizen Kane. Enjoy it for what it is."

They have only some theories that made by them in order to run and hide and since scientists don't know have any answers or explanations about this force they will follow their instincts.<br/><br/>I have to admit that since I had already watched the movie ""Bird Box"" and a lot of people compared these two movies I had high expectations from this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this movie because it didn't have an interesting plot or as some other people mentioned it didn't have a plot at all. I didn't like the direction which was made by M. Night Shyamalan and because in my opinion he didn't succeed in making this movie interesting and make the audience feel the terror of his cast or make them feel that they were a part of this movie too. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I expected more from Mark Wahlberg who played as Elliot Moore the high school teacher and from Zooey Deschanel who played as Alma Moore his wife.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""The Happening"" isn't a good movie, it has a lot of plot holes that aren't covered which is combined with a very poor direction and has as a result, an average movie.

","The Happening is a more intelligent movie than it seems. The internet has made this movie into a collective punchline since its premiere in 2008, and deservedly. The tone is incoherent, the acting is numb, the dialog is a complete joke, etc. But, perhaps there is something more about this movie?.<br/><br/>(Spoilers)<br/><br/>The main theme in this movie is ""the unknowable"", and the hubris of thinking you know, when you really don't. The ""plant toxin"" idea is initially pitched by a weird random guy, but it's the only explanation Elliot has, so he keeps acting on it, just because he wants to know what is really happening, so he can save himself and his group. In the end, he fails miserably, almost all the people with him ends up dead, and he makes a fool of himself by talking to a plastic plant. The guy is a science teacher, and in the beginning of the movie, he says:<br/><br/>""Science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but in the end it'll be just a theory. I mean, we will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature.""<br/><br/>This is the theme of the movie, and it's a fair point. Some things just can't be explained, M. Night thinks, and, if he wants to make a movie about that, good. In that way, it is a companion piece to ""Signs"". However, this concept is awfully executed. I think the main flaw is that it tried to be at the same time satire and horror, and that put the tone of the movie all over the place, becoming a ridiculous mess, which invites laughter at the movie, rather than reflection on the nature of the unknownable.<br/><br/>This movie is kind of a modern Zardoz: a satire lost in ridicule. Although this movie is far less enjoyable because, at least, Zardoz went all the way in its satire and is much bolder in its performance. The Happening is just fun for the memes and the ridicule associated with it, but aside from that it's just a tedious mess.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Something strange is happening in the city of New York; suddenly people I Central Park started acting strangely then a woman suddenly kills herself with a large hairpin. It isn't long before people across the city are killing themselves; workers jump from a tall building, a policeman shoots himself then others pick up his sidearm and do the same. It is assumed that it must be some strange terrorist attack and an evacuation is ordered. The film follows three people caught up in the event; science teacher Elliot Moore, his wife Alma and Jess, the young daughter of one of Elliot's friends. They manage to get a train heading to Philadelphia but it stops in a small town when what happened in New York starts happening in Philadelphia. Soon reports come suggesting that there have been outbreaks of suicides in smaller and smaller communities. Somebody suggests that far from being a terrorist attack it is actually caused by a chemical being deliberately released by plants!<br/><br/>The opening scenes of this film led me to believe that perhaps the negative reports I'd heard were a little unfair; the outbreak of mass suicide was a little disturbing and very bizarre unfortunately what followed didn't live up to this opening. It felt like M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make a film like 'The Birds' with trees as the threat unfortunately rustling trees aren't as scary as the sight of large birds attacking people. Some of the later suicides were more comic than disturbing; a woman shows everybody a video clip her mother forwarded depicting a man feeding himself to the lions in a zoo; after they rip off one arm he offers them the other I was half expecting him to carry on like the Black Knight in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'! Later another man lies down in front of his lawnmower. Stars Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel do a decent enough job but they have both been better in other films. The ending is fairly sudden and a bit of a let-down. Overall I'd say this isn't a terrible film but one can't help feeling it could have been so much better; it is worth watching once if only for the unintended laughs."
"view_and_review","4","1","1","5 June 2014"," A Very Dry Movie
","M. Night Shayamalan is losing his touch. He burst on the scene with The Sixth Sense and had a couple of more hits in Unbreakable and Signs. I even liked The Village contrary to many. Then came Lady in the Water and this. Forgive me if my time line is off or I skipped a movie, but these are the movies of his that I saw.<br/><br/>The Happening is about some mysterious phenomenon that is occurring nationwide and it is causing people to kill themselves. The movie focuses on Elliott Moore, played by Mark Walberg. The movie was just dry and poorly executed. Not a single actor gave a good effort; I'd even say that Shaymalan mailed it in as well.<br/><br/>The movie was very slow and uneventful with the exception of some disturbing suicides. There was just random movement and useless banter all sandwiched in between some odd deaths. This movie either shows Shayamalan's incredible arrogance or his demise."

","THE HAPPENING (2008) *1/2 Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, Betty Buckley, Alan Ruck. M.Night Shymalan's shameless attempt to conjur the ghosts of Rod Serling by way of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" only proves that the once promising filmmaker is running on vapors in this ridiculous sci-fi What-IF Doomsday Thriller when an inexplicable event occurs causing people to kill themselves for no unknown reason and incorporating the usual conspiracy theories and outlandish scientific 'reasonings' that simply wind up as a lead balloon of a movie that is truly disappointing on all counts: wooden acting, stilted dialogue (the likes of which had me rolling my eyes it was so poorly done!) and some truly unintentional laugh-out loud moments of WTF?!

","I just got back from a prescreen of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't that great. The movie had the potential to be great, but the movie failed to deliver. The idea that the toxins that the plants gave off was original, however, the characters and their emotions were not believable to say the least.<br/><br/>Nothing was really ""happening"" in this movie. The reason why people are killing themselves is revealed way too early. After this, the movie really does go downhill. Especially after the halfway point when they arrive on a farm.<br/><br/>All this movie is, is a poor attempt at a thriller movie. There is some blood and the idea that people that become infected commit suicide gains the movie the ""R"" rating. Other then that, I don't see why it wouldn't have been PG-13.<br/><br/>If you're that interested in the movie, go see it. Chances are you will be disappointed. My advice is to just wait until the movie comes out on DVD and rent it."

","Happening, The (2008) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Shyamalan's latest has people on the East Coast killing themselves for no apparent reason. No one knows why the suicides are taking place but rumor has it that the only way to remain safe is trying to reach a safe zone further out west. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel play a couple trying to figure out what to do. This certainly isn't a major film or a good one for that matter but I think it's a minor comeback for the director after the horrid The Village and Lady in the Water. I'm not going to ruin what is causing the ""happening"" but I'm sure some are going to be left with a major disappointment but I didn't mind it too bad. I liked the way the director handled the last days of man theory and for the most part I think he has made a quiet little film that is probably going to draw a lot of heat because it isn't loud and explosive and it doesn't contain anything large. This comes off like an old ""B"" movie from the 1950's that warns people about their actions and what could come if they don't take advice from those who know about the subject matter. With the secret of the film, it never really causes too much panic with the viewer, which I think is the film's major problem. With the last days of man theory the viewer needs to be on the edge of their seat throughout the entire film and that doesn't really happen. The suicide scenes early on are quite disturbing but they never really draw you into the film as much as they need to. Another problem with the film is the performance by Deschanel, which is downright horrible. At times I just had to laugh at some of her actions and sadly she's in the film all the time. Wahlberg comes off fairly good, although it's hard believing him in the role of a science teacher. John Leguizama has a small role as well but doesn't add too much to the film. In the end, I doubt very many are going to enjoy this film and I'm sure I'll be in the minority. It's not a great movie and it's not a good one but it is mildly entertaining and the director's handling of the material is interesting."

","I've seen a lot of films in my time. I thought i had seen the worst films to be seen in appalling titles such as ""transporter 2"", ""Epic movie"" and ""Alone in the dark"". But now to my surprise comes a film so bad that i really cant understand how it made it into main stream cinemas.<br/><br/>I'll begin with the only spark your going to see in the film, and that is the first 10 - 15 minutes. These are quite promising and actually lead you into believing that your about to sit through 1 HOUR 31 MINUTES of mediocrity. A genuinely bridging on intriguing introduction without going into detail (and ""wrecking"" it for you ahahahah (seriously don't watch this movie)) . However you are quickly reassured that no, in fact not even the most open minded fan will be able to really BS their way through a high rating of this ""film"" (and if they can they are incredibly creative). <br/><br/>Then comes the fall... There's to many ""flaws"" (for want of a better word) in ""The Happening"" to really go through, so i will list just a few of the worse ones and hope it keeps you stray of this atrocity. The script is TERRIBLE, i really do believe it had lines like ""say the word ""what's happening is it the trees!"" repeat at least every 5 minutes""(spoiler so sorry!). following on from that the film try's to add in other factors of horror completely unrelated to the film that do not work at all so laughable that it makes it hard to believe it wasn't made by students that had never seen a film before and trying to work out what it was (example after seeing literally 100's of people dying he gets really upset after 1 more dies that he met 5 seconds before and completely unemotional again after he views about 10 people die. Though this falls really into the actors abilities... which leads nicely onto to the lack of them. Zooey Deschanel is absolutely terrible in this film. At first i though it was just a character trait that she had been set to but no after having to watch more than 20 minutes of her staring at the camera as if shes a toddler thats had a toy taken away you just want her to go the way of everyone else in the film. She drags down the rest of the actors as well and by the half way point even Mark Wahlberg seems to think ""hes been paid to BE in the film why bother acting in it"". <br/><br/>This film is diabolically, mind numbingly bad. Featuring scenes like running away from the wind (which is apparently now controlled by plants?!?!) to really bad film work that was designed so that even the brain dead would get fed up of all the unnecessary explanations and lead ups (e.g.. (spoiler) the news-report: ""if only this incident had happened somewhere else in the world maybe we would believe it"" then the next scene is exactly that, and there are countless times this happens thought the dreadful 91 minutes).<br/><br/>So very very bad, you almost want to get the effect featured in the film just so the pain will not be prolonged further. Please don't watch this film. (sorry about all the spoilers.)"

","The Happening sucks. It sucks HUUUGE sweaty balls. It's without a doubt the worst movie of the year, and possibly of the decade. It was unintentionally hilarious in it's poorly scripted, ham-acted idiocy. Do not pay money for this unless you enjoy mocking horrible films in a public arena.<br/><br/>This is up there with The Wicker Man remake in terms of complete and utter dross. At least 5 times throughout the film I turned to the person next to me and simply asked ""What. The. Hell?"" Case in point (yes, SPOILERS); In one scene, Marky Mark and Zooey and a bunch of people, say around 50, have wandered off into a field trying to escape the thing which is threatening them. They decide to split up into groups of 20 and 30 (with our main characters in the smaller group). The groups can no longer see each other, but aren't very far apart. Suddenly, the threat thing attacks the larger group, causing a solider within the group to use his gun on himself. The other members of that group slowly take turns in using the gun to kill themselves. Marky Mark's smaller group can hear the gunshots, and realize what is happening. Marky Mark says, in the breathy and high-pitched voice that he uses throughout the entire f***ing movie: ""Oh. Noooo."" He actually says, after hearing gunshots and assuming the worst ""Oh. Noooo."" It's impossibly to fully relay the stupid delivery, but just trust me. The film is full of strange moments of dialog that cause you to cringe and rhetorically ask ""What the hell?"" The premise is cool, but the explanation is ridiculous. As most of us in the blogosphere should know, this film's script is the result of a rewrite of an earlier one, titled ""The Green Effect"" that was unanimously rejected by every studio in the business. If you're interested, and you don't mind spoilers, google ""The Green Effect"" and see how much more ludicrous M. Night originally intended this to be.<br/><br/>The dialog was, quite simply, totally unrealistic and ridiculous. Combine that with the acting which, despite the fans' protestions, was not 'stylised', and you get a s***-lined t***-coat of a movie (The acting was poor. I don't care if the director told them to act that way, it doesn't change the fact that it was poor). If it was a stylistic choice, it was the wrong choice.<br/><br/>People are now saying that Night intended it to be a B-Movie. It fails at that too (if you want to see a good, big budget B-Movie, see Planet Terror)."

","Can this really be the work of such an accomplished director who gave us such acclaimed works as 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'? 'The Village' is wrongly considered by many critics as Shyamalan's weakest film, but this takes weak to a whole new level: The plot (I use the term loosely) depicts a teacher and his girlfriend's fight for survival against a natural epidemic that forces people to kill themselves. The entire North East of America is infected for a day, and then... it ends. <br/><br/>What is even worse than the lacklustre plot is the acting - this is the first film i've seen in a long time when I literally burst out laughing during, what I believe was supposed to be a really intense scene due to horrendously bad acting. The leading man (I forget his name and, to be honest never want to hear it again) has a hard time figuring out if his character is there to increase drama or create comic relief. This obviously stems from the script which lead me to believe that Shyamalan had no idea if he wanted to make a comedy or a horror. If he was aiming for a mixture of the two it certainly isn't working - the humour is very out of place. <br/><br/>I went into the cinema expecting a GREAT movie - what else would I expect from one of my favourite directors - but I came out having seen, what I can only fairly describe this film as a stupid movie. <br/><br/>This mess is a complete contrast of everything that Shyamalan stands for. It beheld nothing that distinctly says 'Shyamalan' to me - the atmosphere of 'The Village' was sorely missing from this picture. <br/><br/>My best advice to M. Night Shyamalan is to burn this film and forget it ever happened - the latter I will certainly be doing."

Different theaters do vary on how long you have to request a refund so you would be wise to ask how long you have to make a decision when buying a ticket.

It's a question of where it ranks on the list of worst films ever made. Gory but not scary, slow but devoid of character development . . . Mark Wahlberg is DREADFUL in this film, and he has proved himself a more than capable actor in the past. I couldn't even find any enjoyment in watching the adorable Zooey Deschanel.

Seriously, I'd rather watch a marathon of ""Armageddon"", ""Batman & Robin"", ""The Avengers"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" back to back than sit through ten minutes of this again. Trust me: even you Shyamalan defenders aren't likely to enjoy this one. There's no touching human element like in ""Signs"" (or like some of you found in ""The Village""). It's just pointlessly, gory, dreary tedium. If you want to see an infinitely superior film with a similar premise, check out Frank Darabont's ""The Mist."" Better on every possible level. Shyamalan wants to be seen as a modern Hitchock, but this time, he comes closer to Ed Wood.

","Where to start. I was really looking forward to this movie, and am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. the first 5 minutes of the movie is good, but it goes down hill from there and does not stop going down hill until the ending credits. I mean this is one of those movies that I wanted to pull my hair out because it is so frustratingly bad.<br/><br/>The story is there is something in the air that is causing people to stop in their tracks and kill themselves. OK sounds like a good story, but it is not. The leads flee Philly in a train station that has no sign of panic because it is only happening in NYC at this point. The train stops in some rural town and the crew only tells Wahlberg that they have lost contact with everyone. Everybody then goes to the diner and they have the greatest day of business ever until the TV tells everyone that it is spreading to small towns and that it is clear about 90 miles west of where they are at. Everybody scrambles, but in one of the numerous flaws people drive off in both directions instead of all just going west. A jeep the seats 5, uncomfortably I must add, waits for a stranger (one of the leads) to drive into the heart of the infestation. How stupid is that? And on top of that they wait about 5 minutes for a complete stranger while he gives his goodbyes and then gives him the front seat in a jeep while the people that all know each other are cramped in the back. Unreal.<br/><br/>The other 2 leads head off with some plant guy that wastes 3 minutes of our time talking about hot dogs and such. He also says that it might be the plants doing this. So they all take off and confront a 4 way stop in the road where from each direction cars are coming and where behind them there is death. The group grows and someone is on the phone with a girl from the town where the other idiot went to in the jeep and they are all dead. This is where you see some of the worst extra work ever seen on film. I mean it is bad and MW takes over the phone in order to let everyone hear the girl killing herself. Brilliant. So before the girl on the phone kills herself he tells her to stay away from the window by the tree because remember it is the plants doing this. She doesn't and dies. MW goes off upset about this right in the middle of a bunch of weeds and plants on the side of the road. Genius.<br/><br/>OK I am getting tired, but this is how bad this movie. This group of people decide that the bigger the population the more chance of being infected. The decide to head to walk to a town with a small population, but the population of that town is bigger than them just standing there, and oh ya they have to walk through the fields to get there and all there are all plants in the fields. Do you see how bad this is? The bigger group kills themselves and so MW says they need to be in even smaller groups, but decides to keep 2 kids that they don't know to stay with them even though 3 is less than 5. the only reason these kids are with them is so they can get shot later in the movie.<br/><br/>That is when I walked out, but had to go back because I was told it gets worse on my way out. The last thing that I will say is when MW and ZD are split up at the end and he says he wants to be with her if they are going to die and he is coming to her. So he goes outside and instead of running to her he walks slowly. What a dumb A**. Then after all of it is over and they go to 3 months later and it is the first day of school. Now I remember after 9-11 it took a week for airports to reopen. For this event there would have to have been about 50 million dead and within 3 months everything is back to normal. Also ZD is looking at her pregnancy test while there are 3 house plants on the shelf behind her and outside the street is still lined with trees, meanwhile on the TV the plants are being blamed for the event that they are getting us back. I would have the scorched earth on those trees. Thanks for listening and this movie is not even good for a laugh."

","Is it just me or do the trailers for MNS's movies advertise them as something they're not. The village comes to mind as well as the happening. Correct me if Im wrong but on one of the trailers for the Happening isn't there a ghost floating towards the camera? I feel ripped off, I went to the village expecting one thing and got another. I liked the village but felt betrayed by the way it was advertised. This movie disturbs me in the same manner. Anyone with any taste for movies cant even give this show an average rating. What was good about it, the idea, maybe. The acting was poor, chemistry was absent between the main characters and specific ""Happenings"" in the movie just didn't make sense. It started off OK but fell quickly and hard. This movie will make millions and that really saddens me. I wasn't expecting a movie worthy of an Oscar but I was expecting to be entertained. One movie that comes to mind was Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. Definitely not Oscar worthy but at least it was entertaining. This movie will make me think twice before spending my money before reading reviews. I will now download MNS's movies as they are not worth my hard earned money."
"russo-simpson","1","5","12","14 June 2008"," Not worth viewing at all
","After watching the previews of this movie I built up a lot of expectation on it. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. The acting is awful in a way that when it's supposed to be funny no-one laughs and when it is supposed to be serious it's funny. On the end of the movie the whole crowd in the theater started talking to each other and nobody cared to shush. I wasn't scared at all, in fact I couldn't care less if the characters would die or not. Through the whole movie I was expecting some kind of twist in the end to make it less stupid, but it didn't ever come. The worst of all is the try-to-be scientific explanations for the plot. The movie tries really hard to convince us that this could happen. If you can find in your mind a way to believe that vegetables could in no time get intelligent, communicate with each other and systematically kill human beings based on the size of their group, I guess you would love this movie. Otherwise it's just annoying to see the director trying all the time to convince you with nonsense scientific evidence."
"koriandr_star","1","5","12","14 June 2008"," What happens is it fails
","This was the first time I ever walked out during a movie, I was literally disgusted with the script, the characters and the plot. Its hard to believe the characters are so shallow, so uninteresting. It's even hard to believe that Mark Wahlberg was once nominated for an Oscar. I don't think actors just turn bad which is why again this failure of a film rests on M. Night Shyamalan (MNS) Apparently I was told that Mark's character was imitating childish behaviour. Untrue, everyone in the film has half panics to something that should terrify them, his teaching as a tutor is laughable. I have met some pretty weak willed people but even they know when to put their foot down or speak of said jargon in a downsized and professional manner. And that's just him, don't get me started on the military guy or his wife and that dam caller subplot.<br/><br/>It was interesting till people suddenly stood still, walking backwards and then committing suicide, it was actually funny in the unintentional sense. I don't laugh during suicide but when you see one person drop and someone is in despair only to see another and another, I just end up laughing and had a image of someone singing its raining men. For some reason MNS feels its best to show a guy who activated a lawn mower and let it run him down. Apparently I'm meant to be horrified but that's the failure of these deaths. They lack the horror of it as so many of these people are doing it with great self awareness, of their own accord rather then forced.<br/><br/>It all looked too self controlled. Fine if they shut down having a seizure or a fit (as the infection messes with the chemicals in the brain) then that's different because as soon as people start showing a tendency to walk back and speak gibberish means you immediately made them retarded into doing anything practical.<br/><br/>Or for that matter let's see people actually panicking, actually challenging the rail officers who do not know about the other train stations. They make us assume everyone is dead but how do they know if they can't get in contact in the first place? We don't see them making any efforts into contacts, not even informing the passengers. A builder saw his mates die, a woman saw her friend and everyone kill themselves yet aren't affected, so why leave the city? Or what about when our heroes escape in the countryside, on every other road, everyone is dead but not the road they are on? Plants and trees are everywhere, yes all green inflicts a nasty chemical that kills everyone but them as it comes in small waves. Would you believe it, this tutor who deals with students and stress uses MATHS to calm someone who just saw a mass suicide by hanging? Yes MATHS. For crying out he's a tutor dealing with kids, give him some social skills! In that time we have the wife of mark's character being upset and for no real reason, none at all but hides away some caller (if this was MNS trying to be clever in his cameo then it wasn't, though I walked out later on so I will never know) the reason for the secrecy? Its a very trivial one I can assure you.<br/><br/>One of the worst examples of continuity in the film was when our hero and his followers decide to split up and run in the direction of the wind to avoid the lethal touch. (It seemed odd that in a countryside that it would come from ONE direction and that this was the same attack that didn't kill everyone who first witnessed it.) Anyway from that attack, we never see the people who followed him and instead we get two overweight teens following them nor does anyone care. (You knew by gut instinct they were going to be killed off) then followed by some idiotic dialogue in a house and mark's character tries to make a laugh of drama in talking to a tree that was plastic that was just bad, bad enough to make me walk out.<br/><br/>I couldn't stand it, this was one of the worst films I've seen, even worse than ultraviolet because films like them always had some cgi here and there and some action. This was terrible because MNS ruins his own work by sloppy directing, storytelling and a really stupid sub plot regarding a cell phone that I knew from my gut feelings was him being a caller. Half of the dialogue consisted of a draft version of a wiki understanding of science and with no good references or able to break down the jargon to an audience who weren't fluent with biology.<br/><br/>I have a simpler proposal, why not simply make plant life give out C02, a reversal of nature's cycle. Not some chemical compound that was deliver via telepathy or whatever. I think more would have come out if the idea was a simpler and perhaps more disturbing one such as the decreasing supply of oxygen and rise of C02. Which is the flaw of the story, the idea stems from a unrealistic source, the characters in turn are poorly drawn out to react, the sense of danger, threat of the unknown, what it was we provoked was never felt because each scene was self defeating, nobody reacted as if in danger, nobody tried or even cared to understand or react to this except just follow the science guy.<br/><br/>To those who believe this film was good, that's your view but don't think those who don't like it are those who know nothing of cinema. When I got back I watched an older but more superior film of suspense by Hitchcock called Rebecca. If you truly have seen a 'intelligent' film then you'll know that this one falls short."
"jasonpb","1","5","12","14 June 2008"," Shyamalan's Worst to Date
","The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable. Signs. Writer/Director/Producer M. Night Shyamalan has created some remarkable, original, and enjoyable films. Then there are the more recent ones. The Village. Lady in the Water. And worst of all, The Happening.<br/><br/>I will first admit that I was quite looking forward to this film, I thought from the previews that it could be Shyamalan's return to originality, quality screen writing, and inherent understanding that a shocking conclusion does not necessarily make a film great. The Happening, however, is far and away his worst effort, and easily the worst film I've seen in the last five years (although admittedly I do try to avoid those that have no chance of being good). The film actually gets off to a decent start, when people in Central Park begin to die mysteriously. The intrigue created by the first scenes lasts only momentarily, however.<br/><br/>I would typically begin a review with a few positive words about a film before ranting about its negative elements. This film, however, lacks any redeeming qualities. The dialogue is as bad as it could possibly be. Cheesy lines, unrealistic arguments, and pointless conversations quickly erode any interest in the larger plot. The dialogue gets worse, not better, as the movie progresses. One particular scene, involving an argument between the two main characters, is particularly painful to watch. One doesn't know whether to laugh, cry, or get up and leave the theater at such moments. The director never comes close to achieving his desired emotional reactions from viewers. A general moaning and groaning could be distinctly heard at such moments from the crowd at our local theater. Never mind the plot, which is far-fetched, under-explained, and generally nonsensical. The dialogue and acting alone kills this movie quicker than you can say ""Marky Mark, what were you thinking?"" A writer/director must implore the reader to CARE about at least some of the characters in a film, allowing the viewing audience to relate to them in some sense, otherwise, the entire plot appears nothing more than a joke.<br/><br/>While on the topic of jokes, my colleague and I assume that this entire film IS in fact a joke, a setup by Shyamalan to see how much money he can make writing, directing, and producing a worthless film with no redeeming value. My advice? Do not contribute to his funds. I feel as though someone ripped my wallet from my hand, extracted $7.50, and threw it back in my face, only this process somehow took an hour and a half to complete. Talented directors like Shyamalan should be forced to produce something of value once in awhile. For this director, it has been years. And the trend, unfortunately, is headed in the wrong direction."
"larryfire","1","5","12","14 June 2008"," My Review of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening""
","In M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" or ""The Crappening"" as I now like to call it, there's something in the air that causes people to stop whatever they're doing, slide into a trance and commit horrible suicides.<br/><br/>I would have liked to breath some of that air too so that I would not have to endure this terrible movie! Perhaps next time, M. Knight, the cinema's P.T. Barnum can provide me with his home address so that I can just mail him the $20 that I inevitably pay each year to see his increasingly worsening pictures. Then I can spend a couple of hours doing something productive instead of staring at a movie screen in utter dismay. It's just that Shyamalan initially grabbed me with the unique story telling of ""The Sixth Sense"" and because of that, I am always hopeful that he will deliver again. So each year I eagerly watch his next offering with expectancy but in this casedisappointment! M. Night Shyamalan has had a rough streak with his past few movies ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"". I suggest M. Night relinquish some of his roles as director, writer, actor and producer and bring in some different perspectives.<br/><br/>In ""The Happening"", Mark Wahlberg plays a soft spoken high school science teacher who evacuates Philadelphia along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his fellow teacher ( John Leguizamo) and his friend's daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) due to an unexplained (actually, never explained) environmental occurrence. The bad guy in this movie is the rustling wind so the major special effect required 3 house fans.<br/><br/>If you are expecting M. Nights trademark twist, forget it. In fact forget characterization, plot, motivation and resolution. What you do get is flat deadpan acting, unrealistic dialogue, plodding pace and silly but violent on screen deaths.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" was pitched as a suspenseful thriller but it lacked both of those key elements. I urge you not to be fooled as I was, save your money and enjoy the June sunshine.<br/><br/>Larry Fire The Fire Wire Blog"

","I really don't understand how everyone thinks this movie is so awful...I thought the story was beyond original. MNS is one who is known for taking risks. I think he definitely did, and whether or not it's believable...it's something creative...something to think about. Movies are about getting your mind active, and taking a look at the impossible, or maybe not so impossible. I think he did just that.<br/><br/>Here in Canada this movie was not rated R, although I wish it was. It tends to weed out the annoying girlish squeals, and the pre-pubescent laughter as they pretend they're not scared or disturbed. I thought it should have been rated R. I found some of the imagery very disturbing, there is one part that really defined the horror of this ""epidemic."" A group of unaffected civilians are driving when they see a bunch of gardening equipment on the side of the road, then rows of ladders...the next thing you see is numerous bodies, hanging from the trees. Screams filled the theater, and though people may deny later, these were genuine screams of horror.<br/><br/>I do think some of the dialog could have been better, and I could have done without the mood ring. I think some of the acting was pretty bad, but overall this movie was a hit for me. Hopefully if you're reading this, and expecting to go to this movie and see Bruce Willis, and that creepy kid and hear ""I see dead people""....Spare everyone, and don't go! However, if you have an open mind, and understand that MNS tries to make Original movie ideas...then go, and enjoy."

","Wow. That was my response when this movie was over. The only thing that I could think of was thank God I did not pay to see this movie. To be completely honest, this is the worst movie that I have seen in a very long time. I enjoyed the remake of The Fog more than I enjoyed this film. The script was poorly written. There was humor in parts that were meant to be serious. At certain parts I found myself laughing at how bad Marky Marks acting was. In all honesty it was pathetic. The plot was never resolved, the premise of the entire movie was stupid. The ending came with not one once of resolution. The trees and plants are attacking...Oh No. If you are going to make a movie about nature fighting back against us, there are many more things that have to do with nature other than plants and trees. Please if you have any desire to see this film, don't do it just spare yourself the money and time. I really hope that M. Night does not make another film because Lady in the Water and The Happening were lower then trash. It was TERRIBLE!

"beckwith10","8","5","12","13 June 2008"," Inventive Horror Film of Conceptual Originality and Strange Rhythms
","There's something terrifically off-beat about Shyamalan's ""The Happening,"" and perhaps the strangeness comes from the fact that its a horror flick made with a uniquely personal sense, a quality not found in the vast majority of assembly line horror pumped out of the studios into multi-plexes. No doubt this will displease some (or even many) conditioned by the crude, generic shocks found in standard-issue horror releases that strictly operate by the dopiest of numbers. That won't be found here. Indeed, there's something a good deal more delicate and thoughtful at the core of ""The Happening,"" and those inclined to mull it over a bit will it find it rewarding. While the critical response, for the most part, has been negative, the real horror is the discovery of just how many film-illiterate critics are out there writing. Not one has recognized the film's unusual hybrid cinematic pedigree, most significantly Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" and Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" of which ""The Happening"" is, in fact, a conceptual re-thinking of. I'm also very taken with the strange, irregular rhythms of the characters' dialogue and the timing of scenes - again, Shyamalan is clearly contesting the slick, overly-programmed artifice of horror genre films, though that's not to say the film doesn't deliver some good thrills - it does. So, bottom line, Shyamalan's films may not be doing as wellin box office terms, but he himself is developing into an interesting film maker with a point of view. I hope he continues in his maverick mode because God knows we seem to be doing everything we can to stamp that out in the US films. Hopefull, ""The Happening"" will be regarded with much more respect in the future. It is a worthwhile, original film - a rare thing in horror - and should be seen."

","I normally never comment on movies for the sheer fact that I never really have ten lines worth of information to provide. Generally, I either like a movie or I thing it's just okay. I -really- disliked The Happening; let me tell you why.<br/><br/>Above and beyond all else, I would love to know what happened to the acting in this film. I pretty much enjoy any movie starring Mark Wahlberg. This role was a step backwards for him. His acting was flat and the character he portrayed was absurd. I couldn't ""believe"" that Elliot was a real person. For that matter, I couldn't ""believe"" Alma was either. There was such a huge lack of emotion for both of these roles by both of the actors that portrayed the leads. That was the movie's first downfall.<br/><br/>The second was the story line. I see -where- he was trying to go, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad idea. It was just horribly executed. I'll say no more than that so I don't accidentally ruin it for those of you that still want to see it.<br/><br/>I guess that's really all I found lacking in this film, but without strong characters and a good story line, what's the point? I'd steer clear of this movie and wait for the DVD rental if you -have- to see it."

","I've got some very, very bad news for PETA and other vegans and veggies... Apparently, plants can communicate with one another, think, and even plan out highly-organized attacks in which humans commit mass-suicides. What does this harbor for the future? It means that from now on PETArds will have to abandon flora as their only source of nourishment (and what a shame it would be to not have all those noble vegan minds survive!). After we've all learned in recent decades that animals have souls and legal rights, that dolphins can calculate complex mathematical equations, that cow milk has clandestine poisons, that bunnies are in fact deeply philosophical beings, and last but not least that fish are ""kittens of the sea"" - now it turns out that mere plants are the Lucrecia Borgias of the forests. First they were carnivores, then vegetarians, and then the uniquely astute vegans: the logical next step for Petards would be to become ""airians"": perhaps we can convince the world's most brilliant scientific minds to work on finding ways to feed the rising numbers of Petards with... air...? Throw some ketchup on it - and voilÃ ! L'oxygene de la yummy-yummy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, air can only serve as food until we find out that oxygen, too, has a soul and an intelligence, hence has the right to live undisturbed and unkilled. After this happens (and no doubt it will be Hollywood or Moby the DJ to be the first to sell this marvelous idea to us) they'll have to find not only alternative ways to feed themselves but to breathe as well! Perhaps carbon dioxide? Sure, it's poisonous, but it might not have a soul. It ain't easy being a PETArd...<br/><br/>""Signs"" was pathetic and ""The Village"" was drawn out and filled with a truly horrible cast, so I really didn't expect much from the latest MNC offering. The downward quality curve in Mr.Charlatan's career is as plain and obvious as Madonna's tooth-gap. And, as if wanting to emulate that in his movies as well, ""The Happening"" is pretty much the same: it starts off very well, but gets worse and worse, heading shamelessly into a conclusion so predictable, that even fans of Latin soapers would sniff it out from afar.<br/><br/>Tuh-duh: it's nature fighting back against man! Man: that wicked, wicked Industrialist, that bipedal Capitalist creature that actually dares exploit the resources of this planet to stay alive. We've already had this kind of nonsense in movies before (hence the silly premise isn't even original) such as in ""The Last Winter""; but at least the said movie was very well-acted and had top-notch photography and good dialogue. ""The Happening"", on the other hand, is directed with the vigour of a nursing-home nap, and written with the ingeniousness of a glue-sniffing 6th-grader. The dialogue and the acting were always dangerously teetering on the edge of unintentional comedy, but it's small wonder when you have Marky Mark cast in the leading role as a CARING SCIENCE teacher. The less said about the minute - and endlessly irrelevant - subplot concerning his apathetic wife cheating on him, the better. And I will also try not to mention that when the train stops at a remote Pennsylvanian village, everyone suddenly has cars to hop into when panic breaks out... I guess perhaps cars might be conscious beings too, much like terrorist plants, hence are able to drive on their own in search of their human owners... Who am I to say it isn't possible? I am neither as brilliant as Mr.Charlatan nor as intellectually perceptive as PETArds.<br/><br/>""Run from the wind, run!"" When a movie has the main characters trying to out-run a wind, you know you're in trouble. Or perhaps it wasn't a wind, but this script f**ting.<br/><br/>If there is anything nature should rebel against, it's the poisonous fumes coming out of Tinseltown's derriere.<br/><br/>I guess it's too much to ask from Tinseltown to make the occasional horror film, thriller - let alone drama - these days without spicing them up with some lame Leftist-propaganda nonsense. Either it's gay rights, or it's pollution, or it's about evil market economies, or how murderous and conspiratorial those oh-so corrupt evil Western democracies are, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>The easiest thing in the world is to write something preachy and predictable - especially when it's this retarded. But presenting the increasingly dumbed-down audiences with an actual original story, devoid of political malarkey, with intelligent dialogue and a cast uninfected with talentless nepotistic offspring: that, I guess, is too much to ask for.<br/><br/>Zoooooey Dechanel has the acting skills of a tired amoeba.

This is just another in a long line of bad movies. What is upsetting is that it is a good premise. Mother Nature strikes back. Wonderful idea. I can see why they gave him the budget for it. It is good for a laugh with a group of friends, when you wonder why Mark E. Mark is talking like that, or why that little girl is acting so dramatic. But watching this movie by yourself is a mistake.<br/><br/>Why is the movie bad you ask? Very good question. The answer poor execution by a poor director. Yes I said it someone had to say it. M. Night Shyamalan is a bad director. His movies went from having good twists, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, to mediocre twists, The Village, to every element of the plot being spelled out in the first 20 minutes, The Happening and Lady in the Water. Maybe if we weren't told by the equivalent of a homeless man, that it was the plants 30 minutes into it, it would have been better, but alas.<br/><br/>The acting was horrible period. You can make an argument that it was supposed to be a parody of b-movie classics, but no when your last few movies suck, you aren't afforded the leverage to make such a subtle commentary on movie culture. Wahlberg seemed flat the whole movie, the little girl just seemed annoying and stupid and the woman was just there to complete the set.<br/><br/>Here is a hint for whoever he brings his next movie idea to.

","Ah, good ol' M. Night Shyamalan. Those who have read my other reviews know that I am a fan of Shyamalan's earlier films. The Six Sense leveled me, Signs was brilliantly conceived and very well played, The Village was a work of genius. Then came Lady in the Water, a bizarre and uninteresting work of self-indulgent fluff. Fool me once.<br/><br/>Then, I watched the Happening. Did he actually fool me twice? Well, sort of. The Happening had more interesting concept than Lady: Nature enacts its revenge on Man. And, it started out and actually ended better than Lady. While its not nearly in the same league as Signs and Six Sense,it is clearly more bearable to watch the Happening than Lady in the Water. But the similarity in regards to muddled dialog and misguided performance makes me nervous for the fate of Shyamalan's films.<br/><br/>I actually do think the lead was miscast. I don't think Mark Wahlberg understood the role of a flawed everyman. Zooey Deschanel didn't make it easy for us viewers to sympathize for her. John Leguizamo was the only actor who brought a sense of paranoia that was absent in the other actor's performances.<br/><br/>This won't make me very popular, but I do disagree with many of the comments on this site. This movie actually made me think. I didn't really think about how we are destroying the environment or that the trees and bushes would actually make us suicidal. But, like Signs and The Village, I thought about the point that Shyamalan pieced together. If you put aside the below-average script and poor acting, Shyamalan did cleverly tell a story that nobody else is capable of telling. The movie was undeniably flawed at times, but it was also quite intriguing at times. Not enough for a come back, but perhaps not enough to proclaim ""shame on me."""

","Simply put, one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>It reminded me of both The Birds and The Mist, which were both great suspense/horror/sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>M. Night is so great at creating believable characters and surroundings I'm always surprised to see him still working in Hollywood. His films feel more like Asian films with a bigger budget and world famous actors.<br/><br/>There are couple of memorable shots that are so detailed, effective, realistic, and just plain beautifully shot.<br/><br/>Here are some examples: -The entire scene at the construction working site -Elliot staring at the out-of-control classroom then realizing he's not the only teacher being called out.<br/><br/>-The short, effective shot of a long line of people waiting to use the restroom.<br/><br/>-The realistic shot of cars randomly (not in an organized fashion) leaving the diner in fear.<br/><br/>-The way impatience is portrayed when the red Jeep slowly starts moving.<br/><br/>-The shot of the torn cover.<br/><br/>-The scene where characters run out to tell others which locations have been affected. A sense of responsibility felt in disaster.<br/><br/>-The gathering of people around a woman talking to her daughter on the mobile phone. Shows how our life's priority changes, such as our privacy when such event occurs."

","The first five minutes may be the most original and entertaining five minutes of any movie I've seen in a long, long time. Unfortunately the remaining 84 minutes may be the worst and most inane 84 minutes of any movie I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>M. Night takes a riveting premise (people compelled to kill themselves) and then runs with the least promising concept possible. Out of all the possible causes for people killing themselves, he chooses....attack of the plants? The inherent problem is obvious: you can't fight back against plants. That means the entire second act literally consist of Wahlberg, Zooey, and girl first taking a train to get away, then riding in a car to get away, then walking through a field to get away. That requires a lot of scenes of people standing around saying things like ""What now?"" and ""Which direction?"" and ""We need a break"".<br/><br/>There's also a horrible routine of dispersing information through people standing in front of TV's watching the news. That may be okay in one scene, but when the entire plot of the movie is dispersed through these types of scenes, well, that's just lazy writing.<br/><br/>The real disaster for M. Night is the dialogue. It is cringe-inducing bad. It's so bad that I was embarrassed for Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. This isn't the first time Night has had trouble with writing interesting dialogue. The Village anyone? (Along with giving up society, they must have also given up on contractions?) By the third act Night must have realized that he had written himself into a corner because he throws in everything but the kitchen sink. There's the shameless shooting of two kids who had been Marky Mark and Zooey's traveling companions. There's the needless visit with the crazy old woman who provides nothing for the story but some good old fashioned crazy talk, a spooky house, and a creepy doll.<br/><br/>And then of course there's the ending, which should now be dubbed the ""Spielberg War of the Worlds"" ending. Everything magically goes back to normal just in time for our characters to get home and find everything okay.<br/><br/>Night does at least stick to the internal logic because we relive the first five minutes in a European city. Of course, all that means is that the previous 85 minutes we were forced to sit through are now completely meaningless. Thanks Night! Six films in, the verdict on Night's career is in. Great Director? Yes. Awful Writer? Double yes. He's a talented filmmaker, but god his scripts are bad. An all-time classic surprise ending does not a good writer make."

This may have been O.K. if it would have been shown as a T.V. show, but not on Primetime T.V. You leave the Cinema thinking to yourself, ""Did I actually pay, to see that?"". The Acting was about on par, with what you would expect, on a T.V. soap opera. As far as trying to compare this to any other Movie, that I have seen, I just cannot.

"draicfreeman","1","4","9","6 July 2008"," This is a terrible, terrible film
","I left the theater thinking that either Shyamalan made this movie ironically, or he is terrible at every aspect of film-making. I have seen all of Shyamalan's films save Lady In The Water and if you liked all of those, you will probably like this one. That said, this film is worse than any of them. It is a terrible, terrible film. I couldn't help but wonder how Shyamalan got these actors to take part in this god-awful production. Did he change the script after they'd signed on? Did he show them fake dailies so they'd come back the next day? Were they drugged with copious amounts of Special K? Only Shyamalan knows for sure. I have read that this film was intended to be a ""fun B-movie"" and if that is the case I can see where the attempt was made, but showing a boom mic during every conversation multiple times is not clever, it is distracting and makes my brain hurt in ways I cannot explain without multiple charts with cartoon lightning bolts on them. I enjoy B-movies, but they have several traits which this movie lacks. For one, B-movies are allowed to have bad acting, obvious screw-ups and stilted dialogue because they are rushed and made for next to nothing compared to standard cinema fair. This film has all of those bad acting concessions, but while it could be argued that the shooting for this film was relatively brief, but anything over $1 million was to much spent to make something of this grade. It should also be noted that B-movies are explicitly designed to pander. They are cheesecake. They rarely have a message and if they do, it is so subtly done as to be entirely absent from spoken dialogue (take Night of The Living Dead as an example). Thsi film bookends with the message explicitly stated by characters looking directly at the screen. A final defense made for this film is that it is an original tale told subtly that acts a respite to the mountains of remakes, sequels and schlock drivel often found at theaters today. Well ignoring that this film is apparently intended to be the schlock horror that it's fans decry, this film, while of a vaguely original concept, is very much just as bad as any Dukes of Hazzard or Meet The Spartans. The sole difference being that everyone knows those films are pointless trash and no one denies that. This film tells you it's important, it's fans tell you it's important, but if you knew nothing about Shyamalan you would assume that this was a cranked-out summer placeholder, likely to be followed next summer by The Happening 2: It Happens Again. In closing this is a very bad film. Not good bad, not funny ironic bad, but poorly done bad, even mean-spirited prank played on the viewing public bad. If you're looking for a film with an original concept and powerful message, watch WALL-E at a late showing. You won't get cinephile street cred for saying you thought it was great, but you also won't spend the whole thing wishing you'd downed a bottle of Hydroxezine with a bottle of vodka before hand. Please Mr. Shyamalan, stop making movies. You're hurting me."

","I have to agree with the previous poster that the movie had a lot of nothing happening. The characters seemed to be cut out of cardboard (one dimensional generic cutouts). The story was promising with some interesting takes on End of the World tropes. But, in the end Night didn't deliver to his potential.<br/><br/>In The Happening, M. Night Shyamalan strengths are overshadowed by a ""message"" that is forcefully shoved down the movie audiences throat. He missed an opportunity to play to his strength of blurring the boundary between the fantastic and reality because, in my opinion, he wanted to make the message as obvious as possible.<br/><br/>At this point in human history, the message that we are ""hurting"" nature is something best preached to the choir like Al Gore did in An Inconvenient Truth.

I really can't tell you how frustrated I was through most of this film, and had I not wasted money to throw away an hour and a half of my life, I probably would have walked out of that theater.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, the acting wasn't so horrible... In most cases. There's really no excuse for Zoeey Deschanel, whose stumbling, baffled expression seems to maintain regardless of how unbaffling her situation is. Otherwise, Mark Wahlberg handles himself fairly well, and even delivers some fairly funny lines in the unfortunately rare scenes of intentional comedy that are given, which are really the only highlights of the film. The rest of the supporting cast works decently as well. The real failing is that dialogue, which mainly consists of ""What's happening?"" or ""Why is this happening?"" for an hour and a half. Over and over and over again. A number of the reactions are totally inappropriate, (Such as referring to the clearly aggressive and angry people your trying to get to help you as ""b******"" and ""p******"", or a soldier reacting to information of more dead bodies with ""Cheese and crackers!""), and the emotionally line are written and delivered in a manner very similar to the infamous ""Anakin, your breaking my heart!"" scene from Star Wars III. in case you haven't seen it, that scene was ridiculously bad.<br/><br/>The plot is silly. An air-born virus caused by some very p***ed off and sensitive planets releases some sort of chemical that causes every one to want to kill themselves, and apparently only when they're in groups. Hopefully this concept isn't supposed to be believable, because, while I may not be a neuro-scientist, I'm pretty sure plants aren't capable of messing with our brains like that. Anyway, regardless, these plants apparently only feel like killing people when they're in numbers greater than five, and only in the north-east portion of the United States. However, no matter what circumstance the protagonists are put it, they still seem totally in affected, even when everyone else around is putting guns to their heads, and in the end, {Spoiler alert, if you really care please skip to the next paragraph}, the second these characters go outside, the virus miraculously stops! For no other reason than Shymalan's belief that a deus ex machina is a totally believable idea.<br/><br/>While this is not quite the worst film I've ever seen (I saw Eragon, I'm pretty much prepared for anything), its definitely high on the my list. Its one of the most frustrating films I've ever sat through, and anyone who goes to see it should expect nothing better. If you have to see it, rent it.

It is a deeply moving portrait of a woman terrified by the unknown and fearful of losing everything of meaning to her. The director, known for his unusual films that manage to consistently leave us breathless has outdone himself with what he presents us with here.

Judging by this incredibly daft mess, it's my guess that those budgets are going to keep getting thinner and that even the B-listers will stop returning his calls before long.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a mysterious virus that strikes New York's Central Park one morning. The virus strikes suddenly, making its victim's disorientated and incapable of speech before eventually developing suicidal tendencies. The opening scene , in which construction workers rain from the sky, is probably the best of the film because, as the reasons for the virus are slowly explained the film grows increasingly silly.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays one of the frightened city dwellers evacuating the city for the countryside - which proves to be a big mistake; they should have headed for a city centre Starbucks - with his wife and best friend plus daughter. John Lequizamo plays the friend, and he's almost completely wasted as well as miscast. The refugees find themselves stranded in a small town after the train they are travelling on is halted when it loses communications. All the passengers wind up in the town's diner and, when the TV informs them that they have actually ventured into the virus's epicentre, climb into convenient cars to make their second escape. Only Wahlberg and his gang failed to have the foresight to ensure they had a car waiting at the diner for when the unforeseen train stop occurred <br/><br/>It's this kind of sloppy writing that really winds me up. It smacks of a 'that'll do' attitude on the part of the writer that is an insult to the film's audience. Either Shyamalan figures we're not bright enough to spot glaring flaws like this or he just doesn't care whether we notice or not. It's only a small moment, but flaws like that rankle for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>The film grows increasingly silly - with some ill-advised and ham-fisted efforts at humour along the way - so that, despite the brief running time, the audience stops caring what happens - or why it happens - long before the end credits finally roll."

","I have just lost all respect for M. Night Shyamalan. For him to set out and make ""the greatest b movie ever"" is just insulting. So you're telling me that a rich, successful writer/director/producer used their $50 million production budget to create a movie that in the 50s was a result of young, struggling, inexperienced filmmakers who were stuck with low budgets, mediocre actors, and second rate equipment? ANYONE can do that with $50 million. So rather than take in a cheap actor, you pay people big bucks to suck? A studio payed this douche millions of dollars to make a movie that is as ""good"" as something that was made for as little as a few hundred dollars? Really, what a load of crap. This isn't a b movie, this is a cop out from a downhill filmmaker. And for all of you who are going to point out movies like Grindhouse, that was NOT a b-movie either. It was made in homage to be movies, but isn't a b movie itself. It was a spoof. However, 'The Happening' pays no homage to b movies. It is disrespecting filmmakers everywhere. This movie is not a b movie, it is a result of an established filmmaker getting lazy and running out of good ideas."

","I think hundreds of people have said it before me, but this movie is very below average. The plot is that people all over the world are reported killing themselves. They can't find any reason why this is happening (happening? The Happening? Get it??), and it seems that they also can't figure out why these people are committing suicide in the most over-the-top way possible. Then after boring you for another half hour they find out who's making people suicidal; plants! Haha! Really, this is so ridiculous its not even funny anymore. I expected M. Night to come up with sóme kind of plot-twist like he usually does, but plants?! Give me a break. The script looks like something M. Night wrote on a coffee-break in between making movies.<br/><br/>Anyway. After that, the movie drags on and the remaining people are now trying to survive, just as the viewer is trying to stay awake during the rest of this mess of a movie. I just can't believe that the guy who wrote and directed classic films such as The Sixth Sense can come up with such a ridiculous B-movie, and honestly its not 'horrible' either but just boring as hell. But horrible movies at least have some comedic relief, but this movie on the other hand presents nothing original. Mark Wahlberg is also at his worst in this movie. You can just see at his face that he is completely lost. I have to admit that I never liked Mark Wahlberg at all, but his acting here is very poor.<br/><br/>I think that The Happening was trying to come off as spooky and realistic since there are no monsters, aliens or ghosts and the like involved. But instead the movie feels stiff, the acting is simply unconvincing and the characters themselves are not impressive. Maybe a plot about people mysteriously killing themselves cóuld be a good idea for a grim story, but The Happening just isn't. In my humble opinion this is M. Night's worst movie until this date."

","The Happening is another thriller if you want to call it that from M Night Shymalan who rose to fame with The Sixth Sense. His career hasn't been doing so well with flops like The Village, Unbreakable, and Lady in The Water. Which at least to me weren't that bad but weren't the greatest either. The Happening continues that trend unfortunately but the first forty five minutes or so are promising but things go bad quickly after that. The movie was a big disappointment compared to The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008, Iron Man, Wall-E, The Incredible Hulk, and even Indiana Jones. The Happening starts off strong with people randomly killing themselves in horrific ways. The cast for the most part did what they could with their roles. Mark Whalberg, Zoeey Deschnael, and John Leguizamo in a brief cameo bring a lot to their characters but unfortunately the rest of the film isn't as good. M Night Shymalan is a gifted writer and director but this movie doesn't even come close to the Sixth Sense. The ending of the film wasn't that great either. It was predictable leaving me feeling sort of cheated. The music by James Newton Howard was fitting and seemed to sync very well with the mood of the movie. But the bad outweighs the good and this could've been a far better apocalyptic thriller than it was. M. Night had stated this was his scariest film yet but unfortunately it wasn't very scary to me. The only thing startling about it were the deaths by the people who were offing themselves in gruesome ways. If you're a fan of M. Nights films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. If you're not then don't see it because you would've wasted 90 minutes of your life that you can't get back."

Night Shyamalan since Signs and I was one of maybe five people who actually liked The Village. Lady in the Water.... well that is another story. Anyhow I was still eager to see this latest work by Shyamalan and it truly did leave an impression on me. That impression was that he will likely never make another big-budgeted Hollywood film again. Sad, but true. The Happening is a very campy kind of disaster film. It has an intriguing premise but it's really muddled down by it's hammy dialog, lack of suspense, and performances that are just bizarre. Seriously, was Shyamalan's direction to Zooey Deschanel to act as if she were stoned through out the entire movie? Even the wonderful Mark Wahlberg is more awkward than anything else in this film. I know it's a poor film, yet...<br/><br/>I found myself genuinely entertained by it. In a campy kind of way this movie did amuse me. It was funny at times, though unintentionally so, and even as the film didn't have the suspense or scares that I had hoped for it had enough action to keep it afloat. It was weird and off-beat and in the end I think it was the pure strangeness of it that saved it from being a bore.<br/><br/>So what's my final verdict? Well, it's a tough call. I found it interesting and never dull, but I'm also the first to admit that it was pretty flawed. I say if you're a die-hard Shyamalan fan, go see it, if not I would do some internet investigating before seeing it. Either way, I think the time of M.

As with all of M. Night's films, I thought it contained intelligent scriptwriting and a novel approach to the interaction of the human populous and the universe we live in.<br/><br/>I do have to agree that the acting wasn't Oscar-worthy, but as noted earlier, the acting in The Happening was much better than what can be found in the ""Gore/Slasher"" films of late, and overall I would consider the acting certainly passable if compared to the plethora of garbage Hollywood is putting out nowadays.<br/><br/>It is a movie of fantasy, suspense and the incredible, and should not be taken as anything other than that.

"Fisch721","2","3","6","26 October 2008"," M. Night's first R-rated flick falls flat
","I'm not going to start out my review by sighting my enjoyment of Mr. Shyamalan's first three cinematic ventures, as trying to compare any film with a director/writer's previous endeavors is an exercise in futility. I declare that a movie must rest upon its' own laurels as an entertaining and worthwhile theater experience, regardless of whomever is at the helm. That being said, I can not remember a more dreadfully slopped together, poorly acted and painfully wretched attempt at a film that has come along in some time. <br/><br/>For a movie that was hyped up to be M. Night Shyamalan's grand entrance into the R-rated genre, I found myself nearly in tears at the total lack of a cohesive storyline, character development or sensible dialogue. I didn't know whether to laugh, to cry or to simply shake my head in disbelief, yet I found myself performing all three for an hour and thirty minutes. Some have posted that those who criticized this film ""didn't get the deeper message"" and were being ""overly-negative."" Well, I GOT the message, it was just put into the clumsiest, least-thought-through wrapper possible. <br/><br/>Let me put it this way: If you were making a point to someone, two predominant choices would be presented. Either A: You could take a ball-peen hammer and bludgeon them to death. Or B: Take a while, maybe a few hours, and come up with a well-developed, sensible argument to explain your stance.<br/><br/>The second option will undoubtedly take some time, but a clear and concise point would be made, leaving both parties feeling relatively better concerning the matter. The former, while more to the point, leaves the recipient(s) irrevocably damaged, along with a terrible mess to clean up.<br/><br/>I came into this movie leaving my expectations at the door, hoping that despite the mixed bag of tricks Mr. Shyamalan has presented audiences, I would finish having watched at least an entertaining film, if not perhaps a quality one. Instead, what I ended up getting was a bad case of ""Viewer's Remorse"" and a subtraction of time that could have been spent re-watching ""Iron Man."" If you enjoy movies that make sense or even campy B-movies that keep you entertained, DO NOT watch this waste of celluloid."

I'm not sure if it was the fact that we were given the idea that trees, bushes, grass, etc. were tired of us and ready to kill us or the fact that it was just a horrible plot. Either way, I was bored out of my mind watching this movie, and although meant to be a thriller, I found myself laughing at during many moments. I dropped the movie off at a free books store near my residence. I hope they don't sell it as it's a waste of money in the first place. Sorry M. Night Shyamalan, but this was definitely a failure."

In fact I started watching it full of hope and confidence, knowing that his previous efforts have been more than worth watching, but within ten minutes of the start I knew as my heart began sinking that this particular film was going to be the exception to his track record. This is just so so bad I can't begin to describe it! Acting is at best mediocre, script is thin and lacking in anything that may even begin to grip the viewer. Do yourself a favour and spend 2 hours of your precious finite life pursuing a worthwhile pastime instead of watching this dire offering.

","To be perfectly honest, the movie was awful. However, it was great to laugh at. Think about it: a movie with a plot consisting of plants driving people so crazy that they commit suicide! Just how desperate is M.Night Shyamalan to write a movie? Personally, I am not a fan of his work but I do know that he could have done better than this...or so I thought. <br/><br/>Generally, in horror movies, people(or whoever the ""villian"" may be) breaks into your house to kill you. Not in this movie. Instead, people are breaking into your house to kill themselves. Which, maybe, you can see why I found it humorous.<br/><br/>The dialog was awful which may be another reason on why the acting was so awful. I agree with the comment before mine that the lead role was definitely not for Marky Mark. He had the same pitiful expression on his face throughout the entire movie. The girl, whatever her name is, did not perform well either. The first movie I saw her in was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and because that had been the only movie I saw her in I couldn't officially decide if she was talented or not. Now, I know based off my opinion from this terrible movie. Her acting skills are weak. Go to acting lessons! They are there to help struggling actors, such as yourself, for a reason!<br/><br/>So, on top of everything else the ending was the worst. Starting 20 minutes into the movie I couldn't help but wonder where the f*** this movie was going and how it would end. Desperately, I hoped it would turn out OK. I mean, I did just spend money on this crap! I was let-down, of course, by the ending the most. It sucked. It was dreadful. Oh, and most of all dull!"
"fertilecelluloid","4","3","6","1 August 2008"," Will someone please confiscate Shyamalan's typewriter?!
","""The Happening"" opens with poetic images of regular folks jumping from buildings and some off-kilter gun suicides. These gave me hope. As suicides in rural areas of the US increase, stupid people start speculating that these deaths are the work of ""the terrorists"". In a thick- headed way, director M. Night Shyamalan plugs into the way George Bush Jnr. and his war- loving cronies have turned low and average IQ Americans into shaking balls of paranoia; Rod Serling plumbed similar territory in ""...Twilight Zone"" episodes such as 'The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street'. In many instances, Shyamalan films feel like episodes of that classic TV series -- bad episodes, unfortunately. As usual, Shyamalan has written another creative check that can't be cashed. Good set-up. Reasonable confrontations. Tawdry resolution. Childish, actually. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel play a couple who, like so many others, feel the sudden need to hit the road once the suicide statistics start rising. They have no destination; they're just getting as far away as possible from the city. Which turns out to be a complete mistake, of course. There's been a lot of criticism of Wahlberg's performance. My opinion is that he took a paycheck to play a badly written character and didn't get much help from Shyamalan. He's a regular guy type who doesn't quite meet hero requirements. Deschanel, who plays his wife, looks and acts more like his moody daughter. She makes nothing but idiotic contributions to the betterment of the situation. The story hops along and there are some arresting images of bodies hanging from trees. The cinematography is surprisingly plain and the score by James Newton Howard overemphasizes key shifts in the narrative. The explanation for why people suddenly start suiciding is silly. If this had been written by a ten year old, I'd give the kid a B+ for effort. If it had been written by an adult with a bunch of cinematic notches on his belt, I'd send him to his room without supper and confiscate his typewriter."

","This movie was a letdown in many ways. I like Shyamalan's earlier movies, and I like Wahlberg's acting in his other films. I didn't much care for this movie because it seemed like something people throw together when it doesn't matter how it turns out, like fixing dinner for your mother-in-law. Who cares if it is green beans and spinach, it's food and constitutes dinner. The movie is a decidedly B-movie but I don't think it was intended as such like some of the other reviews I have read. The plot is silly and the ending is a re-iteration of some popular books among liberals regarding how the Earth might some day rise up and start killing human kind for being the way we are. No one has ever written a book about the Earth killing polar bears or grub worms for being the way they are, only humans. I wish people who keep telling us how much better off the Earth would be without humans would leave the Earth to set an example and prove their point. We are human, after all, and have just as much right on this planet as any other life form. Nobody bashes lions for eating baby Cheetahs any time they run across one because that's what lions do. Humans build things, that's what we do. If you don't like that move to the Moon, there are no humans there yet, although it is warmer now than 10 years ago just like the Earth. I guess that's our fault as well and should be officially classified as human-driven lunar warming.<br/><br/>I wish Hollywood would stop trying to tell people how to live and produce entertainment like they used to. This movie isn't terrible, it is completely watchable, but the acting seems somewhat forced and not believable at all for many of the characters. Be warned that this movie has a definite liberal slant regarding how bad we humans are and how the Earth might one day rise up and start killing us. What is it about Hollywood liberals and telling everyone how to live their life?"
"Willie-12","3","3","6","4 July 2008"," Three Strikes...And He's Out
","M. Night Shyamalan was once one of the most promising young talents in Hollywood. His films were dramatic, yet suspenseful. His writing was creative and unique. He produced one great film (The Sixth Sense), and two pretty good ones (Unbreakable and Signs). But then there was a ""happening,"" and it wasn't plants killing people. No, the ""happening"" that I am speaking of is the total collapse of a promising career. It started with ""The Village"" (strike one). It did have atmosphere. The acting was good. However, it all built up to one of the most anti-climactic conclusions that I have ever seen. At that point however, I gave M. Night the benefit of the doubt. I mean everyone makes mistakes. Even Steven Spielberg created some crap early in his career (i.e. ""1941""). But then came ""Lady in the Water"" (strike two). There was really nothing good about this film, although the acting was still pretty decent. This is, however, M. Night's worst creation. It honestly felt as if he wrote dialogue for the scenes right before filming them. At this point, I was a bit nervous. Sure ""The Village"" had a crappy conclusion, but most of what preceded that crappy conclusion was pretty decent. ""Lady in the Water"" was pretty much all crap. And finally, we come to ""The Happening"" (strike three...he's out). I had a feeling this was going to be pretty bad when the T.V. trailers started to market this movie, not by using M. Night's name, but in proclaiming how this was his first ""R"" rated film. My suspicions were, unfortunately, correct. This was bad all the way around. The directing, the editing, the acting, the screenplay (horrible dialogue which, in my opinion, led to the bad acting). The only reason I give this three out of ten stars, and rate it just barely above ""Lady in the Water"" is because, every now and then, there were some scenes that had a genuine creepiness about them. And that's just it. It is obvious that M. Night has talent. Somewhere, after wading through all the crap that was ""The Happening,"" there is a guy who knows how to send chills up your spine. But I honestly believe that it's time for M. Night to lay the pen down, and start directing someone else's script. Is it too late? Well, as far as I am concerned it's three strikes and he's out. I will not shell out 9 bucks to go see a sub-par M. Night movie again. And that's a shame. Because this was once one of the most promising talents in all of Hollywood."

All the lead actors are awful, and it doesn't help that they haven't meaningful things to say.<br/><br/>And though this may sound like ""bashing"", unfortunately it is not.

"LarsKrebs","3","3","6","20 June 2008"," Incoherent, uninteresting and slow!
","Okay, so I saw this trailer a few weeks ago for what seemed like an interesting movie. Something about a mysterious event, something about disappearing bees, something about people fleeing the big cities and something about a natural disaster. Seemed kinda new and suspenseful compared to the usual crappy Hollywood-flick trailers packed with action, one-liners and Kodak-moments. Besides, Mark Wahlberg usually performs quite fair in my opinion, so of course I decided to watch this movie on the big screen. Unfortunately, what I didn't realize was that the trailer WAS the movie! That was f...... it! There is no more to this movie than what the trailer reveals! Of course there is a lot of characters babbling back and forth, trying to explain the ""happening"", quite a bit of gore and a whole bunch of weird Shyamalan-like scenes, doing absolutely nothing whatsoever to progress the movie. WTF! If you're into that kinda useless stuff, you should definitely watch this flick. The rest of you should just watch the trailer and be happy that I just spared you ninety minutes of incoherent bull.<br/><br/>Well, allow me to correct myself. The movie takes of quite well, kinda like the trailer ""promised"". The unknown threat that suddenly reveals itself to mankind is merciless and intriguing but is eventually reduced to an incoherent phenomenon pseudo-scientifically explained as a plant conspiracy against mankind or something like that. Anyway, after approximately twenty-five minutes or so, the movie just die in a way. Nothing of greater importance to the overall plot of the movie happens after this point! Now, everyone knows that M. Night Shyamalan usually adds a nice plot twist towards the end of his movies making them a little more watchable. So I waited patiently for this twist to come. Was it all just a dream? Was Mark Wahlberg actually a ghost? Was the government behind the mysterious event? I waited anxiously! I needed a twist! Anykind of twist, no matter how lame!! But the damn twist never came! This movie is completely and utterly straight forward! Simple in the bad way. Excuse the blasphemy, but Jesus Christ! I'd rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear than sit through the last hour of this flick once again. It is so uninteresting! So boring! The dialogue is just, well, abundant and many of the scenes just don't do anything! <br/><br/>Now, many people will most likely ignore the terrible plot and give me a lecture about how the movie is not at all about the characters and their exodus, but instead a symbol of how mankind is punished for his misdeeds against Nature and bla bla bla. Erh, yeah! That particular subplot was just as subtle as a tank in a mini-market, thank you! If a professional writer can't think of a better way to propagate this message, than making plants go postal, Hollywood is on really thin ice! Gee, I wondered why a scene had a big dirty nuclear power plant as a ""discrete"" background. Humiliating and clumsy symbolism, that's what that is. And as for the other subplots, these are just boring. Something about Wahlberg's wife having an affair and something about, no wait, that was it. WTF! As for the cast, Wahlberg hasn't exactly received applause for his role as the protagonist Elliot. I'm not sure I agree tough. I think he does a decent job most of the time, considering the terrible plot and the weird lines he has to work with. He is definitely not the one to blame.<br/><br/>So, all in all, ""The Happening"" is a piece of junk not worth a view in my opinion. Three keywords: incoherent, uninteresting and slow. Don't expect anything."

I also liked this one more than some of his other movies because they weren't afraid to put anything in this like there is some pretty hard stuff to watch in this one. Like Bart said in his review this one really is intense. This was also his first movie to be actually sorta gory which I was surprised about because his movies usually don't have that much gore in them but I still really liked this movie. But if you can't handle movies that are really intense then I strongly recommend you don't see this because this is one of those movies like that. But if you can handle those types of movies like me then this would be a great one to see before it leaves theaters if you get the chance to see it. But if you do miss it in theaters then I would recommend that you buy it on DVD because it's just one of those movies that you have to see.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","I'm just back from the theater where i went to see the happening and I really feel that Shyamalan let me down.<br/><br/>First let me say that the story as a whole was a good one. But the treatment is totally bogus. As another commenter said, the action start right at the beginning of the movie. I don't really know if it's a good thing, most of the movie have pathetic introduction to every character, but sometimes it's the price to pay to care for them.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie are the dialogs. Most of the things the people says through the film are crap. I don't know anybody who speaks like this. All the lines between Wahlberg and Deschanel seems totally artificial. No wonder, their acting seems totally odd. I don't know, how it would be possible to seems natural saying the crap, they have to say.<br/><br/>Globally after the introduction of the happening and the Wahlberg character where he speak the only really relevant dialog (and the key of the movie), I started to find the time really long."

","I don't understand why is everyone dissecting this movie under the microscope. I just don't get it. What movies do you people actually like?<br/><br/>If you take films witch are most similar to this genre, like I Am Legend, where mysterious virus turns everyone to vampires. All George Romero movies includes living dead people walking like there is no tomorrow. Both 28 afters, with their mysterious virus turning people into raging beasts. And the list goes on. Is it the action, or the CGI effects that justifies those movies? Are those movies better just because someone writes the script and someone else produce it, and other directed it? Give me a break! They are actually all lame, but who cares? We like them anyway!<br/><br/>M.Night Shyamalan is great director and that is a fact he proved more then 1 time. We can talk about it, agree or disagree about it, but that is all we can do about it! Is it bad that he likes control over his work? Come on!<br/><br/>What i really like about this movie is that he didn't produce another audience aimed blockbuster. There are no scenes of mass destruction, abandoned big cities or massive exodus of people. I believe that there are no CGI images. Is this really possible? And he done it so skillfully, that it is even more realistic. Why? Because what will we have at the end? Some government statement and media. That's it. They said that it's some terrorist attack. Maybe not. Who knows, for sure. Let's go to see mama on the countryside, because otherwise we can only lock the doors, windows and wait. This movie brings even some better and more disturbing questions, that we should ask. Do we have all the answers? Is it possible that the nature take care of us? Is it possible that behind this global warming madness, we actually forgot how small and vulnerable we are. Is it possible that there are things that, we never understand? Is everything on this planet about us?<br/><br/>I think this movie delivers great suspense, some images that you can't easily forget (at least I can't) and is pretty well executed and directed. It has great camera, edit and of course one of the best scores of J.N.Howard. What more you can have? I don't know.<br/><br/>I think this movie has more in it. And only time will tell."

I've loved all his movies he's had out. People came in there probably expecting some gory movie with blood and guts everywhere just because it's rated R. They missed the whole point of the movie. This is one of the most terrifying movies I've seen in awhile. The scenes with people killing themselves terrified me the most. Especially the part where *******SPOILER******the little girls father killed himself******SPOILER******* Zooey Dechannel and Mark Whalburg were terrific in this. Their acting was totally different than what it normally is. Dechannel is a terrific actor I've loved her ever since her role in Elf. You're probably shaking your head thinking I'm an idiot because you think the acting was terrible. It's not it's meant to be like that. It's more real it's not that in your face acting.

","This was a great movie from a man that has delivered us so many in the past (we'll have to forget Lady in the Water!) Like another reviewer has said, don't go to see this expecting to be blown away because very simply you won't! It is one of those wonderful films that make you think, has beautiful imagery and a very good cast.<br/><br/>There are moments in the film when I, a 25 yr old man, was reclining in fear in my cinema chair as I was frightened!!! That, I feel, can only be done in these situations by Shyamalan and maybe at this given time Danny Boyle! Another reviewer mentioned that there seemed to be no chemistry between the two leads, Wahlberg and Deschanel. Well without giving the plot away we are told that they are a couple that are going through problems and are distant - personally I thought the casting for the entire film was well and truly spot on, especially John Leguizamo.<br/><br/>The film still has it's Shyamalan's ""touches"" with the shock value. I'm not going to give anything away by telling you that some scenes are truly shocking and it some cases quite disturbing yet superbly shot.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 9 very simply because once more people see it and give it time then reflect back. Personally I feel The Village is his best, Signs is great, Unbreakable is a good film (again, once it has been given time) and the Sixth Sense awoke a genre once more that people are trying to re-encapsulate! The Happening is going to be up there with Signs and the Village.<br/><br/>Go and see (or simply just see) this film - ignore the science behind it if needs be. If you want a film that has been superbly cast and beautifully shot then see this film."

I had read reviews saying this same thing and i figured they were just being a-holes, but I can not stress that enough....THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE, and is what really killed the movie for me. You would think this was Mark Wahlberg's first acting role ever. Zooey Deschanel is equally as bad, if not worse. As well most of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>There were good little shocker scenes throughout the movie (the only thing that kept me in the theater for the entire movie) but the whole concept on plants killing humans did not seem well thought of, and almost seemed throw together. There were way to many plot-holes that left you wondering ""Uhhh..how?...why?"" with no explanation.<br/><br/>M.

","I know there are lot of bad reviews on this movie. But seriously guys you have to see this one for yourself. Leave behind the memories from Sixth Sense and Signs and forget all the reactions you got from others on this one. So, clear your mind and steer your car to the movie hall to see ""The Happening"". I am afraid I can't say that the plot was great or how great the starting or the ending was. But, I was thrilled by these great moments thrown at me one after another. I almost stepped into the shoes of the characters and was reacting to every sound I heard. The ride was so thrilling and gripping that it kept me glued to my seat from start to end. I didn't try to think of the story or the theory as to what was happening. I was lost in the moment of every scene unfolding on screen. As always with Shyamalan movies, the background score was a character in this movie and James Newton Howard again proves his command over the medium. Actor Mark Wahlberg was literally breathing the lead character and keeps you with him throughout. He had the entire movie on his shoulders along with the background score and the two of them together delivered the goods for me. The humor has been woven beautifully into the screenplay. While the audience is rejoicing a lighter moment on the screen, a scene makes the audience go ""ah!"" followed by a pin drop silence. That's when you realize the power of cinema and the magic of Shyamalan. The only disappointment was that the movie came to an end really fast. It's almost like you got into a roller coaster ride that you are enjoying as it goes faster and faster and suddenly comes to an halt. I wanted to ride more. Shyamalan's ""The Village"" and ""The Lady In The Water"" didn't work for me. But, ""The Happening"" was really happening for me. So, Finally all I have to say is the movie may or may not leave a impression on you, but you definitely don't want to miss the experience of being part of ""The Happening""."

","The Happening can only be described by me as the willful destruction of an established BRAND. And that is a rather reluctant but honest commentary on this latest awful movie by M. Night Shyamalan. On one hand I am perplexed by the seemingly unfinished effort. On the other I am insulted that we (a loyal audience) may be taken for granted with this offering because he dared to unveil this tripe to us. M. Night did not do his homework nor his due diligence with this film, and it is painfully obvious from the poor dialog, the stupidly illogical story line and the grossly mischaracterized biology and ecology. This one may signal the end of the ride. Speaking as a fan of Mike Tyson who kept looking for a return to the brilliance of old ""Iron Mike"", I think that M. Night may have no fight left. Still, and thankfully so, the fleeting physical attributes of prize fighting are not needed for film-making. But you must have a similar passion to want to be your very best. Well, do you still have the passion M. Night? Or will you become as big a joke to the film-making arena as Mr. Tyson became to the prize fighting arena? Simply unbelievable!<br/><br/>And for those who contend that this is a solid effort that has been misunderstood, you must be more discriminating. You do M. Night's previous very good works a great injustice to say that this one is good. Stop it and drop the Kool Aid!"

Why did the old lady had so much ""importance"" in the story...??? He creates characters with no strength I like M.

If like he said, tried to do a B movie, he didn't got that either... the contrast from what a big Hollywood production is with a B film don't go well together.

","I have not had to watch a more dreadful piece of utter schlock garbage in years than ""The Happening."" The notion that plants could seek revenge or defend themselves against humans is credible, as research has shown, but this movie does its best to make something that is serious seem utterly ridiculous. No attention span is needed as everything is fed to us spoonful by spoonful. The writers have also obviously been out of touch with their own educational experience for some time now - any high school science teacher who spoke to an inner city senior or junior class the way the script has Mark Wahlberg pontificating would likely be knifed in the halls or sent down to Kindergarten to teach. He is so utterly patronizing in that scene that it is hard to believe that he wasn't just rushed and put out of his misery right there and then, which would have saved me another hour and 15 or so minutes of pain...<br/><br/>John Leguiziamo's role is also disastrously badly written, and the ""doe-eyed"" Zooey Deschanel is just plain dumb and creepy. The attempts at character development in this film are so bad, one wonders if they were not written by MNS's daughters, nieces, high school-aged groupies - what have you...<br/><br/>From the point of common-sense alone (the plants spread their toxins by giving off the deadly, invisible brew which is wind-borne, but the wind apparently can be magically summoned by the plants to do their dirty work - this entire premise is never explained or even alluded to as it would have exposed the entire premise of the film as the ridiculous tripe it was) I went after reading another review here (warning me dutifully of plenty of spoilers) but the description of this film as utterly shocking and extremely bloody was unwarranted and overly cautious, probably the work of a soccer mom... Sweeney Todd the musical is much bloodier and more extreme in its scenes of mayhem than any part of The Happening except for one scene in which Mrs. Jones does herself in toward the very end...<br/><br/>If this is the best MNS can now bring forth, his steam is obviously running out.

","I loved Sixth Sense. I think Unbreakable is the best ""comic book"" film ever made, and Signs still scares the crap out of me. I was left cold by The Village, but appreciated the artistry, and thought Lady in the Water was a magical fairytale, judged too harshly by cynics.<br/><br/>All that being said, I cannot believe the director of those films, the man heralded as ""The new Spielberg"", wrote and directed ""The Happening"".<br/><br/>It is possibly the worst film I have seen in 10 years. No kidding. The script is atrocious; reams of expositional, ridiculous dialogue and plot contrivances. Characters behave irrationally to move the plot along, and with no reason to care, their fate is of little interest.<br/><br/>The performances are almost uniformly embarrassing. Knowing that Whalberg can be good (see I *Heart* Huckabees), and that Deschanal has never been bad in anything makes it all the more unbelievable. Whalberg spends his time either frowning or wide eyed, often for not reason, and his high pitched voice, while intended to suggest a soft and gentle man, merely comes across as very camp. Only Leguizamo comes out of it with some credibility, but his part is severely underwritten, and ultimately pointless.<br/><br/>For a film vaunted as Shyamalan's first first R rated movie, the only genuine scare is because of a cheap music cue. There are numerous elements one assumes are meant to shock and scare but are unintentionally hilarious (running from the wind? running yourself over with a lawnmower?), whilst the intended humour falls flat (though I will admit to laughing once, when Wahlberg attempts to communicate with ""them"").<br/><br/>It felt like the film reached its end a third of the way through, and then kept going, with no conclusion. While M Night would argue that the film is an unapologetic homage to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", it played like the worst 50s B Movies you might see on ""Mystery Science theatre 3000"".<br/><br/>This is a ""Battlefield: Earth"" level disaster.

The score was fantastic (as his always are), and the way the shots were done made every second of the film seems creepy and well done. All bad things considered about this film, it still brought a smile to my face. Some scenes were laughable (i.e. the iphone video shown in the diner) but I still found myself immersed in the conflict. I beg you to take directing into consideration before calling Shyamalan's latest film a failure. I am not saying that the script was written well or that there is a reasonable resolution at the end; and would agree that the film climaxes very early and continues to be flat throughout the last half of the film. Yet Shyamalan's directing was outstanding and left me with a great appreciation of his work. I would definitely see this movie again given the chance.I am so sick and tired of people expecting a revolution in film every time they enter a theater.

","I decided to give 'The Happening' a chance this past weekend, despite my reservations that the director M. Night Shyamalan has made a career out of making movies from seemingly Twilight Zone episodes. All we need to complete the effort is Rod Serling's voice narrating with a clear, halting voice to guide the audience through.<br/><br/>But what really intrigued me before I went to go see it was reading somewhere that the film had a $58 million dollar budget and was a co-production between Hollywood and an Indian telecom company; they were essentially splitting their costs on this anticipated turkey. You can tell it had low rent production values as well at that low dollar amount. Barely any special effects and everything was outdoors, giving it that two dimensional (read: boring 1950s t.v. effect) feel.<br/><br/>Boy, was I ever right, and to be honest, I should have stuck to my earlier assessment that this director is a one-trick pony. Because his last outing 'Lady In The Water' was such a piece of dreck, he knew he had to seek financing money elsewhere, hence the Indian funding.<br/><br/>This is where 'The Happening's' director and John Singleton diverge, as a comparison/contrast. Where John hit a grand slam with his first film, as did M. Night with 'The Sixth Sense', John too has seen his films decrease in popularity from his Oscar-winning 'Boyz In The Hood.' But John has chosen a divergent path by becoming a producer and allowing others to direct their own films. Though John's films are still gritty, urban-theme, African-American dramas, he is saying something, and he does not make the same movie twice.<br/><br/>Witness all of M. Night's efforts. He says nothing other than he tries to set a mood to encompass the whole screenplay. The studios have wised up to his failing abilities and he may have to rethink of how he can position his next effort because Hollywood is out to make money, not give it away. And not to go down a rat hole, but why do all his movies take place in Pennsylvania? I realize M. Night grew up in Philly but there are other parts of the nation and the world he can film in.<br/><br/>Because I am a movie junky geek, maybe you'll take my words with a grain of salt. Get a life, instead of writing blogs! But if you don't believe me, then believe my colleague who sits next to me during the day. She actually walked out of 'The Happening' this past weekend, and the theatre management gave her a movie pass for a different show because she also thought this lame celluloid effort tried to qualify as entertainment."

This movie is easily worse than Catwoman. Why did Mystery Science Theater 3000 have to end? This would have been a perfect source movie for MST3K.

It was corny, and just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it does with more and more horrible lines of script played by Zooey Deschanel.

"Craig_McPherson","6","4","10","14 June 2008"," Crafting dread from things unseen
","You've heard the saying ""the more things change, the more they stay the same""? Well, nothing better describes the critical reception surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening. For better or worse, Shyamalan has once again stuck to his artistic vision and produced yet another cerebral skin crawler, only to see vast numbers of critics go apoplectic as a result.<br/><br/>The Happening unfolds quickly, over the span of a single day, beginning in New York City. All over town, starting in Central Park, people begin succumbing to a bizarre, trance-like state in which they engineer their own deaths in robotic fashion. The viewer, like the protagonists in the film, is left in the dark, forced to either buy into the film's various theories bantered as to why this is happening, or draw their own conclusions. Is it airborne? Has a terrorist cell spiked the water supply with a new neurotoxin? Is humanity the subject of an unexplained die-off akin to that decimating the honey bee population? Shyamalan refuses to provide pat answers. Even after high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) concludes (as best he can) that the catalyst is a mysterious heretofore unknown airborne agent released by plant life  something akin to the oceanic red tide algae blooms that kill all marine life in their path  we still never know for sure.<br/><br/>Because of interviews Shyamalan has given as part of his pre-publicity for the movie, some critics have gone out on a limb and interpreted the film's message as an ode to Intelligent Design writ large, but doing so is really a stretch. While Shyamalan may have committed the unforgivable sin of going on record as somebody in Hollywood who actually holds to a belief system whose focus is other than Scientology or powder that can be sucked up through one's nasal cavities, so much in The Happening is left up to pure speculation that one could easily read just about anything into it. Evolution taking a nasty and rapid turn? The Great Spirit waking up on the wrong side of the bed? Mother Nature deciding it's not nice to fool her (as a margarine ad once expounded)? The honey bee syndrome? Take your pick.<br/><br/>What is undeniable, however, is Shyamalan's ability to wring dread out of a simple gust of wind, the coming together of large groups of people, even the lonely quivering of a plastic plant. His talent is reminiscent of Hitchcock, even if his stories are a tad too high concept for a lot of folks, including himself at times.<br/><br/>Is The Happening a perfect film? No. It suffers from uneven acting (largely by the stupendously dopey-eyed Zooey Deschanel) and moments of unnecessarily quirky and awkward dialog, but it is a significant bounce back from 2006's tepid Lady in the Water, and it most definitely is a movie that will give you cause to think about things, which, I can safely say, is more than what 99% of this summer's blockbusters will achieve."
"shadowed_rain115","6","4","10","14 June 2008"," If you don't get M. Night Shyamalan...
","Then stop watching his movies.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan, in my opinion, is one of the greatest and most under-appreciated directors out there today. His directing style is very distinct, understated, graceful, and all-around excellent. With ""The Happening,"" he's managed to bring out a movie that's very different from his other films, but the similarities it bears in comparison is definitely worth noting.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" contains the understated, slow cinematography that the vast majority of his films have, and if you need action in every shot, this is definitely not a movie for you. This film is about reality, and Shyamalan incorporated a good deal of realism into the dialogue, the cinematography, and the events taking place. The thing that I loved about the R rating was that it didn't take away from the movie at all, it allowed the movie to continue in the realism vein. It wasn't unnecessary or shamelessly graphic, it merely added to the film in a way that ""the apocalypse"" (if you wish to view the events in the film as such) would ACTUALLY happen.<br/><br/>What most people don't understand about Shyamalan's films is that they're meant to be psychological thrillers...not a thriller or a ""scary"" movie. His movies are meant to make you think, and they're meant to be understated and slow-paced. That's his style, and most people don't understand what he's trying to do there. I feel that this movie will get that kind of criticism, because people go to see it with the expectation that they'll be scared. Yes, there are parts that make you jump, but you won't get frightened. <br/><br/>If you like M. Night Shyamalan's films, then you won't be disappointed with ""The Happening."" If you haven't seen any of his films beforehand, I highly recommend watching ""Unbreakable"" or ""Signs"" first before seeing ""The Happening,"" so that the pacing and the dialogue won't confuse you. I strongly encourage everyone to see it, but go with an open mind. It's an excellent movie that isn't to be missed."

","M. Night Shyamalan. this name brings fear to many different people for many different reasons. its funny, every one gets upset because he doesn't deviate from his patented pattern of surprise endings, and demolish him when he finally does. But ill tell you one thing, his movies are good. Especially this one. Mark wahlberg plays a science teacher who is trying to escape from a mysterious illness that causes the infected to kill themselves. Even though the plot revolves around wahlberg and zooey deschanel, every now and then he'll throw a news report or two to keep the audience up to date on whats going on around the east coast. as the conspiracy theories are being thrown around the outer horn, the main characters come to a shocking conclusion as to the source of this mysterious affliction. yea the plot is over the top ridiculous, but Night has a way of making the plot seem not only plausible, but his talent helps the film avoid the corn that might associate itself with this kind of film. trust me, there are a lot of haters out there that cant understand that every one of his films are different unto themselves. well this particular film is definitely one of the best thrillers of the year, Shyamalan or not."
"MovieZoo","1","4","10","13 June 2008"," The Happening never happened
","How is it that a man, who has so many fans, can so blatantly insult everyone's intelligence and hope to get away with it? I never made an attempt to become a fan of Shyamalan's and now I never will. The only thing I saw of his that I liked was Sixth Sense. It was fun and interesting even though I remember figuring it out before it was half over. I could explain why I failed to like The Village and Lady In the Water but I don't want to bore anyone, including myself. Although I can tell you why I was excited by Lady In the Water. Simply, the first trailer with Josh Groban singing beautifully and the look of a dark, wonderful fairy tale sucked me in only to lead me to a futile, fatal attraction.<br/><br/>For me, seeing The Happening was a weak moment and an effort to forgive.<br/><br/>I cannot blame poor acting because I think the actors all did as they were told. What some may blame on poor acting was instead, in my opinion, a matter of poor, deceitful directing, leading the performers into a belief that they were a part of a great film which would deliver with fantastic editing - and their shallow characters would fit into a grand plan of the great master's philosophy and plan. I feel sorry for all the performers whom I really do admire. It is because of one man's self servitude and shallow vision that many others may suffer. Hopefully I am wrong.<br/><br/>This is not a movie. I went to see a movie and all I got was this stupid philosophy lesson. I get my lessons from life Shammy and I get my kicks from movies. When you decide to get back into the entertainment business, you're going to have to fight real hard to get me into the theater.<br/><br/>The Sham-fan will get their fill but I will not understand why. But the movie fan will find that there is no artistic value to this sham of a flick. In my mind, the reason for this film was lost in the wind. This makes it easier to believe that he gives himself far too much credit for artistic value, which, in fact, in my opinion, has indeed been blown away by the winds which we all know affect us if we let them remove from reach the real reason why we are here.<br/><br/>1/10 if not 0/10"
"sell_out16","1","4","10","13 June 2008"," one of the worst films i've seen!
","Right, where do I begin?! I went and saw Prom Night the other day and left thinking, okay... not enough blood, but at least it brought me back to my teen-thriller watching days, quite nostalgic. However, having seen the trailer for The Happening and the posters, i was ready to watch something that would really scare me.<br/><br/>I could not have been more disappointed. Firstly, in one scene in the show-house you can see the boom sound mic!! and it's not even there for a split second - it's there dangling between the two characters for the majority of the shot. How amateurish! I, too, was so disappointed with the acting, studying acting myself, i was cringing for most of the way through. I've seen a lot better from the 2 leads! Methinks it was due to lack of emotion in the writing, it was very poorly written, again i didn't go 10 minutes without turning to my partner to cringe at a line - usually an attempted joke! Mark Wahlberg was just as bad as Hayden Christiansen in Awake during this film. In the last sequence when he's walking towards his wife, there's no emotion at all on his face, he just looks angry - and its obvious she's got good news as she's standing outside their house waiting for his return, which a massive smile on her face! He looked angry throughout the whole film actually... and hello! If my friends or even people i knew were killing themselves near me, i'd have a lot more to say/ scream/ do than what they were directed to do! absolute rubbish.<br/><br/>I feel like writing to the producers and asking for my money back! It was a bit like Skins (with the trailer is so much better than the actual thing).<br/><br/>At least we were giggling on the way home at how poorly executed everything was; it was all so one dimensional - the acting, the directing, and the writing. Even the editors should have cropped the boom mic out of that scene! Don't waste your money, at least wait until it comes down to 3 GBP in HMV (which shouldn't take that long with this film) and have a laugh with your mates."
"HorrorWriter7493","9","5","14","4 July 2008"," The Happening
","I honestly don't see what everyone's problem is with this movie. It is a well-done thriller that actually sucks you in to the plot instead of crapping out on you. This is a commentary on modern day issues that's presented in an entertaining way. I especially love the fact that the basic message is that we have no control whatsoever over nature and the environment. Nature can take care of itself and it probably has survived more crap than man ever has... or will. I'm willing to bet fifty bucks that this movie will age like fine wine and will be a classic. If you don't get the plot, then it's not the film maker's fault that you have the IQ of wind-up toy monkey. Sorry that there's no graphic sex or strong profanity. Believe it or not, in real life, people wouldn't be thinking about sex or cussing like a sailor (well, maybe, it depends) while everyone's killing themselves. Until then, I suggest you give the movie a chance and see it in an entirely different light."
"CAMKG","9","5","14","28 June 2008"," Are you really qualified to watch this film?
","When I saw this film at the multiplex nearest to my house, I had to ask the a group of people sitting in the row behind me to keep it down twice. They were older teenagers / young adults. The third time I had to tell them that this was not their home theater system. That at least muffled their voices, if it didn't get them to be quiet. The Happening, on the surface, like all of Shyamalan's other films is a film about nothing. He is similar to Hitchcock in the sense that he is very instinctive and has his own signature style of film-making - you can tell that from the tone, dialogue and mood of their films. Hitchcock was fascinated by the various facets of fear and Shyamalan is equally passionate about the human condition. M. Night Shyamalan has very unique sensibilities - at least that is what comes across from his films. His films cannot be pigeonholed into any one genre; thriller, horror, suspense - these are good for the blockbuster near you. It would be equal to classifying Hitchcock's films as suspense thrillers. This is his eighth feature. I have been fortunate to watch all of them with the exception of his first film Praying With Anger - I wonder if its available on DVD. Shyamalan is a true genius, a path breaker who will be hailed as a cinematic great in the years to come. 9/10."
"Absyrd","6","5","14","21 June 2008"," Possibly the best film ever made.
","OK, no, not really, but I hope I grabbed your attention there.<br/><br/>As the cloudy beginning credits rolled, my friends were already scowling at me out of boredom and frustration for having dragged them along with me to watch the film. But that glare turned to immediate fascination as the first suicide took place, satisfying their philistinian mindset. The first 5 minutes are as violent as the film gets, with about 50 on-screen suicides taking place at the same time. Already the media are blaming terrorists, or an occult revelation, or maybe this is a message aimed for the gas company to lower their uncompromising prices? Whatever it is, Mark Wahlberg does not want to partake in it, thus he, his wife, his friend, and his friend's daughter all seek refuge from the city.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the evil predator catches up with them while they're on a train, and decides kill them all. Their endeavor to survive overcomes them, however, and they *literally* run from the invisible threat. When one of them is separated from the cluster (fatality +1), they depend on merely their wits and endurance to survive the predicament. They attempt to seek refuge in abandoned homes, under evil trees, and in the middle of nowhere, but the compulsive predator continues to try and kill them.<br/><br/>That's really all there is to it. And for the first hour or so, it's actually quite chilling revel. But alas, the film descends into forced elemented situations, as it eliminates characters for the sake of abolishing their unwanted existence, and characters abruptly make bizarre, inanely futile decisions, which all lead up to its overtly melodramatic climax which doesn't even hold a twist, possibly its biggest flaw.<br/><br/>But hey, the film eventually turns to brainless drama, but for the most part it withholds a taut atmosphere, and didn't bore me to tears, and that's more than I could ask for with its horrible reputation."
"jakezdups","10","5","14","19 June 2008"," People who don't get Shyamalan's movies are complete idiots
","I saw 'the Happening"" yesterday with great expectation and it definitely did not disappoint. The mistake that people make when they go to see a Shyamalan movie, is that they don't read between the lines. Shyamalan spells out and gives ample clues about the message he wants to get across. This is one of the criticisms I have of his work - the fact that he spells everything out and leaves no room for interpretation like David Lynch for example. Then again, if I read all the negative reviews, people just don't get it, even if he spells it out. So perhaps he is correct in that regard. Shyamalan has a gift. He writes in a way where he captures the attention of viewers with a good story to keep them interested. Once again, people look at the story literally. It has deeper meaning people!!! The Happening is about the effect arrogant human beings have on the planet. Everyone is just living for himself and his/her family. When the movie starts, you see white clouds and blue skies, but it soon turns dark and stormy. Shyamalan is already giving a clue about pollution. People are affected by a neurotoxin secreted by plants whereafter they commit suicide. This means that by not looking after the planet, plants, animals we are indirectly killing ourselves. A congregation of people together have a very detrimental effect on the planet. That's why only bigger groups of people are affected. You will also find that only adults are affected by this neurotoxin. The children are murdered (in one scene two boys are shot, a crippled girl at the mercy of killers in a storybook. By this shyamalan means that our generation is not preserving for our children. they won't have a future if we keep destroying the planet. ""Don't take her hand if you don't mean it."" In one scene Elliot talks to a plastic plant. He says that the plant should not worry because they are just there to use the toilet. Exactly the effect humans have on the planet. We destroy, pollute and don't preserve. Shyamalan plays with colours, like yellow (bees, honey, schoolbus) which portrays happiness. Also purple meaning ""horny"". Hereby Shyamalan illustrates that people are overpopulating the planet. We are just too many. But we seem oblivious to that fact, hence the ending where she gets pregnant and they are very happy. Anyway... I am not going to spell out everything. Go watch this movie. Shyamalans gives clues about plastic model houses versus a house with an old lady that has no electricity or vehicles. She has a bell for her dog to use - A golden retriever (guide dog). In other words, she treats animals as equals. She is alone in speaking out towards the human race taking what is rightfully hers as well. Everyone has the right to clean air and a future on this planet. Look for clues... in one scene a guy commits suicide by letting himself get run over by a lawnmower. What an excellent scene. By killing plants you kill yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!! Go see it!!! Shyamalan is a Saint."

Was this really the worst movie you have ever seen? As far as 2008 films go, there is no way The Happening is worse than say Vantage Point; yet, everyone seems to think otherwise.<br/><br/>The Happening was charming and entertaining and that's good enough for me. Furthermore, I like to think of myself as somewhat of a critical film connoisseur and even I recognize that a film's sole purpose is to entertain us. Seriously, has everyone forgotten as to why it's called the ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY? Films are not suppose to change your life; they're suppose to invoke fleeting moments of emotion like any other piece of art. So, do us all the favor and step off your pedestal of pompousness; in fact, I challenge everyone who is tearing this film apart to make a better one. Oh yeah you can't because you lack vision, talent, and funding.<br/><br/>Secondly, another absurd pattern I have noticed regarding the reviews is the notion a far-fetched premise. Really? Was the premise of The Happening any more unrealistic than say... seeing dead people!!?

","""The Sixth Sense"" established M. Night Shymalan as a director with great potential. The unfortunate thing is that ""The Sixth Sense"" was made more than ten years ago. Since then, the quality of Shymalan's work seems to have been in steady decline - a trend that is powerfully in evidence with ""The Happening"" - probably the weakest movie Shymalan has been responsible for (at least of those I've seen.)<br/><br/>""The Happening"" revolves around some sort of plague that begins to afflict the northeastern United States. The plague seems to drive people mad, eventually causing them to commit suicide. Believed at first to be a terrorist attack on New York City, as it spreads it clearly becomes a natural disaster. Shymalan does a reasonably effective job here of creating a mystery. The plague is certainly frightening and there's no real sense of how it can be avoided. There's no sound explanation of its origins given, except that it has something to do with trees and other plants. Mystery aside, though, this is very disappointing. It begins with what I felt was a sense of unreality - I just didn't buy any of it from the start. It ends with a ridiculous account of the time frame - ""the event"" says a TV news reporter ""began at 8:33 am and ended at 9:27 am the next day."" What? How can you pinpoint to the exact minute the beginning and ending of a plague!<br/><br/>None of the characters portrayed in this were especially well developed, and none were especially interesting in all honesty. The already uninteresting characters were made even less interesting by lifeless performances from leads Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, who seemed to put little effort into this and showed little passion for their work right from the start. <br/><br/>Shymalan's sad downward spiral definitely continues with this one!"
"Buddy-51","5","3","7","16 February 2009"," ain't much happening here
","End-of-the-world scenarios have become such a cottage industry in recent years that M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that's already begun winding down. In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides. The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills. Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, ""The Happening"" ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with. It also doesn't help that ""The Happening"" feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it (""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""Cloverfield,"" the ""28 Day"" series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny ""The Signal"" (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).<br/><br/>As seems to be the case with Shyamalan's most recent output, one winds up admiring ""The Happening"" much more than one likes it."

However, the script is possibly the worst I've ever been unfortunate enough to witness. The dialogue consistently forces you to laugh and cringe at the same time. Then it manages to end in a way that made us scream in agony at it's stupidity. This isn't a low budget film that is so bad that it's good.

","'You bastard, Shyamalan' I said, leaning back into my seat in the cinema when the film concluded. Months later, I said the same thing as I violently threw the DVD case into the returns slot at my local Blockbuster store; a friend and I had re-hired it as a joke after seeing it at the cinema- we spent two hours hurling outraged profanity at the TV screen. This is not a joke; this movie is so astonishingly bad, it's hard to imagine how the script got the green light of approval to begin with! Thanks M Night Shyamalan. Way to take a great concept- people inexplicably killing themselves- and utterly destroy it. Terrible acting, cringe worthy side-gags, amateur cinematography, and the worlds worst plot since.... well, it's probably the worlds worst plot EVER.<br/><br/>Killer trees? Give me nuclear power plants... Give me disease... Give me terrorists... Give me killer bees... Give me any sort of vaguely believable explanation that the audience can just go along with it. But... EVIL TREES?<br/><br/>Shut the hell up Shyamalan, I'm confiscating your pen. Don't you ever put pen to paper and write another movie again, ever. How dare you expect me to sit through that film? On behalf of everyone who's watched your movies, we are TIRED of your 'attempted big twist' type story lines (aka Signs, Lady in the Water), each one more dreadful than the last. You don't have any skill any more- you're all dried up! So shut the hell up.<br/><br/>The actors were unnatural and wooden, the dialog was forced. Mark Wahlberg (RIP his career) plays a cheesy science teacher, with about as much acting skill & dimension as a dry plank of wood. He has a permanent expression of dazed confusion throughout the entire film, which was hard to miss given that there was a pseudo-suspenseful close-up of his head every two minutes while he delivered his barely convincing tone-deaf dialogue.<br/><br/>Zoey Deschanel was disappointing too. She played a pain-in-the-ass girlfriend of Wahlberg, and was constantly staring blankly into the mid distance with wide doe eyes. John Leguizamo appears also, but does little to help carry the film. Around half way through the movie, Wahlberg hammers the final nail into the coffin with a dreadful monologue as he tries to work out what is going on around them. From then on, everything goes from bad to worse (a scene springs to mind wherein Wahlberg has a conversation with a plastic plant). Other reviewers may claim that ""the musical score was brilliant"", but it certainly didn't stand out in any respect.<br/><br/>The producers definitely should have employed some twisted seventeen year old kids to come up with better 'gruesome death scenes', since that's what the audience was expecting. I imagine Shyamalan gets up in the middle of the night to throw up as he regrets filming it so poorly- I know I would. It's shoddy D-grade work that should have bypassed cinemas & gone straight to DVD. Oh, and ""Shame on you Apple"" for unsubtly plugging the iPhone halfway through.<br/><br/>If you hadn't picked it up already from the review, I utterly hated it from 2-minutes in onwards. If I had invested money in this film, I would be kicking the directors door down to get it back.<br/><br/>I doubt I will ever see another Shyamalan film again. Not because I choose to, but because I doubt any company will allow him make another.<br/><br/>Monumental failure.<br/><br/>-1 / 10"
"fwomp","2","3","7","2 November 2008"," M. Night? What The {bleep!} Happened?!
","I have to shamefully admit something here: I'm an M. Night junkie. I love just about everything he's done. Yes, even LADY IN THE WATER, which had a heartfelt message at its core and a great actor (Paul Giamatti) leading the way. And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were ""happening."" Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of ""The Unhappening"").<br/><br/>Let's see where to begin I guess the story is as bad a place as any First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's ""chasing them."" Second problem Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (THE DEPARTED), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (ICE AGE) and Zooey Deschanel (FAILURE TO LAUNCH), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries (""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!"") and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.<br/><br/>The final stone...<br/><br/>I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M. Night has been able to deliver it.<br/><br/>But here, it just ain't ""happening."""

What a simple yet haunting, in not so classical way, and a thought provoking film.<br/><br/>The hidden agenda seems to be of Global Warming and Pollution, well according to me!<br/><br/>At time I was thinking that maybe we humans have polluted the world so much that the trees and the plants were now working extra hard to absorb the the poisonous gases and converting them into Oxygen, that somehow now they were evolving and fighting back!<br/><br/>For the trees or nature to fight back, had kill the cause of all pollution and global warming, the humans!I am sure this was not the premise of the film but I watched with this perspective! Where ever there were a lot of people and cars and traffic and pollution, the trees fought back by releasing poisonous gases!<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film was just so simple and beautifully effective! Amazing!<br/><br/>The music was just awesome!!!<br/><br/>The actors, according to me, performed just the way there were required for a film like this. This was not a typical film and hence required actors to perform in a different manner.<br/><br/>I have read the reviews by other IMDb users and I totally disagree with them about their views on performances. Mark acted very well!!! <br/><br/>The direction, as ever, was simply amazing. I was feeling what the characters were supposed to in the film.

","This movie was basically horse vomit shat on by a cow. How did M. Night Shyamalan write this movie? By picking out papers from a hat entitled ""twists""? It was probably less long to write it then to watch it. At the end of the movie, we were basically at the same point that we were 20 minutes down the line. Watching the last hour was pretty much useless.<br/><br/>It had way too many red herrings. The mood ring, thee bees, the dogs, all of those things lead nowhere.<br/><br/>Also, inappropriate use of comedy. When the army man said ""Oh cheese and crackers"", funny, yes, but it wasn't really appropriate. It was a dramatic scene. If it were in a comedy, then it would've been really hilarious, but in this film it was just misplaced."

I'm fairly fond of this guys movies, forgiving of the flaws but do agree they have gotten progressively worse. That said, Lady in the Water' is The Godfather, Citizen Kane & Annie Hall combined compared to this drek. The story was horrible, the direction was horrible, the script was horrible and the acting was atrocious. I recommend you don't see it. If you do see it, wait till it's on On-Demand.

","I could not believe how bad this movie was. Usually, movies today could make up for shortcomings with massive amounts of blood and gore or fancy special effects. The Happening was awful in every aspect, except maybe that it was in color. The acting was horrible. Mark Wahlberg talked to everyone like they were retarded children, ""What? No!"" All blood and gore was avoided, when the guy got under the lawn mower, you didn't get to see what happened, it just went to another camera. The whole premise of the movie didn't make any sense. Why did people start killing themselves? Characters made obviously stupid decisions, when the guy went to Princeton to see his wife, of course he would die. Incredibly predictable And how did all three of them survive? They went outside and it went straight to the end when everyones alright. Not to mention the news clips all suggested a government conspiracy. This movie wasted an hour and a half of my life. It was awful, I would not show this to poor African children who haven't seen a movie in their life, even they would think it's horrible. Please, for God's sake, do not see this movie."

Every scene is contrived, forced, and uninteresting, and the best part of the movie is over in the first three minutes. The ""mystery"" is revealed immediately, and the rest of the movie seeks to create suspense that just isn't there.<br/><br/>Several of the scenes, including the hot dog conversation, are the most laughable I have ever seen in cinema, including many many ""B"" movies that easily surpass this mess.

"cafesmitty","3","3","7","17 July 2008"," The Crappening
","So this is M Night's first R rated film and it's much ado about nothing. I normally like his films, The Sixth Sense, Signs, and even Unbreakable, but for me, his last three movies (The Village, Lady in Water and now the Happening) have been HUGE disappointments. In this film you follow along with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel as an unknown virus is striking the US. No one knows what it is and after awhile, you will not care what it is. This movie is so slow and boring and all it does is pose. I swear I thought I was in a staring contest and lost after 2 hours. A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. M Night doesn't bring the audience in along for the ride. It feels as if its one of those movie that we are suppose to marvel in his brilliant use of subtlety, but its all subtleness. You sit through it and it just feels so pretentious that you feel like eating your own arms just for something to do. It is a one note film. It is the bad karaoke of film making and for his first ""R"" rated film, it is completely devoid of danger, excitement, of fear. He basically told a story that has no beginning, no end, just a middle and when you find out the possible cause of The Crappening.. I mean the Happening you will roll your eyes and question it... i mean really? really? thats it, really? M Night next film better knock it out of the park or people will not go see his films anymore. A suggestion to M Night. How about trying you hand of just directing and leaving the writing to someone else. You are not Alfred Hitchcock because you can't just have suspense without the threat. With going to a film costing more and so many good films this year that DID knock it out of the park, the Happening is such a big let down. And, if you all are like me, you really are pulling for M. Night. But you have to call it like you see it. Nothing happens in the Happening. Sorry."
"svetlastoyanova","1","3","7","7 July 2008"," There is nothing going on there...
","There is nothing happening in that movie. It is not intriguing, it is fascinating, it is not even scary. It is kind of interesting at the beginning when that thing start happening but when it just go on and on without a clear explanation of what is happening and why is happening well...you just go brain-dead.<br/><br/>There are few guesses and theories but nothing concrete so the audience has to guess for themselves what the hell is going on. And the scenes where they are running from the wind on the field are more bizarre than scary. The suspense is ridiculous and does not deliver at all.<br/><br/>As of the actors, don't even get me started. I have always loved Mark Walhberg, but the last time I saw him in a good performance was in Invincible. Here he is as sweet as he could be as a high school teacher but not truthful at all, his performance seems a bit exhausted and his character way undeveloped. His wife in the movie Zooye Deschanel is such a beautiful big blue eyed girl that looks more like the students he is teaching than his wife. She was acting weird from the get going so when that happening happened she just looked like a scared animal out of place. I think that the only reasonable character was John Loguisamo's one, who actually managed to breathe some substance into it.<br/><br/>Anyway all in all I cannot say I enjoyed the movie. I think the idea is actually pretty good one but the execution of it very poor. May be it would have worked better if there was some kind of reason for this to happen or a pattern or any kind of logic that could answer all the questions this movie has raised. M. Night Shyamalan though has the habit of just asking them and leaving us empty-handed as in The Signs and The Village. Actually this movie is like a poorer version of The Signs, with the best bits cut out."

"haseebjawed","2","3","7","6 July 2008"," Omg...
","This is by far the worst attempt made by M. Night. And wasn't this supposed to be his comeback film? Through-out the movie I was waiting for something to happen, for something to make sense, and to be honest, it did not! All that made sense was that something was happening with the winds and people were killing themselves. What was happening? Where did it start? The source? The story behind it? Why MNS made such a movie? Did the plants get angry? These are some questions that remain unanswered.<br/><br/>I agree that there are some movies which let you have multiple opinions about them. Donnie Darko ring any bells? But The Happening was just... nothing! It was more like a slasher movie in which people were killing themselves. Nothing else made sense. Movies which end leaving viewers asking questions is fine, but this is one such movie in which nothing at all is told. Seems like Night has a story, and the facts but he just didn't want to put it on screen. Or maybe even he didn't know what it was all about? I liked his previous attempts, especially The Sixth Sense and maybe even The Village, but this one was a big, big let down.<br/><br/>I just can't believe what happened to Mark Wahlberg. An Oscar nominee for The Departed in such a role is just plain bad. He, as much as I hate to say it, just couldn't act in this one. His acting along with the actress (I forgot her name) and the little girl were just too fake. Although I was wanting to stop the movie, I still was waiting for something to be explained, at least. But nothing is explained, you have no idea what's going on, and all, if nothing, you're told is that this is a natural disaster or a government mess up. That is it! But whatever was happening or whatever is The Happening is kept a secret.<br/><br/>This movie is just plain bad.<br/><br/>Avoid this!"
"Bunuel1976","5","3","7","6 July 2008"," THE HAPPENING (M. Night Shyamalan, 2008) **1/2
","One of my pet peeves has always been when movies have identical names but absolutely nothing else in common with each other; this is just such a case since, back in 1967, Elliot Silverstein had already directed Anthony Quinn and Faye Dunaway in a now-forgotten hippie kidnappers comedy which, incidentally, I’ve caught on Italian TV ages ago.<br/><br/>Typically for M. Night Shyamalan’s recent movies, his latest offering was coolly received by both critics and audiences but I actually thought that, at least for the first hour, it was pretty good. Hell, even Mark Wahlberg gets better with each successive film I see him in – or at least seems more tolerable as a leading man here than in that deplorable PLANET OF THE APES remake from 2001! Like the director’s previous films THE VILLAGE (2004) and, to a lesser extent SIGNS (2002), this one also has an intriguing premise which is, however, marred by an unsatisfying denouement. In any case, the film’s would-be apocalyptic feel and the eventual discovery of its natural aggressor bring to mind equally modest (but vintage and decidedly superior) sci-fi outings like PANIC IN YEAR ZERO and THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (both 1962).<br/><br/>The belatedly introduced ‘redneck granny’ character was hard to take at times and, besides, as often happens to me while watching disaster movies, I break out in giggles every time there is depicted an event of mass hysteria (which come in droves here). One does wonder at this point, though, where Shyamalan’s career might possibly be headed since he has basically been stuck in the same allegorical/apocalyptic fantasy rut for far too long now…"

","That's the whole problem. The opening scenes pull you in from the start. However, there isn't much to back that up. It just keeps on the same vein through the rest of the movie: ""The wind is coming. It's the plants. Run away!!!!"" I don't usually put spoilers in my comments, but I'm not worried about it on this one, because I'm not recommending you spend the money to see it. We sat in the centre of our row in the theatre. The entire row to our left walked out and they weren't all together. I haven't witnessed that before in a movie. It was strange.<br/><br/>The Happening reminded me of The Birds. Nature is attacking man and we don't know why. Instead of crows, it's maples and grass. The cast is okay, really the only one you'll recognize is Wahlberg and that girl that you just know you've seen her somewhere. I've seen him do better in other movies. I read another user comment that compared it to the Twilight Zone. If you're a fan of that, you might like this. He's made the characters realistic, because really, if there was a terrible natural disaster, one mane doesn't stand up and say, ""Let's kick butt"" and every one just blindly follow. Wahlberg is reluctant, but real, if not a very deep character.<br/><br/>It looked good, it started good, it just never really got off the ground. Shyamalan said to go looking for a fun B-movie. Talk about a bait-and-switch. When I'm paying over $10 per person to see it, plus expensive snacks and drinks, I don't want to see a B-movie. Especially when it's dressed up as an ""A"" title. Get with it, Night. I even liked Lady in the Water and The Village. I probably would have been just as disappointed if I'd spent $5 to rent it."

It was a relief to find that a new director had created a refreshing style of story telling which established his signature in that craft. Unfortunately like many others, I have noticed that there has been an increasing lack of quality in the movies that were released one after another following his debut movie. The happening was no exception, for the most part it was reduced to the very bare minimum of film cinema if not less.<br/><br/>The very first thirty minutes did a decent job with establishing what the premise of the story was and as the movie progressed, unfortunately the story, characters and turning points did not.<br/><br/>I was watching the movie anticipating that the main characters would undergo a more devastating scenario in each new environment they had come across on as well as seeing their personal struggle to survive the epidemic. The movie instead just continued to drag on inviting new characters that died moments later and had no relevance to the story. The cause of the epidemic was even less logical by hiding it with theories that made no sense and eventually had no explanation by the time the movie ended. It pretty much just happened.<br/><br/>So what happened to the happening....absolutely NOTHING."

The trailer for Shymalan's newest movie The Happening looked very promising. The plot of an unknown force making people kill themselves is a very interesting concept. Mark Wahlberg would seem like a good fit to cast as a main character. Unfortunately The Happening is not Shymalan's comeback like many had hoped. It has very poor direction and script. The acting was frankly, terrible and the viewer had no reason to care for any of the characters. The suicidal scenes were cool and were used quite well. However the plot fell short and the menace was not very scary once we found out the source. The whole environment is the source of the toxins is a good idea in theory but poorly used. The ending was good and would have been great if the movie had taken a different direction but alas it wasn't. This could be the end of M. Night's career."

Now, do not get me wrong, the story was good, I thought the concept had something behind it (once you learn what the concept is). The story was just ruined by the terrible acting and dialog.

","People love to rip Shyamalan's films to pieces, though the only bore-fest he made, is hailed as his masterpiece. Well, I enjoy Mighty Nighty's apparent schlock. He always has something meaningful to say about everyday life and this time it apparently was...be nice to..plants(?) and in extension of that message, respect mother earth. (I was hoping of a shot of a crying Indian...sorry native-American to conclude the film) <br/><br/>Yes granted the premise what incredible or incredulous - take your pick- of all plant life giving off pheromones to entice us to seek our own graphic and painful demise, (Some science for you; the actual pheromone featured in the film, is the organic equivalent of the electronic impulse your TV generates when the new Ron Moore's Battle Star Gallactica is on.) Once again, Shyamalan writes a strange screenplay. It is not bad, it of course does not reflect how real people communicate; the script and drama are stylized according to the major conflict that has bearing on all that takes place and Shyamalan tries make us think about human nature. In his old movies, he did this with broad dramatic strokes and clearly definable moments of dramatic importance. In ""Lady in the water"" and again in ""the Happening"" the drama becomes smaller, not breaking beyond the characters, it's all recognizable drama, not towering with great bravado of human existence like ""Unbreakable."" <br/><br/>There is of course one major flaw, the movie creeps on and on, never revealing enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, the actual threat is a swiftly divulged mystery and there's no ""Holy Macaroni"" plot-twist, but lot's of gory deaths kept me interested.<br/><br/>As for the acting; In a world where Russell Crowe gets nominated for an Oscar, I can live with a bland Marky-Mark playing the blandest of all high-school teachers (save for math-teachers); a quirky biology teacher.<br/><br/>So Granted yes, ""The Happening"" is the least happening film in Shyamalan's current oeuvre, but it isn't bad. It fairly thrilling and it has some nice characters.<br/><br/>And France was next of Mother's earth list of retribution! So that's a perfect ending."

I have loved all of Shamalans previous movies so this one's stupidness shocked me and led me to believe that it was truly directed by Al Gore. It has a bizarre message that plants are going to kill people because we are harming them. I will not mention the holes and plot errors in this movie because it would take up this page.

","I have a problem when people excuse a boring film by saying it has a noble message or its subject matter is admirable. This all well and good but at the end of the day a movie should engage and be entertaining (not necessarily 'entertainment'). The Happening does neither. Not only that but on this example you can also throw in big bucks and high salaries. For all those reasons I do not apologise for any punches thrown at this farce of a film.<br/><br/>This film is tensionless and flat. In fact it is downright awful and feels like a bad daytime TV movie you'd find on the Sci-fi channel. The acting 'style' made everyone seem like they were retarded. I don't by the 'that was the point' argument. At the theatre where I saw the film it induced laughter from a perplexed audience. Totally perplexed. I felt no connection with any character and they bit players were so bad they felt like they were cast straight from the crew.<br/><br/>Usually Shyamalan has some inventive camera blocking. This film felt like it was made by a recent film school graduate. There was no cinema craft on display here, camera choices were poor and did not serve the 'drama'. This would be laughable even from an amateur filmmaker, not to mention from the man who gave us The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>I was very angry I had spent my hard earned money on this crap. I used to be a huge Shyamalan fan. I forgave his one hiccup before this (Lady in the Water) by putting it down to ""an off day"" for M Night. However after this I'm not so sure anymore. This is strike two in my book. For many it's strike 3 after The Village. And for others still, it's strike 4 or 5! Perhaps on reflection I'm being too optimistic! ."

It is as if the Shyamalan himself was a victim of the plant kingdom's 'virus' and gone into self-destruct mode.<br/><br/>I don't think any of the actor's performance could be faulted. The storyline was in shambles. But Shyamalan's produced great stuff before and an apologetic rebuttal is that it was all intentional and that the storyline was mean to be irrelevant. It's stretching it, but too often when watching 'The Happening', you feel the need to defend and explain the movie. <br/><br/>That said, the movie, while frustrating keeps you interested in the sadistic sense: it's intriguing seeing people kill themselves for no apparent reason."

","There was real genius in M Night Shyamalan's first films Unbreakable & The Sixth Sense & Signs. These were all good films. They were entertaining, meaningful, and sometimes scary as hell, most importantly they explored the emotions & psyche of the characters. Then there came The Village which was a such disappointment to me, and Lady in the water which continued the downward fall. Those two films is where we see the chinks in the armor. Now we have The Happening, which looks like Shyamalan's biggest dud yet. <br/><br/>I at least understand what Shyamalan was getting at here. Like all his films there is a great Twilight Zone feel & tone which is both mysterious & eerie. He's also trying to make a meaningful statement about Global warming, Pollution, the green house effect, and society's overwhelming anxiety mass fear & paranoia in a post 9/11 world. Then the shock effect of seeing mass suicides, people seem to degrade mentally into mindless zombies then killing themselves. He does try to explain the phenomena, he does have a few points that this is an act of nature and science can only give theories about THE HAPPENING, there for the event may never truly be explained.<br/><br/>But really the film's attempts to be scary and comical are just so vain, and for a few stretches of the movie we borderline boredom. Problem was that the film started out with a bang and the suspense wasn't built up like in many of Shyamalan's films. The suspense wasn't there, when the Happening arrives we feel nothing, we aren't even sure what the hell's going on. The film was more confusing then it was scary. There isn't any reasonable nor scientific logic to why these people would kill themselves in such elaborate ways, as shocking as they are they don't make sense, why are they finding such clever ways of killing themselves? The suicides range from chilling to just over the top & funny. I mean some of the suicides were just comical. I think the idea he tried to put out was clever and somewhat original, but the execution is terrible. Don't get me started with the acting. Mark Wahlberg for most of the film has this ""Deer caught in the headlights"" look in his eyes, and his delivery of some of his lines made you wanna sigh. Zooey Daschel was equally misguided, there wasn't much chemistry between her & Whalberg in fact she was kinda annoying. When ever they say something meant to be funny we laugh at them not with them, just because of how stupid an awkward their lines were. Everyone in this film just seemed awkward, misguided and really just over the top.<br/><br/>In conclusion this wasn't entirely a bad idea but really the execution is the main problem. Bad acting, Poor dialouge, poorly developed story, lack of suspense, this movie was plain boring. I don't think this is the end for Mr. Shyamalan, but he really needs to get his head together, and remember what he did that originally got him where he is."

Not to mention, a few college students sitting in front of me thought they were watching a comedy, laughing loudly each time a scene showed people killing themselves. The cinematography by Tag Fujimoto was awful, to say the least. The acting was pathetic with no sense of fear or anxiety.

I love Signs, Unbreakable etc. This was his big chance after 'Lady in the Water' (which cost $140 Million, and brought in a huge profit of -$74 million..yes MINUS..) He needed this to claw back his fanbase, but with this film he might as well have turned on his lawn-mower and lay down in front of it. I think this will be the end of him. <br/><br/>There was such a build up to this film, and I feel betrayed, stabbed in the back!<br/><br/>He was right though, Shamylan promised that I'd be walking out of the cinema shaking Alas, I was.. <br/><br/>my head."

"danielcox87","5","3","7","19 June 2008"," Undeserving of the critical slamming it has received, but definitely not Shyamalan at his best.
","I've read and heard several comments, now, suggesting that we should stop expecting a bomb-shell of a twist from M. Night Shyamalan's work and just enjoy his films for what they are. Of course I agree that, as a talented director and writer, he should be allowed to make films which don't necessarily leave our heads reeling come the conclusion. However, the fact is that his best films (The Sixth Sense/ Signs) incorporate huge twists and turns, and without them his work seems somewhat devoid of a climax. <br/><br/>In The Happening, Night has opted out of recreating his twist-focused plot, throwing us straight into the events, or incidents, of the film's narrative. Not necessarily a bad move, but for it to work his characters would have to be well developed, and this is unfortunately not the case in his latest picture. The acting is fine. It's nothing special, but the actors' talents are mostly put to waste, as the characterisation seems stunted and, in some places, forced. I personally didn't feel very attached to the characters. I didn't necessarily want them to cop it, but I wasn't that bothered if they did. <br/><br/>However, even though I felt the characters lacked any real substance, Night deals with suspense very well for the most part, often reminding you of the best scares of his previous films. He also incorporates humour subtly and effectively, giving a sense of humanity to the piece, particularly in one scene involving Wahlberg and a plant.<br/><br/>I would never steer anyone away from watching an M. Night Shyamalan film (at least none that he's done so far), but I left the cinema ultimately feeling disappointed that the film did not reach my expectations. Shyamalan is a fine director, but this attempt fails to show his fullest talents because, unlike The Sixth Sense and Signs, which linger in your mind long after viewing, after The Happening, it's easy to forget it ever happened."
"tlc-88","3","3","7","18 June 2008"," Is this a comedy?
","I have no previous opinion about M Night because it had been so long since I saw one of his movies I had completely forgotten them. I had heard friends say some of his movies were pretty bad.<br/><br/>I saw previews for this a thought it was going to be a good thriller or scary or something. Instead, I laughed the whole way through it and so did everyone else in the theater. I don't even think some of it was laughing because it was funny but just laughing at themselves for wasting their time and money on such a ridiculous movie. I seriously thought the previews were a joke. They said, ""here is a scary movie!"" and when I went to watch it I saw a comedy. There's nothing scary or even suspenseful about it! I did give it 3 stars just because I thought it didn't make a terrible comedy. Otherwise, I would have given it one or none.<br/><br/>Also, they don't tell you so much. In every scene in the parks where tons of people are being killed there is one person who is just watching it all. Why isn't this person being effected?!? And why aren't the people who are still alive not a tad bit upset that all of their friends and family are dead??? And the little girl, she cries in one scene, just ONE! Her parents are both dead and she is hardly upset.<br/><br/>So, all in all, I came out of this movie laughing. Laughing because it was humorous, laughing because this movie was so terrible, laughing because I wasted my time and money to come see it, and laughing because I thought someone had just played a prank on me or something because that couldn't have possibly been the movie I was hoping to see.<br/><br/>Can we just erase this movie from history and let M Night try again?"
"rustygrizwaldcfo","3","3","7","18 June 2008"," Lots of suspense but weak plot....did I mention the plot?
","The Good: The movies ""style"" was great. The filming techniques were very M Night-esk. I'll admit that my hands were over my face for a few of the scenes (due to the suspense). That is the only reason I gave it a 3.<br/><br/>As for the other 7 stars........<br/><br/>The Bad: I was embarrassed for Mark Wahlberg and his acting in this particular movie (and I like Mark Wahlberg). I think Shyamalan must have told him to act like an actor who's trying to act like they are in a small independent film for the first time. <br/><br/>I was so hoping that the ""plant"" theory was NOT going to be the real cause of people dying. I told myself, ""no, don't judge the movie yet, it's not over. I'm sure M Night has something up his sleeve"". Unfortunately he didn't have anything up his sleeve and went with the, ""People are killing the planet, people are bad, plants are tired of being taken advantage of so now the plants kill the people (but just in the north eastern United State for now)"". <br/><br/>The Ugly: Plant's get mad (check) Plant's communicate with each other (check) Plants quickly evolve to give off poison that only affects humans and NOT animals (check)<br/><br/>Plants now have the ability to create huge wind storms (at will) so they can disperse poison's into the air when groups of 5 or more people are around (che......? Wait a minute.....what the hell did he just say)? <br/><br/>Don't believe me, then go waste $9.00 at the movie theater for yourself like I did. Or better yet, wait till you can rent it for $3.00 and use the $6.00 you saved to buy a cheap bottle of vodka, but make sure you drink the said bottle before you watch the movie. <br/><br/>I'm mad at myself for seeing it."

","Poor Shyamalan hasn't had a break in a long time. The novelty in his quirky scriptwriting/direction skills wore off many moons ago and his career took a direct hit with Lady in the Water. But The Happening isn't Lady in the Water. Heck, it's not even The Village, thankfully. Shyamalan has taken this movie straight back to when his films worked. But two consecutive critically panned movies later, would Shyamalan go for the home run? The trailer would have you think that.<br/><br/>Like Signs, we find out what's ""Happening"" pretty quick throughout the north-eastern U.S. as another doomsday scenario is dealt with. And continuing off of Signs, the science fiction is mostly brushed aside to deal with characters and conflict. But these batch of characters are mostly lame ducks, with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel not at their best by a long shot. The script is questionable at best and the overall premise for drama and tension (""Run from the wind!"") for the film is, again, lame. The film is not bad, but it's not great either. I think the novelty of Shyamalan films have worn off as a whole, but at least if this film is an indication, he has returned to form somewhat."

","Tonight i went to see it, i went in with an open mind, not sure what to expect for the ""killing machine"" to be(after seeing the theatrical trailer). All i ask is...how can a film go from OK to almost so bad you want to walk out, and this is only 10 minutes after it had started. i sat through it and my god i wish i didn't. It was clearly made by Americans because the first explanation for the things happening was ""terrorists"". The acting was terrible, even Mark Whalberg couldn't raise the film to an alright film-i even thought that at some points he seemed sarcastic in his acting, it felt like a comedy at points, which seems a bit stupid when they director is trying to joke about something as serious as pollution on earth. Not only was the acting and structure of the movie bad, the editing was horrible. At just on the hour mark of the film (when they are inside the life size doll house, Mark Whalberg's character sits down at the dinning table and there is a microphone visibly showing above his head, which made most of the cinema laugh with embarrassment of the film(know one seems to have mentioned this) . By the end of the film they seem so desperate to keep the film going that they add pointless minutes of nothingness. I would however like to add a thought on the message of the movie, which was that the Earth was naturally killing humans because of the pollution it was causing to the planet. And as it says in the film it was just in the North-East at the time, and it said before that the area had 15 nuclear power plants alone in that area. This film was a huge disappointment for and i would distress to everyone not to think about going to see it. <br/><br/>Pros:Well thought out, clever ideas, made you think that this event could actually happen-subtle messages to make people think about saving the environment) Cons:Bad editing,INCREDIBLY bad acting. unfortunately these 2 factors hugely overcome the film from on the brink on fantastic to damn right awful <br/><br/>This is my first review, so if you could give feedback it would be much appreciated."

Upon ten minutes of watching, The Happening became utterly and shockingly bad.<br/><br/>I give M. Night credit for coming up with some redeeming ideas in the Hollywood world. He delivers tolerable plots that often turn out to have semi-interesting twists. The Village, for example, turned out the way I never would have expected- which is what caused such disappointment with this movie. I expected The Happening to have SOMETHING HAPPEN. Killer toxins in the air caused by plants. Does this plot have undertones of global warming messages? Should we start conserving our planet in case our planet starts to kill us? The next time we are running from wind is it best to take refuge in the home of a menopausal woman? This movie could have been brilliant. Key word: could have. The supposed message of earth awareness could have been delivered much better. The acting was horrendous and a re-cast is in order. Finally, research on the actual behavior of plants is necessary. Oh and a new director too.<br/><br/>If the message of this movie is noting to be aware of our planet, a Geico commercial would have had better effect on me."

At least if that ""something"" came with a twist, but noooo!

This movie doesn't do either- not for one nanosecond. And so- to say that M.

Now I'm not much of a Mark E Mark fan but I loved the fact that no one in the story is perfect and that everyone is just along for the ride in Natures destructive path. Was completely fascinating. I also thought that it was a nice touch to display our arrogance when dismissing the ""Plant toxin"" theory. I'm glad to say that I haven't seen a single M. Night movie that was disappointing. Even the village was brilliant though people seem to hate it. So if your looking at reviews to decide whether or not to go see this movie remember this. Everyone is different and critics make a living criticizing other peoples work. While real artists slave away to create something they just sit on their High chairs waiting to just cut someone down. Why not let the audience make up its own mind. That and also think of this, they are not you.

If there's one cardinal rule of a so-called ""thriller,"" it's that you have to give the audience a satisfying answer to resolve the conflict of the film. Creepy ""happenings"" without a sole explanation or reason behind them are only scary when they're meaningful. This meaningless piece of crap of a movie doesn't even TRY to explain itself. I want my two hours of my life back, but since I can't have it, the least I can do is warn the rest of you: stay away from ""The Happening"" and engage in a more enjoyable activity, such as gouging your eyes out."
"FuKkEVEINKOSTNER","10","4","11","16 June 2008"," What's happening? Go kill yourself!
","Many of you so-called-critics have voiced your opinions of the Happening, declaring it to be an outright disaster. Many of you have obviously lost your sense of humor, wasting away day to day in your cubicles at your nine to five day job that you've had for twenty years to pay of your overdue loans to some fifth rate film school. You obviously have no foundation to stand on when criticizing this man for creating gone of the funniest films of our generation. Everyone who has denounced this film simply cannot understand the concept of irony. What all of you dimwits don't realize is, that like Barack O'Bama, M. Night Shyamalan is a dreamer. With this brilliant canvas, he has painted a world where we can all get together and finally share a hearty laugh at the entire north east killing themselves in the most creative manners. In the same tradition of physical comedy legends The Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and Tom and Jerry; Shyamalan finally brings us the the R-rated physical comedy that everyone has always wanted to see. How many of us have never thought what it would be like if we were at the San Francisco Zoo that fateful day when that kid fed himself to that tiger? Exactly, my point! I was searching for days on the internet trying to see any home videos someone might have caught with their cell phones. When none appeared, I was greatly upset. But after watching Mr. Shyamalan's film I now feel like I have seen that elusive footage. Much like Roger Altman's masterpiece MASH, The Happening has a darker side to it. The plot to this film was so much more than the hour and a half of wacky, unadultered, gruesome suicides I was hoping for, it had a much deeper message. By using images of people committing suicide by jumping out of buildings, he resurrected every image of 9/11 from my subconscious and made me realize that after we win the wars in Afganistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China, and Finland, we will have to fight another enemy... Mother Earth. This is the film that historians will look back upon as being ahead of it's generation, much like Videodrome. With this film I have come to the conclusion that like he suggests in his film Lady in the water, that Shyamalan is a profit. I do not think that the Auteur was far off when he compared this masterpiece to Hitchcock's The Birds. He is one of the true visionaries of this generation of filmmakers and he has portrayed a world where the plants can one day attack us and when that day comes I'll be holding my sides with laughter."

","MNS- incredible actor, director, writer. The premise of the movie was derived from good intentions.<br/><br/>Why would MNS even want to release such a disappointing film. The film took only 44 days to make, and it shows.<br/><br/>Many have applauded the cinematography- you have to be kidding. A few rural shots and the wind blowing the grass and trees, and poorly shot city scenes.<br/><br/>The acting! If this were Mark Walberg's first film, his career would have ended with this movie. Zooey Dechanel seems to be this bubble head walking around like a zombie through most of her scenes. The only plausible acting was by Betty Buckley, though her reclusive character is not believable.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good directors/writers, but, like many as their careers started off heading in the right direction they ultimately fail along the way.<br/><br/>One of the all time worst films ever experienced."
"rafaelvargasvieira","2","4","11","16 June 2008"," No words to describe what Happened.
","First of all, i usually don't do reviews and i really like all M. Night's movies, i think he has improved a lot as a storyteller and a writer since his first one. So this is a review worth reading.<br/><br/>Marky Mark a science teacher. It is as bad as it sounds. I like some of the things Mark Walberg did in the past, just so you understand i do not hate his curriculum or the things he does, but i have no words to describe the lack of the craft's knowledge in this. He doesn't act. It's like he accepted to do the movie without reading the script and gave a quick look before every scene. His work in thsi is an Abomination.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschannel. I love her. Her character in the movie sucks and she does what she can with the material.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschannel + Mark Walberg = no quimistry at all. It's like watching a marriage with no love at all between a lesbian and a gay man.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo's character just like the others is mediocre. Again, he does what he can. I don't know if it's the script's fault but it seems his character is in love with Wahlberg's.<br/><br/>I left M. Night for last on purpose. I liked all the movies he has made so far, even Lady in the water which has been bashed by al ot of people. Everyone expects from him a next ""Sixth Sense"" every time a movie is released, or at least a twist. I think he is a great film maker. I think this movie is one of the worst things i have ever seen, not only in a matter of cinema, but man-made things. If people start killing themselves it will be because of this movie. The script was written in a day without revision. If this movie was an episode of Masters of Horror it would be a bad one. I simply cannot believe M. Night looking at the final cut in the editing room and saying: ""Wow, that was good! Scarry! I am proud of this work!"". In fact, if he has any brains at all he tryed to stop the release: ""Ok, thats not at all what i had in mind. You know when you have an idea that sounds good, but when you do it, it just suck? That's what that was. Let me think for a second. Can we re-shoot some of this? maybe replacing Mark Wahlberg? yah, he was bad but he was not the reason this is sucking so much."" I read somewhere that this is the type of movie that kills carrears. I hope not, but i agree with that statement. This movie will not scare you, will not make you think and it won't get you horny. So is it worth watching?"
"djvale","1","4","11","16 June 2008"," Worst. Movie. Of. The. Millennium...
","This may contain a spoiler, but in all honesty, you don't even want to bother with this film.<br/><br/>After the last dismal outing from Shyamalan, ""Lady In The Water"", I honestly thought that he would pull out the stops for ""The Happening"", return to what he's good at, rather than be a jack of all trades. I wanted to love this film so much, its just such a cruel twist of fate why I even left the house to watch this film.<br/><br/>The build up to this was incredible, so much lying on this film and on Shyamalan's shoulders. In an interview somewhere on youtube.com - he exclusively said that ""The Happening"" was going to be his darkest, scariest and most paranoid film he has ever made. He wanted to take disturbing images and influences from what he thought was the scariest film of his generation, ""The Exorcist"", and utilise similar themes into ""The Happening"". What a crock of BS.<br/><br/>What Shyamalan gives us, is a half arsed, lazy script, with awful dialogue, and some of the worst acting I have EVER seen. Even the films story is crap. Deadly ""suicidal"" toxins released from plant life because they have had enough of human life polluting their atmosphere?? Give me a break Shya, even you couldn't come up with god awful plot like this, oh wait, you DID! Mark Wahlberg gives the worst performance in cinema history since Nicolas Cage decided to play dumb in ""The Wicker Man"" (and I actually think that the ""Wicker Man"" was better - thats how bad this film is). The supporting cast are just as bad, and there are so many moments of cheese. The worst is probably the scene where Wahlberg and the gang stumble across a desolate looking house, and he starts singing to the inhabitants inside. Then a slow mo coincides with a young lad getting his head blown to bits with a shotgun: ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooo!""<br/><br/>How god damn lame. The one thing in this film that makes it have at least ONE star out of 10, is the fact that Betty Buckley, who plays the creepy Mrs. Jones, actually makes you feel abit uncomfortable for the duration of the film she is in. So thats 15 minutes or so. In fact - if she had been the problem of this film - IE: the source of the ""happening"", then I would have actually liked this movies outcome. But she just becomes another victim.<br/><br/>My mate sitting next to me kept saying ""I wonder what the twist will be?"" To which my response was something like, ""The twist is that the cinema screen will break down because this is so bad."" Or words to that extent anyway. My other best mate kept looking at his watch before the halfway mark as he had lost interest completely.<br/><br/>Shyamalan - I've lost hope in you now. Maybe you were a one hit wonder after all. People giving this film generous votes (IE: anything above 2 stars) - really need to watch this film again - because I want to see your facial expression as you walk out of the cinema, knowing that you really have witnessed, possibly, one of the worst films of the new millennium."
"JaxSnyder","1","4","11","16 June 2008"," A huge disappointment and a great laugh!
","This movie went straight to my top three of worst movies ever. Really, my friends said that it was great, like the Sixth Sense and Signs and I'm afraid it's nothing like them! Nothing! I can't stress this enough! The movie started off badly and went progressively worse from there... It's like a showcase of what you must NEVER do in a movie. The casting was a disaster - Zooey Deschanel kept opening her eyes so wide I thought they'd pop out at some point, that's pretty much all she did throughout the whole movie now that I think about it; Mark Wahlberg was incredibly unconvincing as the man in charge, a huge disappointment and all the acting was rather forced, and I don't understand why... Other than that, the plot was missing for the most part, there were way too many distracting characters - people who have nothing to do with the plot (like Joey, then the weird old lady - she was way too strong a character! and then again - what about the slap at the table or the doll??? why, oh why????, then the daddy of the little girl (bad acting there again), the dialogue was terrible, there were too many unexplained and underdeveloped things - the men in the shack who shot the two boys?!?! Now why on earth did we need that? or the silly mood ring? it didn't bring any depth to those two-dimensional characters if that was the idea, just completely useless, seems like Shyamalan relied too much on the ""some things cannot be explained,"" and this is just weak! I started laughing some time around the short phone movie with the lions, then couldn't stop till the end... It's just too funny that movie, really, if nothing else... But that's not the point, right? And the open ending with France is just too trite, I'd expect more of Shyamalan, can't believe he came up with something so weak and unfinished like The Happening... Shame on you, Shyamalan, shame on you!"
"amy-707","7","4","11","15 June 2008"," Where MNS is Failing
","In my opinion, The Happening was not as horrible as I've read from others... it had good points and bad points. The acting leaves a little to be desired and it's hard to believe better performances couldn't be mustered up by the cast. The writing seemed a bit ""off"" at times... with moments of feeling forced. Some of it gets quite campy.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie, and the overall story being told were decent. There are some ""signature"" MSN moments (which I won't reveal, but if you're a fan you'll recognize them). MSN does a good job with suspense and building tension, and interestingly inserted comic relief that keeps the story moving along. There's even an interesting cameo... and depending on your own interpretation, it seems to either pay homage to or flip the bird at another well-known director.<br/><br/>I can understand that MSN may not want to have a ""twist"" at the end of every movie... but where he has failed most dramatically in this recent effort is that the build up doesn't provide the expected payoff. What has made him such a good story-teller in the past is what is missing from The Happening. His movies are usually well organized puzzles where the pieces all fit together at the end revealing the bigger picture... but with The Happening, we are left with too many missing pieces to feel fulfilled over what the bigger picture is supposed to reveal.<br/><br/>I wanted to give this movie a higher score, but because of the things I've mentioned above, I can't. I went with a group of four other people, and in our group three of us liked it, one loved it, and one hated it. I was in the group that liked it."

","Here's how bad this movie is: the people in my theater were LAUGHING at the corny dialog. Are you kidding me? In a ""horror"" flick? Not to mention the fact that this movie is nothing more than a commercial for the radical left wing agenda.<br/><br/>Here's another indication how bad this movie is: the boom mike is seen at the top of the screen not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES!!! And you call yourself a professional director? How does this make it past the editing room? This is worse than a high school production.<br/><br/>Here's a small example of the cheesiness of the dialog in this movie. Upon hearing that there are dead bodies all over the road, a young military policeman stands upright and exclaims, ""Cheese and crackers!"" Unbelievable. Did no one during the making of this movie look around and say, ""Wait a second. This is junk. We can't release this crap.""<br/><br/>And for those of you claiming that this was M. Night's F.U. to the critics, I say: B.S. Even if it was an F.U. to the critics, why would you bill it as a legitimate movie and con people into paying real money for it. Why not release it at Sundance or Cannes where people can see if for free and it would get more media attention? Why would you intentionally make a movie this bad if you wanted to showcase your so-called ""talent."" M. Night just committed career suicide.<br/><br/>This movie starts out bad and just gets worse. Not even Marky Mark's furrowed brow can save this unbelievably bad movie. Not since The Blair Witch Project has a movie so underdelivered after being so oversold. There is no coherence to the movie and the storyline just make absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>I can't believe the same guy who made Signs, made this garbage. I've never walked out of a movie, but I came very close on this one. It's that bad. I read a lot of the reviews on IMDb before I went to the movie. I wish I had listened to the ones that criticized the movie. I would have saved myself $7.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell, if you want to be bombarded by the radical environmentalist left-wing agenda in the context of a movie that makes no sense, is horribly acted and has no coherence, then this movie is for you. Otherwise wait until a friend rents it and borrow it from them.<br/><br/>If you do spend the money to go see it in the theater, halfway through the movie, you will wish that the same thing killing all the people in the movie will start seeping through the ventilation system.<br/><br/>Hey M. Night! I want a refund!"
"Sedatedwombat","1","4","11","15 June 2008"," Is This Really 'Happening'?
","For almost any other film, I would go into fairly great detail in describing why a movie is bad. For 'The Happening,' I simply don't want to. This is a film that tries to be the most original, most clever, most groundbreaking piece of work in the history of cinema. I will tell you now it is the EXACT opposite.<br/><br/>From the opening credits, you feel like you're being forced to like the movie. MNS is simply using his previous glory (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) to create a film that he thinks will sell. NO. NO. NO. NO. Trust me, by the end of the movie you will believe that he stole the aforementioned.<br/><br/>MNS's idea of suspense has become completely skewered. He has this lame idea of showing all the people in the world together, suffering in the same struggle. Plain and simple, IT DOES NOT WORK. He tries to make us care about the people, but we just can't!!! And I'm tired of hearing all this BS about ""MNS's first R-Rated film."" That's what MNS is banking on, and that's the only thing that will keep you watching: the deaths---which aren't that great to begin with. Aside from that, the plot is ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC...truly, YOU WILL NOT SEE A WORSE STORY IDEA IN MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS (if not in the history of film).<br/><br/>Then, we have the acting. Good lord, WHAT HAPPENED(no pun intended)??? Somehow, MNS manages to make the MARK WHALBERG look like a complete and total pussy. Zooey D has NO personality whatsoever, and simply acts as an annoying voice of reason. The child actors are HORRENDOUS, and the extras are potentially the worst of all time. The dialog is by far the worst of MNS and arguably the worst of all time.<br/><br/>During the entire movie you will ask yourself, ""is this serious?"" The answer is : yes and no. MNS tries to make the movie harrowing and even heartfelt---but then at the same time comical and quirky. Thus, MNS has gone legitimately INSANE. If you thought 'The Village' or 'Lady in the Water' was bad, just wait until you see this. I thought he really lost his touch when 'The Village' came out, but SOMEHOW they still fund this little punk (MNS) to make movies. At this point, from a producer's perspective, I'd make sure MNS would never make another movie in his life. He deserves to get his ass kicked after making crap cinema like this. Whoever said he was going to be the next STEVEN SPIELBERG should be shot.<br/><br/>I know I've forgotten a lot of what I wanted to say but please DO NOT SEE THIS FILM---IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AND YOU WILL FEEL LIKE A DUMBASS AFTER PAYING TO WATCH IT---THIS IS THE LOWEST OF THE LOW---DON'T BOTHER. If you must see it then please, when you leave this movie, ask for your money back. I say this because you could get that money back, but you will never get the time you wasted back.<br/><br/>Again, there is so much to say about this awful and pathetic excuse for a film, but I can't say it all. Don't see it.<br/><br/>I would give this a star rating, but it does not deserve even NEGATIVE stars. The production company and virtually everyone who played a major role should be sued and shunned, especially MNS---who is on his way to become the next Uwe Boll.<br/><br/>Worst Movie Ever."
"ZildjianDFW","8","4","11","15 June 2008"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I usually try to avoid hearing reviews of movies, fearing that they might influence me and prevent me from seeing a film objectively. I wasn't successful with this one: I heard reviews saying it was terrible, and so on, and I walked into the theater not knowing what to expect, but fearing the worst. Ultimately, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that this film isn't perfect. The acting is often sub-par, the dialogue sometimes ""off"", it felt rushed in a few places, and its ending was a little too ambiguous for my taste (not something I complain about very often). Overall, I felt it was weaker than some of Shyamalan's other films (including ""The Village"", which I felt was very underrated).<br/><br/>That being said, I generally found it enjoyable. I found myself glued to my seat, jumping at the scary moments and laughing at most of its humorous moments. It had Shyamalan's trademark ""feel"", which I liked. I thought it was interesting, original, and thought provoking. Flaws and all, my impression was generally positive.<br/><br/>And it seems I wasn't alone in my theater. No one got up and walked out. A lot of the other people seemed to jump and laugh along with me. The people I went to see the movie with enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Now, there are some people, and will continue to be some people, who are harder on this film than it deserves. Some of these people will probably complain that it was pointless (an opinion, one which I disagree with). Some will focus on the flaws at the expense of the film's positive traits. And still others won't even give it a chance; as sad as it may be, there are some who condemned this movie months before it came out, and I find it hard to believe that these people watched the film objectively.<br/><br/>Criticize Shyamalan all you want (and there is a small circle of devoted Shyamalan haters on this site), but I enjoy his movies, and this one, as imperfect as it may be, is little different."

This movie does not even merit a rental, or watching when it makes it to cable. It is sad that the only funny parts in the movie is when two punk kids try to get tough with a farmer barricaded in his home and he shoots them....not funny, but apparently some people in the audience found a shred of amusement.

Close by construction workers walk off the roof - the end of the world is here, obviously! Or maybe just the beginning of one utterly bad movie...<br/><br/>Frankly, this movie fails on all level possible: the acting is somewhere between high school drama club and cardboard, the cinematography is boring, the score goes from overdone to pointless, etc.<br/><br/>but worst of all the story goes nowhere! Within the first few minutes we get told that 'toxins' are shutting off our self preservation drive (which obviously means that everybody will kill him- or herself asap!), before half the movie is done we know that plants can evolve to use pheromones to attract other species to defend them (which obviously means that plants can make us suicidal, which combined with the 'toxins' bit dooms us all!) and then the heroes walking and run and watch and the wind is blowing (because obviously the wind is controlled by the plants too!) And then suddenly it's all done after 25 hours (not to mention that it was all localized to the Northeast of the US anyways!) only to start 3 months later in France again while in the US scientists are just scratching their heads...<br/><br/>So, obviously plants know state and national borders, they can control the spread of whatever they are oozing, they make battle strategies, and they are royally p**sed... but a cute little girl sitting on a swing bolted into an old maple is cool! <br/><br/>Well, let's face it: the bigger thread than those evil plants is a really bad writer/director with the initials M.N.S.!

It seems like he feels that there is no need to explain anything in his films anymore..and if there is an explanation its something a that a 5 year old would write, not an acclaimed director of the sixth sense.<br/><br/>From this point on I don't go watching M. Night Shyamalan's film expecting to see something good, I just go to find out just how bad it can get.<br/><br/>As far as the movie is concerned the acting is just plain silly. It makes you feel like you are watching a less funny scary movie (if thats even possible). Instead of building up the suspense and fear factor, there are moments which you laugh at how ridiculous the lines and the acting are.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, explanations are not required any more with this director. The story makes no sense and the reason behind everything will make you come out wishing you had seen anything else playing and I mean anything.<br/><br/>Save your money and if you really have to watch this wait till you can rent it on DVD...or even better till its playing on TV so you don't regret paying for that either!"

Surely this will be a career ending film for everyone involved, particularly Shyamalan, whose career has been on a sharp downward spiral ever since the Sixth Sense.

","I'm surprised at all the negative comments because I really enjoyed this cross between a sci-fi thriller and a road movie.<br/><br/>Sure, there's not a lot of CGI, and it probably moves kind of slowly for the multiplex crowd, but there's nothing wrong with that. I found it really refreshing to see a film without explosions or people doing backward somersaults in slow-motion.<br/><br/>The film deals with a largely unspecified menace, and that's the key to understanding it. There's no-one to fight against, there's no chance of heroics, there's no way to react to what you don't know or understand. Instead, the characters actually *grow* and do small, touching things for each other, as you suspect people would when faced with an incomprehensible peril.

","I'm going to start off with the good points of this movie: There have been worse movies made. After watching The Happening, though, i cannot name any of those movies off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Now the bad points: The plot was horrible. It tried so hard to be creative, so hard to spookily realistic, so hard to be so unique that it was just plain stupid. Plan 9 From Outer Space had a better plot than the Happening. The acting was horrible. I've seen better acting in a school play. The ONLY acting in this movie that could be considered decent was when Whalberg's character was being a dick and joking around.<br/><br/>The movie didn't even have strong characters to back up the horrible acting. The only character that I liked was the psycho-plant hippy guy. Elliott was a pansy, and not the good kind like shaggy and scooby. His was wife spent the whole time dragging everyone else down with her bad attitude. The little girl never spoke, was rarely in camera shot, and had no real character to begin with.<br/><br/>The Happening is by far not the worst I've ever seen, but I would never recommend it to anyone.

Night normally has wonderful music in his movies, and this one made me remember the main reason I loved ""SIGNS"". Personally, every movie has to have very good music, because without music, the film would be very... well, ""Dull and lifeless"", and because I absolutely loved the music in the movie, I talk about it first and it really deserves a great applause.<br/><br/>Plot: Okay, honestly, I really enjoyed the plot of this movie. It's the first I've really seen (Now-A-Days) that has to do anything with plants and isn't exactly TOO out there. This is more based on, so called, ""Realistic Intelligence"". Plants and nature do have more abilities then the human mind can understand. Because this goes in a nice world of sci-fi, it makes a really skilled plot and frightening aspect of how we treat nature. I love stories that go way out there, instead of lame war movies, where everyone knows what's gonna happen, and other movies that once again star Adam Sandler. The whole thing with the plants has got me a little tripped out. Plants doing something to make us kill ourselves? Seriously, who couldn't be at least a little curious to see it?

Yes, there's no explanation for what happens (of course not: if something like this did happen, what explanation could we possibly get, and who from? the Delphic Oracle?); yes, the deaths are shocking, though not excessively gory; but it seems to me that the film devotes all its energy to a single-minded paring down of the cast to one small, simple family group, and leaves its single note of hope right there. With stark, spare cinematography and top-notch sound editing, this is one keen little razor of a cautionary tale, with an oh-my-god final sequence."
"rcreekmur","2","4","11","13 June 2008"," A New Low for M. Night Shyamalan and His Actors
","As I was watching ""The Happening"" today I keep wondering to myself: ""Who keeps giving this guy money to make these horrible movies?"" ""Why didn't I keep my promise NEVER to go see another M. Night Shyamalan movie on opening day?"" ""How can anyone make a great actor like Mark Wahlberg look so foolish?"" ""Didn't anyone working on this film actually watch it?"" Shyamalan must have paid his cast and crew a fortune to work on this monstrosity and simply told them up front that he doesn't care what they think, doesn't want to hear any opinions or suggestions and to just keep their mouths shut. After all, he's a great auteur, no? Because Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed this film, I can only assume what I saw today is exactly what he wanted to put on the screen. It is incredibly bad. Most first-year film school students could do a better job of writing dialog and structuring a plot. And someone needs to teach Shyamalan about exposition in a dramatic work. Having characters pop into frame to explain what's going on is NOT good story-telling. And letting them go one for minutes at a time as they explain who they are, how they got there, what they've seen and what they are planning to do next is just plain amateur in the worst way.<br/><br/>I can't even being to enumerate all of the things wrong with this film. But I'm not just being some film snob who expects high art from all of my cinematic experiences. I was in a theater in suburban Milwaukee on a Friday afternoon. It was about half full with people of all ages. I witnessed an elderly couple walk out after about 30 minutes. I heard snickers and moans from the back of the theater. And several times people laughed out loud - not because something amusing occurred on the screen, but because what the character just said or did was so outlandish that all you could do was laugh. Otherwise you would cry.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is not a bad one. It has an ecological overtone that could have been developed into an insightful and thoughtful story. But instead, it basically ends up that the trees and plants are mad at us and want us to kill ourselves. No twists, no intelligent revelations. And absolutely no explanation as to why some people were spared while others succumbed. Even the strangely animated psychotic scientist interviewed on TV at the end of the film fails go give us any sort of sensible or satisfying resolution.<br/><br/>When a movie is this bad, it's very difficult to write a review. Where do you start and what do you reference when everything deserves to be ripped apart? It's no wonder that Shyamalan and the distributor insisted everyone involved with the project be sworn to secrecy. It is now obvious to me that this had nothing to do with the plot or the unique ""twist"" we all expect a Shyamalan movie to have at the end. It was because there is nothing good to say about it and if an actor dared tell people to go see the movie his credibility would be in serious jeopardy. Again, I can only believe Wahlberg got paid more money than he could say ""no"" to - because he is too talented and too intelligent to get involved with this project otherwise.<br/><br/>I'll end my comments with the most memorable, out-of-place and gratuitous lines from the film. The three lead characters are desperate to get out of town and a local plant nursery owner and his wife offer to give them a ride. But first they have to stop by their house to pick up a few things and say goodbye to their plants. At this point, the nursery owner turns and say, ""You like hot dogs? Hotdogs get a bad rap. They got a nice shape, are full of protein..."" Of course this pays off a few minutes later when we see him eating a hot dog before heading off into a field where certain death awaits him and his group of travelers.<br/><br/>What? I want my money and 91 minutes back."

","Well folks,<br/><br/>I don't know exactly how to start talking about The Happening. In fact, I don't even know if I should start writing about something so BAD. However, I guess I'm gonna do it, just to let you know how wrong I was when I thought I'd enjoy it.<br/><br/>I really don't know what is HAPPENING with director M. Night Shayamalan these last years, but he definitely seems to be messing around with audiences or, if not, proving us all how urgently he needs to improve his writing/directing skills. I can recall ""THE VILLAGE"" and ""THE LADY OF THE WATER"" which, in my opinion, were ENTIRELY GARBAGE. And now comes another rubbish masterpiece, with a new ""label"" and nice presentation, but with the same hollow plot as the past ones.<br/><br/>In the beginning, The Happening seemed somehow promising, but in the very next minutes I noticed something wrong about it. The characters were empty, boring, unstyled and raw. Actings were unnatural, theatrical and very, very poor. Filming sequences were also too bad, giving me a perfect feeling of a low budget movie done just to bring easy money from all those out there who normally love a little bit of nonsense mystery or suspense.<br/><br/>Finally, in regards to the story, I think that The Happening is also pretty bad. In fact, I risk myself to say that this movie has no story at all. Shayamalan has just lead us (and probably himself too) to a promising story with no end or pre-thought sequences, resulting in a very random plot with stupid scenes, characters and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>If I had to describe this movie in a very short sentence, I'd say it is BAD, AMATEUR-LIKE and BORING. During the play time I was always hoping to see the credits part, but the movie kept going on to massacre me.
Anyway, now one thing is certain from now on: I won't see another Shayamalan's movie for the next 100 years! That's for sure!"

","Even the Lady in the Water was more interesting and imaginative; though the plot was ludicrous, at least it had a purposeful plot. And fun characters, nice acting, and juicy details. All these are missing from The Happening.<br/><br/>The Happening's story is so transparent that the movie is more of a straight-on horror flick wannabe.<br/><br/>You know things are getting desperate for the filmmaker when actual gory violence is shown throughout the movie (hence the R rating) instead of Night's previous subtle touches, innuendos, and unseen horror.<br/><br/>In fact, the script is so linear and empty that you could go away for half and hour, come back, and not miss a thing. Really! So, for all those who loved Night's smart and interesting stories, you will be very disappointed. The ENTIRE premise of the movie is revealed very early on and you just keep hoping and hoping that there would be something more. (There isn't.)<br/><br/>The Happening also has the worst cop-out of an explanation in the plot's resolution. It is so bad, that you would think that Night simply could not tie it up nicely (well, there is only a single thread), or he really could not be bothered to. A sign of huge disrespect to the audience.<br/><br/>When the credits roll, there will self-loathing on the part of the audience.<br/><br/>My advice - spend your movie money on some nice beer."

","I don't understand the silly hate for this film & i NEVER listen the boring critics that never like anything unless it's like that boring piece of crap ""Citizen Kane"" & i loved M.Night Shyamalan's Creepy Apocalyptic Thriller & it's my favourite of all his movies!!!
I loved Signs & The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable & The Village & Split & i even liked After Earth & The Lady in the Water but i enjoyed his ""The Happening"" most of all.
Now some of the acting from Mark Whailberg is very corny, silly & goofy but hey this is a fun throwback 50's or 70's style B-movie so it's fine in that regard & Whailberg is fun as science teacher Elliot Moore & really does come accross as that very 50's or 70's style smart scientist lead, i liked his character & his easy going nice guy performance, & what is really great about this fun little Thriller is the simple story that is very old school nature vs us, like the paranoid old school films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" & ""The Birds"" & many other fun B-movie survival films of those times.
""The Happening"" is suspenseful & exciting apocalyptic fun & it starts with lots of unexplained suicides & those scenes are very creepy & the amazing beautiful music score by James Newton Howard is hauntingly lovely & affective, this film is full of an atmosphere of dread & fear as our small group of survivors are running from an unseen killer & that's what's really clever is the ""Killer"" of this sci-fi Horror Thriller is deadly toxins released from plants, trees & grass & those toxins infect humans & then theu kill others & themselves, it's actually a terrifying idea & it's executed perfectly by Shyamalan!!!
""The Happening"" is definitely drenched in that 70's paranoia of a collapsing environment like ""Soylent Green"" & ""The Omega Man"" i love those movies & The Happening fits in that genre with them, man vs nature & the fears of our destroyed & polluted environment!!!
What are we doing to our world?
It's all here in the tense Atmosphere.<br/><br/>The cast is solid with Elliott Moore's troubled girlfriend ""Alma Moore"" played by Zooey Deschanel, she comes accross abit weird really & kinda detached but she's ok nothing special here but Elliott's best friend & fellow teacher ""Julian"" played by the always great John Leguizamo is a great character & an intense & panicking performance by John & another standout & very creepy performance is from Veteran actor Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones & she's great in her small but very sinister role!!!<br/><br/>All in all ""The Happening"" is a fun, fast paced & exciting atmospheric paranoid Horror Thriller & one that i can watch over & over again, it's just so entertaining & good fun."

Namely, it shows that if mankind is destroying nature or some of the species that is an integral part of the same nature, and thus humanity consciously pushes itself to perdition.

"sundance128","8","2","4","28 October 2013"," Just my opinion, but....
","So, I will be perfectly frank. I am going to write my review entirely based on how I view movies in general. There are directors that make amazing movie after amazing movie. They've never made a bad movie. I feel the same way about actors and actresses. Then again, there are those who have made great movies, decent movies, and movies they (and probably everyone else as well) wish would just disappear. Some actors make movies based on the story or the message, some do it just for the money and take every movie coming their way. But I also believe some directors sign on to make movies that have the most amazing messages behind them, but the movie just isn't made right, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>That said, I think this movie is one of them. We all know what the movie is about. It's about a science teacher named Eloit Moore, who with his wife, best friend and best friend's daughter, attempt to escape and inexplicable ""natural"" disaster, a neurotoxin that make whomever is exposed to it commit suicide. The film originally begins along the East Coast of the United States and ends at the Louvre Palace in Paris.<br/><br/>There's a scene at the end of the movie where an expert is arguing that the epidemic was only the beginning and is comparing it to a ""Red Tide"". He proclaims that humans have become a threat to the planet and that is why the plants are reacting agressively. Not to go off on what most would call a rant but I agree. THAT is why I liked the movie. I believe not only could this happen in real life, but it has begun to happen, only in different ways. Namely, Hurricane Katrina and the gross mass outbreak of ""natural"" disasters.<br/><br/>It's simple, destroy humanity (which we are well on our way of doing) and the natural world, the environment, will flourish and begin to heal itself once again.<br/><br/>I find it mind-boggling how many people missed the all important message in this film. We are our own worst enemy."

","It would've been O.K. as a made-for-TV movie, but nothing more than that. It's quite cheaply-made and generally unimpressive. The idea behind it is somewhat intriguing, but the execution is seriously poor. Full of plot holes, bad dialogue, and horrendous acting.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg looks very uncomfortable throughout this movie, which renders him unconvincing. Quite clearly, he's not the guy for this role. Zoey Deschanel has never been a good actress, but her ridiculousness has reached a new low in this film. Those scenes where she deals with her phone stalker... I mean, can anyone in the entire film industry be THAT bad (at acting)? It was painful to watch. The supporting characters were, in fact, as bad as the leads.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed by the ending. This is the kind of movie, where you can get away with killing off all the characters. It would've been so much better, and I would've rated the movie higher. But, instead, they chose the 'predictable to the point of disgust' route -- from the minute you start watching, you have no doubt whatsoever as to who exactly is going to die and how the whole thing is going to end.<br/><br/>The script was a disaster. It's so badly-written and obviously fake, every second of the movie you are reminded that you're watching a movie, which makes it very hard to enjoy. Everything they say, sounds forced -- you don't hear this kind of dialogue in real-life. It's very lame and unconvincing.<br/><br/>It isn't quite on the list of THE worst movies I've seen, but it's nevertheless not very good.

","I vowed never again to an M. Night Shyamalan movie after being sorely disappointed in Signs and then hating life after The Village, so I skipped all together Lady in the Water. However, I broke my promise one night: My roommate had this film and I thought, just for a good laugh, I will watch The Happening. And boy did I laugh. Hard. But that was just for the first half of the feature. Towards the middle, it got so incredibly bad, and then worse, I was still in tears, but not from laughing any more. I will keep my promise from here on, I swear. I heard M. Night once compared himself to Hitchcock. That should've been the biggest clue this guy hasn't got one. Hitchcock was never this bad, never were his features as drawn out to the max as M. Night's are, never this unimaginative. Does he seriously think close ups (and there are too many to count in this movie) are scary or suspenseful? Did he seriously tell his cast to cease from acting? Did he seriously write the dialogue? Did he seriously set out to make a serious B-Movie? SPOILER ALERT – Oh, and when you find out the ""secret"" in this one, it generates the biggest laughs – if you're still laughing by that point. The trees talk with the grass who pass the word to the flowers and so forth, to DESTROY ALL HUMANS! Really? Seriously?

"kols","8","2","4","13 August 2012"," Ummm . . .
","Don't know quite how to rate this; wish IMDb had a N/A.<br/><br/>First, most of the audience should have been warned that this is a massively manneristic movie so forget any Hollywood conventions. Nothing wrong with either the acting or the direction.<br/><br/>Second, the movie is about evoking a sense of unrelieved dread in the audience without providing a comfortable denouement to release the tension it builds up. I saw it on FMC; if I'd been in a movie theater I'd have been out of there half-way through precisely because of that tension. Then I would have looked for it on Netflix (they don't have it).<br/><br/>As I watched, two analogs immediately came to mind: John Wyndham's book, The Day of the Triffids (not the movie) and the movie, The Uninvited (1944). The book echoes the movie's sense of increasing isolation in the face of a (initially) inexplicable 'natural' force and the movie (Uninvited) echoed the unrelenting sense of dread and tension (which were relieved). And that's what The Happening is all about, period. It wasn't about the characters (you want bad acting in a manneristic Film, try Kramer vs Kramer or Diary of a Mad Housewife).<br/><br/>The characters in The Happening are there to be watched, observed, not identified with. They were meant to be distanced from the the audience. That's what the pacing was about: basically stopping everything every so often just to send the audience back into the theater, and that's why the characters just seem to pause, foreshadowed by the sudden pauses that presaged the attacks. That's why the characters go suddenly flat periodically and that's why there are no panicking hordes or scenes of urban destruction with fires and sirens. The Hollywood goal of drawing the audience into the movie is turned on its head.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is very spooky movie that, however you feel about it, does what it intends to do And has a nice turn on the ubiquitous Carrie ending: a return to tonic instead of a kick in the groin."

","Right, The Sixth Sense"" was an OK movie – entertaining, had a clever twist in the end but generally overrated. Same goes for ""Unbreakable"": an alright film which would have benefited from a director who's knowledgeable in the field of comic book adaptations (to mind comes Zack Snyder or Christopher Nolan"". There was a reason I didn't walk out on ""Signs"": they were showing it onboard an airplane, during mid-flight.<br/><br/>Then came ""The Village"" which, despite all the harsh critiques it received, still has elements of cinematic magic, making it (similar to Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"") an on screen-fairy tale. ""The Lady in the Water"" shattered all hopes of repeating this magic; it being one of the most pretentiously self-important film I've ever seen – the only film I've ever given one point (just because there is no 0 points on IMDb).<br/><br/>Naturally, I was more than a little suspect when I slid ""The Happening"" into the DVD-player and was not disappointed: I had expected that it would be crap.<br/><br/>What speaks for ""The Happening""? The soundtrack and, if gore is your thing and you're into films like ""Final Destination"" or ""Saw"", a few nasty, imaginative death-scenes.<br/><br/>Otherwise gifted actors, wasted like rotting hay. Dialogues that will make your toes curl and a storyline so hackneyed, it often makes you wonder: ""Is this a joke?"" (It wasn't a particularly funny joke though, since I paid good money to see this film). ""The Happening"" suffers from the same type of cancer that has killed (most) of above mentioned films, and the name of the cancer is M. Night Shyamalan. Perhaps the director would have turned out a half-decent filmmaker one day, had he not been poisoned by believing his own hype. Perhaps we shouldn't blame the young director but rather the studio-executives and producers, who may have said something cringe worthy along the lines: ""Yeah, this is good stuff"", giving it green light. I wish the director all the best for the future and that he may finally conquer a market that would really appreciate his works –Bollywood cinema is full of colours and ripe with symbolism.<br/><br/>I didn't bother watching Shyamalans ""Avatar"" but I heard it was pretty bad; No big surprises there either. Will I go and watch ""After Earth""? That really depends on what they're willing to pay me.<br/><br/>3 points from 10: one for the score, one for the lawnmower scene (which made me laugh, though I believe that was unintentionally) and one for  well, the sun is shining and I'm in a particularly giving mood."

","After the massive success of the hugely over-rated debut feature, The Sixth Sense (1999), M. Night Shyamalan could only really go one way. The series of films that he produced over the years have always been absolutely reliant on a twist, or put simply, one single idea, that the film's entire narrative is hinged upon. In his first the lead character was dead, in Unbreakable (2000), the lead was an unwitting superhero, in The Village (2004), it was the media signifiers of the war on terror. In essence the films were quite interesting. However, as films they were largely dull, pretentious drivel. I never actually saw Lady in the Water (2006), so I am unable to comment on the film he directed before this atrociously titled, The Happening.<br/><br/>The film begins with a series of vignettes showing various New Yorker's stopping their movements, and randomly committing suicide. One scene has workmen jumping from the room of a tall building - the director sorely missing out on the opportunity to have The Weather Girls' It's Raining Men playing on a radio, or even with non-diegesis. So, what about that old Shyamalan twist that has become so ubiquitous to 21st cinema thus far? The plants did it! The plants are attacking the entire eastern seaboard of North America, and a struggling couple, Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) have been given a friends child Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) to take to safety after her father, John Leguizamo, - who willingly manages to slit his wrists, successfully ejecting himself from this awful film - goes off in search of the mother.<br/><br/>Shyamanlan proudly highlights his involvement in his films, with his credits for writing, producing and directing, and his career path would seem to indicate that he combats outside forces in their making. If this is the case, I would state that for his careers sake, he should absolutely make other peoples scripts. For me, I don't really care, having never really liked any of his films. It would appear that the gravitas of the attention he received after The Sixth Sense, (being hailed as the new Spielberg; the wunderkind status in the media) clearly have hindered his films. And as I watched Wahlberg and Deschanel, zombie-like in their delivery of some very poor ""relationship"" dialogue, and the pathetic narrative of plant spores evolving to drive humans to suicide as a defence, I wondered to myself: Why on earth is this man still making movies? We should relegate him to television reality shows: When Botany Goes Mad!<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I really loved this film. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite producers/writers and I liked this film best of all. The one thing I didn't like is the R rating. I believe the same effect could have been achieved with a PG-13, just with deaths not so graphic. Then it would have been more suitable for my teenage kids. Nevertheless, I thought it was a creative, well thought out idea that was the premise for the movie. I love Night's other movies, as well, although not the most popular ones (Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense). I loved Signs, The Village, The Happening, Devil. I would recommend this film to anyone. I won't spoil anything by giving out spoilers, but will just let you experience it for yourself. I know many have negative opinions of the movie, but then I don't nit-pick at films and TV shows. I see them from a more holistic point of view. It isn't just a film about ecology or strange apocalyptic ideas. It's a film about love between friends and family. It's a creative film. It's not supposed fit someone's idea of a perfectly formed movie in some way, I don't believe. I think it was just meant to be a fun and suspenseful and creative way to look an apocalyptic idea in a different way."
"darklydreamingrahu","4","2","4","30 October 2011"," Good ideas executed poorly
","First of all, I understand this was supposed to be a B-movie homage. I get the underlying messages of the importance of love and recapturing the magic, protecting the environment or it will wipe us out, and the nature of relationships. The concepts behind the plot are well thought out and thought provoking as well. I love ""The Happening"" on a conceptual level. It's one of those movies that make you think long after the credits have rolled. However, good concepts don't always translate to good film.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has some decent credits under his belt. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a fun ghost story with terrific acting. ""Unbreakable"" was an interesting take on the superhero genre and again had terrific acting. ""The Village"" was a wonderful and thought-provoking movie that was underrated and misinterpreted. I think the first film I noticed M. Night Shyamalan may have been slipping was ""Signs"". While ""Signs"" had an awesome atmosphere and well-acted scenes, it's logical fallacies were too much for me to take (Really? Aliens are allergic to water? How did they enter our atmosphere without dying immediately seeing as how it is largely composed of H2O? The aliens sure do seem rather dumb for an interplanetary species, and their attack seems extremely ineffective for such an advanced species....among other blatantly obvious logical fallacies). But I figured okay maybe Sci-fi just isn't his strong suit. Then I watched ""Lady in the Water"". It had good acting but the script was seriously bad and it was almost comedic conceptually.<br/><br/>On to ""The Happening"". Like I previously mentioned, this one is definitely a thinking person's film. It's good for a conversation. Unfortunately the conversation might devolve into how bad the movie is. Mark Whalberg mentioned some of the strange ways M. Night Shyamalan attempted to pull good performances from his cast. Apparently this didn't work at all. The acting is so melodramatic and unrealistic, it really takes you out of the intended atmosphere. It doesn't help that the script is poorly written and invokes these melodramatic performances. Continuous and ridiculous close-ups really detract from any tension Shyamalan attempts to build. One scene in particular when Whalberg is yelling at his group ""Why won't someone just let me think for a second?!"" could be one of the worst scenes I've ever seen....except for maybe the following scene which concludes with ""Keep ahead of the wind!"" Horrid writing and poor choices of camera-work bring this film down a lot.<br/><br/>The opening scene of ""The Happening"" had real promise. I was horrified and intrigued at what could happen next in M. Night Shyamalan's first R rated feature. The first 20 minutes or so is a real treat to watch. Unfortunately it all take a steady slide down the hill and eventually falls from the cliff. With ""Signs"", ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"", and ""The Last Airbender"", M. Night Shyamalan has officially made more mediocre to poor movies than he has good ones. I no longer expect anything from him. ""The Happening"" has some signs of a great film. It has good concepts and a solid introduction. However, it's just not there.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

I think that M Night Shymalan once came up with a decent script he sort of ripped off and made a good movie out of it, and now he's just grasping at straws, and I think he ripped this particular one off from the south park episode that parodies The Day After Tomorrow, everyone running away from a danger that no one can see.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be horror, and it's just pathetic. I laughed at most of the suicide scenes, and saw the majority of the ""suspense"" scenes for what they really were: A bunch of actors standing in a field trying in vain to pretend they see toxins coming to kill them. Signs was a horrible insult to anyone with some kind of intelligence, this time it seems that Shymalan has just lost it. Literally, he lost all the props and CGI and aliens and just kept a bunch of scared people, and guess what, it still doesn't work.<br/><br/>There are no redeeming qualities here, except for laughing at the suicide scenes"

Comedic lines within a disaster movie.<br/><br/>The closeups Shyamalan uses of peoples faces symbolizes dire distress. The story of The Happening everyone says sucked.This is far from the truth.It is quite intelligent, and displays mankind for who we really are and what were doing which I think Shyamalan was trying to communicate to us. Its an eerie movie really.<br/><br/>One of the beginning scenes with all the construction workers jumping off the building is a very memorable scene for me, and where John Leguziamo is traveling through a town and sees that everyone has used ladders to climb trees and hang themselves. Oh and the soundtrack in the movie is just brilliant. Overall a good movie to watch. Definitely doesn't deserve the hate its been getting"
"gosox888","1","2","4","31 October 2010"," The Worst Movie I have ever seen
","Don't even bother watching this movie. It is absolutely horrible with terrible acting and even worse script. I anticipated this movie for quite a movie actually but was really disappointed. I thought Mark Wahlberg would have done a better job. It was a waste of time and space on my hard drive. The plot so ridiculous it's almost funny. How could anyone in their right mind think up something like this? I mean come on, it's not even close to being believable. Plants attacking the humans? WOW! Don't bother with this movie! I thought it could be good with the actors and the comeback of the director was I was very wrong. I thought this was a joke when i watched it, honestly."
"samuel-84","2","2","4","16 July 2010"," An acceptable concept unable to make a story resulting in poor execution.
","Two things I learned about film watching The Happening: 1) Just as it allows for an incredible creative result allowing a filmmaker to write, direct and produce their own film (Stanley Kubrick), it can also be a self indulgent disaster with nobody there for damage control and a reality check. 2) People have faith and want to see Shyamalan make another movie like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. They will keep giving him money, to the insane amount of $161m to date, hoping he will come back from the last string of disasters. After The Village, The Lady In The Water, this and The Last Airbender, which seems to be bombing, I think it may be tough.<br/><br/>To quickly cover the synopsis: People are suddenly killing themselves in droves. One minute fine, next gory suicide. The ""happenings"" start in NYC and begin to spread. We see the movie through our lead protagonist, Eliot (Wahlberg), a nice-guy science teacher having marriage difficulties with his wife Alma (Deschanel). They are trying to evacuate NYC and get away from the happenings which are spreading. Along the way we discover the cause of the happenings and watch the characters dynamics change as they are faced with life threatening events. <br/><br/>The setup and opening act is strong and intriguing, but falls apart shortly thereafter and the final act feels like the filmmaker had a good concept, but did not know how to make it a story.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and the comment is easy to grasp. An acceptable concept poorly executed. The film is wrecked by the atrocious and insulting script, with mistakes a seasoned filmmaker should not accept, and is further spat on by some of the worst acting and dialog ever released in a commercial movie backed by a decent budget and experienced team. <br/><br/>The dialog and acting is insulting to the audience and characters are unnatural, have no depth and talk the plot throughout the film. Wahlberg can be hit and miss and this is his worst by leagues.<br/><br/>The film is a disaster and may even be worse than The Daughter with Kev Costner, which is saying a lot and the only reason I am glad I have seen it was for the lessons learned in how not to make a film. This is the current benchmark for bad film making and unless you are interested in some aspect of film making, it is a waste of 91mins and will only insult and enrage any person with even the most basic level of intelligence.<br/><br/>2/10"
"mrbusyb","1","2","4","7 July 2010"," Certainly, M Night Shyamalan used cheap child labor from India to write this movie
","I can't believe this movie! I'm sitting realizing that there is only ten minutes left of it to watch waiting for that typical revelation, the bit of irony that usually warms the heart in every M. Night Shyamalan film, when all the characters we thought were the protagonists turned out quite surprisingly to be the antagonists, and vice versa. So, don't look for any of that kind of cozy gratification in this film. The only good actor in this movie was the little girl who seemed sincerely lost and afraid of what would happen next. I think the more the other actors realized how stupid this movie would become, the more they actually really started committing suicide. And what about all those stupid special effects using fans to blow all the plants around? With all that running the people did through the fields to get away from the waves of plant breath, I thought for a second I was watching ""The Lord of the Rings."" But no,instead this was dorkiest of the dumbest. Indeed, ""the happening"" never happens."
"Lomedin","4","2","4","3 June 2010"," Almost a comedy
","This is bad. I mean, so bad sometimes that it's almost a comedy. Firstly, the acting. My god... It's not only bad, it's cheesy. Some conversations/actions are totally irrelevant and absurd. Even the gory scenes give this film a touch of those old low budget funny horror movies. Don't get me wrong, not much blood or guts here. Still, sometimes you just have to laugh (otherwise you could take it serious and actually fall asleep). Except for Zooey Deschanel. She does look cute, and made me smile by simply doing certain movements. Apart from that, the whole plot about nature trying to get rid of men is quite appealing. However, this attempt is basically a disaster, a joke. I wonder if Mr. Shyamalan found some little story he wrote when he was 10 and decided to give it a try. This is certainly what it looks like in any case. I did like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village and Lady in the Water. It's shocking to watch The Happening knowing that it's coming from the same person. As a curiosity, at the end of the film, you can see the little girl carrying an Avatar bag pack, hah! I saw the trailer a few weeks ago and looked terrible as well. All FX's and typical story about a chosen one (not again...) with canned sentences that are supposed to be ""cool"", smart and funny at the same time. This might have worked back in the day of Indy and The Lost Ark, but c'mon... Anyway, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan has been blinded by his own popularity, who knows. In any case, he always seemed to be a bit childish regarding certain aspects of his creations and somehow wanted to give a feeling of his movies being deeper and more intelligent that they really are, maybe, with those final twists. Alas, we will see what the future brings. I'd watch this film again if it was necessary, without falling asleep, although I'd rather go for a different title."
"RickHarvey","3","2","4","24 May 2010"," cheese and crackers
","Holy cheese and crackers, Can film making ever get worse than this? Yes.. yes it can. The happening is a film that does get picked on and i can see why, the acting is terrible and shocking when you read the cast list. Mark Wahlberg seems to be lost, i don't even think he's trying to act because his performance is just awful. But it must be said, without him, this film would be a total disaster. Zooey deschanel is on the same level as Mark in this film. At half the stuff she said and how she delivered it, made me cringe. You know what, no point discussing the acting because there are more serious faults to pick on.<br/><br/>What people have to remember is that this film was made from a man who brought us films such as ""signs"" and "" lady in the water"" so you have to expect some over the top plot. The story is simple, plants communicate to one another and release toxins as a self defence mechanism. basically these toxins force people to commit suicide. I have no problem with the concept, i for one, rather liked the idea. But what really ruined the film was how it was written.<br/><br/>Some parts will make you laugh, some parts will force you to roll your eyes, some parts will make you want to do the same actions as the victims commit. There are some stupid one liners. The private's reaction to the dead bodies "" cheese and crackers"". Elliots brainstorming ideas when in the distant , guns shots can be heard. This particular scene ain't helped by the awful acting of Deschanel. Then there's the whole science class scene in which if there is ever a poll on the "" top 10 worst teachers"" then Mark wahlberg will no doubt be number one. the whole class discussion is just pointless. To be honest, Mark acts like a clueless hillbilly.<br/><br/>The only positive is that the concept, even though it daft, is a interesting one. But when a black kid pops up from nowhere and starts discussing other people's personal matters , then the whole film is ruined.<br/><br/>But holy cheese and crackers, the last acts was painful. before this, the film was already on it knees, crawling to the end and the final act was just the beheading. Awful, lousy ending to a lousy film. Shyamalan stated that ""the happening"" was made as B movie. Well, to me, that a poor excuse . he also said how he believed the audience would figure out that the "" The Happening"" is a supposed B movie. I'm sorry, but when you include already established actors and a serious sense of tension, it easy to know that your clearly lying.<br/><br/>With a film that has great actors and a great director, it pretty scary to see how disastrous a film can turn out even when it filled with talent. If the script was solid and if anyone actually bothered to read the script, then this film would of been great."
"Blackace","3","2","4","13 March 2010"," It Didn't Happen.
","I'd have to say that it's really sad to see M. Night Shyamalan career take a nose dive. After doing the brilliant ""The Sixth Sense"", M. Night's movies have slowly gotten worse and worse. ""Unbreakable"" was very good as well, but not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"". Then came ""Signs"" with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, which was also good, but probably not as good as ""Unbreakable"". The Village was so predictable, it wasn't funny. It wasn't scary and only have a few moments of intense thrills. I was disappointed. Even Jaoquin Phoenix presence couldn't save that movie. ""Lady in the Water"" was worse. I still have yet to watch this movie from beginning to end. Now we get the Happening. There are so many things wrong with this film it isn't funny. I'm not going to point out everything, just the things I think are critical.<br/><br/>1) The Script: It's completely horrendous. The idea of plants sending out defensive poisons in the air that causes people to kill themselves and others is a bit much. The main problem though is there isn't enough detail given in the beginning or at the end of the movie that tells us what plants are causing this terrible phenomenon. There are theories thrown around, but never any proof that the trees, grass or other plants is causing this effect. It could have been the birds or some other animals releasing some toxin in the air. Who knows? There's no buildup to a definitive answer. There's not even a conclusion. There wasn't even any twist, which M.Nights movies are known for.<br/><br/>2) Characters/Acting: Absolutely no character development in this film. The only one you really feel for is the little girl. Even though 3 months after losing her parents, she's fine leaving with teachers. The only actors who given any kind of descent performance is Zooey Deschanel and Betty Buckley. It's too bad their talents are wasted on this film. Mark Wahlberg's performances goes from good to terrible by the time the film ends. I was hoping the deadly wind would finally get him. Still, you really don't care about any of the people in this film. We just don't know enough about them to care. So many people die so suddenly, that viewers only concern is how the terror can be stopped (and how did it begin).<br/><br/>3) No Drama/Suspense/Action - The movie is pretty boring. There is very little suspense or drama, and almost no action. With a film like this, you want to be on the edge of you seat, but I was almost on my feet ready to walk out. M. Night's direction doesn't draw you into his vision. Too many questions go on unanswered even after the movie ends. Why didn't the deadly wind effect Elliott, Alma or Jess, yet it effected Mrs. Jones? What caused it to suddenly stop? Why didn't it effect the West coast or other countries? Were any of the people who were effected examined? I would think the brain would be the first thing to get examined. Why wasn't the government more involved? The CIA/FBI would have been on this in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Anyways, ""The Happening"" just wasn't happening. It's definitely M.Night's worse movie to date. Next up is, ""The Last Airbender"" based off ""The Avatar"" books and anime. It can't be any worse then this movie, that's for sure.<br/><br/>I gave ""The Happening"" 3 stars. Do not buy or rent this movie."

"vip_ebriega","6","2","4","10 January 2010"," Put it this way: If you like Shymalan, it's worth a look.
","My Take: Bizarre and sometimes campy, but can be chillingly effective if it has to be.<br/><br/>As I am a fan of M. Night Shymalan, my first impression of his latest film THE HAPPENING being a ""fun b-movie"" as he puts it is that it wouldn't turn out to be as bad as many critics put it. Shymalan, in an attempt to revive his success after the failure of LADY IN THE WATER (an argument that is still goes on among few defenders and haters), just wanted to make a simple B-movie genre effort in an attempt not to alienate some of his viewers from the different and misunderstood nature of his previous efforts, an effort that is still being shrugged by critics. But even a B-movie to Shyamalan is still a film that is faithful to some of the nature of his previous efforts. Most evidently, the use of suspense rather than typical scares.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is probably the best. It opens in Central Park, where people go about their usual business when suddenly people find themselves committing suicide in the oddest of fashion. Shymalan, given the full liberties of an R-rating, devises this opening sequence in an over-the-top fashion, yet as well in such effective creepiness that it makes your skin crawl nonetheless. Unfortunately, in spite of a few other disturbing kills later, the rest of the film fails to live up to its admittedly chilling setup. I praised Shymalan before as a superior yet underrated storyteller, but it seems in THE HAPPENING, disturbing and well-crafted sequences aside, fails to live up to some of his superior works, even if, taken in its own merit, is not half bad compared to what the critics have said about it.<br/><br/>Firstly, the narrative is rather messy, with no real beginning (after the superb opening sequence, there's hardly a character setup) and an ending with no real closure. Everything just seems to be, pardon the pun, happening. Performances are uneven, with Wahlberg alternating from frantic to campy, either way it's hard to believe him as a science professor when he starts getting silly. Zooey Deschanel is just out of place, a great actress as she is. Some actors like John Leguizamo, Spencer Breslin, Alan Ruck and others are in the cast too, but it's hard not to credit them as nothing more than cameo appearances; they're hardly there, whether or not they serve any real purpose. Finally, Betty Buckley appears later in the film in a relevant supporting role (even if she's only there for, say, 20 minutes) as the out-of-her-mind Mrs. Jones.<br/><br/>THE HAPPENING is Shymalan's weakest film to date, not that I'm comparing it to any of his ever-varying works. But being an admirer of his works, every underrated work of his after THE SIXTH SENSE, THE HAPPENING has it's strong points and some effective moments that live up to the director's form. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto perfectly captures the shots and one-take sequences that Shyamalan demands. James Newton Howard provides yet another terrific, if often ham-fisted, score. Suffice to say: If Shymalan is your cup of tea, this one is well worth watching. I, for one, am looking forward to what he'll come up with next.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."
"KineticSeoul","6","2","4","20 October 2009"," M. Night Shyamalan similar premise, just done better before
","The story here is that something has been released into the air which causes people to stop moving, talk gibberish and walk backwards and after they decide to kill yourself. Throughout this awkward situation Elliot Moore a character played by Mark Wahlberg who is a high school teacher tries to get his wife in a safe area. I didn't think this was a bad movie, I mean it's not brilliant but it's worth a look. The problem was that when this film came out people just had way too much high expectation for it, thinking that it will be a big smash hit summer movie M. Night Shyamalan past reputation and since it's his first rated R movie which don't really need to be rated R. It's a mediocre with a average dialogue and a dull ending, nothing was spectacular but will keep you interested at least it did for me. If people watched this expecting a indie film, they probably wouldn't be too harsh on it. The premise of this film was good with a decent beginning but a terrible finish.<br/><br/>6/10"
"clivecollett","4","2","4","15 October 2009"," I so wanted it to be better.
","I have rated this as a 4 mainly because the idea was good. I feel that it was a wasted attempt, such a shame because it could have been so much better. I agree with many of the comments, in that it was loaded with inadequate acting, lost threads, and missed opportunities. The suicides were mostly unconvincing and seemed to be there more for shock value than anything else; not very well thought out in my opinion. My version is 86 minutes; mercifully short in light of the above, but having said all of that, there was still a dark thread running through it which teases out the uncomfortable thought of YOU and YOURS being in that situation. Developed skillfully this could easily have lasted over two hours. I compare this film to 'THE MIST' by Stephen King. A much longer film, with a mind boggling ending, the like of which I have never experienced before in a film. The director of THE MIST was certainly not frightened of taking risks, and MKS is renowned for the same; but why 'o' why did he let this opportunity slip by? I really cannot understand."

All the actors are atrocious especially the female lead who thinks she is something special which makes her performance even more excruciatingly abysmal. The story: Horrible things are ""happening"" in one part of the States. Is it a terrorist attack? Perhaps some kind of nuclear fallout? Or is the environment fighting back against man? The idea of this picture might be good but it is totally ruined by a clueless idiotic production, direction, script and cast. The only reason I give it more that 1 out of 10 is some decent music and also some pleasant outdoor scenery, hence: 2/10."

","Oh for Chrissakes, what a mess. Having watched a number of this director's fiascos, this has to be the worst. The acting is atrocious enough that this might end up as a cult film. Throughout the flick, I kept hoping the whiny wife would end up walking backwards at Superman speeds to turn the earth on its axis back to the point where she was in an incubator - then the hospital would have a power outage, sparing us from her woodened-face delivery. Mark Wahlberg breathes a lot, and talks plastic plants down from their homicidal tendencies. Annoying teenagers annoyingly try to kick through a barricaded residence, and get shot for their annoying efforts - cheerworthy if anyone even cared about the plot at this point. The reclusive old woman who succumbs to the plants' master design should have been played by Cloris Leachman a la ""Malcolm in the Middle."" Quit giving this loser director any money to continue to foist his crap on the unsuspecting. And Wahlberg warbling ""Black Water"" was a truly cringeworthy moment. Sucks sucks sucks!!!"

People in New York just sort of go into a trance and then kill themselves. What's causing it? The story focuses on Elliot, his wife, Alma, his friend Julian and his daughter Jess. They are trying to get out of the affected area. Their train stops in a small town and from that point, it's everyone for themselves. They gather with others and track across open fields. But is that the best strategy. One guy they get a ride with seems to think plants may be involved. And at the end, they seek shelter with a crazy old lady.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Not enough suspense, badly written. Not scary. Miscast actors.

I do applaud his attempt to rise above the script. The only performance that had any depth belongs to John Leguizamo and he is gone within the first half hour.<br/><br/>The solution: Singing, Dancing, Fireworks! Replace Mr. Wahlberg with Tom Hanks. The little girl's character should be rewritten as a cross-dressing, 10-year old boy. This alone would add the much needed depth to the entire film - a subplot of sorts. (Michael Jackson could do a cameo.) The anxiety-ridden wife poorly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel could be fully illuminated by the talents of Meryl Streep.

"Jaarus","3","2","4","15 May 2009"," Keep off the grass!
","Well I just watched this film and actually felt COMPELLED to come on here and write something about it... that alone should tell you something!<br/><br/>Other reviews I have read on here seem to suggest that the fault lies almost solely with Mark Wahlberg being miscast for the role - well to be perfectly frank, thats the least of the problems affecting this film! Whilst I do agree that seeing an actor who usually plays the role of:<br/><br/>'tough guy just trying to get along in the world. But he is up against it, thrown in an impossible situation and the only way out is obviously a gun and more bullets than anyone would feasibly carry'<br/><br/>Instead playing a role of :<br/><br/>'school science teacher trying to make his marriage work. But he is up against it, thrown into an impossible and implausible situation and the only way out is to be overly emotional armed with nothing but a 'mood ring'' IS a little hard to accept! - However, his acting remains easily the strongest in the movie - that should tell you something as well!<br/><br/>The main fault instead lies with a frankly bizarre premise, a truly awful script (and I mean BAD), poor actors and utterly clueless direction. That pretty much sums it up to be fair but I will elaborate further just in case you still aren't convinced!<br/><br/>Now I love 'end of the world' movies. The hopelessness of everything, is in my view, a fascinating scenario where character development is fundamental and the twists and turns of a good plot within such a desperate concept leave you feeling truly haunted. Constantly quizzing yourself on what YOU would have done, how YOU would try to survive etc so I was keen to see this film despite the poor reviews centred on the miscast Wahlberg.<br/><br/>However, this premise may have been a step too far...<br/><br/>The premise that the plants are releasing a neuro-toxin that affects humans, and only humans, as a defence mechanism is OK. Somewhat unusual, but hey, thats no bad thing. The trouble comes when the film actually goes on to convey the theory that the plants are 'working together' in a coordinated manner. They are communicating with each other kind of similar to that shown in 'The Birds' but nowhere near as effectively. The camera pans from a tree blowing in the breeze to the bush next to it doing the same and now the grass is doing..... OH MY GOD...... NOOOOOOOOOO! Pathetic.<br/><br/>So the plants are now hunting down humanity starting in large population centres and working there way down to the last few groups of stragglers, due to the damage we have done to the planet is quite far fetched to say the least. Add into the mix that the neuro-toxin released doesn't actually kill you but instead causes people to simply freeze for a few seconds before then finding the nearest method of committing suicide - and we have a frankly ridiculous film. Obviously done solely for shock value to include some attempted 'horrible' self inflicted death scenes.<br/><br/>Its a real shame - had the script been better and the actors been better cast it would have been better. Had the plot being changed to an unknown enemy, no reason given at all it would have been better still.<br/><br/>As it stands - the trees and the bushes are out to get you - they are gonna make you kill yourself with a lawnmower - here have you seen my 'mood ring'? Its awful.<br/><br/>I gave it 3 stars - I did watch it all so it passed the time I suppose."

The overall plot is fantastic, it's new, fresh and gripping.

Mark Wahlberg (Elliot) was one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He hardly changed his expression or tone of voice art all. The ending was exactly like the ending in 28 Weeks Later, it breaks out somewhere in France.<br/><br/>Most of the characters were great, it's just Wahlberg stood out because he portrayed the main character. Do that badly and the whole film is screwed.<br/><br/>I liked this film, I like it a lot. I liked it almost as much as Signs and Sixth Sense.

","I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't great but I found it entertaining, especially compared the MNS's last flop, the disappointing ""Lady In The Water"". While the plot required a pretty hefty suspension of disbelief, many of the individual scenes succeeded in creating a suspenseful mood, and the director succeeds in imbuing seemingly innocuous images, such as trees blowing in the breeze, with a sense of dread. The actors, especially the likable Zooey Deschanel, do an admirable job with some occasionally corny dialogue and improbable situations.<br/><br/>Taken as a whole, the overall effect doesn't add up to all it could have been in a more skilled writer's hands. MNS seems to be awfully fond of his own ideas, and this winds up being a one-note movie without much depth. He seems content to create tension rather than drama. But if you approach this film as pure escapism, and can suspend disbelief enough to forgive its flaws, it succeeds as an engaging and entertaining series of scenes with which to fill an hour and a half."

You'd have to not be paying attention at all (which is highly plausible in this case) to not know that John Lequizamo was dead meat at the very minute that his wife didn't show up for the train. But, it was pretty much spelled out on the screen when he suddenly abandons his kid (good move, btw) to climb into a jeep full of extras in order to find his (obviously dead) wife. I'm tired of this, ""you go on, I'll just gonna go do something and catch up with you, later"" crap. We all know where it leads...<br/><br/>3. Poorly written dialog<br/><br/>Horrible. Lequizamo is ridiculous as the ""fretful parent/husband"" And, the whole ""odd couple"" thing between Mahlberg and Zooey Deschannel (who actually is somewhat talented) fails miserably on every level.

The plants, the insanity, the death. No development there, either. And, I won't even get into this movie's total ignorance to plant biology. It just isn't plausible. Even in a disaster movie <br/><br/>6. Cop out ending<br/><br/>Yes, just like Mark Wahlberg said at the the beginning. ""An act of nature that we don't understand"" Or, something like that. That's great! Because, when I watch movies about mysterious, yet socially relevant ecological disasters, I like to leave with absolutely no closure, whatsoever! This is worth another two stars Bite me, Shyalaman! <br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie had an interesting concept for a ""natural disaster\end of civilization"" sort of story. And, I really was interested to see what was actually killing people off. But, I guess that I'll never know."

","Let me start the way many of these comments have by saying I am a huge M. Night fan. Now here is the twist which will set my post apart from many of the others...I fully enjoyed The Happening. I have followed MNS movies from The Sixth Sense, as have most people, and oddly enough (or so it appears), I have yet to be disappointed. The problem MNS faces is that The Sixth Sense set such a high bar with the twist it presented, that moviegoers have expected the same type of film every time he releases something, so much so that the twist of his films have now become that there is no twist. When Lady in the Water was released it was bashed, however when was the last time we were presented such an original story, twist or no twist? The same can be said for The Happening.<br/><br/>The Happening revolves around an unexplained phenomenon in which people are killing themselves left, right and center, with zero cause. It is believed to be the act of terrorists, until the event has spread so quickly that terrorism is ruled out. Shortly into the film, one of the supporting characters suggests he believes the plants are responsible, to which he is greeted with obvious doubt. As the film progresses it becomes clear that plants are indeed the cause...this is the part of the film in which I believe people mostly stopped paying attention and began waiting for it to end...and I have heard many people state that the plot is just too ridiculous to take seriously. <br/><br/>However, I do not believe this makes a bad film. Why is it we can see a film about a bunch of cars that transform into Robots sent to protect the Earth ( I loved Transformers as well btw, and do not mean this as a negative ), however plants attacking the Earth is seen as completely unbelievable. Hello....movies are works of fiction, and are not always supposed to be taken literally. What MNS presents in this film is a ""what if"" scenario...and I think on that what he delivers is highly entertaining. The death sequences are original and visually dazzling, and the camera work is impressive, illustrated brilliantly in the car wreck scene. Yes there are some spots in which I felt a little let down by Mark Wahlbergs performance...however I have noticed that throughout all of MN films, he has provided us with unconventional characters and directs them in a way that presents characters unlike any we see in any other films. The DVD also has many added features which provide insight into the film as well as its characters. MN has never shoved everything into our faces ( these are my characters, they are in love, they are going through a rough time, this is why, this is how its resolved), but gives us subtle and short insights into his characters and plot lines, leaving our imaginations to do the rest. This type of film making is not for everyone, but I feel that anyone that is going to go into watching this movie with an open mind and not just to prove that MN has gone down hill (which I strongly believe he hasn't), or better yet an MN fan who truly gets his work, will find satisfaction in The Happening."
"Poe-17","7","2","4","7 October 2008"," Edgy, softly creepy and vintage MNS
","MNS has been bludgeoned to death because he didn't repeat ""The Sixth Sense"" with his career. That seminal film had the ""twist"" that most of us saw coming and righteously enjoyed nonetheless. But it branded movie-goers' expectations from this director. ""Unbreakable"", which lacked the ""twist"" of TSS, again telegraphed this director's intentions of illuminating the ""between the lines"". ""Signs"" alerted everyone that he was seriously not focusing ""the same ol same"". An alien invasion with only trace-aliens? Who would'a thought? By the time ""Signs"" came along, it was clear MNS was looking at things through a new lens. ""The Village"" nailed it. Critics talked about the ""twist"" (still demanding a 'twist ending')as disappointing. ""The Village"" wasn't about a ""twist ending"". ""The Village"" was a love story. About the courage of love, told ""out of kilter"" And then what should we expect from ""The Happening""? Quite naturally, it is a story between the lines. Told from a perspective that's easier and easier to fear ... we're not in control of things like we think we are. Nature might hold a surprise or two. I don't like to make comparisons like this but MNS has, from the first, called up those ""Twilight Zone"" kind of visions. Invites us to ""look at things ... this way"". He's done it again. Dismiss it. Knock it. But if you're honest ... it's hard to ignore the film's metaphor. We live in strange times and strange things can and do happen. Why are the honeybees disappearing? ... they really are, you know. It's called Colony Collapse Disorder. You can look it up. It's scarier than the movie. Or part of the movie. That's how MNS works. Much decent."
"denis888","8","2","4","22 September 2008"," Very Good!
","Mark Wahlberg is truly a universal and unique actor. He can play almost everything, from a chilling thriller to a driving drama. Here he is a school teacher, methodical, deep, sober and very meticulous. His dry approach to events helps him a lot and he never loses his head even in dangerous moments. The idea of the movie is very good  to show that we, people, are a danger to the Nature in such a blood-chilling way. The scenes of mass suicides and gory deaths are truly horrifying and they do show the fragility of human life. Now, there's a great suspense growth in many scenes and the wind rustling in the trees has never been more terrible to hear! There are many minor parts in the film and those often unnamed heroes die and show us the very horror of the situation. Another great plus of the movie is its tempo and durability  it is very short and never drags. The very beginning and ending of the film are excellent and stand out much."
"diki24","2","2","4","28 August 2008"," I wonder how/why they released the movie
","To be frank, i have never been a great Fan of shymalan, however i have never hated any of his movies as much i have for this one. Of all his films i had liked ""The Village"" because of its Atmospheric feel and pretty good a Cast. <br/><br/>However ""the Happening"" just does opposite to its name. The number one problem of this movie is its Casting and horrendous acting. Forget about the Plot or the story, which anyways is so unrelaistic and its bad script makes it even so loose. There are no subplots or even tie-ins of events that happen or are shown. If it was deliberately intended to be open ended where audiences join the missing pieces in the end, then i would say it completely fails here. You cant expect Audiences to fill in the parts of script that you were too lazy to leave empty.<br/><br/>Next comes the Acting and Characters. C'mon we are talking of a Big budget A+ production movie here. Script is so bad that at times you feel like laughing at the way characters are reacting to certain tense events. Mark Wahlberg, is given some so stupid lines, that you wonder if he is the same guy who has acted so well in other films like ""Departed"". even the support cast is horrible. I don't know if Director intentionally wanted the characters to behave funnily in some extremely tensed moments. I forced myself to watch it till the end only hoping that there will be some twist or some kind of revelation. <br/><br/>In the end i can only give it 2 stars and this is just because of the intent of creating something different. It otherwise loses on all fronts , Directing, Acting, Story, which are all ZERO stars."
"thebengalimafia-1","2","2","4","17 August 2008"," So weak.
","This movie was supposed to be so many things but mostly it was supposed to be the return of M. Night Shamyalan. Honestly, I feel like he hasn't made a good movie since ""The Sixth Sense."" Anyone who watches Signs or The Village would know why many critics call him a one trick pony. Sadly enough, ""The Happening"" turns out to be the same but without the one trick.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true. This is one film from Night that didn't have the twist ending or the one trick to it. He tried to sell the movie and the scares on some sort of supernatural happening which was completely unexplained. As the trailer explains, the first signs are loss of speech, then disorientation. And then the victims suddenly commit suicide. OK, honestly, the physical portion of the so called symptoms was over done. Basically, when someone is about to commit suicide they begin to walk backwards. By the end of the movie you've seen that bit so many times that you just cant help but laugh. And I was somewhat surprised by the number of laughs there were in the movie. But I didn't go to this movie to laugh; I went to this movie for the scares. Sadly, there really weren't any.<br/><br/>I will say this though. From the trailer we know there is a scene that involves construction workers all jumping to their deaths. You don't know how terrifying this is until you actually see it. To see a body hit the pavement and the sickening sounds it makes was nothing short of horrific. Now imagine the camera moving in a circle as more and more workers jump off the girders. Every time a body hits the pavement or a car or a dumpster, we see bones breaking and the sound sends chills up your spine.<br/><br/>Some people have commented on how Mark Walberg always plays the angry badass. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in ""The Departed"" and this was well deserved. I didn't think that Walberg could pull off the role of a middle school science teacher but he ends up doing it quite well. It wasn't like the usual turn an actor makes and tries something different, and you're sitting there wishing they had never had the idea in the first place. Do I need to remind you all about Jim Carrey in ""The Number 23""? All in all, I think Shamyalan is washed up. He might make one or two more movies, but if those don't break box office records then he might have to retire. I love how with the trailers of all his movies he has to put, ""From the director of The Sixth Sense!"" Yea pal, we know you made one of the creepiest thrillers ever and gave Bruce Willis his finest hour. We know that was the movie that gave Willis the title of 2nd highest paid Hollywood actor in history (the first is the ever crappy Keaneu Reeves). We also know that ""The Sixth Sense"" made more money on the 5th weekend it was open (Memorial Day weekend) than it did on opening weekend. This is an accolade held by only one other Hollywood film; Titanic. But seriously, the critics called him the one trick pony because of the predictable twist at the end of all his films after ""The Sixth Sense"". I'm seriously beginning to think that he just got lucky with his first film, and that's all."

About midway they say that it's big groups that set it off yet at the beginning we saw people alone killing themselves. Poor Marky Mark he's not a fab actor but paired up with Zooey Deschanel he seems even worse, maybe because in other films the better actors help him to be better? But Zooey just widens her admittedly very pretty eyes every time she needs to show a reaction to something and that's as far as her ability goes.<br/><br/>However even tho this film isn't great IF you can ignore all the bad points it's mildly entertaining so if it comes on and there's nothing on the other channels and your Netflix isn't working then sit back and watch just don't get your hopes up that it improves as it goes on because it doesn't"
"Cineanalyst","3","0","0","20 May 2020"," Breaking Wind Forces Marky Mark to Value Social Distancing
","I never thought I'd see ""The Happening"" again, but since I've been seeking out a bunch of movies of late that may seem relevant to today's real-world pandemic, it's taken on added interest. It's still a very bad movie, though. The plot is the standard game of apocalyptic fiction of running away from disaster. Dialogue is trite to atrocious, including Mark Whalberg trying to remember aloud the scientific method and John Leguizamo reciting nonsense statistics. Little is done with the urban-rural dichotomy, and the Underground Railroad subplot is out of place. Attempts to interject human interest into the main characters are pathetic, including a squabble over the relation of a dessert to marital infidelity--or some such rubbish. Characteristically, Whalberg, as a science teacher, of all things, and Zooey Deschanel, as--give me a break--emotionally reserved, are wretched. With the threat of such an acting couple procreating, it makes sense the world would naturally try to reject it. Heck, it's understandable just as a means to stop Marky Mark from mis-teaching that class.... The bees are dying from environmental destruction; it's not a mystery to never be solved, you self-satisfied ignoramus. There, I said it.<br/><br/>The obvious message of the picture is of environmental warning, with post-9/11 threats of terrorism serving as red herring. Beyond plants blowing in the wind, however, this seems prescient given current events as of this writing, as the characters temporarily learn to survive by socially, or physically, distancing from each other. Find yourself in a large group, the wind blows the wrong way, and the virus spreads. Sounds familiar. Even staying indoors isn't entirely safe due to air circulation and due to Whalberg inevitably rejecting what little wisdom he's learned to risk exposing himself and those he loves to deadly contagion. For the safety of one's enjoyment as a movie spectator, it's probably best to stay away from this one."

The characters were too strange, almost as strange as the horror-filled scenes themselves. The dialogue was artificial or forced. Only glimpses of true film-making flare were on display. Unfortunately they were far and few between. This movie was a frustrating experience because it felt so unreal, unrealistic which was devastating for a movie with the plot outline that required a stretch to begin with.

","Shyamalan had something to prove. After the atrocity that was 'Lady in the Water', he needed to create another 'The Sixth Sense' before losing faith from the film community. How did he tackle this? Well, with this film. The Happening. A ""psychological horror thriller"" about an inexplicable disaster that is controlling people to commit mass suicide. Instantly we are greeted with death as innocent civilians stab themselves and walk off towering buildings. Chaos seemingly ensued. This was it. Shyamalan was back with a vengeance! ""I can write more than two good films!"" he exclaimed to all the haters. However, minutes later after the promising start, Wahlberg started talking. ""Apparently, honeybees are disappearing all over the country!"". And from that moment on, Shyamalan regressed to his cocoon of inadequacy. But wait! It's not just the preachy environmentalism that comfortably nested amidst the non-existent thrills. ""Hot dogs get a bad rap. They got a cool shape, they got protein"". Or perhaps ""what kind of terrorists are these?"" as a man gets mauled by lions. Or even the infamous ""whattt!? Noooo!"" line delivered by an unfathomably awful Wahlberg. How about Deschanel's death stares as she looks glumly confused? Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant? No no wait, ""see, I'm a teacher!"". ""Why are you giving me one useless piece of information at a time?"". ""Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?"". Honeybees, science, plants, hot dogs, firearms, lemon drinks...I can't take it. I've lost my sanity. This is so unintentionally hilarious that it outshines the majority of comedies, films designed to make you laugh. The extras are better actors than the lead stars. There are no thrills, aside from the tiniest slither of mystery. And, to top it all, it concludes with an explanation outlining how inexplicable the event was. It started, and ended, abruptly with minimal reasoning. Every bone in my body is telling me that this is one of the worst films I've ever watched.

The only thing that kept me watching this giant pant load was the fast forward button and enough curiosity about whether or not it could continue to worsen. It did."

","Or, instead of a speech therapist, maybe all Mark Wahlberg films should come with free subtitles.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this film is that he doesn't have a lot to say.<br/><br/>Actually the film isn't that bad and I liked the ending, but please all you directors, especially the casting directors, can't you make it a clause in Wahlberg's contract that he has to undergo speech therapy? Unless you honestly believe that his script is not worth a dime, then it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>But if you remember his performance in The Shooter where he plays Bob Lee Swagger, he was pretty much unintelligible.

"filipemanuelneto","4","0","0","15 March 2017"," Night Shyamalan: going from genius to fool.
","Night Shyamalan is one of those directors who learned from Tim Burton: he loves bizarre movies that can be brilliant or obnoxious. Therefore, he's a genius just as easily as he can be a fool. In this film, he not only directs but ensures script writing.<br/><br/>This movie is about a mysterious global pandemic that causes people to kill themselves mechanically, without thinking. This sentence, synthetic and simple, already allows us to anticipate a bad script, but the film takes that expectation to a new level, telling a story so unbelievable that it becomes hilarious. And when a movie has a bad script, it's doomed.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is the main actor and has a poor interpretation. I think he would admit that himself. From the middle of the film, he failed to interpret and went on to simply say his text and do what they were told. I don't know if he protested to Shyamalan, but the truth is that he couldn't save his character without changes in the script. Zooey Deschanel seems better, and the physical beauty of the actress is certainly a bonus, but the truth is that her character was spared by the script because of not being a protagonist. Anyway, I sincerely believe the actors did the best they could. Blame the writer."

","Good story, good actors, good ideas, bad dialogues.<br/><br/>Movies are ""make believe"" as kids say. So in my opinion, the cardinal sin of a movie is when characters do not act or say stuff ""normal people"" would in the point of view of the viewer, even under extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>In this movie, I felt the acting was slightly ""off key"" in that regard. I think the problem is the ""fine writing"" of each scene. The general story line is good but you feel the acting is bad because actors are saying stuff that does not fit the particular situations. They were scared, emotional, joking, angry, worried, calm, etc at the wrong times. So no matter how good or bad the acting is... it's an uphill battle... and the viewer has to force himself to ""play along""... but it is annoying and gets in the way of a basically good story and creates a distance between viewers characters. As a matter of fact, I think the actors themselves were struggling with delivering lines that did not feel right for each scene/situation."

The dialogue and the expression, God. You make me wanna laugh hard instead of feeling terrified.<br/><br/>But I do appreciate what this movie tried to deliver. Yeah, it wants us to love plants.

","You know what? When I entered the cinema to watch this film with a friend of mine, I had already decided that this movie stinked. I hadn't watched a trailer, nor had I read any synopsis, all I knew was that it had something to do with the apocalypse. Considering the horrible disasters Lady in the Water and The Village had been, I thought this movie would be as bad. I can't believe how wrong I was.<br/><br/>When the movie started, it seemed a little messy, it didn't really explain much of what was happening, and it was just people committing suicide. It still wasn't bad, but from one opinion I had read somewhere before, I thought it was going to collapse at some point in the middle. Not only it started getting better and better by the minute, but it just sustained the tension and created a perfect atmosphere at all times.<br/><br/>It all starts in a park, where people stop moving all at once, and without any warning, they start killing themselves. The same thing happens in other places to different people. According to the news, a new toxin was released into the air by a terrorist group, and it resulted in people losing their minds and committing suicide. But they also talk about the government, and the nuclear plants on the northeast area of the united states. Whatever the reason is, people start leaving their homes and try to escape this weird toxin. The story focuses on Eliot and Alma Moore, who try to escape with a friend and his daughter. The acting is more than good, and the amazing effects used in every death make you hold on to your sit more than once.<br/><br/>The tension this movie creates from beginning to end is astounding, specially considering that it was made by the same person who created Lady in the Water. I simply can't understand why other people didn't like it, and can only assume that the gory deaths and the overwhelming tension just was to big for them. But not for me and my friend, at least. We loved it. However, this is just an opinion, just like the ones before which qualify this as horrible. So, for all of you who haven't seen it and want to know how good or bad this is, there's just one thing to say: go and decide for yourselves. I think you won't be disappointed."

","When I go to the movies I don't always agree with critics or other people's reviews. Critics can rave about a movie and I see it and don't like it. They could trash a movie and I love it. A movie can have so much hype then I see it and think that's it? And sometimes I agree so I can only say everyone needs to make up their own minds. I can only speak for myself but I liked The Happening. I have also enjoyed the filmmakers other movies: Sixth Sense,Signs and The Village.<br/><br/>The Happening has the quietness and relationship aspects (like the Village) which I loved the most and the creepy what's going on, message that Signs did. Some of the dialog had campy humor but overall I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I loved the Philadelphia scenery and references to things currently going on in the city, like the newspaper headline being Killadelphia (referencing the city's crime/murder problem) and seeing the usage of the city's newscasters.<br/><br/>The quietness,the creepiness and the what's happening fear played very well and like an old time movie. Some of the deaths scenes had me closing my eyes. One of the things I enjoyed the most was the Elliot and Alma relationship, which they were having problems but truly love each other, and I wanted to see more of it. I think Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel did a great job.<br/><br/>For me the happening is a great movie."

I was amazed by some of the scenes, they looked really awesome, and some deaths were, well, quite metal, but the overall performance by the actors ruined what could've been potentially good scenes. They even go so far as to point out the mood that is implied by the actors in some scenes. If I could rate it in the negatives, I would.<br/><br/>If you like movies that have good plots, surprising twists, good acting, and most importantly, quality, this movie is certainly not for you.

The worst thing about this movie is the people killing themselves in different ways, this movie shows you many different ways a human can kill himself, watching a person committing suicide is one of the worst things to watch, let alone watch it so many times in one movie.<br/><br/>2. The second worst thing is the story and the repetitive of how what happens is ""act of nature"" and that we ""will never find an explanation for"".<br/><br/>3.

"ToddWebb","9","3","8","25 November 2008"," So much better than the reviews it's received!
","This movie is NOT BAD! I had such incredibly low expectations after reading the reviews here on IMDb. I was hesitant to see this. But I have loved M. Night's other works, and I kinda like Wahlberg too. So I spent the dollar at RedBox to rent it. I just now finished watching The Happening.<br/><br/>This movie is really worth watching! Of course, I really like sci-fi flicks, especially smart ones. I can't understand how this movie is rated to low? I can only guess that people want Bruce Willis or Will Smith to swoop in and blow up bad guys, or something equally lame.<br/><br/>This movie is suspenseful, slow, and deliberate. What can I say, I liked it a lot. The few key characters introduced seemed like real people. I cared about them and wanted them to succeed and survive. Isn't that the most important thing in a movie? Several other reviews here on IMDb stated specifically that that first half of the movie was good, or even great, but that the second half fell apart or lost the audience. I kept watching, waiting for that moment where the story jumps the shark and suckiness ensues. Alas, no suck was to be found. I was in suspense til the end.<br/><br/>The weak bits: The acting was spotty. There's a few scenes where the actor's timing appears off or perhaps are over-emotional for the moment. I blame that on editing, really. Also, this movie is very PG. Considering the horrors we are shown (or almost shown), I would expect a lot more cursing. The verbal cleanliness felt unnatural to me.

"revival05","7","3","8","9 November 2008"," By far, the most underrated movie of 2008
","Here's my pick for the most underrated movie of 2008. And man, sometimes you wish you were just like everybody else and didn't have to be in this uncomfortable minority - everybody hates this movie, and everybody hates M. Night Shyamalan. That's too bad. I don't really know why. The Happening is quite great.<br/><br/>The story is brilliantly in your face - all of a sudden, everybody in Central Park, NY, inexplicably commits suicide. Then all over Manhattan this mass event follows - construction workers walks out from shaffolds for no apparent reason. As it turns out, this ""toxin"" as it is called in the movie, spreads throughout the entire East Coast. Why only the East Coast? We don't get to know, we can only speculate (on the same level as the characters, no less) and this is an example of how the movie takes a quite original standpoint. Mark Wahlberg plays a Philadelphia high school science teacher who has to escape along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his co-worker and best friend (John Leguizamo) and this man's daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) - there is clearly something from the past going on between them that we never get to understand, another example of how the movie refuses to explain itself. As it turns out, the directions are few since dead bodies are found by virtually every exit. Wahlberg's character has to do his best to try to get some sense out of the strange events that happens - he has no answers and he has no good plan on how to survive because he's just a human, but by using scientific logic he can conjure up a theory that may or may not be true, but that at least works in order to keep them alive.<br/><br/>It has been a while since I sat through a film that allowed me to breathe and take in what's going on for myself, with obligatory afterthought and a demand of some constant brain activity. Every scene in the film is thematically a question that has no answer, but inspires speculation. I have a theory as to why this film was received so poorly. M. Night Shyamalan is well known for his seemingly natural talent of creating spooky, supernational darkness. Now, the critics are right - nothing in particular happens in this movie. But this is not an action movie. The dark, Shyamalanesquemoodiness was probably taken to it's extreme in the mediocre The Village (2004) and I find it interesting that he can break free from the spook house - or well, judging by the negative response he can't, but I admire him for trying.<br/><br/>And he doesn't make it all easy on himself either. Had he been interested in gaining back his reputation he could have easily made this into a creepy, apocalyptic doomsday-film where Mother Earth Strikes Back and the very nature itself becomes a threat, forcing everybody to stay indoors. Yeah, he could have made a crowdplaser. But, and I think this is the most important thing about the movie and why people don't like it, This is not a horror movie. It's barely a thriller. It's a science-fiction movie, first and foremost. We are not in this to be scared. We are in this to think. Consider how the movie takes place in broad daylight, how there is no suspenseful bit-by-bit-buildup as in, say, Signs (2002) and notice that there is no hints and mysteries given in stock for a surprise ending. No, the hints and mysteries this time leads us into a question mark - what happens is ""an act of nature that we will never fully understand"" as Wahlberg puts it in the beginning of the movie, on another subject. I don't know what to say, I like it. I find it intelligent.<br/><br/>True, The Happening is no masterpiece, it is flawed, at times far fetched and silly, and if it's deliberate or not, well, that's not always easy to understand. It surely bites of a little more than it can chew. But I really like it nonetheless, it was the first movie of the year that instantly made me eager to re-watch it, and I love how Shyamalan doesn't go the traditional way with it, leaving all threads open for interpretation. Sure, there's definitely an environmental message in there (duh...) but it's not taken out of the air (so to speak), and furthermore it's a study of human behavior, all characters act realistically and the film in itself even bears a naturalist air to it, and I don't know about you but I sure miss that amongst todays over-explanatory, steroid pumped thrillers.<br/><br/>The Happening is, I would say, Shyamalan's best movie since Signs, it has gotten an unfair amount of nag and way too little praise. Personally, it gave me back my faith in him as a director that can make his own distinct movies without making them just plain repetitious. I suspect Shyamalan himself didn't expect any ""comeback"" with this movie, I think he has gained is auteur title, and will keep making the films he wants to make, regardless of who will see it or what they will think of it. I, for one, will be looking out for the next one."

"MrPink08","7","3","8","3 July 2008"," If this is the worst M Night can do...he's a good director.
","I have always been a fan of M Night Shymalan and have always taken some ridicule for it after The Village and Lady in the Water, which I personally enjoyed. I already took criticism for The Happening. And yes, I will admit, it was M Night's worst film yet...but that dosen't make it bad.<br/><br/>M Night's latest effort stars Mark Whalberg as a Philadelphia science teacher. Once again, M Night casts a great lead role as Whalberg follows in the steps of Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Paul Giamatti. Whalberg made this film interesting and fun. Shymalan tries to join in on the fun with his plot which features people in the Northeast killing themselves in gruesome ways. One of the reasons this is not Shymalan's best work is that here he tries to frighten us by showing these depictions of death. However, sometimes they just come off silly. For example, one man starts a lawn mower and intentionally allows it to run over him. In addition, one of the things that made M Night's other films successful was his quirky characters, like Abigail Breslin in Signs, when she portrayed Gibson's daughter who had a fear of tap water. Shymalan tries this tactic again in The Happening, but the characters, such as an old lady separated from the rest of society, come off even sillier.<br/><br/>The Happening does redeem itself with its ""monster"". When the carnage first occurs, the initial blame is attributed to terrorists. Later, it is thought that plants have been communicating with each other. Fed up with our treatment, the plants release toxins inside of them, causing humanity to fall one by one. Shymalan passes this test with flying colors. It's almost like he presents us an interesting version of An Inconvenient Truth. Also, Shymalan asks us the question, ""How do you fight and flee from something...when you don't know what it is? It is, indeed, Shymalan's worst effort yet. But when he releases his next film...it's gonna be one heck of a redemption."
"fxystudio","7","3","8","3 July 2008"," People are being way too harsh
","As a thriller, I liked it, I think overall the story telling, the atmosphere worked very well, and for a few moment, it was pretty damn creepy. However, what was drawing me back was the way people killing themselves in the movie. I just don't buy it that when people are losing their mind, speaking confused and losing sense of direction can execute pretty complicated suicide. The part when a man killed himself by lying in front of the grass cutter, I thought it was hilarious. Creepy but hilarious. Another thing was to emphasize that people are losing their sense of direction the director made some characters walking backward. Perfect straight backward. I think this is even harder than walking forward. To me it demonstrated a better sense of direction... I thought the problem was that at some point the director was a little too deep in his own world that he cut some sort of connection with reality. Lady in the water was the first movie that made me feel this way. Nonthless, the movie was well paced, the emotion was well played and the characters were more or less believable. It definitely deserve better than some of the harsh criticism."
"carlabrams","8","3","8","28 June 2008"," An everyman film - which is why people don't get it
","This is not one of the classic movies of all time - Sixth Sense. It still ranks as one of MNS best efforts for me because of what it's not. It's not a typical Hollywood disaster film, and I think that's where the VAST majority of reviewers here miss the boat. This is an everyman film.<br/><br/>What do I mean by that? Simple. Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a goof. He's still a kid at heart, in love with his wife, and a nerd. He's just a guy trying to deal with a situation that he's not used to, being thrust into a leadership role that he's not comfortable with, and trying to survive. Alma Moore (Zooey Deschanel) hasn't quite grown up yet either. She's not sure if she's really married to the right guy, and she's not someone that is comfortable outside of her little circle.<br/><br/>So now you've got two quite ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. How do they react? How do they survive? That's what makes this such a compelling and thoughtful film. Watching Elliot and Alma try to grow beyond the empty and facile people they started as - actually becoming more than they were, such that by the end of the movie you know that they're now mature - that's the point. You don't have to start with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to have a husband and wife that can become heroes and grow beyond themselves.<br/><br/>Many people have commented the rationale behind the disaster is implausible. That's hubris talking - we don't control nature. While it at this point seems unlikely, it is potentially possible for this to occur. Mother Nature is quite capable of wiping out the dominant species on the planet - just ask the dinosaurs."

","First let me say that I have highly enjoyed all of M. Night's other films, including Lady In The Water. Second let me just say that The Happening was one of the most disappointing movie experiences of my entire life. There were no presents under the Christmas tree. Your parents have been lying to you about Santa Claus. This was actually one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Was this kidding? Was the twist supposed to be that people were expecting a good movie and what they got was a big piece of poo? There was no subtext, no subtlety, no underlying anything that made people think, it was just a straightforward finger-pointer we've seen a thousand times, but what makes this one stand out was the inconceivably, unbelievably bad acting. Mark Whalberg was better in his ""Good Vibrations"" video. Remember that? Lifting those weights? That song RULED.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is Zooey Deschanel's blistering blue eyes. Everything else smells like the bathroom after I've gone poo."
"dimlim77","8","3","8","24 June 2008"," What is wrong with you people?
","I always come to IMDb to read reviews by other users before seeing the actual movie. The Happening was one that I have wanted to see from the moment I had heard about it. So, when I heard and read the negative reviews from everybody, I was a little discouraged (especially since Lady in the Water was beyond terrible). But it turns out that you are all on crack.<br/><br/>As you can see from my rating, I really enjoyed this film. It was a comeback in my opinion for Shamalamadingdong. I thought the script was funny, and Wahlberg's seemingly bad acting was his interpretation of this script and I thought he nailed it as did the rest of the cast. I do not think that the actors were here to win Ocars. It seems they came out to have fun with it and it worked. That is why it shocks me to hear such bad things. The tension was there. The comedy was there. The classic Shamalan ending was there.<br/><br/>It just seems that the kind of people who went to see this movie are the ones who are probably pure horror and gore fans and were expecting more and more people to die in this film. Shamalan only had a few deaths shown in this film and then in other scenes he let us assume what was happening. Not everything has to be handed to us on a silver platter.<br/><br/>If you are a true Shamalan fan, then see this movie. It is a film like Unbreakable and Signs where action is not happening all the time but it still keeps you gripping on for more."

"yoshukiu","7","3","8","20 June 2008"," Even if it's Shyamalan's worst yet, it's still excellent.
","M. Night Shyamalan. A man with a unique mind and an amazing talent for film-making. Many reviews of ""The Happening"" disagree with the aforementioned statement, so let me take a moment to attempt to solidify it.<br/><br/>First, Shyamalan's movies are thought-provoking. The movie world in 2008 is not the same as it was when his ""The Sixth Sense"" was in theaters. Audiences have different expectations for movies, with all of the banal action-packed superhero movies being make left and right, especially in the summer. You cannot go into ""The Happening"" expecting it to be something it is not. There is no Hulk smashing buildings, nor are there high-speed car chases or tragically predictable love stories. I truly believe that mindset is the most important thing to enjoying a movie.<br/><br/>With that said, I had extremely high expectations for this movie, especially after the disappointment of ""Lady in the Water."" In many cases, ""The Happening"" fulfilled these expectations, while in a few other ways, it did not.<br/><br/>The script and the pace make this film outstanding. When watching ""The Happening,"" just place yourself in the role of the main characters. How would you react to the events taking place? How each of the characters reacts is extremely realistic, showing just how frightening the truth can be. The fact that this movie takes place over such a short period of time really captures its moments well. Even faced with much larger concerns, the characters do not forget about their personal lives and problems.<br/><br/>Now what is wrong with this movie is the direction--namely its casting of Mark Wahlberg. His character shows far less emotion than he should, and his acting seems so forced it is almost pathetic. The easiest way to put this is that Wahlberg's character says the right things, but in the wrong manner. Throughout the whole movie, as I watched, I pictured Mel Gibson with his masterful and moving performance in ""Signs"" in Wahlberg's place. With Gibson, the movie definitely would have been at least an 8/10.<br/><br/>On a final note, I would like to add that Shyamalan again manages to bring about real world concerns in a fantastical scenario, bringing at least some enlightenment and concern to those who care to listen. Do not go in expecting a gigantic twist; do not go in expecting a little boy to see dead people; ""The Happening"" is a very solid movie. People who appreciated ""Signs"" will almost definitely enjoy Shyamalan's latest installment."

","I just saw this movie and I feel that it was not worth the money I spent on it. The plot dragged for the entire movie and it had no suspense. I also feel that it should not have been advertised with the point of it being rated R as there was close to no attributes of an R rated movie. You will find that in this movie there are many completely unnecessary scenes and at other times will question whether this is a comedy or a horror. There are many points in which you will want to fall asleep during meaningless conversations or parts where truly nothing is happening. With rising gas prices I recommend saving your money for gas."

","This movie was much talked about before its release and why not since it was by the same gentleman who brought ""The Sixth Sense"" on to our screen. To some extent, this has lived up to its hype.<br/><br/>People, walking through New York's Central Park, start to get confused - repeating their words, standing still and then shooting themselves and this is believed to be a terrorist attack. In the meantime, a science teacher, Elliot Moore, is called out of his classroom and is informed that due to the incident in Central Park, the school is closing down and so Elliot and his wife flee the town in a train with their friend and his young daughter, Jess, who starts crying for her mother. Here they are informed by other passengers that the attacks are not just in one place but several and is spreading in the North East area or the country only. The train then comes to a halt in a remote town and everyone on it is informed that this would be the last stop as they had lost communication with everyone else. However, at dinner that night they hear on the news that these suicides are not caused by terrorist attacks but is a natural phenomena.<br/><br/>The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Lequizano and Ashley Sanchez. This is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Though not so good as ""The Sixth Sense,"" this movie is a gripping thriller which has involved some very good special effects. There are scenes of some gruesome nature involving blood and in some scenes, the director very cleverly leaves the imagination to the audience.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A good thriller to watch but don't compare it to ""The Sixth Sense."

","This move is creepy, morbid, violent, and disturbing, but it's also like a car accident; people can't help but watch. There are those who will want to lower there gaze. There are those who will think this movie is made for senseless shock value alone, but these people are the ones missing the point. This movie isn't about sugar, and spice, and everything useless unless you're baking. It's about life, the tress, the flowers, and what we are doing to it, how we are destroying it. We humans have become a force of destruction, and the earth taking notice, finally fights back, killing us just as we kill the plants. Just as the flowers drop dead, we drop dead.Just as the grass turns brown and dies, we die. In this movie humans get what's coming to them.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are uniquely engaging, almost like a nightmare, and they will stay with you. I mean the opening scene alone is a handful of people jumping off a building committing suicide. I had a hard time turning the way people die off in my head at first, but a good movie does that it stays with you.<br/><br/>The movie in its simplest form is a campfire story with a lesson to be learned. The moral of it is to remember ""The Golden Rule"" do onto others as you would have them do onto you."
"rexbot","2","3","8","13 June 2008"," The last Shyamalan film
","Context: I really liked Sixth sense and the village. Lady in the Water and Signs I didn't like but thought they were watchable. Unbreakable was painful to watch but the ending made it worth the effort.<br/><br/>Review: To begin with the characters are unbelievable and shallow. I don't blame the actors, this is in my opinion clearly the fault of the director/screen play. You can see that there is potential but it is never brought forth. One ends up having no emotional connection to the film because one really doesn't care that much if a character lives or dies. They are hollow empty shells whose only use seems to be to give a running verbal dialog of what is visually happening on the screen.<br/><br/>The plot seems to be used solely as a mechanism for the director to give voice to his anti-human political stance. The devices he uses to drive the story forward are crude and intellectually insulting. It seems the director has an exceedingly low opinion of the IQ of his audience, or perhaps it is a simple lack of imagination. As one generally shouldn't blame malice when incompetence will do, I will simply state that I think Mr Shyamalan has lost his talent for story telling.<br/><br/>In certain scenes the visuals in the film seem designed to shock by their graphic nature. As a rule I don't mind this but there seemed to be no point other than to try to 'amp up' what is in reality a very long, drawn out, and rather pointless plot. It is so poorly done that it is in fact almost comical in certain scenes. None of the director's other films rely on gore and one gets the distinct feeling that the director is in desperation trying to rely on a cheap trick rather than put in the effort to tell an entertaining story.<br/><br/>The one redeeming quality of the film is in fact that it is so poorly done. Often when one initially becomes aware of a new film by a director that has done ground-breaking work in the past, one is almost compelled to see it even if their recent films ""haven't worked out"" (we all have bad days). The anticipation mixed with fear can be annoying. This film shows me very clearly that I can now safely ignore any further work from M. Night Shyamalan. I now feel a sense of release and so I am in a perverse way grateful to the director for making this film.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr Shymalan for making some truly wonderful films! Having now finished your movie-making career in style I wish you the best in whatever new field of endeavor has captured your interest."

","After watching ""The happening"" tonight i'm afraid that the answer must be ""YES"". As a warning: This film is a total waste of time. The story is absolute nonsense. The only thing to it are a few mildly shocking scenes, but that's surely not enough to make up 90 Minutes of filming. The acting is terrible too, some scenes are even - unwillingly - funny ( for example Marky Mark talking to a rubber plant ). The only bright spot is John Leguizamos performance, but he appears only in a few scenes. After Shyamalans marvelous films ""The sixth sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and in my opinion even ""The Village"" and ""Signs"" it becomes obvious that Shyamalans days are over even before he turns 40... ""Lady in the water"" could have been a temporarily blackout in his career ( even though LITW has still a better script than ""The happening"" ), but this film absolutely marks the pitiful end to his career as a writer and director. I had really hoped for another ingenious movie from Shyamalan, but alas, all my hopes were destroyed by this piece of absolute rubbish. Please understand one star of my voting as a mere gesture of respect to his former work and the other as a tribute to John Leguizamos appearance."

"Tony1990","Null","5","17","13 June 2008"," Pointless Happening
","This weak mass of a film is a major disappointment from M.Night Shyamalan, director of classic films including The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. The central premise is that nature is striking back at the plague of humans on the planet by releasing an airborne toxin that causes people to kill themselves(the film has a very heavy-handed environmental subtext). While this premise provides for some striking images - dozens of people hurling themselves off building, or hanging like strange fruit from the trees - the film unravels shortly after the opening scenes. Mark Whalberg is horribly miscast as high school science teacher Elliot and Zooey Deschanel, who plays his wife Alma is better at comedy than horror. The movie follows the basic format of a zombie movie, except when people get infected, they kill themselves. The lack of any tangible menace means the film mainly consists of the protagonists running through fields as Shyamalan tries desperately to make shots of grass and trees rustling the wind seem horribly threatening. Try as he might, he can't do it. Worse still, the film doesn't follow any logic - if there's an airborne toxin, surely the first thing you would do would be to find a gas mask or seal yourself up in a relatively airtight building? What Shyamalan does manage to produce here is the world's most sustained suicide - glorifying film."

","Well, I really like Mr. Night Shyamala.. Shamyla... errr, his movies so far. I liked The Village despite its obvious plot flaws and I liked Lady in the Water as well, but this time.. <br/><br/>It is safe to say that the story itself has some potential. It could have been a really scary, entertaining, creepy movie - and it was at least sometimes, the opening sequences were actually really frightening, and Mrs. Jones really made my flesh creep.. But then, bad acting, especially Deschannel, really turned me off. She looked like a small child with wide eyes ALL the time. I felt that her acting resembled that of C-class TV-series actors. <br/><br/>Anyway, the camera did a good job, but the editing sometimes appeared to be quite disrupting and jumped from scene to scene seemingly unmotivated, leaving me behind feeling like only taking glimpses at the story and what happened.<br/><br/>And then there are the countless implausibilities and very ""unlikely"" events - and I'm not speaking of the story itself which was as I said not bad, better to say, promising.. No, the events as presented in the movie more than once let me think ""yeah, right...""<br/><br/>Overall it was, despite the flaws in and the criticism on the movie-making handicraft and acting, an interesting movie, unconventionally and sometimes quite surrealistically filmed (as always with Mr. Night S. - I guess this times the unconventional and unsteady editing contributed to that feeling) and some good ideas and really good and scary scenes, but it seemed to be done in a rush, not very caring, not really a work of heart but a remittance work. <br/><br/>BUT: I can't help but somehow I can't stop thinking about the movie.. It still works in my brain, and not in a bad way. Hmmmm....."

I have to admit I have never seen anything quite like this, it definitely caught a lot of people by surprise.<br/><br/>We are living on times that almost every movie that comes out is a sequel or at least look like one. We've seen so many tsunamis of pre-fabricated clichés, copies and plain rip-offs that we forgot the real meaning of what is really a ""new movie"".<br/><br/>It is true, this one is not for everybody. Unfortunately, in order to really ""get"" this movie it is required to whoever is watching it to have a brain.<br/><br/>If your thing is movies that just tells you how to think or even better, does not require that you do any thinking at all, this is not the right choice for you.<br/><br/>Not even the awful performances of the leading actors was enough ruin this movie.

I did like Sixth Sense (even though it had no rewatchability what so ever), and Unbreakable, and Signs had its good moments. But his last two movies were terrible, and I really didn't think anyone could make a worse movie than Lady In The Water. But leave it to M. Night to top that. Usually he at least has good cinematography or some sort of suspense, but no you get none of that. I suggest you stay for the first 10-15 min. and walk out and ask for your money back you will have seen all the merit-able footage this movie has to offer even the suicide scenes are terrible. This was a D-movie with worse acting and probably one of the worst scripts I have ever heard. But I will give it one thing it is probably the best comedy of the year so far, I could not stop laughing, while the whole time trying to figure out if M. Night had tried to make a bad film or not because I really don't think if you were trying to make a good film this is what you would settle for. I honestly can not believe that M.

His character is quite strange and fragile, and he is not really brave or anything..<br/><br/>The ending might be a little thin, but I like the fact that it didn't end in your typical action-packed, hero-has-to-save-the-day-by-fighting-the-terrible-monster climax!

"frederik-aerts","9","4","13","13 June 2008"," Close your window ... but open your mind
","For me this was a terrific movie. Though I can understand a lot of people did and will not like it. Why? Most movies handle about extraordinary situations combined with extraordinary people: they have special powers, are very creative, show strong leadership. What about a movie where you have an extraordinary situation with 'ordinary' people? That's what the happening is all about. The situation is really extraordinary: flora is doing some nasty teamwork that threatens mankind! But there's no hero! Elliot Moore is not the biologist that goes in counter attack (i.e. by finding some cure that makes us resistant against this act of nature) nor is he the creative leader that comes up with a brilliant plan to 'bewilder' plant life.<br/><br/>After seeing such an intense trailer for some months it can be quite a disappointment having to cope with the above (only regular hesitant people in a remarkable situation). Maybe I was influenced by reading some bad reviews upfront and was therefore surprised with this subtle thriller.<br/><br/>I'm asking myself: if this movie was not promoted as a blockbuster, would it then get better critics? Maybe, but it's hard to say afterward. 'I am legend' was not your typical blockbuster movie  even though it was put forward as such  and still it became a hit.<br/><br/>As I see it, Mr. Shyamalan wanted to let the situation be the main actor and did his utter best not to let anything take over (Mark Wahlberg definitely could have  if the script allowed it). Even though this movie was working just fine for me, I'm sure it would score better if [1] the trailer had not made us think this would be a fast paced and powerful movie from head to toe or [2] let mankind be more in control."
"dcbb","10","3","9","3 August 2008"," Well done film, EXTREMELY funny
","This movie was obviously not meant to be taken seriously. The characters, story, and places are all satires on Shyamalan's previous movies; he's making fun of his own corniness.<br/><br/>The fact that wahlberg's character is a science teacher is hilarious. He tells his students, ""there are some things in nature we will never understand and we have to accept that..."" The most obvious point to make here is that this is not science. No science teacher would ever believe such a statement. So why was wahlberg's character a science teacher? To further highlight the absurdities in this film. And probably to make the scene in the field possible. (where upon facing gunshots and plant-induced death, he recites the scientific method to himself)<br/><br/>The stops on the characters' journey throughout the movie represent different films done by Shyamalan. The old lady's house, for example, is very reminiscent of the end of Signs. And the way she invites them into her home ('i suppose i should let you stay the night,' etc...) is playing on the ridiculous characters we often encounter in these types of movies, living on their own in the woods, etc. And you may notice that the first thing she says to her guests is that there is a speaking tube between the main house and the slave quarters. This is a not-so-subtle foreshadowing that pays homage to the same technique often used in horror movies.<br/><br/>I could go on, but i would rather be watching The Happening, a fantastic movie. And that is all it is. There is no hidden message here, just somelighthearted fun on Shyamalan's part, which he does very very well.<br/><br/>Another thing he did very well is fool all of you. Congratulations, M. Night Shyamalan got the best of you. He built his career around hidden messages, pulling the audience closer and closer to look for meaning in his works. Then with this most recent piece, he got himself an R rating (to complete the comedy) and has had all of you stumped for months trying to find meaning where there is none.<br/><br/>Think of it as a comedy, and it's brilliant."

","There is nothing scary about this movie except that it has an audience of some fans out there who find it entertaining. Is this M. Night Shyamalan's entry into the current genre of torture porn? These comments come from a seasoned (42 years old) horror fan who found this movie more offensive than anything else, and I have defended ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" for over 30 years to people from all walks of life. TMC is certainly sedate to the genre films of today, but I am making the point that I am not a squeamish. I have found worth in a lot of extreme cinema. Suicide is not scary it's pathetic and sad. There is NO possible way plant produced neurotoxins could make people kill themselves. I can maybe see zombied people being unable to prevent being killed in accidents and hurting others, but doing it. The explanation is stupid. M. Night needs to read more about the human brain. Suicide is a thought related process, meaning they need to be aware on some level of the act. His self preservation malfunction is no excuse. The creative ways these victims commit suicide is an exercise in tasteless cinema. Did M. Night see the Japanese movie ""Kairo"" (Pulse)? In this movie, there was a mysterious global happening of mass suicides being caused by dead people luring the living to the other side. You may ask, isn't that as impossible as plants making people commit suicide? Maybe so, but it was certainly less gruesome not focusing on gore. I just read that Stephen King liked this movie. I can believe that since much of his work is recycled ideas. Sorry M. Night you lost most of us with ""Signs."" It was the sign to us that you were on your way out as our future Hitchcock. Here's an idea, mass groups of theater goers all walk in front of cars after see a movie because they feel ripped off. It could be a global happening."

","Shyamalan's movies are always about heart. The human's heart. To understand his story, and the implication that he wishes to convey with his movies, one just have to LET GO of his mind, go back to his heart, just watch.<br/><br/>Same with this movie, The Happening. There is no intellectual. There is no logic or illogic. There is no cleverness. There is no brain. There is no mind. There is no thinking. There is nothing. Yeah, I sound like a mystic. But Shyamalan understand the mystical way of the world. His movies are always not about the brain, it is all about the heart. If you use your brain, just cannot let it go, just keep on thinking and thinking and thinking and arguing and arguing, non-stop, you will not understand.<br/><br/>I know, letting go of the brain to watch this movie sounds like an idiot. But remember one thing. All mystics, all religious masters ever existed, having existed and existing, know one thing that is very important but ordinary guys like you and me simply love to ignore, that is, to let go of the mind, eventually.<br/><br/>Most people just cannot let go of their mind. Therefore they find it very difficult to understand this movie, treating this movie like trash. All because, they live in the mind for so long, just cannot let go, cannot trust their heart to simply feel and understand the movie.<br/><br/>Do you know why those people in the movie can't help but killing themselves? Because they, like you and me, live in the mind and rely too much on it. Too much relying on the mind, sooner or later, you may feel like you want to kill yourselves to end all this misery, because the MIND is the only source of misery. Nothing else. It is because of the mind, you want to kill yourselves, simple as that. But can you get it?<br/><br/>Do you know why the 3 main actors can survive in the Happening? Because they are PURE. They are in the HEART. There is goodness in them. There is LOVE in them. Innocent is with them. All the goodness I mentioned above, trust me ,most people simply just have lost them. That is why, they do not understand. They just rely to much on their brain.<br/><br/>Yeah, in the movie, the Act of Nature kills. Why it kills we never know. But one thing that I know, or understand, is that, the nature won't hurt another nature. So why hurt those people? Because those people, like you and me, keep themselves away of the nature, and live in the brain. In other words, they become no longer part of the nature. Because they choose to do so. They choose to over-rely their brain.<br/><br/>The Act of Nature do not kill the main actors, simply because, they are still with the mother nature. They are love, innocence, heart, pure. The nature treats them as their own, that is why they survive. They are survive because they are NATURE. Never part from the nature.<br/><br/>If you do not understand, you have to find ways to do so, because living all the time in the mind and over-dependent on it is not life. Letting it go is."
"mausar","7","3","9","3 July 2008"," B-Movie + Philosophy = this nice and entertaining movie
","The Happening is a very nice movie. Here Night M. Shyamalan did not his best (""Signs"" is my favourite and ""The Sixth Sense"" is a little masterpiece), but he did a very nice and entertaining thriller movie. Like all his other works, Shyamalan starts with one of the fundamental philosophical questions of this time and he tries to answer with a B-Movie theme. In ""Sings"" the fundamental question was ""Does God exists?"" and the B-Movie theme was an alien's invasion. In this case, the fundamental question is: ""Is man the cancer of our planet?"" and the B-Movie theme is an unstoppable pandemic deadly disease. The plot is a typical pandemic movie, but this is not a B-Movie at all: complex characters, realistic situations and shocking scenes of massive suicides give great depth to this movie. There is something wrong with acting: all actors (Zooey Deschanel, Mark Wahlberg and all the others) are always astonished, sometimes they act as alienated people. This is a characteristic of all Shyamalan's works, but in this movie it could be a bit disturbing. Shyamalan creates suspense. And he re-creates very well a desperate situation where humanity is struggling against an unknown, invisible and very powerful enemy. In this struggle there are no heroes, but only victims or lucky people, like in ordinary reality. And all this stuff is really, really entertaining! His plot is very coherent with the fundamental question ""Is man the cancer of our planet?"". He answers in the very end of the movie. Personally I don't agree with Shyamalan's answer. But I don't want to reveal it. Go to theater and watch it!"

People pause, walk backwards and become truly dead meat for some lions or paper to a industrial sized John Deer. Those two suicides were my favorite because they were original and not to mention hilarious.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there were also clever funnies added in. When Walhberg talked to the plastic plant changed the tone from a suspenseful feeling into a joyful and humorous one.<br/><br/>To maintain a serious plot, Shamalan added some key ""sad"" points such as the death of the little lassie's father.<br/><br/>Another great factor was the many hints that plants were making the 70's hit ""Raining Men"" come true.

Not the case here, no adrenalin shoot, junkies; That's why this movie has strong IMDb rates at 10 and 1 levels. I enjoyed it because I followed the characters as if I was there with them. It's very human, simple, natural, realistic. A form of docu-movie. It has a slow-fast pace, as the threat itself. A bit of satyajit Ray and Hitchcock in it.

I don't know if it was the actors who stopped caring or that the script was so poorly written, but almost every line of that movie was entirely unconvincing. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor, but even his lines were given in dead fragments and statements, lacking any quality of suspense expected from an R rated horror film. Secondly, was there really a full plot? So the movies starts, the 'happening' starts to happen, and then the movie ends. There is no conflict resolution what-so-ever. People start killing themselves then they stop killing themselves. It all turns out to be a ghastly attempt of Shymalan's to try and raise awareness of global warming. Last question, why did people clap after I saw this movie? Some people just like to see blood and some gruesome deaths, which is about the only thing this movie had (but something that still could have been improved.)"

If you are not willing to allow yourself to think then you should not view any of his films. Why? Because all of his films receive the same negativity in the beginning until viewers take a step back and think outside of the realm we are used to. We are handed plot lines and action on a silver platter. We are not expected to sit still and contemplate the texts sunk into the greater picture. We are handed everything and only expected to buy more popcorn and be content with the information being handed to us.

Elliot Moore (casted by Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher that is faced with these harsh situations where people are dying from unknown causes. He works together with Alma Moore (casted by Zooey Deschanel) to protect themselves and Jess, daughter of fellow teacher Julian (casted by John Leguizamo).<br/><br/>Shyamalan delivers the message in a thoughtful way to continually question ourselves as to what may happen since nature is an unpredictable force. With this harsh reality in view, it may be sensible to question our own actions as to what we are doing to this world and how we may be hurting it. Too many people live each day without worrying about consequences after throwing out emissions from our gas-guzzling cars and pollutants. Shyamalan delves into one of those possible consequences, and that would be nature fighting back to survive.<br/><br/>With an open mind and the ability to go past some of the horribly written lines and awkward acting by Mark Wahlberg, a viewer can experience a possible horror in this world that may become a reality someday in the future. Shyamalan seems to tell us that the unlikely and the seemingly impossible is actually quite possible, but only if we are able to see them happening before our very eyes. However, with this horror film, it is better to question our own actions before horrid consequences may arise."

"mr_popcorn","7","3","9","15 June 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""The Happening""
","I don't know what the hell is up with the people saying that this film sucked bigtime or M. Night losing his touch, going downhill blah blah blah. This film was good that's that. Some people just hate M. Night so much that when they entered the theaters, their minds is set for one thing: this movie is bad. They didn't even give the film a chance, those Night haters weren't looking for the good things, they're looking for the bad. ""Mark Wahlberg's weakest performance"" this, ""where the hell is the twist?"" that. Okay, this may not be Night's best film ever (Sixth Sense for life) but this isn't his worst either (Lady in the Water still holds the title). This film is good, it may have its fair share of gaping plot holes or absurd sequences, but the film as a whole is good. Here's why: first, the acting. Mark's performance wasn't that bad, the critics had it all wrong. His performance was supposed to be that way, childish, immature and a guy who freaks out a lot. Remember the scene where he's teaching a class and then ducks when he sees the vice principal? Then there's this scene about the cough syrup thing which sounds like it came from a 10 year old and then there's the part where he freaked out and he says ""Just give me a minute!"", its all intentional. His character is supposed to be childish and immature because in the end, it will be a big factor for their survival. The same thing can be applied to Zooey Deschanel's character Alma. Alma is as childish as Mark's character Elliot.<br/><br/>So you see, the people who saw the performance and disliked it got it all wrong, it was actually pretty good. Second, the whole ""Where's the twist?"" bit. Okay, when Night made ""Sixth Sense"", the audience dug the whole twist in the end and they wanted more twists out of him, and so he did in three more films. They got pretty bored with the twists so Night stopped and made two twist-less films. And then when he made this film, with his infamous twist being a no-show, the people didn't like it mainly because the juicy twist isn't present. I swear when I saw the film when the credits rolled, I heard this guy saying: ""Where the hell is the twist? Oh my, this movie is ----"". A bit of advice to Night, don't listen to other people. Just follow what's in your gut because the people have different tastes and you can't satisfy them all so follow your instincts.<br/><br/>And lastly, the plants did it. In case you were wondering who killed those people. The plants were releasing toxins that's blocking some neurotransmitters in the human brain doing some bad stuff, fatal stuff into your body. I thought the plot was really good. Nobody has ever done a film about killer plants in the past 25 years, 50 years maybe. An original concept but people are just too busy bashing Night and putting his head in the gutter. I'm not a fanboy of his or whatever, I just wanted to straighten some things about this film. I know a bad film when I see one and this one isn't. Its too bad the majority of the people are Night haters.<br/><br/>7/10"

","M. Night Shyamalan's hype and standard probably did him little justice in this film. The ratings I saw on IMDb seemed on target with how I felt with the movie.<br/><br/>The acting seemed a little uneasy at times, I just found it hard to see Mark Wahlberg as a school teacher. Betty Buckley's character in the film was one of the stronger performances and really moved the opening day crowd I saw at the theater.<br/><br/>The movie keeps you on edge at times and has some very interesting and creative death scenes.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies, that after you watch it, you ask your friends, ""wow, what if that really happened?

"hans_jenssen","6","3","9","14 June 2008"," Thrills, chills, people standing still...
","So far, I think viewers have been a little tough on this movie, perhaps because of Shymalan's reputation. A good amount of people who went to see ""The Happening"" loved ""The Sixth Sense"" and hoped for something of that caliber. However, Shymalan may have peaked a bit early -- and you can't hold that against him. Though not as fantastically terrifying and mind-bending as ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Happening"" holds its own as a decent (but not terrific) horror film. Compare it to most horror films you'd see in theaters now. I would recommend ""The Happening"" to any horror buff or individual simply seeking a gore fix/adrenaline shot. It does have its graphic death scenes, and it does have its ""jump"" moments. They were mostly shoved into the first half of the film, but still... prepare to hold onto your popcorn. While the elements we always seek in the horror films (suspense, violence, scariness) are all pretty much there, ""The Happening"" also brings definite creepiness to the table. Get used to the hairs raising on your arms whenever the phenomenon strikes another population... The unsuspecting residents of whichever city being hit with the strange effects of... well, I won't tell you... stand perfectly still, frozen in whatever they were doing. And then they end their own lives. Not gracefully. It creeped me out in a manner unlike that of any horror film I've seen. It struck an emotional chord no films have gotten to, for me. While I did expect a Shymalan twist, and was slightly disappointed by the last half hour, it was all worth it for those genuinely disturbing moments. Say what you will. For me, ""The Happening"" definitely happened."

The script is terrible. The dialog is so terrible many of us in the theater laughed out loud and yet the movie wasn't quite bad/good enough for the ""so-bad-it's-at-least-funny"" pile, which Lady in the Water was bad/good enough for. This movie is a complete disappointment on every level. The trailer looked decent so I thought I'd give M Night another chance but this movie sucks and I now have officially given up on him. I don't even like Sixth Sense any more now that I've seen it three times and realize it was overrated even by myself somehow! One last note, why on earth does M Night Shyamalan keep putting himself in his own movies? He really truly can't act at all. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bad. Why is he ruining his own movies? If he's not good enough to get parts in other people's movies he should give up his acting dream."

This movie is plain and simply horrible, the plot has no substance, the actors are clearly not convincing in their roles, the explanation for the events that occur are predictable, the ending is mediocre and the movie is poorly made.<br/><br/>I counted three shots in which the boom was clearly on camera (when the character Zooey Deschanel- Alma Moore is ignoring the phone in the living room in one of the first scenes and one of them is on the model home they find while talking).<br/><br/>Save yourself the horrible disappointment of watching this ""horror"" movie and rent the orphanage if you haven't seen it yet which is a great scary movie."
"videogamesgirl","5","3","9","13 June 2008"," Utterly disappointed
","After seeing this movie, I left the movie theater thinking ""What happened?"". That's it, just so utterly confused. I mean, seriously. What happened?! I wanna start off by saying: this is not a bad movie. That is, by conventional means. If you have no idea who Shyamalan is, if you don't care, or you just like over-the-top gory movies and you go into it expecting nothing you could watch this movie. You might even enjoy it. It was a very good idea that was just not executed to its potential. If you're a loyal Shyamalan fan expecting his comeback, don't even bother. You'll be greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie starts out very promising. The opening scene is gorgeous, appropriately and unsuspectingly haunting, and most importantly, shocking at the last minute. Graphic enough to shake you but not too gory so as to disgust you, which is very much Shyamalan's style. Which is exactly what leads to confusion later on. As early as the second scene, they're at it again. Another shock, except this one lingers far too long and is way too intrusive. Wait, this is a Shyamalan movie right? Okay, no biggie, a fumble, that's all, I figured. They give us a break in the third scene, and the fourth scene, guess what? There it is again! Blood! Gore! Graphic violence! Okay, now I'm getting suspicious. And it really just goes downhill from there. While I do applaud the grotesquely creative ways in which he imagines people killing themselves, by the time the scene with the lions came, it was just enough. I don't need to see this. No one does. It's offensive and condescending to his fans. The best Shyamalan movies show you only what you absolutely need to see, they trust their audience to be smart enough to surmise the outcome on their own. The movie itself is smart. But not here. We get every single detail of every gory death, hints thrown in our faces every 5 seconds (the writing on the blackboard takes the cake, they just told you the whole damn story!), but no discernible plot, characters, or story to speak of. I was scared throughout the movie, but for all the wrong reasons. I was scared what I was gonna see next!<br/><br/>The acting is beyond unbelievable. Wahlberg just doesn't seem to care, Deschanel looks and acts like she's stoned half the movie, and Leguizamo stumbles through his words like he just got around to reading the script the night before. No one delivers a good or even decent performance. The characters are shallow; the romance subplot is laughable at best, and the synergy of collaboration is completely nonexistent. Where's Bruce Willis or Joaquin Phoenix? Why couldn't he get one of them? <br/><br/>Lastly, there's the environmentalist pitch. I never would have pegged Shyamalan for an environmentalist, if that even is his doing, but while the message is indeed a good one, the whole delivery of it is blatantly on the nose. ""If you don't stop destroying the planet, this is what's gonna happen to you *shaking finger*"". Again, offensive and condescending! Enough of this! <br/><br/>All in all, this is really not a bad movie- if you expect nothing. And I do mean NOTHING. As in, not good acting, not good screen writing, and not good storytelling. Nothing at all. Just a lot of pointless violent deaths. If you're a die-hard Shyamalan fan like myself, this is absolutely unacceptable. The Sixth Sense was excellent, and Unbreakable was absolutely superb. Signs and The Village were good. Lady in the Water was just tolerable. With The Happening, it may be time for us to finally accept that our revered god of directing has peaked. This just never feels quite like a Shyamalan movie. I can't believe that it is. What happened?"

","The Happening is a great departure from Shyamalan's previous films. Many have talked about this film getting an R rating but I found the most noticeable difference to be the black humor in it. I have always been a Shyamalan fan but must admit that his films often seem to be taking themselves too seriously. Not so in this film! There is plenty of comic relief between the scares (Elliot talking to a plant, a man who brings a load of hot dogs with him in the evacuation) as well as humor in the violence itself. Let's face it: It's hard to take a movie seriously when a man feeds his own arms to a lion or a woman stabs herself with a knitting needle. You have to laugh at that, but that is intentional. The point of this movie to be an entertaining B movie and I'd say it succeeds. The concept is original and generally the film is fun to watch."

And then at the end of the movie I get the impression that this movie was a warning about global warming. I don't know if anyone else got that impression, but I did. I won't tell you not to waste your money, but I'm also not going to tell to you not to see it.<br/><br/>Dialouge-5/10, acting 6/10, plot, 10/10, directing, 8/10, overall 7/10."
"low_kix","7","3","9","13 June 2008"," The Hypening...
","Let me start by saying i was super excited to see this movie. NOT because of the extensive advertising, proudly proclaiming this to be ""Shyamalans first R rated film,"" but because i hold this film maker in very high regards. From the 6th sense to the village, he wrote and directed 4 truly great films, establishing himself as the new master of suspense. The Hitchcock of our time. What made these films so effective was the way they worked on multiple levels - signs wasn't REALLY about aliens, but it was a way into a deeper story. He has a very natural ability to suck an audience in...<br/><br/>Then came lady in the water. Even though i knew next to nothing about the movie, i saw it in theaters. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen at the multiplex. However, i have been able to forgive M Night of this one self-indulgent flop. A Hollywood film for your little girls. Well, glad you got it out of your system...<br/><br/>SO, that brings us to the Happening, M Nights return to form it seemed. Well... yes and no. As with his earlier films, its not REALLY about what it seems. One big problem I had, which isn't necessarily Mr Shyamalans fault, is SO much was given up in the previews to the movie. The first half hour has little shock value due to what we've already seen on TV, and many more events later in the film are seen a mile away, again, because of our previous knowledge from the previews. Also, the supernatural element of the movie (which actually isn't too supernatural this time around) isn't shrouded in nearly as much secrecy as his previous works, which makes it harder to build suspense.<br/><br/>As with every one of Shyamalans efforts, you couldn't ask for a better or more appropriate cast. In a complete 360 from his roles in films like the Departed, Wahlberg plays a gentle, even goofy high school science teacher. Its nice to see a character in a horror situation keep his wits and not be reduced to over reacting (or over ACTing) or going mad. His wife is a interesting enough character, but isn't really given enough material to run with. All supporting actors fit their characters to a T, especially the scared military man and the weird plant guy.<br/><br/>The conclusion doesn't go for the knockout, as several of Shyamalans movies do, but thats OK. The story ends gracefully, and lingers for a bit, never really being wrapped up tightly. An appropriate ending given the nature of the story. Still, it will leave some audience members upset and feeling empty.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a satisfying experience, and the film makes good use of its R rating without using mindless gore. Still, i find myself waiting for M Night to return to top form..."

","I just watched an early showing of this movie at my local theatre and paid $5 instead of going last night to the midnight showing and paying roughly double that and I couldn't be happier. I'm only happy about the fact that I saved myself $5. This movie was awful! I want to like this director, but he has lost it in my opinion. His past three movies have all been terrible! The village was stupid. Lady in the Water was weak. This one takes the cake, though. The only reason I gave this movie any rating at all was for two reasons. When the chick stabs herself in the throat, that was badass. Also, Mark Wahlberg was funny in the movie. It may as well have been a comedy. All they did was promote the gore and the fact that Shymalan had never went hard-core enough to get an R rating. It didn't matter. This movie was terrible. Once is a aberration. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern."

","I think M Night Shyamalan has lost his Sixth Sense, I can see the Signs, its clearly Happening.<br/><br/>I think there must be a reason why you want to spook people, some message you want to get across. If suddenly people start killing themselves, and it spreads like an epidemic throughout the north-east of USA, then for sure it spooks you. Also people finding different innovative ways of killing themselves doesn't make for pleasant watching in the best of times / movies. And it drags  more people kill themselves, we get exposed to some of the classic American nut-cases, then more people kill themselves. And we still don't know why Mark Wahlberg, as a science school teacher, plays his part pretty convincingly. Somehow, recently, I've had an overdose of him, having seen him in 'The Invincible', and 'The Shooter' apart from 'The Italian Job' (the remake, one of my favourite movies). Maybe it's a sign ? He was good in this movie as well, trying to manage his wife and a kid while trying to figure out whats happening amidst the bewildering going-ons. It's a well made film, as far as the art of film-making goes. Some nice jokes, a lot of tension, some emotion etc. But you cant help but wonder what was the point of it all !? I loved Sixth Sense, didn't think much of Signs and successfully dodged his other movies (Village, Lady in the Water). I think the director is on a non-stop downward spiral. I was proud of myself for predicting the ending, for predicting the way he would end the film. Until my wife cattily remarked it could be because I've started thinking like him. After watching the Happening, that wasn't a compliment For more reviews, read apurvbollywood at blogspot Thx"

","This is only one man's opinion, but i can't see anyone enjoying this pile. Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't the worst he's made (lady in the water, the village) but it sure makes me wonder why he's still getting work. There are tons of flaws to be found in 'The Happening', even the name doesn't make sense (much like the rest of the film) or the R rating for that matter. <br/><br/>For the life of me, I have no idea why this movie had an R rating, every time someone kills themselves the viewer either got to see some feet and hear a gunshot or the picture cut away to others characters reactions. The one scene that could have given this movie an R rating was the one with the lions, but still it was probably the worst death scene in the movie and probably should have been cut out. they didn't even swear once throughout the entire movie which brings me to my next point. <br/><br/>The dialog is horrendous! I don't care who you are, where your from, what you think and like, nobody acts the way that the characters in the movie do. for example, the little girl in the movie cries once when she knows her parents died, yet about 5 minutes later she seems relatively fine, no bad thoughts in her brain. the amount of calm in the movie makes me wonder in Mr. M. Night has ever truly been scared in his life, because his screen writing suggest that he hasn't.<br/><br/>I could go on about this for pages, but my fingers would get tired, so to sum this up.... The acting is sub-par Marky Mark gives one of his worst performances, and even johnny Legs (one of my favorite actors) disappointed. The dialog is horrible. The cinematography is completely lack luster. There is not one scary part in this movie, not even a cheap thrill, in fact the spookiest part of the movie was the mirrors trailer before it. Also, if your into gore and are hoping to find a rated R gore fest, look somewhere else. And the final kicker, this entire film made Absolutely no sense, and had Absolutely no point for the most part. The idea the plants cause people to kill themselves is just plan stupid. If you really want to see, I cant stop you. but if you go, you should probably sneak in, I know i would be pretty angry if I had to pay to be bored for 2 hours."

","I missed the first half hour of this, a production to which my TV Guide gave only one star out of four. That often make me anxious to see it.<br/><br/>By the time I tuned it, it was clear that this was one of those extended ""Twilight Zone"" episodes with some unseen force following a horde of refugees seeking safe zones somewhere in the Northeastern United States before they suddenly stand stock still, get all paranoid, begin repeating themselves like deranged robots, and finally commit suicide. (One guy lies down and gets himself run over by a mobile wood chopper or some similar device.) The force, whatever it is, seems connected to plant life and is carried by the wind.<br/><br/>It's a ridiculous movie. I've seen Mark Wahlberg in other films and thought he was fine, and at least in one case (""The Departed"") outstanding. Here, as the central figure, he seems to go out of his way to prove that he can't act. The other performances are okay, and Zooey Deschanel is quite appealing.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find it was all written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who is a thoughtful and intelligent movie maker. Man, does he make mistakes in judgment here. Enormous close ups of faces are frequent, and a wide-angle lens turns the features into those of a porpoise. It's especially painful when Wahlberg is staring directly into the camera and shouting entreaties to an unseen listener. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the photography passes muster. The weeds, the trees, the flowers are all furiously green. It was shot largely in the suburbs of Philadelphia. One scene is supposed to take place in Princeton, New Jersey, an area I'm familiar with, but the placid and empty residential streets we see resemble Princeton as it was fifty years ago. Today it's a bustling industrial park full of glitz and commotion. <br/><br/>Anyway, as it develops, plants can communicate with each other and some can even secrete substances that repel others of their species. That's why, when you see a desert with creosote bushes, they're all so evenly spaced that they look as if they were planted. And, if attacked by parasite, some plants secrete a vapor that attracts predators that feed on the parasite. In Polynesia there is a plant called a mile-a-minute vine, and when you touch one of its miniature leaves, they all shrivel up as if afraid they'll be eaten. Oh, they're canny alright, smarter than we give them credit for.<br/><br/>Can I quote a stanza from Karl Shapiro's poem, ""A Cut Flower""? Is it permitted? Because it's relevant to the film's message.<br/><br/>She tended me and held me by my stalk. Yesterday I was well, and then the gleam, The thing sharper than frost cut me in half. I fainted and was lifted high. I feel Waist-deep in rain. My face is dry and drawn. My beauty leaks into the glass like rain. When first I opened to the sun I thought My colors would be parched. Where are my bees? Must I die now? Is this a part of life?<br/><br/>The gleaming thing that's ""sharper than frost"" is a pair of scissors. It's the problem that underlies the film and provides it with a message. We're cutting down too many trees and other plants and they're responding defensively. But, don't think of this as unambiguous, or some kind of eco-leftist tract. It's not explained until the end, and then only in a TV interview hosted by a skeptic, and the argument is explained by a professor who looks and acts like a neural shambles. You wouldn't buy a potted African violet from this man, let alone a botanical and moral theory."

","Worst Films ever! I get this film I really do – I understand that this is Shyamalans' take on the 9/11 attacks but it is just a terrible film.<br/><br/>The time counter that appears every now and again is running along a timescale that is the same as the 9/11 attacks, the scenes have tried to be too clever in portraying this with bodies falling from buildings and mass paranoia & confusion along with an unknown enemy throughout.<br/><br/>The problem iswelleverything! Firstly I must just say that I have seen a lot of films in my time and I am a fan of B-movies and low budget horror films as much as the next guy so I know a bad film when I see one but bad films can be good if they know their limits.<br/><br/>'The Happening' could have been made with a budget a tenth the size of the $60million allocation that it received and it most likely would have been better. How on Earth they spent $60m on this picture I'll never know?! The Director said that it should be viewed as a B-Movie as that is what he intendedthen he should have used the budget of a B-Movie and made it exactly what it isbut he has failed.<br/><br/>The acting is terrible from the likes of Mark Wahlberg & John Leguizamo that is not really to be expected & even the delectable Zooey Deschanel turns in her worst performance to date. There is no real emotion or feeling put forward from any of the actors in the film and you need to have some strong emotions dealing with potentially the end of the Human race surely.<br/><br/>Okay so plants killing people is not the most logical or best of ideas but it has been done well before – see 'The Ruins' & 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', original or even remakes. Even 'The Invasion' was better than this failure and that is saying something.<br/><br/>Shyamalan tries to scare us with the threat of the plants byyep you guessed itshowing the wind breezing through the canopy of trees and the blades of grass on the ground. If he was trying to make a parable about the way we disrespect our planet then there are a million better ways to do it. This just doesn't work in any way whatsoever.<br/><br/>The special effects or complete lack of them for a $60m dollar movie are terrible. A highlight of bad effects is when the car crashes into the tree in fast motion and people fly out of the front windowcringe worthy.<br/><br/>I had read the reviews of this film previous to watching it and it seemed like it could be okay so I gave it a chance with an open unbiased mind and to be honest I almost turned it off halfway through.<br/><br/>It would have been a much better film if the old lady at the end were the cause of The Event but that risk is never taken sadly. One of the worst films ever made. 1/10"
"Agnelin","Null","2","5","16 April 2009"," This is a good movie, don't listen to the haters
","That M. Night Shyamalan is perhaps the most hated and slammed film-maker of the present day is a fact beyond any debate. I have to admit that I was very disappointed at the movies he made after ""The sixth sense"", and that I didn't like any of them. However, I can't understand why so many critics and anonymous viewers of all kinds seem to have this negative prejudice against him. Perhaps it's because he doesn't send out an especially likable vibe, and because his former work sometimes came across as too pretentious. It's true that with every one of his movies, he always tries to deliver some deeper message and that he constructs his movies as parables, with the focus usually set on some universal situation or crisis rather than on the more particular conflicts that most dramas, thrillers or mysteries have us accustomed to. I can't say I think he's been very successful at delivering these messages in a viewer-friendly, non-pretentious way, but I respect the fact that he has never given up on his personal view of movie-making, and that he stays true to himself, much critic and -in my opinion, unjustified and too harsh- bashing this might have fostered. Having said this, like I stated at the beginning, I think his career has been objectively quite erratic.<br/><br/>Well, having said that, I think that ""The happening"" is, simply put, a good and entertaining movie. I have to admit I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, precisely because I regrettably chose to listen to all the many holier-than-thou critics who state their opinions as scientific fact, and also, dare I say it, to my own prejudice. I was proved wrong, and I am happy to say that I'm now looking forward to watching Shyamalan's next movies.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect by any means, but it is thoroughly enjoyable, and it's based on a basic idea and a script that are just as smart as anything reasonably smart that you get to see on the big screen any of these days. The acting is also good. I honestly believe that, had this movie been made by any other household name or ""promising"" new director, it wouldn't have been slammed as relentlessly and sometimes scornfully as it did. This movie isn't at all the disaster that it has been described as by many critics. You might like it or not, but I would recommend watching it if you like dramas with a supernatural element, decent character development, and thrillers.<br/><br/>Another thing that I enjoyed about ""The happening"" is the modesty and, might I add, the lack of self-consciousness from which it was made. Especially at some sequences (and you will know which ones they are), you can tell that Shyamalan was probably not taking himself all that seriously, and that he was perhaps even making fun of the reputation that he's earned throughout most of his career, as a very intellectual, serious, and sometimes cold movie-maker. The movie has some tongue-in-cheek bits that I appreciated very much."

","For those who went to the theater - sorry if it didn't work out; for the audience that will see this movie on TV through DVD and/or pay movie channels where it's not as big a deal - it's definitely a cut above generic/junk sci-fi.<br/><br/>Plus... it's well acted, intense at times and serious throughout. Whether you do or don't like where it's going, you'll feel compelled to watch to the end.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the trailer, the movie is essentially about a mysterious occurrence that ""happens"" in the northeast section of the US: masses of people are going into a dazed stupor ... and then killing themselves.<br/><br/>Since it's a typical M. Night movie, the above story is what's going on in the background. In the foreground, the story is about a couple struggling through marital problems. Mark Wahlberg and Zoey Deschanel do a great job of portraying the husband and wife characters who have very different personalities.<br/><br/>Again, if you watch the film on TV, I don't see how you can really go wrong. The demands are much lower than if you were at a theater. It's got decent acting, drama, and medium-fare sci-fi."
"Charlie_Hooch","4","2","5","8 December 2008"," The most skilled and most pointless film I have seen this year.
","The day I began to watch the movie, I was in the most brilliant of moods. I had a cup o' hot chocolate my right hand, a cigarette in my left and a mind at complete peace and harmony with the world around me. <br/><br/>As this disaster epic neared the hour mark however, I began feeling distraught. Why? Because it's a thin story, plain and simple. <br/><br/>A plague of initially unknown origins (duh!) starts killing off eastern America, manipulating people in to murdering themselves in the fastest and often most brutal manner possible. An interesting premise, you say? I would tend to agree. But with a running time of 90 minutes, it is hard to find it interesting at all after a certain point, because you know it will go no further. <br/><br/>The characters are dry, and somewhat lifeless (excluding Whalberg and Leguizamo). Their reactions to their impending doom are somewhat too subdued at times, which is how most of us would most likely react. That's right, Shyamalan goes too far. In pursuit of realism he sacrifices suspense, a mistake he made in The Village. <br/><br/>Needless to say, it is visually and musically perfected, but that has never been Shyamalans Achilles heel. His weakness lies in convincing his audience to give a damn about the fate of his characters, who he more often then not, treats as puppets caught in the storm of his creativity. <br/><br/>We feel the power of the storm sure, but do we really want to go through it, without any characters to cheer for? Think about it."
"cristo111","8","2","5","6 December 2008"," A good movie if you can suspend disbelief
","Like everyone else, I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was brilliant - the twist at the end made this a magnum opus. With such a debut, the level of expectation for Shyamalan has been set very high. I've been disappointed with most of his films since, but I did like the atmosphere he created with ""The Village"".<br/><br/>Now to ""The Happening"": The beginning of this movie conveys a completely gripping and horrifying crisis. It has a sense of immediacy, and grabs your throat: what's going on? When you finally get the reason, it seems very far-fetched. If you can suspend disbelief for that part, I think you'll enjoy the rest of the movie, as I did."
"lagriff05","3","2","5","5 December 2008"," Ain't no plot Happening here.
","Well, this sucks. M. Night Shyamalan is not a director I've been very familiar with over the years, having only seen his much-lauded and much-overrated The Sixth Sense, but he seems absurdly pretentious and smug. And all I have to say to that is, if this fecal matter is the best he can do these days, then he had better start learning some god damned humility.<br/><br/>The Happening is another one of those fashionable natural disaster movie, only about ten times worse than you'd usually expect. This movie boasts deplorable writing, awful acting, plastic characters that try and fail to get you to care about them, and THE LAMEST DISEASE EVER. I won't spoil it for those of you who have not seen it yet, but this disease and the ""plot"" constructed around it are absolutely laughable. It seems to be TRYING to build up, but it doesn't work, and mostly this just comes off as a bunch of suspenseful (haha) scenes strung together on a clothesline with no punch line or climax or anything of the sort. Oh, and why do all the characters in this movie have to say ""happening"" so much? Annoying as Hell. This is basically a shitty 80s B movie with a modern sheen, and that is more horrifying than anything Shyamalan could conjure up in his writing.<br/><br/>Oh, and have I mentioned how delightfully retarded this is? I mean, we have people talking to plants, the main character and his fiancée arguing about their petty problems in the middle of a train station where everyone is trying to escape the virus, and worst of all, the frighteningly dumb jab at the Americans with all of the references to ""terrorists."" Nice one, Shyamalan. All Americans are like that, indeed. F*ck you all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>So basically, all the viewer can really do, deprived of any visible plot or hook to grab onto, is sit in awe of the puerile dialogue and attempts at characterization, which are so bad they're funny, and I actually found myself laughing at this more than real comedies like Death to Smoochy and Tropic Thunder, which leaves something to be said for those, as well. I'll chuck a few points onto the rating here, as it did make me laugh a few times, but really, The Happening is an awful movie and I would not recommend it."
"newpapyrus","9","2","5","21 November 2008"," An apocalyptic classic
","I'm really not a big Shyamalan fan. But I've always respected his Kubrick-like pursuit to make his own style of movie rather than adopt the usual Hollywood formula. <br/><br/>I thought 'the 6th Sense' was interesting but I've never understood the hoopla surrounding it. I did find the Village to be an interesting film. But I thought Signs and the Lady in the Water were absolutely boring. <br/><br/>But 'the Happening' is easily his best film, IMO. In fact, I think its a classic and far superior to unrealistic and silly apocalyptic films such as Will Smith's ""I am Legend"" and Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'. <br/><br/>The mystery of a mass suicidal apocalypse infesting the northeast cost of the US was very creepy and very realistic. The characters were sympathetic and often tragic-- especially the little girl's situation. And you actually felt for their safety rather than rooting for their demise. <br/><br/>And Shyamalan's usual ironic twist at the end had a great sense of poetic justice. <br/><br/>So I'd place this amongst the great apocalyptic films like:<br/><br/>Night of the Living Dead, The Stand, The Omega Man, Dawn of the Dead (both versions), Testament, Panic in the Year Zero, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (the original), 28 Days Later, The Day of the Triffids (BBC mini-series), The Mist,"

","Well let me start by saying I understand why so many didn't like this movie and I can't really argue their points. But for my viewing I must say I was intrigued the entire time and especially during the old woman's house scenes I was really on edge. Considering the genre I can't really ask for more than that out of the movie. It was certainly a strange idea but I can't down-rate for originality. My only real two complaints are that one, in the explanation, I don't really get that a gas that breaks down our naturally defense to not hurting ourselves would automatically cause us to hurt ourselves, also I have come to expect more from an M.N.S. ending. It could have used some fireworks to wrap things up. All that said I really can't recommend this movie to anyone because I see the strong potential for them to be disappointed.

"winner55","7","2","5","15 November 2008"," parable on love
","Director Shyamalan is the most Christian of all popular directors working in Hollywod, and the most thoughtfully Christian in Hollywod's history. Even though I'm not a Christian, I respect his thoughtfulness and faith.<br/><br/>This not a horror film but a kind of post-modern ""Pilgrim's Progress"" parable. The difficult question of the film is not ""what is happening?"" but rather, why are the lead characters innocent enough to survive it? And the answer is rather odd and rather bold. Although recently married, they are still in the process of 'falling in love.' That's important because in a truly Christian universe, love is a practice, not a feeling. ""Feeling"" love or ""being in love"" does not redeem, only the active process of it.<br/><br/>Is Shyamalan successful in portraying this? No; and the effort to do so actually requires considerable maturity, more than Shyamalan has right now. By the time John Ford was able it pull it off in ""the Quiet man,"" he had some 25 years film-making experience, and had lived an adventurous life.<br/><br/>But I am willing to give Shyamalan points for effort here. Constructing a parable of this sort in this time and place took considerable nerve. Hopefully the commercial failure of this film will not deter him from continuing to take such risks. Thoughtful films are hard to come by these days.<br/><br/>So it's an admittedly weak film - parables lend themselves to beautiful visuals, but not to great acting, and the best dialog is on the theme and not the plot. But its reputation will grow in time, as Shyamalan's reputation grows and his handling of such themes matures.<br/><br/>Oh, a last word - on the violence depicted in the film. It actually has to be taken with a tablespoon of salt. Much of it involves a student filmmaker's conceit, indicating Shyamalan is still concerned with learning his craft. But, to put it bluntly, much of the violent acts are insiders' jokes - 'it's raining construction workers,' get it? and the guy feeding his arm to the lions is a nod back to - Monty Python. Further indication that we are dealing with a parable on a theme rather than a well-constructed plot.<br/><br/>Hopefully in the future, Shyamalan will learn, as John Ford learned, how to marry the two."
"HalGuentert","3","2","5","5 November 2008"," Mediocre Film that needed a better ending.
","""The Happening"" seemed to start off with an interesting and mysterious plot, but falls flat from act 1. Two things bothers me, the first is the $60 million budget, because there have been much better films made for less than $20 million, and second is an underlying theme that unexplained events, such as the bees dying off, are caused by ""nature"" as an acceptable answer. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the audience needs to have more questions answered in order to buy into the story. In ""The Happening"" the plot failed to ever provide an explanation for what was really happening. We were told that ""nature"" could be fighting back by plants giving off some new toxin, but how could plants control the wind? Which plants were producing the toxin and why did it spread? Why did the toxins start one day and stop the next? There were some guesses that the toxins sensed a group of people and attacked based on some size group, but then that idea was contradicted by the old woman getting poisoned while alone.<br/><br/>Without any established limits, it is hard to buy into the idea of ""nature"" attacking at random, and requiring the wind to blow up at the same time. Is this a paid propaganda project to plant the idea that the problems with use of genetically modified plant seeds, and spraying aluminum compounds into the air is an unexplainable act of ""nature"", I don't know? Could it be? Yes, it certainly lacks other value. <br/><br/>In the extra materials on the DVD, the director states that he needed a home run at the end, and unfortunately, it was a bunt. The ending added more questions, instead of wrapping things up.<br/><br/>It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but not up to what I expected either, and basically middle of the road by today's standards. ""Tremors"" proves you can do a lot more with a much smaller budget, but see ""Cloverfield"" if you gave this movie a ""1""."

","Once again, much like The Village, I thought this movie was quite horrible and a waste of time. The way things fit together was OK as was the acting but the movie's intensity wasn't much at all like the preview trailer exaggerated it to be. There were maybe 2 or 3 parts where the suspense had built up to make you think ""ooh!"" but the sad part is that these scarce moments were TOWARDS THE END of the movie (around the last 20 minutes or so). The ending of the movie leaned towards having a part 2 but the rest of the movie was quite bland - like bean soup made with plain water. I think I was more glad once the movie had ended although it was a so-so movie. The acting was OK but not very believable and I'll be returning this crappy film to the metal RedBox machine today (THANKFULLY!). Definitely NOT going to see this one again!"

","What is it with M. Night?? His movies keep getting worse!! This movie has to be one of his biggest disappointments to date. It sure was not scary, there wasn't much of a thriller element when you find out what supposedly is going on, and who knows why it got an R rating. Sixth Sense was awesome, Signs was OK, The Village was barely passable, but The Happening was awful. The ""plot"" the acting was not even anything to write home about and it had some decent named actors. I hope he turns things around with future projects, but he needs to stop doing weird pointless movies!! Just my personal opinion. One of the problems I saw with this film was things were never properly explained at any point in the movie and nothing is more irritating to watch a movie for 90 minutes or more to only be scratching your head at the end because it just made no sense and didn't frighten, shock, scare or any other emotion that a thriller is supposed to do. Sixth Sense did ALL of that! I hope he gets his touch back for doing movies like that again!! I only give this movie 1 out of 10 and it is not one I would recommend to others."

","Most of the reviews here have already covered this pile-o'-crap fairly well, so I'll try not to repeat any previous comments, but it's so hard when you're talking about this lame effort from the wunderkind of Hollywood. <br/><br/>One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is the lion-mauling scene. I was unaware that an animal can pull off a man's arm with only a slight tug, AND that man can continue to stand so that another lazy lion can coax the other one off! WTF? The plot holes are big enough to drive Jupiter through and yes, the acting was bad! Marky Marks wife, played absently by Zooey Deschanel, just comes off like someone that just drank a pitcher of Nyquil, and I was reminded of Karen Allen's demented portrayal of Indiana Jones's long lost love, smiling and laughing maniacally at the most dangerous times! There was no real suspense in this movie and the idea of people outrunning the wind is way beyond preposterous. And, as some others have pointed out, the wind would essentially dilute anything airborne and make it LESS potent!! <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg constantly looked confused, but not by the events surrounding him, but by the script. (How do I act like any of this is believable? He seemed to emote) <br/><br/>Also, Is it believable that being inside a house will stop airborne particles small enough to not be seen by the naked eye? <br/><br/>I liked the first ten minutes or so and had high hopes that the film would take some of those frightening elements and take it a step further, but instead, what we got was one community-theater feeling scene after another and the characters were strangely dispassionate about the whole thing. <br/><br/>All in all, one boring movie. It's pretty hard to defend a film that starts out strong and gets increasingly ridiculous and confusing as it goes along. Don't waste your time, money or brain cells on this half-hearted attempt!!"

","I think this was a very ""intelligent"" move. It takes a smart person to enjoy this kind of movie. It doesn't come right out and tell you what is going on, you need to figure it out yourself. There was lots of foreshadowing, and hinting around in the movie. It had a very deep concept, ""the earth's rinse cycle"". When the planet feels threatened, it restores balance. The planet will not sit back and watch us pollute its air and chop down its forests, it will fight back. The characters might have been a little stupid, but the concept of the whole thing was very entertaining. The epidemic started in the northeast, where the industrial revolution started, and started impacting the environment. The ecology had suffered the longest there. Next was Europe. Soon after will be the middle United States. The epidemic would blossom outward, following the path of humanity's conquest of the planet. The safest people on the planet would be the ones in third would nations that have yet to be industrialized, and are still at balance with nature."

His political beliefs are now shaping his once-great writing skills and what we have here is pretentious bile. The acting is dead-pan, as usual in his movies, but the dialog is laughable. This is an example - like Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" - of a writer/director imitating himself, and the result seeming like self parody. This really does seem more like if Mel Brooks was lampooning M. Night. The best parts of the film are towards the end with a crazy old lady, played by Betty Buckley (basically mimicking Piper Laurie's character in ""Carrie"", in which Buckley co-starred). If the entire movie centered on the heroes trying to escape her clutches, this would be a fine film. And that's exactly it. M. Night needs to make a haunted house movie, or a slasher flick, or... something simple. He needs to simplify. He's gone wacky. He's getting a bit too original for his own good, and ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" have almost sunk him. But this mess leaves him - and the audience - all wet in the end."

I find it hard to fathom how a filmmaker that could make such an incredible film like ""The Sixth Sense"" came proceed to make five terrible films in a row after wards. I didn't think it would be possible to make a more disappointing, pathetic film than ""The Village"", but he manages to 'surpass' what I thought was already insurmountable incompetence.<br/><br/>There are so many terrible moments in the film, I don't even know where to begin. Walberg talking to the plant, the man feeding his arms to the lion, the 'crazy' lady who lives alone, the shameful failed attempt at melodrama while our two lovers talk to one another through the pipe... These are just some of the really bad moments of the film...the bad ones fill the rest of the time.<br/><br/>WHAT WAS HE THINKING? Who makes a film where you can never see that antagonist? The problem seems to be that, miraculously, Shyamalan's head is still big from his one hit a decade ago. The feedback he gets from the professionals has been tepid at best, yet he chooses not to listen. When the studio questioned the weakness of ""Lady in the Water"", instead of taking the advice to heart, he proceeded to make a lousy script his way...into a lousy movie.

","I will admit that I have enjoyed a couple of M. Night Shyamalan films... The Sixth Sense was fantastic - then it all pretty much went downhill from there.

But compared to The Happening, Lady In The Water should have been an Oscar contender. <br/><br/>Not only were the performances completely lackluster (Mark Wahlberg... whiney... Zooey Deschanel... irritating), but the story line was absolutely absurd & COMPLETELY preachy! Let me get this straight... the TREES are communicating with other vegetation & in order to protect themselves against the beast that is man they start releasing neurotoxins that rids humanity of the will to live??? Wow. The kicker is near the end, after ""the event"" has ended; some professor is seen on television telling society that: ""this is just a warning"" & some business about how we're destroying our planet & now Mother Nature won't stand for it anymore. Again - wow. That's not preaching at all - I swear! All this combined with somewhat shocking images of MANY people killing themselves in grotesque fashions (In one scene a man turns on an industrial sized lawn mower, puts it into gear & lays down in front of it.) makes for one HORRID film.<br/><br/>Had I been unfortunate enough to pay to see The Happening in theatres, I would have asked for my money back on the premise that it was 91-minutes of my life I'll never have back again."

","This is the first time I have written my thoughts on a movie but felt I needed to give my opinion. I use IMDb ratings and several critics reviews to determine whether or not to waste my money on a theater trip, wait to rent it, or just forget it altogether. I've found that ratings of 6.0 or more seem to be watchable and 90% of movies that fall below that rating are usually a waste of time.<br/><br/>The Happening was, for me, a watchable film and one I will buy on DVD. The pacing was just right as it gave a sense of foreboding and what's gonna happen next. The acting by Mark Wahlberg was decent and a scene with him talking to a plant wasn't ridiculous as more it was a little humor to lighten the mood if only for an instant. I think all the actors did a good job with a good script. There was plenty of startling and eerie images, especially of the old woman walking on the porch. The ending was creepy and left for the viewers imagination.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel this was a good movie and at the very least, a worthwhile rental."

","M. Night is being lambasted about this film; I won't say this film doesn't have a ton of flaws (believe me, it does), but it's clear to me that he is on a tract to duplicate the successes of Alfred Hitchcock. It is obvious Hitchcock is a huge influence... nay, a source... for much of M. Night's experimental film-making.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he's turning off a lot of people with this style of film-making.<br/><br/>Let's just get it out of the way now - the idea is unique but the screen writing is atrocious. This film needed a healthy dose of panic. If the film-makers had injected 1/10th of the panic-stricken dialog from the movie 'Cloverfield', this film could easily have been a frightening thriller.<br/><br/>Instead it just plods along delivering cheesy overly-dramatic lines that are seriously out-of-context.<br/><br/>The actors aren't panicked when they should naturally be, and often times it appears they are just standing around waiting for their fate rather than running off in the other direction, away from the terror that is coming after them.<br/><br/>I can see where M. Night was going with this, but I honestly think the studio should have called for a re-write. M. Night is great, but clearly he needed help on the dialog and character actions of this film.<br/><br/>Now let me get to the worst part - M. Night gave away the 'twist' almost 25% into the movie! From any other director I don't mind, but I've come to expect a 'surprise' from M. Night - kind of like, waiting for the jack-in-the-box to spring open, even though you know it's coming. Unfortunately the 'twist' was cited early on, which left me thinking 'ok, now what?' until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>I give M. Night a 5 out of 10, because it seemed like he genuinely tried to do something magical here, but just missed the mark. Next time, Mr. Shamalan, PLEASE accept the help of some gifted WGA member, even if you throw out most of their rewrites."

","I had my fair share of ""trouble"" with a Night movie! Happening is not one of them. And it's not because I'm trying to buck the trend (the overall voting here is speaking for itself), but because I really liked the understatement and the underplaying of the movie. It's not about panic, it's about a message, that Night tries to send through. Well the message is very clear and still some won't like what they'll see and won't like the bluntness with which the movie delivers this message! <br/><br/>I liked the acting and I liked the point Night was/is making with this movie. It's a slow building chilling experience (if you let yourself into it), which does not rely on any ""twist"" ending or anything like that (didn't work for ""Village"" imo).

She looks the same through out the movie (even when people die),she keeps getting calls from a guy when all the phone lines are down but she avoids it so that our HERO guy doesn't suspect. Thats all she does. I read the comments here on IMDb before watching the movie and at least 90% of them said it was bad. So I wasn't having any expectations.

I was literally not entertained once during the 98 min. run time NOT ONCE!!! This was trying to be a serious film, trying to tell us how important it is to save the environment and how we are abusing the planet. I agree that we need to work towards a way to stop polluting the planet to prevent the threat of global warming. But this film has the dumbest characters (weird guy obsessed with hot dogs) oh there's a good idea Shyamalan.

Night Shamalan (did I spell that right?) who directed The Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable. One of the main problems with this movie is almost all of the apocalypse movie clichés are followed, which makes for a very boring movie experience, and to make it worse, the movie contained almost to memorable scenes. All of the action in the movie consists of shots of trees and plants an then people killing themselves, and there weren't even any inventive or gory death scenes at all.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is clichéd and slightly boring. I'm not saying it is horrible though, there are many, many worse movies out there. I just would not recommend wasting time and money to see it unless you are extremely bored or happen to catch it on TV."
"Mister_Blister_73","2","2","5","10 July 2008"," One of the WORST!
","Let me be the one to conclude this movie with just one simple phrase - THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR! And I mean it - i've watched a lot of garbage this year - I repeat A LOT - but this thing-of-a-movie is by far the most idiotic film ever created from a human being. I even wonder how was it even produced and released to the cinemas so the innocent viewers must PAY MONEY to watch this crap. The bad things in this movie are so many that they're the only thing that's really SCARY and SHOCKING in it. Let's just talk about the little thing the artists liked to call ""acting"". The ""so called"" acting in this film is so pathetic that makes the characters look like total morons. Mark Whalberg and Zoey Dechanel are so one-dimensional and dull as the lead actors that after 20 minutes you just didn't care any more about they're characters and whether they'll live or die. It's quite disturbing actually to see well known actors in a mainstream movie of a famous director to act like dumb children in a school play. And what about the story. There is nothing here - NOTHING. No suspense, no horror, no thrills, even no real climax and explanation. Not to mention that the trademark of all M. Night's movies - THE TWIST - is also missing in this one. Not to mention that the event that is HAPPENING in the movie is basically so absurd that's even hilarious. Also - it reminds a lot of a story, written by Steven King, only ""The Happening"" is much worst. I can't even believe that I've sit trough the whole movie, without killing myself. There is NOTHING that drives the storyline - no real emotions, no real relationships, just plain and artificial reactions between the characters and god-awful stupid dialogs. It's like watching a serious movie which eventually feels like parody and you end up laughing at the whole thing. Absurd and hilarious are quite well said descriptions to the entire script. Further more - the well known cinematography and visual style of the old Shyamalan's films which we all anticipated are just gone. The directing is bad or mediocre at best. There are only a couple of scenes that even reminds us of Shyamalan. I know that the writing AND producing AND directing a movie is a tough job but one director's ego should not be a reason for promising projects to be presented like some Uwe Boll movies. Was that laziness or lack of creativity - you tell me. The only thing good in this movie is the music. It's effective and it really flows with the scenes. James Newton Howard gives us the only thing with which this movie is even watchable - his music score and it's great. But yet again even the good music is degraded by everything else. After all the high hopes, M. Night embarrassed himself utterly with this flick. It should have been a great and chilling thriller but instead it's something I really don't want to talk about any more. The director said that he made it to be a B-movie. Well, I think the B-Movies ARE the future for him, so good luck with THAT."

","This movie sucks a lot! Whole idea is OK, but script and plot suffers from idiotic dialogs and poor acting. For example - Wahlberg and Deschanel run through the field and then Mark starts dialog about how he bought a syrup in shop! Geeeez, who wrote that? Also actors (and Zooey) makes some stupid faces all the time wrinkling forehead and gets eyes out of the moon.<br/><br/>Also there are some scenes without sense like nature affecting on one person (but Wahlberg certified that nature attacks groups) and D-movie like ending.<br/><br/>Shyamalan should go on retirement because after Unbreakable (which was solid) gave us some cliché, underperformed dramas..."

","I have been a huge fan of all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. So I went into this realizing it would probably not be the typical Hollywood blockbuster, but is so much worse than that.<br/><br/>There is no character development. No plot development. The dialogue is terribly forced and seems very much out of place.<br/><br/>I am sure that fans of this movie will argue that those who don't line just don't understand what Shyamalan was trying to achieve. They will say he was kicking against the Hollywood status quo. Making the viewer have to think and work a little bit (Much like he he did in ""Lady in the Water""). I don't mind some work, but the real work was forcing myself not to run screaming out of the theatre.<br/><br/>This movie was quite similar to a Twilight Zone episode. The problem is that instead ob being 20-25 minutes long it was stretched into an excruciating 80 minutes.<br/><br/>Shamylan has encouraged viewers to go into the theatre expecting a fun ""B"" movie. The Happening definitely had similarities to to a ""B"" movie, such as: Bad acting, unnecessary dialogue, no real plot, completely anti-climactic and really not making one lick of sense. But Shamylan also seemed to try to hard to make the movie ""fun."" He threw in smatterings of non-nonsensical/weird dialogue in an attempt to be funny, but it really just made me angry.<br/><br/>Once again, I have enjoyed all of M. Night Shyamalan's previous films, and believe he is a brilliant filmmaker. But The Happening, to put it bluntly, is a worthless piece of crap."

Nights movies (the sixth sense, unbreakable, Signs) were all great, the village was eh alright, but after that movie things got bad but for some reason his movies get me curious so it draws me in to see it which is why i saw this movie, now with his first R rated film im even more curious.<br/><br/>Heres what i thought was wrong with this movie...(i wont spoil anything for anyone) the opening sequence was flat, it just STARTS and the acting done by the people who are not ""infected"" show no emotion of panic or fear. Then there's Mark Wahlberg, i thought he was going to save this film because he is up there as one of my favorite actors and boy was i wrong, sure he plays a teacher in the movie and isn't some tough bad ass like he is in previous films but man oh man does he play the biggest wimp in the world it gotten to the point where i wanted him to get out of the scene, i was embarrassed for him. pretty much in my eyes the acting was just awful, i gave it a 2 out of 10 because there's one scene that kept my attention.<br/><br/>after the movie was done i started thinking, making he wrote this movie as a joke because it was so bad...i mean how can you make a good movie about mass suicide?"

","The basic idea behind The Happening could have been written down on a single sheet of paper and sold to a producer to turn into a good movie. Unfortunately, it ended up being worked out as a script and filmed by a writer/director who has completely lost his way. Intervention for M. Night Shyamalan, anyone?<br/><br/>The acting is wooden, no exceptions, and reminded me of some of the worst porn movies I have... heard about. Had I not seen Wahlberg and even Leguizamo in much better roles before, I would have written them off as serious actors on the basis of their performances in this film. I can only imagine how bad they must feel about their decision to get involved with this project.<br/><br/>There is no internal logic to any of the actions of the characters. Many scenes are just loose ends without any contribution to the plot development. That includes the few scares, which mainly consist of cheap tricks. Some of the horror effects made me laugh; half way into the movie I began to wonder if the surprise Shyamalan had in store for us this time, was that it was in fact a black comedy. No such luck.<br/><br/>Please, M. Night Shyamalan, stop writing and directing. In stead, sell your pitches to people who know how to write a script, direct actors and basically, make movies."

So I was so desperate to watch The happening that i watched it on the first show itself(first show of the release date). I felt that the first half was pretty good but then i began to feel that OK first half showed it all now what else can m.night possibly show ahead at such a point. I felt that the concept was good but i guess m.night created a very difficult situation for him self it was very difficult to show any thing ahead after the first half in a story like this and what i thought came to be true there was nothing of it that interested me after the first half."

","I've always liked M. Night's films - even when they were bad, I've liked them, (e.g. ""The Lady In The Water."") So I had hopes for his latest. Unfortunately, I can't be as charitable with ""The Happening."" The story concept was interesting,almost Michael Crichton in style. But Shamayalan played it more like a 'bad' Stephen King movie. While I had no problems with Mark Wahlburg's or Zooey Deschanel's acting per se, the two lead characters were two of the least interesting I'd ever been forced to watch on the big screen. We're supposed to care about their relationship and their futures together, but because they were shallow and half-developed, moments which were meant to be moving, were mundane. Oddly enough, some of the side characters were far more entertaining, and lasted on-screen for only a short time. The only good thing that I can say about this film is that there is some very well- done, disturbing imagery, which stays with you after the film ends. Sadly, it's the only thing that stays with you."

","No spoiler warning needed for this flick - the movie itself has the spoiler about halfway through, after that it's anti-climactic and quite boring. The premise of plants suddenly mutating and gaining abilities to sense nearby people, then release toxins to make them commit suicide, is laughable. Anyone who has had chemical warfare training knows that wind will disperse airborne toxins, but apparently that's when the plants are most aware or something. The characters are in danger, you can tell, not by their reactions (department store mannequins would react more believably) but because the wind blows the trees around and the schmaltzy music gets really loud (which kept me awake at least). And after the holocaust is over, things just go back to normal. Except... OOOOH! It might happen AGAIN!! Somewhere else!!! Scary!!! I get the impression that someone had a basically cool idea, then sat around with a bunch of other people thinking of how to make it work. Then about halfway through the session someone said ""The heck with, let's go get a beer and start shooting next week."" Whoever you guys are, I want my seven bucks and two hours of my life back.

","Do not take your children. There were children in this audience and it was very inappropriate. Again...no kids!! First for the good parts. That's the shorter list. M. Night Shyamalan always knows how to build some tension and he did this on occasion in this film. It was well photographed. Now for the disappointing bits. This is a preachy, extreme environmentalist wacko version of the birds. The premise of the problem that the population faces makes no sense. It's obviously written by someone who has no scientific training. I should have known we were in trouble when Mark Wahlberg's character is teaching a class in the beginning and questioning where all the honey bees have gone. The only plausible answer coming from the class was ""global warming"". By the way, we live on a farm and the honey bees were prolific this year. The film's bloody bits are disgusting and the scene in the zoo looked like a bad remake of the SNL Dan Akroyd/Julia Childs scene. There was one sickening scene of bizarre suicide after another and it became tedious and finally laughable. Yes, there was laughter in the audience as these grotesque scenes were played out in all their slasher splendor. I even heard a ""good grief"" and a ""when will they die"" comment from the audience. The characters are so eccentric, in fact downright insane in some cases, that there is no feeling of empathy. It's rather like the author felt the need to show how bad humans are in general. I was tremendously disappointed to have paid the money and wasted the hours. More than one of the comments have indicated that perhaps the people who do not care for this flick ""just don't get it"". Yeah, we get it. People bad, plants good. Take off on a B movie. Don't destroy the planet, because that will destroy you. Yeah, we get it. It's still a bad attempt at making that message. It's disgusting, it's sophomoric and lacks any scientific expertise one would expect from a middle schooler."

","I can't even begin to tell you what a disappointment this latest from M Night was to me. I had started looking forward to it months back when I saw the first trailer, as I have been a follower of his stuff since the Sixth Sense. I actually DID like The Village, and was OK with Lady in the Water- though I have to admit, it seems that each movie was less than the other as they were progressively made. But this- this was a really bad nightmare that I kept expecting to wake up from. In fact, at one point I had even hoped part of the scenario of the movie was that it WAS a bad nightmare- but alas, this nose-dive never pulled back up again. It was as though this was some spoof- not at all like Shyamalan's style to me- no intrigue, no twists or turns, and some of the WORST acting I've ever seen. Course, I felt a few misgivings when I saw the other Wahlberg being the star of this one- but I guess I felt like Shyamalan could work wonders or something. NOT. There were maybe two scenes that actually held any of the trademark Shyamalan humor - and the ""suicidal"" stuff you see in the trailers that looks like it will be scary, just ends up being as anti-climatic as the rest of the movie. What happened? is all I kept asking. I was ready to walk out within 30 mins or so, but kept hanging on to see if SOMETHING anything would happen to make it get better. It didn't. I just keep thinking- WOW. What a waste from a guy that could bring something like 6th sense and Signs, to get to this. And this my friends, was a joke. Don't waste your money at the movie theater- and really, don't waste your time with the DVD either."

","Very intense scenes are made gratuitous by a script that treats the moviegoer with condescension.<br/><br/>It's hard to make comments without giving away the story. This is essentially a makeover of a 60's film with none of the scientific sophistication that a modern audience demands in a film. Instead of an intelligent script that might make the point without giving the moviegoer a head injury, they have written a movie that is preachy and illogical.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that Shyamalan tries too hard to be the conscience of the moviegoer instead of a storyteller.

A global threat that no one could figure out, but then it made a turn... and it turned a little silly. I mean toxins released by plants?! Well, it's an interesting concept and a great attempt at an environmental movie, but it just didn't ""hit the spot"". <br/><br/>This was M. Nights first R rated movie and it was only because of the graphic death scenes, which seemed like they were there just so they COULD be there. And for what? The best way to describe my feelings about this film is to imagine you are starving and you are expecting a thanksgiving meal but instead all you get is Split pea soup.

It's true that some of the scenes in this movie was quite suspenseful and I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>But there's some scene that doesn't quite make sense in the movie. For example, compare the situation when John Leguizamo character got ""infected"", and Mark Walhberg's toward the end where the toxins supposedly at the peak of its potency. He should have got infected too, but being the main character of the movie I guess that logic is impossible for him to happen. When I came out of the theater and discussed this movie, no matter how I tried to explain the plot and defend the reason things happened in the movie the more I realize that, they were right and I was wrong. The movie sucks.<br/><br/>I really, really hope that this can be as good as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable but for more Lady in the Water is a bit better than this one.

He takes a bit of a new route this time with his first R-rated film - but if you're looking to see brutal death and mayhem, there isn't enough of that here to justify a ticket purchase.<br/><br/>It's the smaller moments that count here, and that's where a whole world of emotion is told in just a brief moment (I don't want to give it away, but I'm sure you can spot it when you see the film).

","Personally I found this movie completely riveting. This movie will not appeal to braindead mindwashed morons who get their movie kicks from the endless number of stories about adultery, murder and obscene amounts of money. The plot is very simple and precise. The characters in the movie are sincere and believable. The action and filming techniques provide spectacular viewing. A remarkable insight into human behaviour portrayed by the highest quality of acting abilities regarding the cast. It is reminiscent of Hitchcock, Triffids and Bodysnatchers yet it is none of these. It is a story of true love. Try it."

","Really? This M Night has got a lot to answer for. At least to me anyway. I have been less than impressed with the man ever since I saw The Sixth Sense (big twist or no, it was still an artless bore) and through the years I have become increasingly aware that he has no place making films....would you want to be the director responsible for The Village? <br/><br/>This, however, had two things going for it; a mysterious, intriguing premise and a terrific trailer. People dying mysteriously left and right? Sure, i'm game for that, let's go out and see it.<br/><br/>From the outset I half-regretted my decision. Half regret because I - along with the rest of the cinema - was laughing my ASS off in addition to the pain. <br/><br/>This is why - despite being a 1/10 - I would recommend it.<br/><br/>It starts off setting the scene of mystery and foreboding; a scene that should create a tense atmosphere which the characters have to deal with. This tension is killed IMMEDIATELY by absolutely godawful acting. When the builder exclaimed his ""surprise"" at his colleagues falling all around him, I licked my fingers in between fits of uncontrollable laughter, already feeling full after 5 minutes of this ham-fest. In fact hamfest doesn't quite describe this...this turkey.<br/><br/>The pacing is simply awful. We end up right in the the ""danger zone"" with little chance to connect with the characters beforehand (except the obligatory character building base scene with Marky Mark at the school showing what a funny, likable character he really is; way to use Screen writing 101, M!) Scene selection is all over the place in terms of characterisation; some characters have a few scenes and are then killed off, with little chance to connect with them (although the acting makes them seem less like proper people and more like tools of the script, so there's little connection anyway). Even good ol' Marky Mark busts out a few hams. In fact, it seems as though M Night has an issue with consistency and continuity, be it in pacing or tone; I mean, the characters actually make JOKES?! JOKES when they're in the face of danger?! <br/><br/>So the pacing stinks and the character building is awful. Plot? If that's what you wanna call it. They end up in a house for the last ten minutes after running away from the wind (not making this up) with the secluded Mrs Jones, who remains disconnected from the world thus having no knowledge of the goings on outside. And it is in these final ten, twenty minutes that the true stupidity inherent in the film ramps up; expect more misplaced jokes and awful acting. After experiencing the non-ending and walking out, I felt myself echoing the sentiment of a fellow film-goer a few rows down: ""That was the f**kin' most awful sh*t I've ever seen in my life"".<br/><br/>It's not like it's a zero trick pony though, I mean M Night has also read the SuspenseWriting101 book as well it seems. The trees swaying in the neurotoxin-infested wind mix well with the music, and there are some cool death scenes, admittedly. So you might say that the (rather humbled, should he read this) director has applied the rudimentary practise of suspense-thriller film-making.<br/><br/>So WHY see this waste of a blockbuster?<br/><br/>This film is, simply put, excellent entertainment. Through it all I kept thinking ""This CAN'T be a serious stab at a film, even for M"", but I joined the whole cineplex in enjoying the hell out of it. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I regret spending 6 pound 80 on it. Mrs Jones' antics may be just about the funniest, out-there occurrences i've seen on the big screen in a while, the acting is sometimes absolutely HILARIOUS when it's not (evidently) trying to be funny. It is even more incredible that it manages this feat, despite being directed in such a way that even the biggest metaphor-misser will see that the film is an allegory for environment awareness. <br/><br/>Put simply, please see this film. It will have you rolling in the sticky, sticky aisles, even if you're expecting the director and the cast to pop out at the end and laugh at you for sitting through it.<br/><br/>1/10 for the film, but a 10 for entertainment value."

","Before I went to this movie I read several of the reviews on here. I found many that completely dismantled the film so I went into it with rather low expectations.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to see a fresh idea and unique movie. I think that people are not giving this movie a fair shake.<br/><br/>The cast is somewhat awkward together I must admit; Most noticeably Deschanel and Wahlberg. This was apparent to me within the first ten minutes of the movie, however I felt that as it progressed they slowly ""worked"" for me.<br/><br/>I sadly was the minority opinion among my friends I went to see it with. I kept asking what their problem with The Happening was and it tended to be ""it's no Sixth Sense"" or ""it's no (Shamalayan film here)"" That to me, sums up everyone's take on this movie. You can't go into the theater expecting Shamalayan to reproduce the sheer genius that was the Sixth Sense. You're going to see the Happening, not the Sixth Sense 2. Unfortunately it looks like MNS's career began too well for his own good.<br/><br/>Anyways enough of my ramblings. Go see this movie. Bring an open mind.

"Coventry","6","3","10","16 June 2008"," Shyamalan's best in a while, but movie-miracles still ain't happening
","Please note the reviews also contains slight spoilers for ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". <br/><br/>Pretty much like the rest of our cinema-loving universe, I anticipated the release of ""The Happening"" with quite an unhealthy dose of skepticism. I never even bothered to watch ""Lady in the Water"", but I severely disliked both ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" and I even think his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" are vastly overrated. Still, the formula of ""The Happening"" strangely appealed to me and  unlike any of the aforementioned titles  I felt to urge to go and see it on the big screen as soon as it got released. The trailer is downright fantastic and, even though you just know it already features all the film's major highlights, it literally oozes with suspense and morbidity. And also, for me personally, the opening of the film took away a massive load of skepticism and negative premonitions. Shyamalan doesn't dawdle for once and comes straight to the point after the atmospheric and moody opening credits. Strange, inexplicable and unspeakably tragic phenomena overcome the East coast of the United States. Starting within and around large national parks, people suddenly become emotionally and physically paralyzed and subsequently commit suicide as if they're instructed to do so by some sort of higher power. A large posse of petrified people, amongst them a science teacher with his emotionally troubled wife and one of his colleagues' young daughter, attempt to flee towards Philadelphia by train, but the unidentifiable menace spreads out as well. The occurrences are too complex and precise to be terrorist actions and an alien attack is entirely out of the question, so the only remaining explanation would involve a spontaneous revolt of nature. The undeniable strong-point of ""The Happening"" is that M. Night Shyamalan emphasizes the mystery-aspect a lot less than in any of his previous screenplays. At first there are several wild speculations regarding the origin of the events, but once nature's involvement is established, the focus purely lies on survival of the characters and at least the film doesn't build up towards the infamous  but often disappointing  twist in the end. The concept is pretty good, however the elaboration still too often feels incoherent and unconvincing. ""The Happening"" contains multiple isolated moments of sheer brilliance and  also unusual in the director's repertoire  pure horror, but as a wholesome it still isn't as powerful as it should be. The sequences in which construction workers throw themselves off rooftops, people stand in line to shoot themselves through the head with the same gun or even lie themselves down in front of a moving lawnmower are highly unsettling pieces of intense horror and probably the most shocking images M. Night Shyamalan will ever capture on film. They're especially disturbing since they're illustrated with a great sense of elegance and style, like the supernatural suicide is some work of art. In between all the menace coming from higher and incontrollable forces, the director also grabs the opportunity to depict ordinary human beings as the ultimate monsters. In their quest for survival, common people become egocentric and dangerous aggressors. It's an ancient and overused theme in Sci-Fi movies, but still very efficient and appropriate. A final and equally typical trademark in Shymalan's films is that the cast of characters doesn't feature any heroic or implausibly witty types. Taking all this and more (good acting, stunning photography, beautiful locations) into account, I'm tempted to describe ""The Happening"" as a good film and a personal triumph for the writer/director, but there's something that really upsets me. M. Night Shyamalan still is an imitator! Admittedly a very subtle and discrete one, but an imitator nevertheless. The rudimentary concepts for his most acclaimed movies may come across as original and unique, but they're always somewhat borrowed from less conspicuous older films. Genuine horror fanatics will have thought about ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Dead & Buried"" whilst watching ""The Sixth Sense""; ""Unbreakable"" had oddly many ideas in common with two obscure 80's movies called ""Sole Survivor"" and ""The Survivor"" and, if you contemplate about it a little, ""The Happening"" is a subtle re-working of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". If you've seen this classic piece of 60's eco-horror, please take a few moments to think about the similarities."

","This film was made, without a doubt, for the scientifically minded. The majority of reviews by people who do not like this film, I would be willing to guess, have an ignorance of science in general.<br/><br/>This film has spectacular cinematography, very good acting, the occasional joke and mildly odd characters; everything you need to make a decent movie. What makes this movie particularly scary, however, is the realistic plot. If you need giant flashy robots destroying the world on screen to make a disaster movie, then maybe your attention span should be examined. This film is made for the intellectuals.<br/><br/>Intellectually, this film is as scary as it gets; of course this exact plot probably wouldn't happen, but it's not a bad guess as a possibility (not a probability) of what could happen. The only thing that bothered me at the end of this film, though, was the lack of explanation as to what caused the disaster in the first place. However, after thinking about it, if the director were to offer an explanation in the film, it would have ruined everything; an explanation would have been too cheesy, fake, and improbable for the situation.<br/><br/>This is genuinely a good movie, but I believe that you need to posses more than a few braincells to enjoy it completely - go watch ""War of the Worlds"" if you are one with a short attention span."

","I went to this movie trying to keep an open mind. Within two minutes, I was having serious doubts. Within five minutes, I was shaking my head in bemusement. Within ten minutes, I was laughing my ass off. This would have to be one of the most terrible films I have seen in a long time. Where do I start? The plot was absurd in every possible way. The acting was terrible, although many people will be of the opinion that the actors were cast in order to represent ""real"" people and not act like big blockbuster stars - whatever the reason, the acting was terrible. The casting was plain strange - nobody suited their part, not one person. Surprisingly, Mark Wahlberg - although not really suiting his part - was quite funny, though I'm not entirely sure he was supposed to be. The dialogue was plain strange and quite ridiculous. The supporting characters were just insane. The old woman who is a religious nut absolutely had me in stitches she was so funny. The scenes when they were outrunning the ""wind"" was just absolutely absurdly ridiculous, there was nothing slightly scary about the grass waving to and fro. It was pathetic. The suicides were poorly done and just stupid. I just can't express how awful this film is. There was nothing remotely scary or thrilling or even interesting about it, the only thing I can say is it is good for a laugh, I barely stopped chuckling at the ridiculousness of it from beginning till end. If it is a thrill and a scare you're after,watch something else. For a highly amusing comedy, watch this - it won't disappoint."
"ole-95","1","3","10","15 June 2008"," Abysmal failure!
","At the time I write this review ""The Happening"" has an average score of 6.2, how that is possible is beyond me! I have seen a few of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, I really liked ""Sixth Sense"" and thought ""Unbreakable"" was pretty good, but I have to say that ""The Happening"" is the worst film I have seen in a long time!<br/><br/>The story is paper thin and the basic premise of the film is absolutely ludicrous. Apparently Mr. Shyamalan thinks it is perfectly reasonable to expect several different species of plants to develop some sort of hivemind and ""decide"" to start producing and releasing completely identical neurotoxins simultaneously! And not only that, the plants can also sense the presence of humans and only release the toxin if they deem the number of humans to be high enough! Not to mention that it seems the trees are in control of the wind! <br/><br/>But besides the silly premise, is the movie any good? Well, sadly the answer is NO! The script is not good, on several occasions the lines feel stilted and unnatural, making it very hard for the actors to do a good job. It is very odd that Mr. Shyamalan wrote it with Mark Wahlberg in mind, since he feels miscast as ""Elliot."" Wahlberg has delivered very good performances earlier, but here it falls flat. I'm not happy about the casting of Zooey Deschanel either. To me, she always comes off as rather odd, which doesn't really work in this movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>There are only feeble attempts at character building, which leaves the audience uncaring about the fate of the two main protagonists and the overly sappy ending is downright silly.<br/><br/>It is supposed to be a thriller, but I never felt any suspense and the only slightly scary thing in the film is the cranky old lady. Not a good thing, when the main story is about something that has the potential to wipe out the human race!<br/><br/>Some of the reviewers who have given ""The Happening"" a good review have more or less implied that if you don't like it, it's probably because you are not the kind of person who appreciate ""thoughtful"" films. I find this rather insulting! There is nothing thoughtful about this film. It is, IMO, a poor attempt at playing into the whole ""doomsday"" perspective that the media likes to portray regarding global warming and ""eco-disaters."" It would seem that Mr. Shyamalan started out on top of his game and has gone downhill ever since.<br/><br/>Easily the worst film I have seen in 2008."

","I went to see this film with a friend last night as there was nothing much on and it looked fairly promising. The cinema was packed, so it was clear that everyone had been lured in by the same false promise (or the complete lack of good films on). <br/><br/>I chose not to tick the 'contains spoiler' box as despite what the title would lead you to believe, nothing very much happens in this film.<br/><br/>It starts with some poor quality footage of a park with two girls sitting on a bench, discussing something as irrelevant and banal as the rest of the film. Forgive me for saying that the combination of the horrifically painful acting, and the director's choice of a cheap, tacky close-up shot of one of the girls' face with wide, 'startled', blue eyes, wasn't going to win any awards. <br/><br/>I wish I could say that the film got better, but it really didn't. The bright blue-eyed girl from the beginning was replaced with another, who sadly prevailed on screen for the duration of the film. I didn't think that it was conceivably possible for anyone to act this poorly, let alone act this poorly and then be cast for a main part in a film, but I was proved wrong by this little gem.<br/><br/>I must credit 'The Happening' with something though; it's the only film I've ever seen that manages to achieve the complete set of terrible directing, horrible acting, poor script, ridiculous plot-line, bad camera-work and bad production. In one scene in a country house, the microphone makes a guest appearance at the top of the screen. It was probably the best actor in the film.<br/><br/>In spite of this, I must say that I did find many parts of the film unintentionally amusing, including the particularly endearing scene when a construction worker falls off the scaffold and his co-worker takes about five seconds to produce an unconvincing reaction. For anyone who still has an ounce of faith in cinematography, horror and, quite frankly, humankind, I advise you strongly to heed this warning: Do not see this film. Ever."

Mark Wahlberg's performance was better than I expected. Most of the time he sold his character pretty well, it was fairly believable that he could be a teacher. Zooey Deschanel though... There were many times when her speech was very stilted, she sounded over-rehearsed and unrealistic.<br/><br/>She also looked cross-eyed a few times... Seriously.<br/><br/>There were 2 kids in the movie who just seemed kinda out of place. Their bit in the movie had no real effect on the storyline one way or another. The only conclusion that I can come to is that that they might have been there to show how desperate and violent humans can get when put in an extraordinary situation such as this.<br/><br/>Now the good...<br/><br/>If you are a fan of violent death scenes, you should appreciate a few of the ones here. The zoo-keeper, the policeman, and the car crash victims were my personal favorites. Most of the scenes though were a bit tame. But the ones that were nasty and gory made up for the ones that weren't.<br/><br/>This movie had a few scares in it, though not enough to be a truly scary movie. Unless you are freaked out by the thought of plants being able to make you kill yourself, don't expect to be too frightened by this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it was decent.

"pop_iconography04","Null","3","10","13 June 2008"," An Honest and Calculated Review
","I am just now sitting down after returning from the 7:45 showing of The Happening at our local theater and after being asked twice what I thought about it, my immediate answer was: I...just don't know yet. I've had the drive home alone to better gather my two cents, so here goes.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole...I don't feel got the experience and vision across that Night wanted us to have.<br/><br/>One reason for this includes the fact that I feel some of the side actors were trying to lather up their acting chops to match that of the main characters--thus, the chemistry between the two groups was just blatantly off and the non-A listers just looked like a bunch of overactors.<br/><br/>Then there's the spoken script. Characters in movies are all given silly lines from time to time and they just have to make it work, but in this film the lack of chemistry mentioned above often failed to resolve this and sometimes even normal lines seemed really strange when paired with the overactors.<br/><br/>You might be wondering: any positives to mention? <br/><br/>Well, I suppose. I think Mark W did a better job than most people here are giving him credit for. I'm not saying he's phenomenal in it, but there were a few moments where I do feel I was seeing a different side of him and where his natural standoffishness was working for the character. He and Zooey have decent chemistry, though I felt her acting was inconsistent at times. John Legiuzamo was decent; he can pull of being a father figure. The film score by James Newton Howard is nice when he's not trying to scare you, and when appropriate I felt it brought real emotion to the story and scenes where it was needed.<br/><br/>In short, I am giving it an overall 5. I began with a 7 because I could see the kind of movie Night wanted to have which could have been great, but a 5 is representative of the product. Not horrible (i.e., not deserving of the 1's and 2's others have been putting on here..hello, we're putting this in the same league as Showgirls, The Neverending Story III, etc? I think not), but not his best film by far. I'm a huge fan and believe in him, but this was the first film where I didn't leave feeling thoughtful, inspired or ""changed"" for a moment. I just left uncertain of what to think of it all.<br/><br/>It's not a film I will ever watch again, so perhaps the best course of action to take for the curious viewer would be to either wait until a friend rents it or wait a week until it is free to download off of the internet."

The premise of the movie is a about a sudden ecological event that becomes a threat to all humanity causing people to brutally kill themselves. The movie introduces us to high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his less than faithful wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) trying to escape from Phildelphia before the the event ""happens"" there too. Math teacher and friend of Elliot, Julian (John Lequizamo) and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) tag along. The thing I liked most about this movie is how Shyamalan shows how people would really react to the end of the world, not by running around screaming but sitting idly by,confused and filled with quiet fear.<br/><br/>In summary the people who didn't like this movie obviously didn't see the how deep it's meaning goes. If your looking for a cheap horror movie,this movie isn't for you, but if you you are looking for a deep, moving, and powerful psychological thriller than you should see this movie.

I got used to seeing him as a cop, but thought he was believable in this role.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is always thinking on another level than most film directors and writers and he remain's in my opinion one of the best story tellers ever in film making history. When you are watching this movie you'll find yourself thinking of things you've never imagined. The R-rating is necessary so keep that in mind if you're bringing any children. Their was several younger kids watching the movie in the row right behind me and they seemed to be enjoying it.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed all of M.

She doesn't like scary movies and this one is NOT scary. Shyamalan does have his usual suspense filled scenes and my girlfriend seemed to enjoy those.

Mark Wahlberg's casting seems the worst error, even though the plot doesn't leave much room for character development and the movie as a whole seems to have been shot in a rush (it was actually shot in quite a short period of time). Yet, is has Shyamalan's signature all along. It is scary, with no digital monsters, buckets of blood, sinister killers or psychos hiding in the dark... despite a simple plot, shallow characters and weak acting, the wind blowing through grass and trees may prove enough to make you shiver. This kind of achievement is reserved for just a few directors, Shyamalan being one of this few.

At the end of the day we are supposed to be scared by a virus but it doesn't really sneak up on anyone and in minutes the victims are dead. Even then the virus just disappears (just in the nick of time for main characters) and everyone lives happily every after (except in France). No one even had to figure out how to outsmart the virus. The characters just run long enough and hide well enough and by luck they survive! I am massively disappointed and didn't like the ""global warming"" message in the movie. What a waste of a good idea and waste of some good talents."

","The first time I saw this movie it freaked me out, it was like whoa! I thought this was the most amazing movie ever. The happening had so much suspense, it always had me wondering what was going to happened next. Mark Wahlberg played his character very well, with his witty sense. However I didn't like his wife she always had a sense that she was hiding this guy from her husband. Overall the characters brother was very weird. I always wondered why in the world would you let your daughter go with the uncle if u were going to end up dying regardless. The mother of young jess was no where to be found I thought she died in the movie. After seeing this movie a couple of times I began to like it movie, it made me sad because all these people were killing them self. These people jumped off buildings shot themselves, and just died by something strange. I still like this movie a lot it was the best suspense movie ever!"

","Blimey words can not describe how truly bad The Happening is I'm still in a state of shock. The acting was terrible and I wasn't sure whether it was actually meant to be a comedy as I found myself laughing quite a lot. The two main characters are normally very good actors so I can only assume that they got five minutes into acting in this film and thought 'this is rubbish I can't be bothered to act anymore'. It's almost worth watching just so you can say ""Yes I agree with everyone it really is that crap!"" It's a shame because if you watch the trailer for this film you think oooo... that looks good, so I would suggest you just watch the trailer as it contains the only good parts of the film."

","Yes....the summary title is actually a line from this absolutely dread attempt at an apocalyptic thriller by a writer/director who should have quit while he was ahead (after Unbreakable). I caught this movie on HBO and while watching I had to see what the IMDb community thought. Usually I place my barometer for trash movies at about a 5.0 (of the realistic 9.1- .2) scale as ""watchable"". Occasionally I'll indulge in a trashy Showtime movie (not the dirty ones I mean ones life ""Traffic Jam"" and Texas Chain Saw the Lost Years. This movie delivers that quality, with a Hollywood budget. The first review I read gave this one 3 stars.....thats generous. The acting is almost as atrocious as some of the lines these robots are forced to deliver. Poor John Leguizamo.....I guess now i know why you don't see him getting work anymore, but man I feel for the guy. Anytime Mark Wahlberg out performs you on screen, you should question your craft. This movie does raise some questions in my mind...they are as follows.<br/><br/>1. Is Shamylans a worse director or writer? Compelling arguments can be mad for both side, but in the end I have to give it to the writing side. Past of the overuse of close ups he'll deliver a shot that isn't utterly painful at times. But the script....oh the script........ 2. Will one of his movies ultimately be so bad that the scenario proposed in the film comes to fruition? Simply put, I'd believe that more than any of the premises of the last three movies by this hack. 3. Why did Mark Wahlberg seem like the appropriate cast for this or any role?<br/><br/>He'll always be a one hit wonder."
"innocuous","1","2","6","1 May 2009"," Why did Ebert like this as much as he did?
","""The Happening"" is a sad and pathetic film. Throughout the movie, I was thinking, ""Does MKS really think the world and 'nature"" are like this? Where did he go to school? Does he ever read actual, real books about science, physics, and subjects other than film?"" Of course, it was easy for me to think these thoughts because the acting is totally and uniformly awful. There are NO good acting roles in this film and every single actor just tanks it. Wahlberg is terrible in a Snidely Whiplash fake way in the first scenes and just goes downhill. I've never understood Deschanel's appeal and she makes Wahlberg look like Gielgud. My only hope is that MKS really does understand how stupid the whole story is and was trying to create a grand metaphor for, for...something else, I guess. Can't imagine what. Don't waste your time on this, even if you just want to see how bad it is."
"cellis33","1","2","6","20 December 2008"," What Happened?
","Confession: I am an M. Night Shyamalan fan. I own The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, and Unbreakable and eagerly show them as masterings of writing and direction. I am also a Mark Wahlberg fan to a point. His character in The Departed could not have been better served by any other actor and his turn as an aging athlete in Invincible was both heartfelt and inspired.<br/><br/>Admission: I went in to this movie expecting it to be Mr. Shyamalan's return to greatness following the professional hiccup that was Lady In The Water. It was going to be yet another display of perfect storytelling, carried by a very capable lead actor, that I could add to my collection of Great Modern Movies. I had nothing but hope.<br/><br/>Admonishment: Stay clear of this movie. Don't even watch it as a rainy Sunday afternoon option to cure boredom. The direction is somewhat sound and the pacing is slightly above average, but what's going on IN each scene is absolutely negligible . Outside of one scene where a distraught construction worker watches his coworkers plunge to their deaths, there's not one redeemable moment in this movie. The acting level of every minor character is that of a high school educational movie troupe, the revelations of what is HAPPENING are spoon-fed and forced, and after 15 minutes I felt like I was stuck watching JUST ANOTHER DISASTER MOVIE. Worse, I didn't care to see what became of any of the cookie-cutter major characters: the loving wife, the honest friend, the goofy-science guy with the answers... they could have bit it in the first third of the movie and maybe, at best, I'd have woken up. Sure, John Leguiziamo is good and Zooey Deschanel is admirable in their respective roles, but when you don't care about whether they live or die you've gotta think there's a problem somewhere in the script. And as for Mark Wahlberg? Miscast. Seriously miscast. He spends his entire time here trying too hard to be the nice guy you just know he's not. The trivia page for this movie says that M. Night wrote the lead role specifically with Marky-Mark in mind. I don't know what he was thinking and I fear that his instincts may just be THAT FAR OFF. And that's a shame, because when his instincts were on we got Incredible Cinema. Now we get a dumb 1970's B Horror movie that I only finished because I hoped that somewhere, somehow, some SIGNS or SIXTH SENSE magic would show up. Here's a spoiler: it never does. Somebody get M. Night into therapy now (or at least a UCLA film class for a semester or three)to work out his issues and get his edge back because The Happening is the new Webster's Dictionary example of a LETDOWN and the second bomb in a row for a guy capable of SO much better."
"thomasaaa123","4","2","6","23 November 2008"," Contrived and pretentious
","Like most of Shymalan's films, The Happening is pretentious. Don't get me wrong, there's a few stunning sequences (esp. an early one featuring some unexpected falling objects). But the deliberately tantalizing hints scattered throughout the movie, once again--much like in The Village, frustratingly proved to be just a tease and ultimately lead to nowhere. The whole setup and intentional atmosphere in the early part of the movie promised far more than was eventually delivered.<br/><br/>The Happening is not a very bad movie, and it has the potential to be much better. But that would require more honesty from Shymalan. Shymalan is a master creator of suspense. But except in The Sixth Sense and maybe Unbreakable and Signs, he failed to bring satisfactory resolution to the suspense he crafted. Consequently, by the time one leaves the theater, his later movies (The Happening in particular) feel empty, silly, contrived and forgettable.<br/><br/>It is most unfortunate that Shymalan's later movies increasingly bear the hallmark of a director/writer who has got famous and admired too early too fast. Fame and acclaims could lead one to all so easily be convinced that he's cleverer than the rest, and it showed in Shymalan's movies. He might indeed be a very gifted movie maker, but his strong self-assurance has got in his way of making truly good movies--movies with realistic emotional resonance, rather than inward looks of what is in Shymalan's own mind. Shymalan is overdue for a bit more self-confrontation. Until he confesses to himself that he's actually not as clever/intelligent as he believes he is, he cannot be as clever/intelligent as he has the potential to be."

"thisham33120","2","2","6","22 July 2008"," A disappointment, despite having potential
","I liked the sixth sense. In fact, with that movie, Shyamalan created a whole new style of storytelling. However, after that I watched Signs, The Village & Lady In The Water, I noticed the the pattern of steady deterioration in his work.<br/><br/>At least the rest of them had good performances by the actors in the lead roles. Mark Wahlberg frankly surprised me by how bad his acting was - I think he only did a few minutes of decent acting in the beginning. But then, he probably stood out because he had the most screen time; others were equally terrible, if not worse. In this case, it seems as if it's the director's fault. I also wonder if the mistake was greater in casting. Surely when you do so many close ups of the lead, you'd want an actor who is better at facial expressions. I respect Mark Wahlberg as an actor, but this movie really did make it seem that he'd only be good for the more physical actor playing a bad-ass.<br/><br/>Onto the plot, I thought the main concept of the movie was pretty interesting, it wasn't something totally useless like Epic Movie, but something one could ponder about. But the execution was rather poor. For example, at the end when a scientist loudly claims on TV that this was nature acting back, it seemed too overtly out there & sounded comical. I'd rather go with the government idea, because that idea was portrayed a bit more subtly.<br/><br/>The opening scene turned out to be pretty good, and for a moment, I found myself thinking ""Yes, Shyamalan has returned!"" But while the movie continued, the story didn't unravel any further. Halfway through the movie, we are told that plants are behind this pandemic, and that was the only explanation we ever got. I was naturally disappointed, not to see 'The Shyamalan Twist'at the end(although the scene at the end where Elliot & Alma walk towards each other in the fields & remain unaffected may have been intended as the twist, but I failed to see it).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there have been good movies where we never really get a full explanation of the plot, like the low-budget Canadian movie Cube. But they had more interesting characters. As for the characters in this movie, most of them seemed unrealistic. For example, the little feud between Elliot & Alma - were they not overreacting to Alma having dessert with Joey when supposedly working late? Or about the part about Elliot joking about a pharmacist? Another thing, the characters' reactions to the deaths surrounding seemed odd. Yes, Alma & Jess stated early on that they don't like to express themselves, but surely a bizarre pandemic could trigger a frenzy of emotions within them.<br/><br/>By the time we reached the freaky old woman, I hoped maybe there would be something to the movie. But sadly, all that freaky old woman was was a freaky old woman."

","I watched this film not too long ago... And wow.. just wow.. This is maybe one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a long time... The worst part of it was possibly the acting. While I actually think mark Wahlberg usually does an okay job... my god he didn't do it this time, and neither do any of the other actors. The best acting was probably by the construction worker early in the movie. other than that, the actual plot is just silly, and it seems like Mr Night knows just how unbelievable it is and tries to make it more believable by making people mention things about plants and the human energy time after time... It simply seems misplaced a lot of the time. The final moral about trying to be more careful about the way we treat our planet is all good and well.. but is kind of old and really doesn't save this movie. The one good point it did have was that it is rather scary and suspenseful I was certainly kept on the edge of my seat until the end.. so it does deserve a rating of 3 for that.. but other than that.. it's bad, simply put. sorry.

"MashedA","2","2","6","10 July 2008"," Missed opportunity!
","Where to begin with this sorry saga! The Happening is without doubt a missed opportunity snatched from the jaws of victory by our good friend Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg who, when given excellent direction and material can turn in a mediocre performance at best, finds that given no direction and bad material, well; I'm afraid you only get what you deserve.<br/><br/>Acting lesson 101:- An actor should be that good that you don't notice them acting! Wahlberg is so wooden I half expected to see a carpenter use him as an instrument to bludgeon one of the victims with.<br/><br/>The story in the Happening is a good premise badly realised. The film lacked a cohesive direction which left you without any empathy for the main characters or what was happening to them. There are many good scenes in this film, what is lacking is a strong enough thread by our main characters to mesh everything together.<br/><br/>There are some quite shocking scenes of construction workers jumping off high rise buildings that left me puzzled, would airborne spores really have reached that altitude in sufficient quantity when there didn't seem to be very much vegetation in the surrounding area?<br/><br/>In previous films by Shyamalan you had big name actors like Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson & Samuel L Jackson. The only link I can see here is Joaquin Phoenix who had been in the film ""We Own The Night"" which also starred Wahlberg. Perhaps Phoenix tipped Shyamalan that Wahlberg was good!<br/><br/>When all is said and done about this film, it is the actor who should be able to carry a film, be the star attraction,the film merely being a vehicle, you only have to see this from the likes of Will Smith who has had a couple of turkeys, yet is forgiven by his box office returns. Wahlberg is not in a position to carry the lead in a movie, he should stick to being a co-star in films with actors with more charisma like ""The Departed"" We can only hope that Wahlberg is not given the opportunity to ruin yet another film."
"chrisporreca","1","2","6","8 July 2008"," Two hours of my life I will never have back...
","There are so many rotten and useless aspects of this movie, I don't know where to begin. The pedestrian acting responding to the hollow direction? I've heard the director said he intended to create a B movie. Well, this is not how it was billed. When exactly did he decide this? Isn't that convenient once your movie is decidedly a totally campy piece of trash? We were sold his first R rated flick- promising a comeback that never came back. That there is still money backing Shayamalan or that we are still a hopeful public isn't up for debate in my mind. <br/><br/>So many ridiculous moments come to mind, but if there is one that stands out in my mind: the impossible and utterly laughable segment in which the person's arm is ripped off in a lion's den after the repeated coaxing on the part of the person. After tapping one lion's nose, ""hey, look here."" he turns to the other, in case he missed that, and had the remaining one promptly ripped off! I'm sorry, that is that height of hilarity.<br/><br/>The best part? That this was communicated via video through someone's Iphone, as simply as ""hey, look at what my sister sent me."" Okay, first off, why was the sister not jamming her Iphone into her eye socket upon seeing this? And second, the Iphone is incapable of recording video(in the real world).

","I won't do it. When you get to the end of this review there will not be a grade out of ten because I just can't do it. I want to slap a poor score on it and then the next minute I'm crying out to M. Night Shyamalan (who never answers back) that there has to be a secret to this film as to why it was PURPOSELY made so poorly. The man is not new to film making and I have loved every single one of his movies and the thing is they have all been downright brilliant. Brilliantly written, perfectly cast, wonderfully acted and beautifully directed. I will also say to all those people out there who crap of Lady In The Water...I adored Lady In The Water, pure and utter brilliance and beauty and probably my favorite of his films. The Village I could live without, it wasn't quite as intelligent as his other entries and then there is this which doesn't even register on the scale of intelligence. It's ludicrous!! There is virtually no story, not one that makes sense, the acting is horrid on the part of every single actor especially the lead cast. There is no beginning and end really, no twist, no cares, you just never wanna see it again. I'll get to my rant in a moment.<br/><br/>I'm going by face value and although I used to not be able to stand Mark Wahlberg but lately he had grown on me with some impressive performances. In this film he is absolutely putrid. One of the worst performances I have ever seen and I am telling you that 100% he is doing it on purpose. He is purposely acting bad. First of all his character acts like a child...and this is done on purpose I am sure of it I just don't know why. Other reviewers have noticed this as well. His scared puppy dog look about being left behind on the train, and his tone and his facial expressions...he's acting like a 10 year old boy but WHY?!?! Almost as bad is the performance by Zooey Deschanel. She acts like a child as well and that can't be just a coincidence?!?! She has these enormous eyes that are constantly zoomed in on as she just plain acts BAD!! The two of them together make a deplorable twosome with some sort of back story about them and their wedding that we are never privy too. John Leguizamo CAN act. I've seen it...and this is not it. He's acting almost as poorly as Wahlberg and has that child like quality about him too. There is some bad blood between his character and Deschanel's character but we don't know why and don't care really. The supporting cast aren't really terrible, they just aren't in it much and we don't care because the lead cast is so awful. <br/><br/>Is M. Night Shyamalan trying to create a movie that is so bad it will become a cult classic twenty years from now? Is that his twist? Will he pop out twenty years from now when the Golden edition Red Ray disk version is released and say HA I PLANNED YOU ALL TO LIKE IT IN TWENTY YEARS!! Is there some hidden mystery to the lead cast acting like children? Is it some message about purity and environmental ruin? There has to be something...someone please save the reputation of M. Night Shyamalan for me because this film single handedly ruined him as one of my favorite directors and yet I hold hope that there is something more, something fiendishly clever about the movie. I kept wondering if the twist would be that all these people were filming a bad B Movie like Godzilla or Valley of The Dolls or something but no it appears that it just might be that bad. But to hold out hope I will not rate this movie for the first time in 700 reviews!! I only encourage film buffs to watch this and try to find for yourself the reason why it is terrible but do not go see this expecting to be entertained because it is ridiculous!! A summer bomb by any stretch of imagination!!"

But it starts to get bland and boring very quickly and at that point the acting and the boom mike get to be a source of irritation.

No, instead it gets worse - it finishes itself off with a true cliché ending that manages to change the feeling of slight irritation into massive irritation.<br/><br/>So, in short...

When I say terrible I am over stating how I feel, but rather summing up my overall view of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible. In fact, I believe it was one of the worst acted films I have ever seen while under a dramatic/suspense category. Mark Walberg is usually good, but it was like watching him in The Big Hit. He talks like a puss and is put out as the strong willed protagonist. He didn't feel strong, smart, or interesting.<br/><br/>Supporting actors were about just as bad.<br/><br/>And I never felt as if the people in the movie were ever truly scared or troubled about what was happening.<br/><br/>NOW THE STORY.......<br/><br/>The story was very good at first......but it seems to me that M. Night came up with the idea and didn't know how to completely unroll it into a movie. It felt very draggy and repetitive. As if they looped the same scene throughout the entire middle then ended it......terribly.<br/><br/>OVERALL.....<br/><br/>This movie does not come with my recommendation, and you can say he just doesn't like M.

John Leguizamo stood out among all the actors, but his performance was still very lukewarm for what he is capable of. The special effects (of people dying)were neat and marginally scary, but only because of the loud thuds. Mostly I was cringing because this movie was so poorly put together. M.

"mjrei","4","2","6","21 June 2008"," Like many others I vote ""not happening"" for The Happening.
","I'll try to sum this up quickly. M. Night Shyamalan has a lot of good will in my book as ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" are some of the most entertaining and nerve-wracking movies made in the last 10 years. For those three great films alone I'll go see M. Night's future films hoping for anything even close to those highly entertaining films.<br/><br/>The Happening isn't all bad. It is however, about 60% bad. And when it's bad, on occasion, it's downright awful. I was going with it for about the first 30 minutes. The first 30 minutes seemed like a collaboration piece between M. Night and John Carpenter. Again it worked for a while, sort of.<br/><br/>As the non-story ""builds"" the directing and acting both seem to get sloppier. Scenes become unintentionally funny and I for one found myself groaning out loud and talking back to the screen. I haven't done this so often since Nicolas Cage in ""The Wicker Man."" I'm convinced The Happening will be studied in future film classes as an example of when things go horribly wrong. It's worth seeing, but don't expect to see a good movie."
"piksplanet","3","2","6","21 June 2008"," Really really disappointing..
","It is a well known fact that Manoj Night Shyamalan is a prodigy when it comes to making our hair stand on ends, and make you cringe in your seat with fear. It is also a well known fact that he might be losing his touch a little bit. Although his scripts are among the most original to come out of Hollywood, since Signs, his films have failed to capture the attention of audiences. With all due respect to Shyamalan, I have loved all his movies immensely except Lady in The Water, The Happening shows signs of lack of care in making the movie. Something that one would never associate with him.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is famous for the tension he creates on the screen. The scary and awe-inspiring moments which he is able to create on celluloid is nothing short of pure genius. Read : The scene with the boy with half a head from The Sixth Sense, the green man running across the screen in a flash from Signs, and the sight of a police jeep driving up in the middle of what seemingly is nowhere from The Village. M. Night Shyamalan is truly brilliant when it comes to things like that.<br/><br/>Like all the above mentioned, The Happening too has a fair share of such sequences. Namely, people falling off a rooftop (the poster above), a man walking straight into a lion pen - swarming with lions, and another man laying himself down in front of a giant grass-cutter. The loudness of the sounds which accompany these are shocking, not to mention spot-on! From shots of the wind ruffling through giant oaks and tall grasses, to shots of utter silence, visually The Happening is stunning. But that is about it.<br/><br/>The storyline is merely a different take on what one calls, in layman's terms, global warming. The biological accuracy of the plot is unknown to me. The consequences however, are, simply put, freaky! It is some sort of toxin or whatever you would like to call it, that makes human being suicidal. It looks mostly like a zombie movie. Though, films like 28 Days Later and I am Legend tackled the situation differently. The acting is way below par. Mark Wahlberg is not suited to play a science teacher. Zooey Deschanel, blue-eyed wonder, (Shayamalan has one of these individual's in most of his films) is flat. No expression, no nothing. The little girl, Ashlyn Sanchez is also flat (Why not Dakota Fanning? - though she wouldn't have much to do). There is no character development at all. The timing for most things is wrong. You never really feel for the characters. Just the sheer apocalyptic nature of the plot is enough to dismiss everything else about the film. It just seems a bit too over the top.<br/><br/>There are also too many misleading plot twists. The hippy family, and old Mrs. Jones (plain insane I tell you. I felt like smashing her head with a shovel). The two kids which accompany the main cast midway through the film - What were they even there for? All over, just the background score and the visual look and feel of the movie are commendable. Shayamalan still stands out in that field. But, be serious. The Happening is nowhere close to a good movie. It's just all wrong. Why would anyone crack a romantic joke when they have better things to worry about? Concentrate on staying alive - that helps! Don't waste your time on this. Catch a few of the scenes I mentioned above, on YouTube, stay home and watch a rerun of The Sixth Sense, Signs, or whatever.<br/><br/>3/10 overall. Give us something better, M. Night. We know you can!"
"robin-lefebvre","3","2","6","21 June 2008"," Annoying technicallity
","I'll not go into storyline discussions, there are currently over 300 comments already. Either you like it as a B-movie, were characters are in-perfect beings in suspense running from the unknown, untouchable and invisible, or you think the suspense mechanism used is ridicule and unbelievable.<br/><br/>My critiques is a technical one. Ever seen Out of Africa, where in one of the scenes you can see a black object hovering in the top middle of the picture? An incompetent sound recorded whos single job is to hold the microphone on a stick couldn't keep it up and the microphone hovered in view. That was 1985 and just once. ""The happening"" is 2008 and the the microphone dips into the picture 15-20 times through out the whole movie. I just hate it when a movie is trying to draw you into the story-line, trying to get you to the edge of your seat... and you see a technical error that reinforces the 'oh-yeah just some actors in front of a camera repeating their script-lines' feeling.<br/><br/>Seriously, did Mr. Shyamalan even looked at the movie after shooting the last scene? The microphone is so often in view that he could just as easily cropped the top 10 pixels of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Send back to originator and put some more effort in it next time."
"emanuel42","Null","2","6","20 June 2008"," so bad, in any respect
","this movie is so bad, I can't imagine why other critics used so many words to describe and criticize it. The acting is bad, , the background of the characters is unclear (so is the conflict between the couple). There is some resemblance to War of worlds, but this story is so poor, and...stupid , that any comparison will be an insult. There is one similarity to the recently made version, with Tom Cruize; the little girl portrayed in both films is hysterical, and is an irritation to the audience ear.The elderly lady , who owns the house , tops everything else in this movie by adding a grotesque figure to this basically impossible plot.<br/><br/>Do not go to see it, it is a waste of your money, or even worse; of your time."
"da_lowdown","3","2","6","20 June 2008"," Disappointing
","I include ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" at the top of my personal mood-piece masterpiece list. Shyamalan has shown an uncanny ability in the past to conjure up tension and dread almost out of nothingness on the screen. That takes talent. <br/><br/>However, with this movie, it seems that he has become overconfident, overusing some of his old tricks to the point of gimmickry. The overuse of staccatos and things jumping out of the corner of the screen show that he was really reaching for the cheap scares, perhaps to hide a weak script. And that's were the problem lies: A weak script. Unlike his previous films, which were patient, well modulated, detailed, and flowing, this movie seems to just clunk along without creating any tension, character empathy, or dread. It doesn't do a very good job at making us care for the characters. The story feels hackish because the dialog is hackish. <br/><br/>I don't know the man, obviously, but judging by his latest work, he's become overconfident. Overconfidence breeds complacency. His complacency is evident everywhere, especially in the halfhearted script. I hope Shyamalan takes some time to prepare his next script. <br/><br/>I get the feeling he probably needs to get his ego in check as well."

"schlimig","3","2","6","19 June 2008"," Dire!
","I am a casual fan of 50's b-movie thriller and horror films and have seen a few real stinkers in my time, but also some true works of genius. A film can be bad and awkward and messy and still achieve greatness, the Happening did not.<br/><br/>Lord knows what they spent the $50,0000,000 budget on - there were virtually no effects, a short filming schedule, outside naturalistic location shoots, minimal extras and only a few big stunt shots. The actors (whilst good actors in my opinion) are hardly high-salaried Hollywood a-listers so I doubt it went on them.<br/><br/>The acting was bad. Stilted, awkward and in places downright amateurish. At points you could almost see the actors trying to be bad it was so bad. This style of acted bad acting just didn't work and it made the film feel really childish, rather than b-grade. I had images of little kids playing in the yard putting on a play or something, not b-movie! There was nothing amazing in the cinematography; the camera work did nothing to build a sense of tension nor intrigue for me, it was just really flat and uninteresting. In particular there was one shot with very little movement where the boom mic came down into the frame - really inexcusable and if it was done on purpose to make it look b-grade then they should have backed this up with other such touches.<br/><br/>The story you could scribble down on a post-it note. If this had been a 30 minute short film or something it may well have just about clawed enough substance together to be interesting but the film just went on and on and on and was punctuated by some truly awful and clanging expositions from characters throughout.<br/><br/>Basically this film could have been done really well. The concept is interesting but M Night it seems is not skilled enough to make a contemporary b-movie. As such the elements which attempted to make it so were heavy handed, misplaced and jarring throughout. If you want to see a fantastic b-movie then I suggest that you look to Grindhouse's Planet Terror and Deathproof - two genius contemporary homages to the genre.<br/><br/>Save your money, there's better stuff out right now."
"jethro247","4","2","6","19 June 2008"," wait for DVD, a few good moments, but not worth a trip to the cinema
","i cannot understand the people who have voted 7-10 points for this... a really terrible script, some truly wooden acting from Zooey Deschannel, and even Wahlberg struggles with the material. As for the story ? an interesting premise, but no real commitment. The characters that are meant to be introducing some form of explanation are portrayed as such loons that you don't take the seriously - so how are we meant to take any of it seriously? Save yourself the trouble; watch 'The Birds' instead, it's basically the same story - couple in peril (cause unknown), driving around, trying to get away from the danger, but with a sappy kid thrown in for good measure. I've always been a big fan of the way The Birds ends, but with the happening i was just glad it was over.------------it does have an excellent score however, very creepy.----and ther are a few good scenes, i suppose..."
"kirvic_aguilera","6","2","6","18 June 2008"," Good Idea, Everything else just...kind of bad
","I was waiting this movie since a saw the trailer, really waiting for it. The Friday the 13th of June was the premiere. The idea and plot the movie is really good, a new idea, but the acting is weird, the people is not so stupid to see that a virus or something is in the air and get our of their cars to breed fresh air. Well not everybody can do that, some thinks. This director is responsible for The Sixth Sense, and Signs, and The Village, and I enjoy those, and are really precious horror and sci fi films but ""The Happening"" is not going to be in my collection of GOOD HORROR AND SCI FI MOVIES. Anyway, Good idea, bad movie, not worse than others, but just bad."
"rosepetals495","5","2","6","18 June 2008"," Shyamalan Has Seem to Done it Again!
","Let's be honest here; Shyamalan hasn't really done anything spectacular since The Sixth Sense. I actually went into this movie having no prior knowledge of it besides my friend telling me it looked good. I was surprised when I saw that Shyamalan had written, produced, and directed this new feature film. I was also surprised by the fact in the first few minutes a woman stabbed herself in the neck. Yeah.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes or so were pretty decent. Entertaining for the most part, but after that, it was pretty downhill from there. I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg, but through the entire 91 minutes of this film, he didn't seem quite to click with his character. All of the characters seemed quite out of place for one reason or another, and I think that can be blamed on the writing.<br/><br/>First of all, why did there have to be ""another man?"" Honestly, that was just unnecessary turmoil between the two main characters. Or perhaps it was just a plot to get Shyamalan a part without being too obvious. I absolutely HATED the parenting aspects in this movie. Okay, so there are people all over New York City killing themselves, a supposed terroristic attack, and Jess's mom decides that is the perfect time to leave her family and go get her a doll house?! And then Julian leaves his only daughter to find his wife, thinking, oh!, maybe she might still be alive. No. Why would you do that?! That just frustrated me to no end.<br/><br/>What also frustrated me was the lack of closure and answers to the never ending questions being asked. The movie just kind of ended. Kind of... The question I kept asking myself, my friend, and the movie screen (if it was supposedly the plants) is, ""why now? Why not 20 years ago, or a decade from now?"" They seemed to try to explain that in the news sequence, but even the person being interviewed had no idea. Of all of the Shyamalan movies I have seen, there has always been a plot twist, which has made most of his movies the only thing that makes them watchable.<br/><br/>The only thing that made The Happening watchable was the amazing direction. There is no doubt that Shyamalan is a fantastic director, but it seems like he has lost his knack for writing."
"rob-purkiss","Null","2","6","18 June 2008"," An attack on the senses!
","I've got to say this is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen... and I've seen some awful films :) The acting was appalling; Wahlberg's performance has somehow lowered his career to an unbelievable level of torment and the dreadful attempt rest of the supporting cast was nothing more than an assault on the senses, in fact Deschanel's dramatic moments had me laughing out loud in the cinema, the casting director should be shot. The cinematography was dreadfully cheap and arduous to watch while the drawn out and characterless storyline lacked direction and conclusion. As far as Shyamalan's direction is concerned, I've seen stronger purpose and vision in school nativities.<br/><br/>In summary the film seems to be Shyamalan's momentary comment on mans effect on the planet strung into a miss-conjoined series of random events and slapped onto film, truly offensive to anyone with any sense of taste or fracture of intelligence.<br/><br/>You have to watch it to believe how bad it is!"
"doc66-1","4","2","6","18 June 2008"," ""You just don't get it""
","I think the majority of the people that are rating this movie any better then a 5 think they are at some deeper level of understanding. I understand the movie fine, the plot, although possible, isn't feasible. The actors are all trying their best but the screen play and the lines they are forced to say sound that way. Nothing is realistic in portrayal of the expected emotions. The first half of the movie is playing on a dead suspense note because you and the actors (probably shamalan too) are trying to figure out what the hell they are gonna do with this movie. Then, just like it probably happened in the writing process, an answer just comes out of left field. We are expected to believe that what Wahlberg's character says is the truth, how he knew what was going on is beyond me. I must say though, the last third of this movie is entertaining. Once Shamalan gives up trying to keep up the poor suspense, there are some really interesting ideas to be played out in the world they have created for the viewer. Sadly, shamalan tests out two simple ideas of ""what would probably happen"". <br/><br/>(SPOILER FURTHER - STOP READING TO STAY SURPRISED)<br/><br/>The ending was incredibly cliché. I guess not having happy endings isn't the new hot thing, it is back to typically happy endings. (^^ SPOILER ^^)<br/><br/>I would wait for the DVD, or download it for free on the internet."
"Mylene-2","2","2","6","18 June 2008"," SPOILERs - for a bad movie....
","Save your money and your time.<br/><br/>I am a faithful fan of M. Night Shyamalan. When everyone trashed any of his other movies, I defended them. His movies have always told such different stories; and he tells them and films them well. So, where did he go wrong here? Oh yes, he went terribly wrong. <br/><br/>***Spoiler to follow*** It seems he paid millions of dollars to tell his viewers that the abuse that the earth is experiencing from human existence is making her angry and she's not going to take it any longer. And apparently, you don't want to see her angry.<br/><br/>****And more spoilers**** For me to really enjoy a film, the characters have to be believable and act the way real people would act in certain situations. I'm talking about the porch scene. This scene had more holes in it than the police put in Bonnie and Clyde. If a little hole in a car will let in enough air to affect a carload of people, how did these people have only shutters on their windows keeping out the ""whatever""? People are jumpy in times of violence. Why did the kid keep pounding on the door? Why did Mark Wahlburg not grab the kid away? Better yet -- if a one person in a group of people standing on porch gets blasted with a shotgun, the whole group will generally freak and hit the ground or run. They will not hang around like a bunch of dorks waiting to be picked off like quail.<br/><br/>***Yet more whiny spoilers*** Okay, now my last rant... Why was the old lady crazy? He made such a point of her madness, but no hint or explanation. Why put it in the movie if you're not going to exploit her insanity? And that thing in the bed, it reminded me of Norman's mother. Was there a dead child under that mask? Don't put something in a movie that's so distracting but adds nothing to the movie. My point, I was distracted about the whys and what fors of the old lady that it detracted from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>***Summary without any spoilers what-so-ever*** You've been warned. Don't believe the good reviews, listen to me. Wait for the DVD if you feel you really have to watch it, because it's not a big screen movie anyway. And if you've read the other reviews that trash the acting, they weren't wrong. :-\"
"taxdodger","3","2","6","18 June 2008"," Big disappointment.
","I think when the Director said to go in to enjoy a fun B movie, what he was really saying was, look, I know this film is awful. The acting is terrible and I'm sorry to say that because I like Mark Whalberg & John Leguizamo (although the latter probably gave the best bit of acting in the movie, though that's not saying too much).<br/><br/>As a big fan of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & Signs, it's hard to believe this piece of tripe is from the same director. I don't understand how some of these takes made it to the final cut of the movie. I reckon M Knight may have actually suffered the Happening while in front of the camera, making him disorientated to good acting. Yes, that's it, it's got to be. I I could go on and on but I won't. Absolutely awful, the end."
"DonFishies","3","2","6","17 June 2008"," If only the script could have reflected Shyamalan's great ideas and imagination
","M. Night Shyamalan has a habit of making movies that look and sound genuinely interesting. The man clearly has an immense imagination, and it shows in the content he produces. But after the disappointment of The Village and the absolutely terrible Lady in the Water, I think I was one of the few that still held out hope for The Happening.<br/><br/>For good reason too.<br/><br/>As the title and promos suggest, The Happening revolves around an ""event"" that is making people in certain states in the US commit suicide. Originally pegged as the work of biological terrorists, everyone in the top most Eastern states attempts to flee, but the threat continues to wreck havoc on the populous. The film focuses on the plight of Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) Moore, who are attempting to get out of Philadelphia with the daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), of one of their friends.<br/><br/>Intriguingly, Shyamalan starts the film right off with the event beginning to take place in New York City, and barely breaks pace to breathe from there. Much like Cloverfield, this is a movie about running and survival. We are barely introduced to Elliot and Alma before they find out about what is going on, and attempt to leave Philadelphia. He leaves very little time to get to know anyone the two encounter (much less the pair themselves), and spend more time on how they are avoiding what looks like an inevitable death. And in this respect (minus some really bogged down exposition near the final third of the film), Shyamalan manages to recreate the breakneck thriller style we knew him for back when he was first starting out (so basically everything pre-Village).<br/><br/>He is also very effect in his use of violence. It is never too gruesome, but it is fairly graphic nonetheless. The film was advertised heavily as his first attempt at an R-rating, and he uses this minor hindrance to his advantage. But instead of being in-your-face about the violence, he builds up to it, hitting us with graphic images for only a few minor seconds (as opposed to the near pornographic depictions in ""thrillers"" like Saw IV and Hostel). He teases and shows only what he needs to, and then throws up the rest quickly in the cases that need it. And when he is not being ridiculous with his death sequences, it looks like he is making a genuine attempt at scaring the audience.<br/><br/>But unfortunately for Shyamalan, this is not the movie that will deliver him out of the rut he is in. If anything, he just made the hole a touch bigger.<br/><br/>For one thing, the storyline becomes ludicrously bad after the devastating effects begin to become apparent. It just seems like he cooked up the idea for the story, wrote an amazing opening, and then had no idea what to do afterwards. Everything that comes after the initial set-up either feels half baked, or feels haphazardly thrown together at the last minute. There is little commitment to these scenes, and there is even less in the cohesiveness of the story. The film is not long at all (and practically flies through its running time), but it feels like a lot of loose ideas Shyamalan had super-glued together in his script, than it does something he actually spent real time working on. I admire and like the reasoning behind the attacks, but Shyamalan only has the idea on display here, not the real workings of it.<br/><br/>Laughably bad death scenes aside, Shyamalan also needs to work on his dialogue. The Happening is nowhere near as dialogue heavy as any of his other scripts, and as a result, leaves a lot of room for error. I know that Wahlberg is a decent actor capable of greatness. But here, his character is worse than one-dimensional. Yes, we have the pathos for his character built up in nearly every scene, but his dialogue does not sound like that of any human being I have ever met in my life. If I am being faced with a life-altering decision, I doubt I would ever just say ""Oh no"", and not really mean it. If the audience is laughing at what your characters are saying, instead of being terrified of what may or may not be coming for them, something is most definitely wrong.<br/><br/>We know, at the very least, that Shyamalan can write decent dialogue. The man was not nominated for a writing Oscar simply based off the crazy ending people still talk about. So what happened here? Did he really set out to write the most wooden dialogue of the year? Did the studio really push him into the project based solely off the main idea that is expressed with the first ten minutes? Valid questions yes, but ones that will never be answered by the man himself.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the movie is nearly unwatchable. Wahlberg and Deschanel are the essence of mismatched pair, and not once is their relationship believable. I realize that some of their subplot involves the troubles they are having in their marriage, but it does not explain the fact that they never show any real desire for having liked each other in the first place. Sadly, Deschanel fairs even worse than Wahlberg's cardboard acting. I really liked some of her previous work, but here she looks confused for the majority of the film, and completely out of it for the rest.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is not much better. Sanchez does not even bother making an attempt at trying to look desperate, John Leguizamo gets next to no time to develop anything, and Betty Buckley's character is just too quirky for words.<br/><br/>The Happening has some great ideas, but no foundations to do anything with them. Shyamalan has the ability to make something of his movies, why not use it instead of giving us this half-baked garbage? <br/><br/>3.5/10."
"cartoonfan322","3","2","6","17 June 2008"," Certainly not what I expected
","A deadly killer rises up out of nowhere, indiscriminately taking victims, shattering families and lives, and crippling the northeastern United States in a matter of hours. It has the power to cause even the most strong-willed of people to fall under its power, rendering lethal wounds unto themselves, decimating the population. New York, the city that never sleeps, falls silent. All that is heard is the sound of the rustling wind. It's an interesting premise, one that fits M. Night Shyamalan's thriller genre: take an everyday occurrence, something we take for granted, and make it the most terrifying thing imaginable. Make it a story of survival, of beating the odds, of the everyday man in a battle against nature itself. A story of human love triumphing over human nature, and of the will to live triumphing over the will to destroy life.<br/><br/>If only that had been the case.<br/><br/>Rather than taking that interesting premise and developing it into realizing its potential, Shyamalan's latest piece is instead a horror of poor writing, poor acting, and poor execution. Not even a promising cast, led by the usually watchable Mark Wahlberg, could save this train wreck of a film. Instead, the viewer is subjected to 91 minutes of watching Wahlberg and company wander aimlessly with looks of chronic constipation, sometimes running from their unseen enemy, sometimes hiding like small children playing a game of hide and seek. Just as laughably, too.<br/><br/>Wahlberg's character, Elliott, is a high-school science teacher who always sounds like he's talking to hyperactive five-year-olds. He is married to Alma, played by the normally enchanting Zooey Deschanel, but who in this film appears to be awakening from a drug-induced coma. Perpetually wide-eyed, you have to wonder if she really comprehends any of what's going on or if she's just following a game of cat-and-mouse. For two award-winning actors, these performances were very sub-par, quite on the same level as Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in the recent Star Wars movies, if not lower.<br/><br/>Elliott and Alma are joined by Elliott's best friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and his young daughter Jess as they try to escape the affected areas of attack. Julian eventually leaves them to find his wife, leaving Jess, who has the role of the eerily quiet, affected child in this volume of Shyamalan's work. (Reference: Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, and Abigail Breslin in Signs for comparisons.) They run through the countryside, trying to escape the wind, and although they're caught in it, they emerge unharmed.<br/><br/>That's another big issue I have with the film: believability. A deadly neurotoxin travels through the air, yet somehow Elliot and his crew, though being caught in it, are never affected. The neurotoxin is apparently unable to travel through cracks or holes, as evidenced by the numerous door slams and window locks in the movie. So many times, while watching this movie, I was reminded of the fright films that used to be shown in schools in the 1950s and 1960s, during the Cold War, which led hundreds of thousands of children to believe that hiding under a desk would protect you from a nuclear bomb. Were a neurotoxin to truly be released into the air, such as sarin or mustard gas, no amount of door slamming or towel-stuffing would be able to save you; even a fraction of a percentage of the toxin could travel through, and that would be enough to kill. That is a fact. What's sad is that this reality was shoved aside, asking the viewer to ignore all logic in favor of the story.<br/><br/>There is just so much wrong with this movie it's almost embarrassing. From the bad script, to the horrid acting, to the sluggish pace of the action, this certainly has to be Shyamalan's most forgettable film. Let's hope he's able to pick up the pieces from this disaster and make a comeback in his next movie."
"Rob_Yeomans-1","4","2","6","17 June 2008"," Another poor showing
","OK, so M. Night Shymalan is back with his follow up to the truly god-awful 'Lady In The Water' which is something of an achievement in itself as I'm surprised anyone would give him a penny after that effort, but they did so here we are.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is based around a sudden biological attack in eastern America which causes its infected to commit mass acts of suicide. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are the couple on the run from the ever widening affected area. An interesting idea, you would assume, especially given the fancy trailer which has been doing the rounds for the last month or so.<br/><br/>However, there is a problem with The Happening. It is terrible in many ways, and by terrible i mean truly terrible. The first problem I had was the acting, particularly Wahlberg, who it seems was challenging himself to use only one vocal tone throughout the film, which as soon as he opened his mouth in his opening scene sounded absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>My second issue with the film was that it was like being locked in a room and coughed on repeatedly by a Greenpeace activist. Shymalan uses the entire film to get across an idea that he is teaching all of us uneducated people the error of our ways, well I'm sorry but the man is simply making himself look like a fool.<br/><br/>Thirdly the film was just plain ridiculous throughout, I mean for example, for anyone who has seen or plans to see this film, when you leave the cinema, please ask yourself: Who was controlling the wind? And one final thought, in the trailer there is a sequence in central park where a woman is looking around her as the woman next to her and all of the people in the park around her become infected with the 'virus' I ask you all, how is it that she does not get 'infected' at the same time? It just WOULDN'T HAPPEN.<br/><br/>So in conclusion 'The Happening' is an interesting concept which has been terribly hampered by a poor script, terrible acting and poor execution.<br/><br/>Rob Yeomans"

","I'm not entirely sure what age has to do with it? Is it an over-a-certain-age sort of film? It's a fifteen over here mate! In a Nut shell I think the whole Idea of the film was good, but they shouldn't have put the best part of the film on the adverts (which by the way seems to be the down fall of a lot of movies these days). It was too long winded and yet not really that long at all ... it goes to show something when you're sat watching a film for an hour and a half (or whatever it was) and you feel like you've been in there forever! Also, I thought that in most films you were supposed to feel a 'connection' of sorts with the characters ... not at all! There seemed to be no chemistry what so ever with the main characters and I believe the director tried far too hard to over use the 'shock tactics'. I was really looking forward to this film and was sorely disappointed! I honestly went to watch it thinking it would be great, I'm actually a fan of MNS!<br/><br/>WHAT'S HAPPENING???"
"MacAindrais","7","2","6","17 June 2008"," There's Something Happening Here
","The Happening (2008) *** <br/><br/>I should admit that I have a predilection for disaster flicks. My fascination with natural (or something like it)disasters on celluloid has lead me to give generally favorable reviews to otherwise not very strong films. I debated myself whether to go with a 2.5 star review or the positive 3 stars. I at first chose 2 1/2. I slept on it, and decided that I was interested enough in The Happening to kick it up half a star. This review is one of guilty pleasure, and may be against my critical judgment.<br/><br/>This movie is preposterous, hammy, cheesy, corny and silly. Despite that, its execution is clever, and its premise is terrifying and, to me, extremely intriguing.<br/><br/>An unknown natural disaster is affecting the North Eastern United States, beginning in New York City and spreading throughout the region. Eliott (Mark Whalberg) is a high school science teacher, who lectures his students on the disappearance of bees all over the country. He's soon after pulled out of his class room and informed that there is some kind of ""event"" happening. This event causes people to become disorientated, attacks their motor skills as they stand still or walk backwards, then triggers them to kill themselves. Suicides come en masse and no one is safe - other than animals. Eliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel), his friend Julien (Leguizamo) and his daughter hop a train to Pennsylvania in hopes that this ""event"" wont' be happening there. Of course it moves there, and they're train is stopped in the middle of nowhere after it loses contact with everyone. Stranded, they attempt to flee west, where the event is not happening. Julien, frantic over his wife who is in Princeton, heads off to find her, leaving his daughter with Eliott and Alma, who are struggling to keep their marriage afloat.<br/><br/>The origins of the ""event"" are not really in the end officially determined - its proposed that the plants have released toxins as a self-defense mechanism; others propose its an army experiment gone awry, to which the government refuses to comment upon. The plant theory is the most precedent among the group. This of course equals trouble since they're stuck in the middle of nowhere surrounded by forestation.<br/><br/>The Happening goes to some pretty extreme, and pretty silly lengths to get its message across. Some of the suicides are so over the top they're comical - I'm still unsure if Shyamalan was in on this little joke or not. There are other moments which seem to be added for nothing more than shock value. The movie is rated R, and it earns it with a number of moments.<br/><br/>Shyamalan certainly has a strong talent for direction and photography - the film shows that definitely - but he is deeply lacking in the writing department. Tracing back his films, there has always been a weakness in his writing - dialogue is often contrived and expositional when its unnecessary, dating from the Sixth Sense to Signs (both films which I like very much). Poor writing hurts The Happening, and there a few cringe worth moments of foolishness. There are scenes where it sounds as if voices were dubbed in later to explain what we just saw in case we didn't pick up on it ourselves. There is a scene near the end that offers this method of clarification, where the problem isn't actually that it was explained through dialogue (it probably needed it) but the manner it was done. A shot cuts to outside of a house, and Eliott's voice cues to sum up what just happened in one exposition heavy sentence, end scene. I'm not suggesting that I necessarily have a better way to clear this up, but its done so poorly that I simply must be possible. What comes after that is also extremely clichéd and entirely tacked on for no reason other than sentimental posturing. This of course is the fault of the writing. Oh, and also get ready for people to say the word ""happening"" or some variation thereof at every chance.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Shyamalan's directing chops are still sharp, and there are some very effective moments throughout the film. The manner of how people are affected is not only interesting, but awesomely eery and creepy. There is something about seeing a entire park of people stop dead in their tracks and become disorientated that his a nerve. There are moments in the film where when these people stand still that it almost seems to take on the creepiness of a similar scene in a far different film. Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad has a famous scene in which two people talk on balcony overlooking a garden at a hotel. The people in the garden stand entirely still as they cast shadows but plants and other fixtures cast none. I suspect that if you know this shot, it will make the scenes in The Happening that much creepier. The pacing of the movie (which has a fairly short run time) has been attacked as ""too slow"" and ""nothing happens."" I actually thought the pacing of the film was one of its strongest assets. It takes its time, and I enjoy that in a film.<br/><br/>From what I've said here I'm really not justifying giving this a positive review, however its the premise of the film, which I think is so deeply interesting and truly scary, that keeps this afloat, but may also damn it at the same time. I will say it here and now that I am disappointed, and frankly if it came out tomorrow that The Happening was being remade, I would jump to see it get a do-over. Either way, I was still entertained by this one."
"j-burke-2","1","2","6","17 June 2008"," Booooooooooooo
","Wow. That is all I can say. Immediately following the end of the movie, I gave a different one word reaction.<br/><br/>I loved 6th Sense. I loved Signs. Unbreakable and The Village were kind of cool with a certain amount of creep factor and some decent acting. But this stinker is possibly the worst piece of garbage to ever come out of a major studio.<br/><br/>Do you hear that? I think it sounds like the end of Marky Mark's career. I am a huge Mark Wahlberg fan, but he seemed to be stuck in some feminine, bad-acting mode that should have him in Days of Our Lives, not on the big screen.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible. The script was terrible. The character development was forced and contrived. The only scary part was a crazy old woman that they sort of just stuck in the film near the end as they probably realized just how boring of a movie they were making.<br/><br/>I mourn the death of Marky Mark's acting career. He coulda been a contenda.<br/><br/>And as for M. Night Shyamalan, his movies seem to be getting worse instead of better.<br/><br/>I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"

","Truly the worst of Shy's films, it hurt me to watch. I was perhaps expecting the best thing since sliced bread and therefore had further to fall... but why do i still feel like i'm falling?? The acting was souless, unbelievable, and unfortunately was always going to fail with poor direction, editing and script.<br/><br/>Please don't waste your time and money in the cinema, the film probably had it's merits but i was bored after 30 mins, nothing of any relevance happened after the first 15 mins... watch that much and it's intriguing, watch more and wait for something to happen, and wait, and wait, and wait... and then get scared once... hmmm...<br/><br/>Perhaps too simple? I'd like to see a directors cut produced that maybe adds something to it, in it's current form it doesn't feel finished and feels like the director got bored after 30 mins and decided to try a different film!"
"M-J-Veerkamp","4","2","6","17 June 2008"," Not even an interesting failure
","Once upon a time, I was a fan of 'The Sixth sense'. I loved the tone, the pace and the craftsmanship. I saw some of these elements in the others movies that 'Night' made, but I feel the urge to file most of his work under 'humbug'. I'm don't want to bash his films, if I give a filmmaker two hours of my time I want his films to be good. The 'Lady in the water' was a failure, but at least a stylish failure:he tried to do something different and had to pay a price for the risk. I respect that effort. 'The Happening' travels a very familiar road: it's another disaster movies. After 'Cloverfield', 'The Mist' or maybe even 'War of the worlds' comes another tale of people who try to avoid a haunting fate. This time, sadly to say, it's emotionally flat, mannered, empty and not even stylish. Not subtle in any way. The acting style wasn't working. I love Zooey, but here it seemed as if she's been eating mushrooms all the time. Wahlberg can be sharp, like in 'The Departed', but his line-reading seems uninspired, flat. The stilted acting style feels too cerebral. The way people react to all the horrible events the witness doesn't feel real, there's a lack of internal logic. There are some scary moments, but when it starts raining construction workers the whole cinema was shaking with laughter. The idea is GOOD but the overacting is horrendous. And then that final scene.... an attempt to a 'twist ending'? I was angry with this lazy film. I don't know if I even by another ticket for a film by M. Night Charlatan."
"osmith-9","3","2","6","16 June 2008"," a very B-rate film
","I was shocked at how poorly made this film was. There are high school kids who, given the same amount of money, would have made a better film. The idea behind the film is plausible. I was intrigued by it. But 'The Happening' totally fails to live up to its promise. The acting is bad. The special effects are horrible. And when it tries to be 'Hitchcock', it's laughable. This is a movie you can sit through. It didn't make me walk away. But there are parts of this movie that seem like a spoof of thrillers... only they're not meant to be spoofs. For example, there is a scene where supposed home video of a bloody scene. It's a joke. You look at it and go, 'they've got to be kidding'. And when a car rams into a tree, a dummy goes flying out the front window about 50 feet, and it looks totally fake. All you can do is laugh, and say 'how could a movie have gone so wrong?'"
"wisewhiz","1","2","6","16 June 2008"," What ""Happened"" to Shyamalan?
","The only thing I wondered after watching The Happening was what ""happened"" to M. Night Shyamalan. I'll come right out and say it: this movie was bad. It wasn't scary, suspenseful, thought-provoking, or anything else that it tried to be.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about the movie is M. Night Shyamalan, because the biggest fault in the movie was poor direction. He's already proved to the world that he can be an awesome director. It's not like the potential is there--it's already been proved! It is baffling, then, to see how this movie can be made by the very person who brought the Sixth Sense. Yes, I know, people claim that you can't compare this movie to his previous works. Yes, I can. That movie was really good. This movie was really bad.<br/><br/>Let's start with the acting. It wasn't there. The entire movie, I felt an emotional disconnect because I did not feel that the characters were actual people. They were just people staring off in the distance, delivering poorly written lines, not even showing a shred of panic, nervousness, or even more than a slight concern that people all around them are killing themselves! Mark Wahlberg is not the greatest actor, but he's not a bad actor. Obviously, he's not (insert Academy Award winning actor's name here) and he can't be compared to said person. I'm glad that he's moved on from his rap career as Marky Mark, but films like this aren't helping his future. His acting was corrugated cardboard. I felt like I was watching early William Shatner. The supporting cast was equally unconvincing. Dang it, show some emotion, the world is ending! The only good acting was found in John Leguizamo, and *SPOILER* he croaked 20 minutes into the movie!<br/><br/>The script was bogus. The dialog was unconvincing. People don't talk like that. The first few lines in the movie made me groan for being cheese whiz, but I dismissed it, only to be bombarded by more and more. It was just simply unbelievable.<br/><br/>The plot was flimsy. After the first scene in the movie, I was able to guess how the rest of the movie was going to unfold. Unfortunately, I was correct and had to spend the next two hours watching it unravel. *SPOILER*<br/><br/>As soon as they zoomed in on the trees in Central Park, I thought to myself, ""Hmm, I bet this has something to do with the trees. Don't tell me Shyamalan's jumping on the bandwagon and preaching to us about how we need to be more eco-friendly..."" What do you know! It turns out to be killer trees! Welp, I know this isn't politically correct, but why not just torch them to the ground? OR, why not just go to a place where there AREN'T trees, like the desert!? Drive to Arizona or New Mexico! The whole sub-plot with the protagonist's marriage problems is fluff. It's added to add depth to their characters, but it doesn't pull it off. There's no chemistry between Wahlberg and Deschanel. <br/><br/>Walking out of the movie theater, my sick and twisted mind thought, ""Well, if the movie succeeded in one thing, it made me relate to the characters. Except with them, it was the TREES that made them want to kill themselves...I'm just left with an awful movie.""<br/><br/>Shyamalan, there's still a little shred of hope that your next movie will be your redemption! You can do it! Just don't look for me in the movie theater--I'm still out of pocket from the money I wasted on this flop."
"Minstrelman","5","2","6","16 June 2008"," An M. Night Shyamalan Apologist No More
","I have been an M. Night Shyamalan apologist for a while now. Everyone loved ""The Sixth Sense."" Most people loved ""Unbreakable."" Then it starts to slip. I loved ""Signs"" and really loved ""The Village"" (that one's theme of ""the good old days"" hit close to home for me), but some didn't. I didn't like ""Lady and in the Water,"" but my wife did. I figured it just wasn't my cup of tea (the whole fairy tale thing), and I thought Night had too big a part (he's not a terribly good actor). But it had a good concept and some quality actors and some very good performances so there was some forgiveness from me. With this movie, I am no longer coming to his defense. OK. I know he doesn't need me to, but I'm looking for much better from him next time out.<br/><br/>I was a little generous and gave this title a 5 out of 10 because the first half of the movie was actually pretty good! The first 30-45 minutes were tense and kept me on edge as any good suspense movie should. It built in some questions as to what was causing the ""happening,"" and caused me to jump in my seat a few times. There were some okay performances from Wahlberg and Deschanel and a couple of great performances from Leguizamo and Buckley (she reminded me of Kathy Bates in Misery a little with her out-of-touch intensity). I was also very impressed by the performance from Jeremy Strong as Private Auster, and Spencer Breslin caused a disagreement between myself and my wife--it was hard to recognize him since he grew up some and did not overact as usual! But the second half of the movie just fizzled. There were very few tense moments since we knew what was coming every time the wind blew and someone stared into space and took 2 steps backwards. And the explanation for the cause came too early in the film so the questioning pretty much ended. There was no real climax in the story. Two people standing in a wind-blown field is not very exciting (and their romance was even more boring). It would have been acceptable for the pre-attack warning to be wind-blown grass for a low budget, independent film, but Night used ILM for his special effects. ILM!! And wind blowing through the trees was the best they could do? Then in the end it was just a long, ""green"" environmentalist guilt trip. Now, maybe my right-leaning political viewpoint taints my feelings a little, but who wants to sit in a movie theater and be guilt-ed by a suspenseful thriller--especially when there was very little suspense or thrill? (By the way, it takes a lot of electrical energy, fuel, and petroleum-based film to make a movie, but that's an entry for a different type of website.) And the worst thing? I sometimes use my watch to time the actual running time (without credits) of a film. It felt like hours and it was only 86 minutes! Unbelievable from Night--I'm usually riveted throughout any of his movies.<br/><br/>Night, you're my boy, but you really missed bad with this one!"
"seanmalloyproductions","1","2","6","16 June 2008"," Scary Movie 5: The Happening - Funniest Yet!
","M. Night Shymalan has made the funniest entry in the Scary Movie series by keeping the visual gags to a minimum and ramping up the situational and verbal comedy aspects that the past four have left out. Scary Movie 5: The Happening has everything a great parody movie needs a wonderful opening scene that sets us up for what will surely be the funniest 90 minutes of Summer '08. The reaction shots from the cast rival Jason Bateman and Micahel Cera's best work on ""Arrested Development."" The whole production looks stunning and Night's eye for composition are still some of his strongest points, but it's the way he handles his actors that really caught me. In a bit of inspired comedic casting Mark Wahlberg is our hero through this canon of classic Hitchcock motifs and like Charlie Sheen before him, Wahlberg turns in some of his best work since Boogie Nights. You can see and hear the joy in the actor's voice as he spits out comedy gold at every turn. The ""You should care more about science"" exchange may go down as one of the great moments in comedy history right next to 'Who's on first?' and the drop off scene in ""The Big Lebowski."" The death scenes are some of the best in the series even topping the stabbing of Carmen Electra's implants. The 'follow the gun scene' has some great moments from the extra blood spurting that is obviously a nod to ""Ichii the Killer"" and ""Kill Bill"" even the sound effect is different for each successive shot from the same gun, possibly an 'in' joke referencing the grindhouse horror of old. Making the villain 'wind' is Mr. Night Shymalan's finest bit of writing since Sam Jackson's reveal as the mastermind in 'Unbreakable.' I had thought Night had run out of ideas after his last two efforts but in the comedy/ satire genre Shymalan has found his true calling and one can only hope he chooses to continue on this path. I loved Scary Movie 5: The Happening and would recommend it to anyone looking to laugh and cry tears of joy as you watch a cinematic masterpiece that I will be proud to place on my DVD shelf. Thank you Mr. Night Shymalan you have returned with great success, let's hope you return for 6.<br/><br/>Scary Movie 5: The Happening receives: 94% out of 100"

","The previews, rated R hype and actor appearances on talk shows really made me want to see this film, I was actually excited.<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more disappointed. The acting was terrible by absolutely everyone involved in the film (big or small roles); Mark simply cannot play a good guy in this context. I love Zooey, but she was on something in this film - like she was doing interpretive improv in the theme of a space cadet. Maggie Gyllenhaal or Kate Beckinsale would have been a far better choice for Alma and any actor in the world would have been better than Leguizamo.<br/><br/>The premise and resulting story could have been so great for this, as unusual as it was. The scene when they are trying to outrun the wind actually had several of us in the theater laughing out loud. They abandoned the crazy, nursery, hippie guy too early, he should have been more involved in the plot. Also, at no time did anyone suggest heading for a ""concrete jungle"" which I believe would be paramount to this plot. The film was shot at in the farmlands to a miserable degree and should have included some alternate shots or even side-stories in the city areas. Mark pointing out the fact that the two major outbreaks started in parks hurt to watch, as if anyone at that point hadn't figured the entire movie out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the supposedly R-rated scenes are OK to watch and would be worth it to see when it comes out on video - don't waste your time seeing it in the theater."

It seemed almost like a rip off of 28 days later, only they are not even conclusive about what is killing the people. Then the end once again, shows the even happening somewhere else, leaving the movie producers free to make another crappy movie. The only enjoyment that came from this movie, was making fun of it. Thats about it. It seems like the movie producers were thinking they hadn't made a movie in awhile, so lets make one real quick and get it out there."

It's poorly directed, poorly written, and the acting is very wooden and unbelievably fake.<br/><br/>Potential Spoiler Alert Beyond This Point:<br/><br/>A brief look at the feeling of this movie is that it attempts to establish a serious and frightening mindset right from the start, but will randomly throw in light-hearted situational comedy involving Mark Wahlberg and Zooey, or some random characters they meet. The movie does not really take any direction, there is no goal met by any characters in this movie, and besides a lack of climax - the movie also ends abruptly. I will not go into details about this movie beyond this, other then to say that I hope you have a good imagination and love nature; It may be the only two reasons you could like this movie.

"ecmcsweeney","4","2","6","16 June 2008"," Disappointing
","First, I want to make my history with M. Night and his films very clear: The Sixth Sense: 9/10 (fantastic film, Shyamalan's best in my opinion) Unbreakable: 8.5/10 (great performances by Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson, another Shyamalan hit) Signs: 7.5/10 (intense film, thriller throughout, strong suspense towards the end, but lacked some creative elements) The Village: 7/10 (mediocre at best, not very thrilling, suspense is slow moving and doesn't culminate well) Lady In The Water: 5/10 (just a poor film, I enjoy Shyamalan and his work so I gave him a lot of slack on this movie, but it was a pure disappointment and wasn't even entertaining to watch)<br/><br/>Now, let's move on to the reason I am here: The Happening (4/10). Clearly, Shyamalan's biggest disappointment thus far in his career. It was simply a bad movie. Some of the most entertaining (mostly because they were laughable) parts were people committing suicide in the most gruesome yet comedic ways. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but some parts in the movie were so pathetically done and so unrealistic that it shed a shameful light on the entire film. I made the mistake of coming into this movie with high expectations, because the movie had a good premise, and I thought it was M. Night's time to shine again, after his stumbles with Lady in the Water and The Village. Also, I expected a performance out of Mark Wahlberg that I didn't exactly get. Some of the dialogue that his character was forced to say took him out of his element and made him look childish while acting. Mark is a great actor so it was a let down to see him be involved with such an awful film. His performance was the best that he could have done, given the feeble script and odd nature of his character. All in all, the film was casted well but not performed well, and the premise for the movie had some potential but wasn't executed. A huge disappointment from Shyamalan. Hopefully my ratings of his movies won't climb slowly downhill as they are appearing to now. <br/><br/>I will warn you once, don't see this film, and if you do treat it as a comedy."

","I was hoping for a good movie. I was hoping for a good movie from M. Night Shyamalan, who I know is capable of a great movie, but in whom I have been disappointed with lately. I loved ""The Sixth Sense"", and thought ""Signs"" was pretty good. As of right now, I am not sure if ""The Happening"" or ""Lady In The Water"" is my least favorite. And unlike his other movies, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't have a role in ""The Happening"", which makes me wonder if even he was disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>The idea was good and original, and I honestly feel like it could have been a great movie. There are many things that this film presents to the viewer to make them think, and in the end form their own opinion. Ideas that are indeed scary, and not that far fetched. Things that are hard to imagine, but not really that unrealistic..... which makes the ""Ideas"" in the movie truly scary!!! However, in my opinion, the movie didn't capitalize on its own ideas. And the movie didn't even come close to capturing the tension and terror that would go along with its own idea/ story.<br/><br/>(Start Spoilers) Basically after years of abusing our planet with pollution, etc, ... nature takes the offense. Basically the movie talks about how plants can produce toxins to defend against threats. Plants finally determine that humans are the environments biggest threat and starts to produce a toxin that targets the humans. The story goes on to explain that humans have a genetic chemical/ programing that makes us want to live and survive. However the toxins that the plants are producing, alter that ""programming"", so instead of wanting to live..... we are programed to want to die. So once exposed to the toxins, we become confused and end with us committing suicide. (End Spoilers)<br/><br/>Like I said, really creative (but not unrealistic) idea. Something that would be devastating and truly scary!!!<br/><br/>But unfortunately, other than the basic idea, this movie has nothing. It is not scary. It seemed undeveloped. The movie seemed very stretched out, for the content that was made for it. (In current form, would have made a better 1hour episode for Twilight Zone or something like that.) The acting was horrible. I get that they were trying to be ""real people"" in a ""real situation"" and not actors in a movie. But even cutting some slack for that reason, I didn't buy them in their roles.<br/><br/>Sorry, I wanted to love this. But in all honesty, this movie was painful for me to sit through."

"petit76","Null","2","6","15 June 2008"," absolutely horrendous
","Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan: I adored ""The Sixth Sense"" and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. ""Unbreakable"" was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of ""Signs"" to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful build-up in recent film history. I even liked ""The Village"" and could easily dismiss ""Lady in the Water"" as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating ""The Happening"", especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures- the paranoid 70's sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing out of the way- ""The Happening"" is unbelievably, impossibly, ridiculously, hilariously, inconceivably bad. Normally I would refuse to rate any film that had any good scenes or that was well-directed less than four out of ten, but ""The Happening"" has to have one of the worst scripts among recent big-budget Hollywood films. It's absolutely shocking how retarded the logic behind this is and how poor so much of the dialogue is. This script began as ""The Green Effect"", a tremendously poor (trust me, I read parts of it) script by Shyamalan that was soundly rejected and eventually reworked into ""The Happening"". Having seen the critical reaction to ""The Happening"" prior to going into the film I found myself pleasantly surprised by basically the first thirty, forty minutes of the film. It was nothing special but it had something going for it, Shyamalan's direction was top-notch, and Wahlberg was playing the sort of goofy science teacher I'd loved (and loved to hate on occasion) in high school.<br/><br/>Then the descent began. The bulk of this film is some of the most hilariously awful crap produced by a talented filmmaker since Schaffner's ""Sphinx"". Shyamalan, who was using close-ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. There is one painfully, painfully long close-up of Mark Wahlberg pleading for time to think and then calling for his group to 'keep ahead of the wind' that is up there with Nicolas Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" in terms of hilariously awful acting. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film, with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second, culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. I don't blame Wahlberg for this, I blame Shyamalan. Wahlberg claims Shyamalan tried to force him into real paranoia so his performance would work better. What happens here (no pun intended) is that Wahlberg ends up looking amazingly uncomfortable for the last hour of this thing and struggles to deliver any reasonable line deliveries.<br/><br/>Okay, I do have to credit Zooey Deschanel for making this movie watchable. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well-drawn one at that- one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). There's also the score: oh my it's gorgeous. Seriously, ignore this film and just buy the score CD by James Newton Howard- it's brilliant.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" starts out well but ends up being an absolute embarrassment. I was prepared for a mediocre offering- perhaps a misguided effort such as ""Lady in the Water"". I was not expecting a disaster on the level of ""The Happening"". Its last forty minutes and especially its last ten minutes or so are among the worst I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered if it was possible for a film to go from enjoyable to absolutely horrendous in the space of ten or fifteen minutes? ""The Happening"" is proof that it can, pardon the (intentional) pun, happen. Evren Buyruk from USA"

","Excuse me? Was that movie a thriller, comedy, horror, action etc? I'd have to say comedy because this movie had me laughing all the way through. The acting was inexplicably horrible, the writing was sub par and the sentimental moments between the main characters were ridiculous and unnecessary. Mark Wahlberg's performance was so bad that I thought he was doing it on purpose and the woman playing alongside him was probably even worse. I remember near the end all you could hear were people snickering at out of place lines and poor delivery when the director was obviously going for something more serious. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is the story. It was a solid conflict and it kept your attention throughout. Yet the ending was pathetic and predictable and left the viewer waiting for more. This movie wasn't scary, thrilling, or action packed. It was mainly comedic but I'm pretty sure that's not what the director was going for."

","Elliot Moore is an innovative Philadelphia science teacher whose marriage is on the rocks. That's the least of his worries however when a mysterious endemic strikes the northeast region of the United States, causing erratic behavior, violence, and even death among the general population. Along with a group of survivors, it's a race against time to try and make it to safety before their fates are quickly sealed. M. Night Shyamalan's latest showing is interesting, startling, unusual, but also frustratingly uneven; from one point of view it's a supernatural tale of human survival, from another it's a domestic exploration of love and reconciliation, and from yet another it's a deliberately distant, ambiguous story thread designed to pull viewers along before they realize there's really no point. A miscast Wahlberg tries gallantly to pull it off with a straight face, while some of his co-stars seem to be reading off of cue cards. At times serious, at times unintentionally silly (?) it plays mostly as a mixed bag. ""Different"" would probably be the most accurate description. **"
"dcyoung354","7","2","6","14 June 2008"," Not great, but has some good moments
","From what I understand, M. Night Shyamalan is a huge Hitchcock fan. What struck me right away about ""The Happening"" is how much it reminds me of Hitchcock's ""The Birds."" The theme of people caught up in the mayhem when nature inexplicably runs amok is common to both films. Modern man wants to think we are always in control and are pretty darn smart. So when suddenly faced with a deadly situation that seems to originate with nature, strong feelings of despair and impotence surface. The realization that we simply can't win a fight with mother nature quickly sinks in and we are left feeling very small. Conveying this sense of despair is what ""The Happening"" attempts.<br/><br/>While ""The Happening"" is not a great film like ""The Birds,"" there are many similarities. I wonder how a film like ""The Birds"" would be reviewed today. Plodding? Lacking action? I agree with Roger Ebert's review. This film is not a blockbuster action flick, and anyone who can't sit still for five minutes without a car chase or explosion, will probably be bored. But if you appreciate a film that doesn't rely on special effects to move the plot along, this film is worth a look.<br/><br/>I do agree with some of the negative reviews pointing out the weakness of some of the dialog in the film. (I especially did not care for the man who owned the plant nursery, who first guessed that plants might be behind the problems. His character really made no sense and was almost cartoonish.) I also agree that the message behind the film could be a bit more subtle, although I was not that put off by it. But the reviewers who are taking issue with the plot may be missing the point. How many films of this genre have a plot that really stands up to scientific scrutiny? The fun of these films is in the suspense and if throwing logic out the window for 91 minutes helps the fun, then I'm all for it.<br/><br/>This is not a great film, but if you are a M. Night Shyamalan fan, I think it is a step back toward his earlier promise and is worth seeing. You might want to wait to see it on DVD. I don't think it will lose much on the small screen."

Its high time for humans to learn to preserve and respect the nature. The movie was OK but Mr Shyamalan could have sent across a really strong message if the open ended questions were answered and not left for user interpretations.

"UniqueName76","7","2","6","14 June 2008"," M. Night once again does his best to not dole out cookie cutter films...
","Love him or hate him, his movies have a unique signature upon them that definitely separate him from the dozens of movies release each month from Hollywood. As a matter of fact, Hollywood apparently has run out of ideas remakes upon remakes, and now worse with movies like The Departed, Strangers, The Ring, and Bangkok Dangerous they're down to ripping off European/Asian movie directors for their ideas.<br/><br/>This time M. Night strikes back with notable differences from all his other movies. First of, M. Night usually forgoes direct violence and gore and replaces it Hitchcock styled atmosphere/sound over gore. Looks like studios are tired of this and forced his hand. Interestingly enough, even with the added gore and violence, there was still a great deal of that ""atmosphere"" utilized to heighten everyone's awareness. A good deal of work was put in the sound fx to also put some flavor into several key moments.<br/><br/>Like all M. Night's movies, there are SERIOUS flaws in The Happening. Bad acting across 4-5 scenes you simply cannot deny, just really dry delivered lines. A surprising number of no name actors is probably the reason for this, which leads to the music of the film. I haven't seen music this bad in a film this decade. It sure seems as if studios are cutting M. Night at the knees financially. Lastly, this blame will fall solely on the director, the pacing was a tad uneven, abrupt in some places that failed to achieve the desired effect I would say.<br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, the plot and premise is quite interesting, even if it's a bit far-fetched. Once again I found myself smiling throughout the movie and enjoy this movie as if it were one of those old 50s B&W goofy horrors about a giant brain eating up half the planet. Shyamalan doesn't explain the plot in total detail, leaves you with several clues as to what triggered the main events and how the main characters dealt with those events. If you like weird sci-fi with dashes of brilliant horror footage, this is your movie. If you like M. Night movies not because they're full of action and violence, but because they're interesting and different.. you'll love The Happening. However if you have ADD, adrenaline junkie, or hyper-critical in your films.. you'll hate this film steer away."

And M. Knight Whatever, is mostly to blame for it. He just can't showcase his script and actors. The directing is appalling. I stopped counting the number of times I giggled or laughed hysterically at all the unintentionally funny moments in the movie. Betty Buckley's guest starring being the part where I completely lost it. The rest is just as embarrassing, but that was it for me. There is some good gore (?), but I would've rather have had a more compelling directing/acting, with actors that don't quote stupid lines, with eyes like a dead fish (Zooey, this is for you). Mark Wahlberg was the weakest lead ever. And the rest of the cast was either underused or badly used.
With a mystery that is literally going nowhere. The movie ends just as awkwardly as it went on for an hour or so. And the end credits start rolling."

","I love M. Night Shyamalan. He's a brilliant writer/director and I've been so impressed with his unique ideas or twists on previously attempted genres. This movie, however, I didn't really enjoy. Though, it is not for the same reasons as most other reviewers have stated.<br/><br/>The movie delivered no one-liners, no stand up acting from any particular actor/actress, and no real climax. Those are the good things. It felt real. The characters reacted in a very human way, no heroes, the lines didn't feel scripted. It felt as though the person sitting next to me would react the same way. Amazingly realistic. Almost too realistic. But, MNS has always been one to push the boundaries.<br/><br/>What I did not like was MNS's finding his way into the box of the environmentalist. Because of the huge ""green"" push and global warming phenomenon, we've seen a large rush of that in Hollywood. I thought MNS was better than that. Though the thoughts are underlying and he does a fantastic job of presenting the issue in a different light, we still see the ""humans as pests"" ideas and the overpopulation theories at work. I don't like the boxed up Shyamalan. Nothing against environmentalist but we've heard and seen enough of it. Keep it out of my thrillers.<br/><br/>The best part of the whole movie and probably the biggest reason to see it is the score. Brilliant. Simply stunning. The music made the movie. Had the score not been as wonderful, the movie would not be worth seeing.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10 in my book."

And what was that house where everything was plastic? seemed like a plot device solely to have Wahlberg talk to a plastic tree.

","There was a time where a great filmmaker by the name of M.Night Shyamalan was creating films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs."" I wonder why this once gifted brilliant artist turned to making awful apocalyptic films that made good actors give horrible performances. ""The Happening"" can be thought of as more than just the title of a bad movie, but what is happening to the talent of Mr. Shyamalan. ""The happening"" is also about a disease or natural defect in which people space out and kill themselves. It's occurring in Central Park, where high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zoey Deschanel) must fight to survive and escape from the terror. The whole idea of a disorder in which you go crazy and kill yourself is something hat SNL would do a spoof on as one of their prime skits. To make a serious drama about it, and have leading actors try and deliver strong performances turns it into something pretty silly. Mark Wahlberg gives his worst job of acting, and is even a better wrapper than an actor here. He talks so stupidly, and it is hard to take him seriously in such a crazy subject matter. Deschanel out acts him. She's god awful as well. The directing by Shyamalan is over dramatic and tries to be suspenseful when really there's nothing to shock you. His writing is worse. The characters he writes are used as a way to make the story feel as if it is effective, but really we have seen similar stories in films way less audacious and pointless. I miss the old days when M.Night Shyamalan was behind the camera and writing mind adventures instead of laughable disaster movies with no suspense and terrible directing."
"Floated2","3","1","2","16 July 2013"," Good concept but disappoints
","The Happening seemed to have potential from its concept and the idea but the overall execution and writing of the film collapses. A main reason why the film is harshly criticized is because of the acting from the leads Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. They seemed miscast and it was hard to take Wahlberg serious as a Science teacher and the chemistry between them two seemed almost fake (at least in the first 45 mins).<br/><br/>The film starts off promising, drags around in the middle then picks up and becomes a more thriller suspense in the last 30 minutes. From around the part when they meet the older lady Ms Jones, I feel as if the films picks up and start becoming a little more interested. Still crazy in concept but it was more enjoyable from this point on. From there, we see her helping them in her house, feeding them and of course acting suspicious towards them. Once her characters exits out, we then see Wahlberg and Deschanel try and survive in her house then they eventually end of leaving. We last see them curled up in the outhouse, then it cuts a blank screen and a tagline shows ""three months later"", and everything seems fine and normal. Fee like this ending was a copout and Shyamalan could have thought of a better ending. As a rewatch 05/04/20' The Happening remains an overall disappointment in concept film. It has some moments of entertainment as already highlighted but a majority of the film is quite boring and plain. There isn't much of a climax."

","Shyamalan is well-hated for this one because he doesn't seem to care about his audience's state of mind. He started, he showed, he gave them some new dramatic scenes, he hinted at what might have been, and before it was adequately explained, he left suddenly. He had no intention to prepare them and he would not come to an aid when they were lost. I don't believe this is vanity. He merely wants to leave the audience totally unprepared in order to feel the powerlessness. To understand this film, one must choose the right frame of mind. I am touched by the storytelling being deliciously atmospheric and surrounding. Nature can act up and takes back whatever we think are ours at anytime. It doesn't need to reason. All is left for us to do is to learn fast how not to sink so rapidly. I don't even care about the possibility of the plot. Shyamalan asks us to close our eyes and to feel the feeling. He accomplished, and that is good enough for me. It doesn't make him god-like and superior than the audience, which is, I believe, where much of these hateful sentiments must have come from.<br/><br/>Cinematography of this film is top-notched. The frequent use of wind is effective. Almost all spoken lines are written to be an undertone of the atmosphere. The ending of this sort of film is always problematic. You start with nature, and it is hard to end it in a man-made way or an alienated conclusion like the likes of ""Knowing"", of which some extra terrestrials are responsible for everything. I think Shyamalan delivers what he has intended. Only a large number of people out there are not particularly fond of the delivery itself. This is the price he pays for trying to be different from his past works. I believe this film will redeem itself and finds its place. No need to like it now. Some minds must first grow.<br/><br/>The near-ending scene at the bus stop adds to the completion. It is so ordinary and calm, and it is priceless when compared to deaths and the state of uncertainty before that. I think the film reminds us to love what it is now, and to appreciate every moment. A critic wrote that ""The Happening"" is actually not happening. Precisely. This is not a film to be intellectually fulfilled, but to feel."

"shroudoftheimmortal","4","1","2","21 June 2009"," The Happening...not so happening
","To say that I like M. Knight Shyamalan movies is an understatement if ever there was one. I have loved every one of this man's films from The Sixth Sense on--he made two movies prior, but I haven't seen either yet. Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies of all time and Signs is one of my most often viewed; I've lost count of how many times I've seen it.<br/><br/>So it would be safe to assume that I was going to give The Happening a look-see. I've been waiting for it for a few months now. My hopes had risen quite high as they tend to do and I didn't try to rein them in because Shyamalan hasn't let me down yet. There is a first time for everything.<br/><br/>This movie has an interesting premise. Something is causing people to do themselves bodily harm in localized areas of the Northeast. The ways in which these people harmed them selves were bizarre, gruesome, disturbing, and tended to result in their deaths. The opening scene was an attention grabber but from the moment the two girls on the park bench started talking I started thinking, ""I wish they had gotten better actors."" I didn't stop thinking that for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>After you get past the over-the-top shocks and the intriguing set up, there really isn't much to the movie. It is all plot, no story, no character--though there are several feeble attempts at developing a couple of them--no emotion. Nothing but watching people die in creative ways, and some of the suicide just seem out of place or to run too long. This movie couldn't even make mass suicide disturbing, only curious.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has, prior to this movie, been more of the Hitchcock school of film making. That is what you don't see is scarier than what you do...for the most part. But in this movie he chooses to show almost everything. It was an interesting change in the beginning, but became an odd choice later for me. Why bludgeon us over the head with a series of suicides when the scene with periodic gun fire in the distance gets the point across so much better. The most suspenseful scene in the movie is when a woman affected by ""The Happening"" circles her house out of view of the camera stalking Mark Walberg's character, who waits in fear inside. The camera simply pans a wall tracking her progress behind it, but it was a great moment. It makes the death scenes just seem to be indulgences, schlock, cheap thrills.<br/><br/>Another problem I have with this movie is the ""Happening"" itself. I actually like the idea of it, people inexplicably begin killing themselves en masse. The key word being ""inexplicably."" When you are told in the movie halfway through why what is happening is happening, and are told by a crazy man with an affinity for hotdogs, and the explanation is a lame as it is, then it kind of loses something. Mystery is good. But again Shyamalan decided to hide nothing. Let's talk about the acting some more. It was...off, let's say. I like Mark Walberg. I really like John Leguizamo. I don't have a problem with Zooey Deschanel. But no one ever clicked. Half the time it didn't even seem like the characters were responding to each other. It was just odd to watch. This movie was just odd.<br/><br/>Now, I do have a theory on why this movie turned out the way it did, and I may be grasping at straws to salvage it in someway for myself because I did wanted it to be good. It came across as very cheesy almost jokey, but there weren't very many jokes in it. The few that there very good, like anything the two boys that showed up later in the movie did or said. There were also odd plot contrivances abound. There was the cooky old man that figured out why what was happening was happening. There was the cooky old lady cloistered away from society that offered help, but at a price--she had the greatest line of the film by the way: ""I see you eying my lemon drink."" There was the fragile couple growing strong through the tragedy.<br/><br/>Then you have the general light tone of the film and the beware-or-this-could-happen-to-you message and the happy, but not so happy, ending. All this lead me to my first theory. And that is that Shyamalan was paying homage to the '50s sci-fi B-movie, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Blob, Them and others come to mind. I don't know what Shyamalan was thinking when he made this, but The Happening had that hokey feel to it and the plot followed the lines drawn by movies that came before it. I don't know.<br/><br/>My second theory is that this was just a bad movie.<br/><br/>I did not like this movie. I do not recommend that anyone see it, unless they are just going to go see some innovative death scenes. I won't say that there are no redeeming aspect to the film. It still looks like a Shyamalan movie. The cinematography is beautiful and the shot selection is nice. There are a few very suspenseful scenes and the show moves along at a good clip. I just wish that the show was worth watching. It is not."

","I am a movie fan, and one fan of Night. I was totally biased towards his themes and ability of in direction, etc, after watching The Sixth Sense, Signs and to an extent with Unbreakable. I was excited when I got this DVD expecting same standards.<br/><br/>This is a total disaster for Night.<br/><br/>I read all the reviews, but just hoped that there will be something I would be able to like. None. Looks like the entire crew here were totally misguided. Even the actors couldn't save this movie. Script is bad, direction is worse. Things happen exactly when I was expecting them to happen, in exactly the same way. After the first few minutes, there is no suspense, forget story line.<br/><br/>Why should such a movie be released in first place. Money and lot of time including Night's could have been saved.

They can't move on their own but they have some sort of crazy ability to make us kill ourselves. Mark Wahlberg can't act but he does pull off a couple funny moments. This movie had zero action, and no threat of a bad guy or anything. Wherever you go, the wind can get you and you'll die. But in the end, Marky and his girl both go out into it, and magically nothing happens. Whoa, didn't see that one coming. Stupid movie, don't know why it was MNSs first R rated film. Don't bother with it."
"jtindahouse","6","1","2","23 February 2009"," So very close to a return to form for Shyamalan
","I had such a good vibe going during this film. I couldn't work out why all the hate toward it. M. Night Shyamalan appeared to be back to his best so I began trying to work out which brilliant ending he was going to lay on us this time. There seemed to be little hints here and there that I figured would leave me saying after wards, ""ofcourse, why didn't I see that coming?"" Instead I was left feeling absolutely robbed at the brain power I had spent on this movie.<br/><br/>Shyamalan was back near his best in terms of building quiet suspense, even though we aren't entirely sure of what the disturbing occurrence we are in for is, which makes it all the better. The premise he's developed makes it easy for him to throw horrific images at us, but he does it with his own sense of style and creativity none the less. He's certainly nowhere near top form but it's definitely a step up from the awful Lady in the Water.<br/><br/>One of the reasons this movie fails in a lot of peoples eyes is that it lends itself to being over-analyzed. We know what Shyamalan is capable of in comparison to what he's providing us with lately and so we naturally see little faults in all aspects of the film much more clearly. A lot of the dialog is awkward and unnatural and some of the character decisions are questionable at best. The ending however must go down as the big one when we consider this is the man's specialty. The Sixth Sense, The Village and my personal favorite Unbreakable all had endings that left us both shook up and satisfied for days, even weeks. The Happening doesn't even come close to having either effect on us.<br/><br/>Not one to be proud of on Shyamalan's part and he's been let know this by his many razzie nominations. But it's not all bad and it's certainly not unwatchable. The man does have other traits beside delivering us with an incredible ending, despite what a few may think."

","I hated Signs. I thought the Village was completely predictable, however having not bought into any the hype or seeing much of the trailer when it was first released, I gave this a go. It cost me £15 for three ex-rental titles at Blockbuster, and this was one of them.<br/><br/>Forgetting for a minute the performance of Zooey Deschanel, which was wooden to the point of making her character appear mentally unhinged and the subplot of the relationship issues which was so flippantly tackled was completely irrelevant. This aside, I enjoyed the movie and an interesting take on a semi-eco message, for £6 a great value piece of entertainment! <br/><br/>Goblin - www.openbytes.wordpress.com"
"carlisima24","4","1","2","22 January 2009"," Uh...not really impressed...
","I have been a fan of Night for a really long time, and I have to say I think he could have done better. First, he needed to stick to PG-13 rated movies, I think he got a little carried away with the R. Some of those suicide scenes made me queasy...also, at the end of all his movies he leaves your mind working after it is over. At the end of The Village, you have to decide for yourself if Luscious is saved. In Lady in the Water, you have to decide if Story really did impact all the people she met. However in this movie-what do we have to think about? Is the story going to repeat itself in France? Duh! I unfortunately wasn't blown away like I have been by all his other movies."
"KombiNiere","7","1","2","10 October 2008"," Good Story boring characters
","I think this movie has its place among those which have to be seen but surely can be forgotten very fast.<br/><br/>The story is very similar to ""Der Schwarm"" a novel written by the German author Frank Schaetzing; veryvery recommended to read; in 2002 or something around. <br/><br/>Creatures of the sea become dangerous and produce toxics which seem to be able to kill all mankind. But then the planctonic algae decide within their metamorphic mind to let the humans live. It was just a warning to mankind not to destroy the nature especially the marine environment.<br/><br/>I think shyalaman stole the storyline, or maybe he bought it, and then transferred it upon the earth and into terrestral liveforms. Marc Whalberg and this woman with the big blue eyes, really acted as bad as Tom Hanks and the french actress in sacrileg. <br/><br/>So just seven points for this movie."

Thinking that they will be safe in the country but it turns much more worst, because of the unexplained phenomenon has something to do with mother nature.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by M. Night Shaylaman (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, The Village) made an intriguing horror film, which the director nearly pulls off making a hard R-Rated flick. There's some memorable violent sequences but maybe not enough of it. Walhberg is good in the role and the supporting cast are fine. The movie starts out great and it's impressive for awhile. Effective first half soon loses its edge and never quite recover but at least, it's an improvement over the director's previous feature ¨Lady in the Water¨.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Deleted Scenes with introduction by the director, featurettes and an gag reel. ¨The Happening¨ isn't quite the feature, i was expecting but it's somewhat close. It's the kind of movie that starts with a bang but ends in a whimper. Although despite all the flaws, it's still worth a look. Alan Ruck and Brian O'Halloran appears in cameos.

","The Happening is a good movie! And not as bad as many people says. Not perfect, not super but still good. Better than the water girl. Much better. Shymalan's big problem is here, that he can't give us new story anymore. The plot is the same since Signs. This is the biggest problem with this movie. The actors are good for me. Maybe the acting is a little bit strange, not usually... but still works. Especially Mark Wahlberg was fine. I think the script was mot enough. The story was good, but the script I think is too small. There are some really scary scenes, and the cinematography works perfect. The score is good. James Newton Howard feels again what Shyamalan wants to say. So, with a better script and a longer movie and more time to finished completely the Happening could be a perfect work. But now it is a money pit. A little bit shame for Shymalan. I think he must think about these before his next idea! But I still believe him!"

I for myself, just enjoy the imagery and leave veracity to engineers.<br/><br/>The Happening was 3 out of 10, and that for the suicide scenes. But still, PLEASE, PEOPLE, why is the idea STUPID ?

Signs had the thrills and the scares but was missing something. In 2004 we were sent to the Village where there were also scares and a great story. All were good movies until the Lady in the Water. I was overcome with Confusion and a headache. Now in the Happening there were no scares and no thrills. M Night Shymalan really seems to be loosing it.<br/><br/>The Happening is not worth seeing.

","For those of you that love the ""fear"" aspect in films as opposed to the ""horror"" aspect, this is a film for you. Widely advertised as the first R-rated film from director M.Night Shyamalan, ""The Happening"" is more for those of you that prefer your movie not spoon-fed to you and like to think. M.Night does not waste any time on getting the movie going, as the violence starts within the first two minutes of the film. From there, it is a roller-coaster ride that takes us throughout the eastern part of the United States of America. This area is infected with this unseen affliction and it is graphic as people are killing themselves in pretty creative ways....I will stop there to not give anything away. For those of you looking for a slasher-type blood and guts horror-fest, you will hate it. For those thinkers that love a motive behind the violence and want to see actual ""fear"", it will give you fear. The difference between ""fear"" and ""horror"" is evident here. This is not a ""horror movie"". It is a movie that will scare the pants off of you.....The scariest movie that I have seen in the last 20 years is ""The Sixth Sense""---this is a movie that I would not want to watch alone. Would you call ""The Sixth Sense"" horror??? i wouldn't... ""The Happening"" just joined that club. The message in the film will come to you after you see it and think about it. Fear and Scares, with a lack of the word ""horror"" do work once again in Shyamalan's blender....he simply has fear with no horror---which works!!!! This one is scary because it is REAL!!!! enjoy..."

","This is a movie about nothing. There's no monsters, villains, fiends, suspense, atmosphere, acting or script. How a movie like this could cost $80 million, released by a major studio and given the green light by a supposedly tough team of producers and executives is a true mystery.<br/><br/>The first five minutes are compelling. Something is forcing thousands of NYC residents to kill themselves. Switch now to Mark Wahlberg who portrays a befuddled science teacher and he tells his class about the mystery of why bees are vanishing. Could this have something to do with the unknown power that's causing mass suicide.<br/><br/>Then we see Mark, his wife and friends fleeing the city on a train that suddenly stops because the engineer has killed himself. Then we see endless shots of plants and trees blowing in the wind. Is it the wind or the plants that's causing people to kill themselves? at one point, as a few survivors race away from the oncoming wind, Mark faces the camera and shouts: ""Wait a minute! I'm trying to figure out what's happening?"" The few people in my theater all cracked up. He voiced our confusion perfectly.<br/><br/>And then, we next see Mark and company happily back in NYC. Traffic flows, people shop and stroll along the sidewalks. But wait! What happened to all those dead corpses? Is the invisible killer gone? What was it?<br/><br/>This movie is a landmark in inept film-making and should have been shown on the Sci-Fi Channel--home to the cheesiest made-for-TV flicks to be found in the world."

","This is the first time I'm ever giving a 1 out of 10. I think :p I see other people's comments regarding this movie and it is pretty much spot on. There are a few people defending this movie but they fail to defend it well. They speak of ""The message"" behind this movie. What message? Are you kidding me? Save the world? Give me a break. Global Warming is a joke. The earth is cooling and the ice caps are getting larger and thicker. Look it up. Don't be subjected to the Hitler Clause: If it's said enough times then people will believe it.<br/><br/>It is a no-brainer that fun, stupid and silly movies sell. They bring about laughter and that is the BEST emotion. Films like Zohan make it big because people LOVE to laugh. I recently watched Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay and I absolutely adored it. It was stupid, silly but GREAT fun. The Happening however, is absurd. It's stupid and silly in a completely different way: It insulted me. It insulted my intelligence.<br/><br/>You see The Sixth Sense, which is by far one of my favorite movies of all time, was made by a man who created not only a work of art, but a puzzle piece of which the viewer needed to pay full attention to or he or she would be lost and would not get the point of the movie. After coming out of that movie, I heard so many people saying ""I don't get it"". I didn't get THAT. NOW I do. Let's face it, most people do not have the kind of intelligence quotient required for the kind of movies that Shyamalan is capable of. IT SEEMS that either he's lost his edge or he's changed his ways and DUMBED his movies down in an attempt to appeal to ""the masses"". If that is the case, it sure did not work.<br/><br/>The story line is awful. The idea of what ""happens"" in this movie is ridiculous and even if he was attempting a ""message"" within this movie, it fails miserably. EVERYBODY knows....what we do to OUR environments. We are all WELL aware however, we are not children and we shouldn't have to be subjected to be subjected to being assumed that we all are . If I sum this movie up it would be this: ""The trees and grass will kill us because we're killing them"".<br/><br/>That sounds like something a child would say. Is it an impossible situation? No. It IS plausible however improbable. Plant life does not adapt en-mass to kill. It adapts to survive. They become resilient to anything that is thrown at them. The Chernobyl incident is a prime example. 20 Years after that accident, life is sprawling there. Trees and other plant life have taken over and have begun to break down all that man has built there. Even more surprisingly, animal life has INCREASED since that accident. The Plant kingdom does not NEED To (lol) kill all humans and even that is severely flawed. Any biologist would tell you that the premise of this movie is beyond silly.<br/><br/>I grant that this is a fictional tale however, fiction should at least be entertaining. I was completely bored with this movie and it was quite predictable.<br/><br/>Please go back to making intelligent movies, mister Shymalan and if not, at least start making FUNNY dumb movies. I'm sure you could do very, very well making a movie along the likes of ""Scary Movie"". Who knows, you might be the master at it."

I can come up with a few reasons, but I cannot be quite sure and thats what troubles me about this film. I solidify this film as a two, because MNS did attempt to keep this film true to its genres as all his other ones. Some scenes were graphic and actually disturbing that I notice the audience did look away at times. I think he had the right idea, but was deficient in his execution.

The cinematic craftsmanship speaks for itself: it's superb, on all fronts. Like LADY IN THE WATER, THE HAPPENING was (for me) a fully realized fantasy- like a dream, functioning, at times, on an almost subliminal level. It would be interesting, indeed, to see what Shyamalan could do with one of the hundreds of novels or short stories written by the likes of Richard Matheson (I AM LEGEND) or Charles L. Grant (HOUR OF THE OXRUN DEAD) or Charles Beaumont (THE HOWLING MAN) or Harlan Ellison (FLOP SWEAT) or Shirley Jackson (THE SUNDIAL) or H.P. Lovecraft (THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE) or Robert E.

","When I saw the film in the theater. The first thing I wanted to know after watching it was: what would people write about this? Is this some kind of joke? I didn't watch any interviews of M. Night Shyamalan or read any reviews before. I only heard the plot of the movie from someone: It's about the plants and trees which produce a poisonous chemical so that the people kill themselves. In a nutshell.<br/><br/>First off, the acting. I couldn't even believe it. The worse acting I've ever seen. It was indeed as if it was intentionally but it was annoying. It was like a theater performance where you have to overreact. God...so horrible. It was probably the most horrifying part of the movie.<br/><br/>The story itself seemed pretty cool to me, but everything was just too much. The long close up shots. The horrible clichés in the movie..and so on.<br/><br/>And even if HE DID wanted to make a bad movie...it didn't work. People wanted a nice scary movie to watch and it would have been if it wasn't for the 'inside joke'. I loved the parts where the people all fell from the construction site building (although ...they looked like dolls - on purpose?) I don't want to HAVE TO see interviews before I watch a movie. I don't want to read about inside stuff before I watch it so that it will explain it. Same with art. I want to have my own interpretation on it/ So yeah, it was horrifying, but in a bad bad bad way (I only liked Sixth sense, unbreakable and a little signs)"

"EijnarAmadeus","1","2","7","1 July 2008"," Not a convincing turn from Wahlberg or Shyamalan
","THE HAPPENING is the latest mystery-thriller from pop-director M. Night Shyamalan, this time Mark Wahlberg takes the lead and mixes up a cocktail of nonsense. The traces of nerve and anxiousness feels way gone as Shyamalan builds this drama around the terror of the unknown, and were THE VILLAGE and even SIGNS made small but effective bursts of thrills, THE HAPPENING wants to full-on shock in the opening scene and instead of slowly revealing the mystery throughout, it takes us away from the original drama and steers away from excitement. It may have seemed as a good idea at the time, taking Wahlberg and co. into the county and small-town scenario, but the movie looses all of its drama and ends up feeling like a true lackluster. And the whole deal doesn't feel believable, at all - and then I'm not talking about the shocking terror upon us, but the brother relationship between Wahlberg and Leguizamo doesn't fit, and Zooey Deschanel's part is a sad turn. THE HAPPENING is M. Night Shyamalan's most accessible movie yet, but his most disappointing as both a writer and director."
"escalade94","8","2","7","30 June 2008"," Not to bad!
","I think a lot of people are giving this movie a bad reputation because they expect so much from M. Night. The Sixth Sense is a movie that comes around once. You can't expect M. Night to make tons of movies as good as The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>First, he's not trying to scare you, he's trying to give you a good story. The Happening is not only original, but it is also a well thought out story. There's never been a movie about a toxin causing people to kill themselves. At first the plants may seem to be a stupid ""villian"" in the story, but facts are given to make it seem more reasonable.<br/><br/>The acting was a hot topic in this particular movie. Mark Wahlberg had questionable acting, but Ms. Deschanel is definitely a good actress. I think the acting in this movie is more natural. It's more real life and not ""drama, drama, drama"" as you see in other movies. You would think of it as real acting!"

","I just finished watching this movie and I have very mixed feelings about it, which is not unusual when one comes in direct contact with M. Night Shyamalan's vivid and ever so subtly terrifying imagination. For it is exactly the unusually subtle nature of the fear he invokes that makes his works so remarkable.<br/><br/>If you are looking for blood, gore and spilled guts, do not watch ""The Happening"". This movie's strength is in exploring the kind of horror most of us can relate to: treating our direct environment (let that be people or any other living organisms) with neglect and then facing the unpleasant consequences. We get a sense of havoc, but the story revolves on the fragile state of the human psyche in terms of dealing with a sudden shock.<br/><br/>I suppose I liked ""The Happening"" more than I disliked it. It is so refreshing to see something unexpected in a genre that lately has presented such monotone plots. It also allowed me to reflect on the possibility of an impending doomsday with a little more objectivity.<br/><br/>As for what I personally did not enjoy so much was that the movie seems to progress at a slow, comfortable pace - up until about the last ten minutes, during which events sped up so rapidly that I was scared to blink in case I might miss something. I am not so content with the ending, which keeps me from highly praising this movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those love-it-or-hate-it flicks. I happen to love it more than I hate it."

'happend' (no pun intended). it seemed too simple.. so simple, that it looked like the entire film was pulled off with less than a million dollar budget! and with most of the budget going to the two big name stars of the flick; Mark Walberg and John Leguizamo and M Night's first R rated film????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? that was PG-13 all the way! unless if the version i saw was edited, (which i saw via internet sources from japan) but this movie was just... OK. i give props for an interesting idea to mass human suicide, but the movie loses points for such a WEAK story.<br/><br/>with all due respect, M Night Shamalan needs to stop writing movies. not directing, but writing. hes an incredible director, and comes up with amazing ideas to films, but he should make like steven Spielberg and hire somebody to wirte his scripts for him.<br/><br/>The Happening (where nothing happened) 5.9 out of 10 stars"

Some have said ""why should we care about these people? I'm not invested in their plight"" (paraphrased). Why should you care? It could very well have been you, your family, your friends, who were affected by this ""Happening"".<br/><br/>The only flaw, and the reason I can't give this 9 or 10, is the ending. The scene with the couple at the end, followed by the TV report, could have been cut. In fact, it should have been. The report should have simply said that the event was over in the Northeast, and left it. The final scene should be included though. Why all this? ""The Birds"". That's why. The end of ""The Happening"" left you with a small sense of relief, but the end of ""The Birds"" leaves you wondering what the heck is going on. Hitchcock intentionally refrained from explaining why the birds were attacking the world (and never defined the scope, which I liked as well...it could have just been California or it could have been the whole Western Hemisphere...or more), which made the end more chilling and horrifying than could have been achieved with a ""proper"" ending. ""The Happening"" should have ended the same way.

I don't think most of those acts can even be conceived by the normal suicidal person. I wonder how the infants killed themselves.<br/><br/>It was around 4:30am when I woke up and couldn't go back to bed. So Mark Wahlberg, Alma, and the little girl didn't get infected because they shut themselves inside a room, blocking anything that the wind can pass through; that college kid calling mom's cellphone didn't lose human logic before she opened the window. For people inside buildings, I'm assuming that the way the ventilation for air conditioned facilities' work let the toxins in. Oh, think of the materials one can use in the corporate world!

Most people walk into a movie expecting the plot, scenario, imagery, effects, etc, to all be spoon-fed to us by the makers of the film.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is one of a dying breed to tell his audience's - think about what your are hearing and seeing.<br/><br/>Despite what seems to be a weak plot, and lack of panic and chaos due to a seemingly horrible world-wide event only adds to the irony of the film and the message that is being sent. The fact that the plot is simplistic / lack of panic and chaos points to the current human condition - we are so numb to everything around us that even if something shocking or horrific occurs, natural or man-made, we glue ourselves to our cameras or TV's for a short period of time, and then we are completely desensitized to it.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has succeeded greatly in showing us his view of how people have been conditioned in today's world, how we have ignored the fundamental harmonies we used to have between ourselves and our fragile world, and the possibilities of what might occur and how a desensitized human population might react to an unexpected and unfathomable event.<br/><br/>Think about what you are seeing and hearing - EXPERIENCE the movie instead of watching at face value.

"william-hooper","8","2","7","20 June 2008"," Missing the point.
","I think many reviewers are missing the point, or at least the significance of this film. ""The Happening"" is not about the earth taking revenge on humanity, just like ""Signs"" was not about an alien attack. Simply put, ""The Happening"" is about suicide, the suicide of Western civilization. Demographically western Europe, by way of birth rates, is disappearing. The U.S is just at maintenance levels. The elites have lost the basic instinct of self-preservation. Just note the reluctance of many to fight a war that threatens everything we hold dear. The elites (a strong concentration in the affected area) have strangely substituted the fight to end global warming for the fight against global Islamic terrorists. They don't want children, they want to enjoy the present without the encumbrance of children. These are all aspects of societal suicide. The killer is our own selfish hedonism and blindness to the real enemy coming back to blow us away.<br/><br/>Night is a subtle artist and the heavy handed premise of earth's revenge on the mean humans, obvious from the first third of the film is simply the story for his real point, societal self-destruction. Assuming the film's premise that plants are way smart, why would they want to kill us? Especially plants and trees that live in a park. Aren't they pampered, protected and cared for continually? The environmentalists are the ones trying to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, that's what the trees breath! Maybe that's why they want to kill only in the predominately liberal Northeast. There is irony here, please appreciate it. <br/><br/>""Signs"" was not about an alien invasion but about God being in control even when we can't understand everything He's doing. This is not about attack of the killer tomatoes but the strange suicide of the West."

","After lady in the water making you not care about his characters and the village with too much of a twist but still scaring you. M. Night Shyamalan has redeemed himself with a real look into the human psyche, instead of actors pretending.<br/><br/>The airborne pathogen inducing people to lose their sense of self preservation and consequently kill themselves, while it is invisible and not a huge beautiful special effect monster, it is still one of the scariest things that could be possibly put into a movie and seem realistic. After all, the whole ""scary murderer, ghost, vampire"" Thing has ceased to scare people.<br/><br/>I greatly admire this leap of faith that Shyamalan risked in order to create this film. That risk was simply a new approach to directing actors.<br/><br/>Actors nowadays are judged by their ability to display emotion, instead of the realism of their performances, this film however puts people in a very real threat situation and they react... well, like people, not actors. If you haven't seen the film yet, go into it thinking how would you react in certain situations, such as when Elliot, Alma and Jess meet the crazy old hermit and she accuses Elliot of attempting to steal her things He responds exactly like any person would.<br/><br/>Defensive, confused and abashed. While at the moment of the scene being played off it seems a little corny, in retrospect I was struck by the pure genius of such a reaction.<br/><br/>Though the movie lacked special effects, it was not lacking in fear and rather realistic gore which, at times (if you aren't too big on gore like I am) is a bit too much, someone turning on a lawn mower and having it run over them, or jumping into a lion exhibit at the zoo in order to kill oneself is not exactly something I needed to see, but it instilled fear, which i'm sure was the intension.<br/><br/>Overall, it was fabulous, if you aren't big on horror movies, this is the most clever and terrifying film without being corny and full of unreal occurrences. I loved being scared, and actually left the theater to blowing around tree's and strange mist (Mist doesn't happen in New Mexico) and i was actually afraid of the toxin for a split second."

Special effects are really strong, many scenes incredibly disturbing (the one in the zoo for instance), and the horror of the situation is captured and showed everywhere.Highly original, apart from the embarrassing family drama, shows a faceless and nameless threat driven by the wind, that is effective 100%.

"dyl_gon","6","2","7","19 June 2008"," What's happening? A decent alternative to the summer blockbuster, that's what happening.
","M. Night Shyamalan has had a rocky track record as of late. While The Sixth Sense was a huge hit both financially and critically, his films have slowly been declining in critical praise and box office performance ever since, which was apparent from Lady in the Water, which didn't manage to break even during it's run and was generally viewed as one of 2006's worst films. The Happening is his first new project since his last disaster and it's been billed as Shyamalan's first R-rated movie. Despite the heavier rating, The Happening is similar in style, theme and content to Shyamalan's other films, although it's a bounce back in the right direction after a few mishaps.<br/><br/>The Happening chronicles an epidemic that sweeps the North-East coast of America. At first thought to be the result of a terrorist attack, large groups of people begin to become disoriented, lose their speech and commit mass suicide at random. The events occur sporadically, first in Central Park, then throughout New York City and eventually spreading throughout the whole North-East coast. Elliot Moore, a New York high school teacher, desperately tries to seek safety with his wife, Alma, and his best friend's daughter, Jess, as people begin inflicting death upon themselves all around them.<br/><br/>While the film was billed as a visceral, gory R-rated horror, that couldn't be further from the truth. The Happening is more of a drama that focuses on a horrific event, rather than a straight-up horror movie. This will be familiar for fans of Shyamalan who have likely grown accustomed to his slow-moving, atmospheric films that focus much more on character than they do on generating scares. This isn't to say that the film is without its freaky moments. Some of the mass suicides, particularly one where construction workers begin plunging to their deaths, are incredibly eerie and unsettling. The idea of people turning on themselves is creepy in itself, as one can really only rely on themselves in life. By having people randomly commit suicide, Shyamalan taps into the fear of people turning on themselves and he's got the visual style to create some very chilling imagery revolving around the suicides. His use of long wide shots allows the audience to focus on what's happening, as opposed to using jumpy, sporadic cuts that end up detracting from the content (like most horror/action directors use these days). Shyamalan's already proved himself to be a master of suspense with The Sixth Sense, and there are a few shocking moments throughout the film which had me jumping out of my seat that hark back to his horror debut.<br/><br/>The downside seems to be that in an attempt to get an R-rating, Shyamalan has thrown in numerous useless instances of gore. I'll admit I'm a huge fan of gore and violence, but it really feels out of place in a film like this. A scene in which lions bite a man's arm off or a scene where a man is torn apart by a lawnmower seems unnecessary and at odds with the rest of the film. Obviously it was a marketing strategy, but it detracts from the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Another weak point of Shyamalan's is his script, particularly the dialog. While he's a great director, especially at building up suspense, and he's skilled enough when working with the plot, storyline and the twists he has become famous for, his dialog is really weak. Often the stuff they say is rather ridiculous and unrealistic (a young soldier says ""Cheese and crackers"" as opposed to a more common expletive) and it ends up evoking laughter in the audience. The attempts at comedy are also fairly poor, with characters randomly talking about ""hot dogs"" and other things of the sort. Shyamalan's strong suit isn't comedy and while humor could be a nice contrast in a dour movie like this, it doesn't work here.<br/><br/>The acting is also fairly bad, which is a surprise considering the cast. Mark Walberg and John Leguizamo have proved themselves to be good actors, but here they are pretty terrible, and most of the blame can be pinned on Shyamalan. They are both notorious for playing tough guys and here they're miscast, both portraying soft-spoken teachers. The issues with the dialog don't help them much either, and they're always overacting, in an attempt to appear more ""nerdy"" or things of similar nature. Zooey Deschanel is entirely wrong for her role, as Wahlberg's wife, and even the character is developed poorly. She talks like a character out of ""Juno"" (with the quips on the phone about Joey being a stalker) and she seems to quirky and unnatural for a movie like this, which stays fairly grounded in reality, at least for a horror. It's obvious that despite Shyamalan's directorial finesse behind the camera, he's not nearly as gifted when working with actors.<br/><br/>The Happening isn't nearly as good as some of Shyamalan's other efforts, nor is it nearly as bad as some. It's a decently good eco-thriller that manages to conjure up some good scares, with a message beneath them all. It's not the best horror film, but it's one of the more original ones to come out recently. It definitely doesn't deserve the critical drubbing it has gotten, but then again, the same critics smashing this film are praising mindless drivel like The Incredible Hulk, so it's to be expected that a more thoughtful film would be trashed. If you're tired of seeing the standard cookie-cutter summer blockbusters, do yourself a favor and give The Happening a shot."

I agree with a lot people when they talk about him getting into the role of Elliot.Mark's used to doing characters that are tough, this character's more laid back, gentle, and an all around sweet, appreciative, smart guy. So Mark really needed to try and practice hard to nail this role, So it's kinda hard to look at him differently, But all in all, he pulled it off, Not extremely good, but good, I could tell the hard work, and even though his characters are tough, they have a heart and caring side to them, which made it believable for playing "" Eliiot"". All of the people that go to this movie expect being scared, But if you know ""M. Night"", you know his movies like ""Signs"", weren't that scary, he goes for a more supernatural, kinda mystery thriller, not scary movie.I liked it, because I'm a fan of supernatural movies, whether scary of not. But that's for people like me, who love movies to death, where they look and see they idea's and get into the art and appreciation of the characters, there backgrounds, and can see where they're'e going. I could connect with them,especially Mark's. I'm also a sucker for romance though into this kinda movie, so I loved how in they end, the couple loved each other so much, they realized, how much they needed each other, and sacrificed themselves to be with each other.so for you movie buffs, who just like supernatural , and mystery, go see this movie.Expect to be creeped out, but not scared."
"thedarkpoet","5","2","7","19 June 2008"," Something for the Summer....all that is required is a little imagination
","I don't understand why this film is getting such a bad rep...oh yes, hang on, i do, it's because you have to be able to relate to movies to get it. I don't think that people got the fact that this is a 'End of mankind' movie with a little twist...we see everything from a very human perspective. There's no explosions, meteorites or high paced action, just well built tension and such an amazingly well told story. MNS knows the perfect pace and the perfect way to tell a story. So many people are expecting some sort of 'Twist', that they forget how to empathise with the characters and try to imagine what they would do if this really happened. i hear a lot of ranting about the dialogue, but i really found no problem with it, sure its a little ON THE NOSE, but people don't really speak in quotable lines of dialogue, i can't think of one real quotable line that anyone in real life has ever said. Im not complaining about most dialogue, I'm just saying that people should be more open to something a little bit different, and you are not one to be complaining if you rated D-WARS as a 8 out of 10 movie(yeah, I'm talking about you). If you want something a little bit different this summer, go and see the Happening."
"tomgib","7","2","7","18 June 2008"," Either outsmart the inexplicable or die. That's OK - in a movie.
","In ""The Happening"", we see an intense effort either to survive by outsmarting the inexplicable or to face the end with dignity. I found it appealing.<br/><br/>I liked Mark Wahlberg's science teacher and how he handled his class. The trick he played on one student might get him into trouble in today's hypersensitive world, but such theatrics must be tempting to many teachers. If everyone could teach like that, our test scores would be great.<br/><br/>I liked the struggle for an explanation. Not that I agreed with the movie's take on evolution, but when you are in a desperate run for your life from such an unknowable threat, you might improvise a bit. Wahlberg's character, the TV talking heads, and John Leguizamo's math teacher were all out of their depth, and they were all probably wrong about what was happening. But at least their theories fit the facts before them. The ""force of nature"", whatever it was, clearly affected smaller groups as time went on, and realizing that fact saved at least some of the characters.<br/><br/>I liked how Zooey Deschanel conveyed terror without surrender at least until there seemed to be good reason for surrender without terror. From the promotional clips, I was afraid that she was stuck with one of those old female characters whose only role was to just stand there. I was prepared to hate that, because her characters are usually strong people who can deal with life and convey their turmoil without the standard kicking and screaming.<br/><br/>However, her character did deal with life and taught us something valuable. The first shot of her face, a quietly expressive one, shows understanding of the scale of the danger if not the cause. Eventually, as a painful ending becomes likely, she shows how you can face this as long as you fulfill your responsibilities  in her case to atone for her contemplated transgression and also to the young girl in her care.<br/><br/>I was actually disappointed that the ending was so bland. There was no good reason for the movie to stick with the explanation as understood by the characters, who were making the best of very limited information. The danger they perceived could probably be overcome medically, and the movie needed to end by finding some new level of revolt by nature. Now I am stuck with trying to create my own ending, but maybe that is part of the fun."
"daniel-e-kimble","7","2","7","17 June 2008"," This isn't what you'd expect from the trailer.
","I would like to start of by saying that this movie didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it from the buildup the last few months of waiting. I WAS looking for an all-out thriller that would scare the crap out of me throughout the entire movie. I left the theater having been entertained, but confused about how I felt.<br/><br/>I thought about it for a while and decided that it just wasn't what I was expecting. This doesn't mean I didn't like it, doesn't mean it was better than what I was hoping for, just different. I think I want to blame this on the trailers being developed for movies these days. Lately it seems too much is being done with trailers. Anyone else agree? ""Twists"" are given away in thrillers, all the funny parts are shown for comedies, and sometimes movies are advertised as something they just aren't.<br/><br/>Shortly after leaving the theater I decided that this movie is more like a parody than a thriller. The performances were obviously cheesy. They were great, in quite a not-so-subtle way. The thing that further impresses me is that the scary parts were truly intense and the funny parts were honestly funny. Everyone else in my packed theater seemed to think things were funny as well, as I heard them laugh. I suppose they think that the performances and humor were accidental and this is maybe a reason for their hatred of this movie. I also think it is because of the let downs everyone had for the buildup of the trailer.<br/><br/>If you go to this movie expecting an all-out thriller, you probably will be upset. If you go expecting an M. Night Shamyalan ""Sixth Sense"" you're going to for sure be let down. Go to have fun. Go to be scared. Go to watch a parody of disaster movies. You'll have a good time."
"phoenixfyrr","1","2","7","17 June 2008"," Jump on bandwagon bus M. Night.
","Here is the thing, and I think most of us agree... his best work, is The Sixth Sense... it's been down hill from there. As far as film is concerned. Personally my favorite M. Night movie was Unbreakable, just because I thought it was such a fresh look at superhuman abilities, tying it to comics. I could have taken or left The Village and I wasn't a fan of Lady in the Water. (Signs was good, but that was a love or hate movie I thought.) ---- Now, ""The Happening"" and it's funny, because 60 mins into this movie I said what the hell is ""Happening."" This is M. Night's lousy attempt to get on the Inconvienent Truth bus.<br/><br/>I love M. Night as a writer, but this is not a fresh idea. There was no twist. He actually made Mark Wahlberg look like a worse actor than he already is. This was junk. I knew the angle 15 minutes into this movie. Global Warming... wow... that's original. Other than the suicide scenes this was a whining rant, much like the guy on TV at the end of the film. Then cut to the ""Happening"" in Europe. Wow? really? let's confirm the guy on ""CNN like news channel."" Crap. This movie was crap. I don't mind Global Warming movies, if they are well thought out and have something behind them, but this had nothing... a moth story, and a fossil fuel story. Yaye.<br/><br/>The only two things I liked in this movie were the fact that it was short, and the fact that it was so bad that hopefully M. Night will sit down and rethink his line of writing, or quit doing it all together."

","I agree, when i saw this film the theatre was very full and people seemed to be right into the movie. Even the odd screams now and then. I can see how some people may not like the acting, some of the minor characters could have done better. This film gives an unsettling feel. l But over all i think this film is a true one for anyone who loves post apocalyptic movies. M Night should have stayed true to his twists. But i think the twist was more in the middle. When we realize that it was plants. I still love the plot and the idea of the film. M Night is staying as one of my top writers/directors. He'll come back with something."

","I have seen a lot of bad movies... But honestly, when I see actors like Wahlberg and Deschanel in a movie written and directed by someone who is supposed to be extremely talented (like M. Night, key words supposed to be) I expect something better than Pluto Nash. This film didn't deliver.<br/><br/>I came to the theater with very low expectations after his last two films. I am not an M. Night fan boy, but I have enjoyed a couple of his movies. Not having either a love or hate for him, I would've been satisfied with just a mediocre suspense flick, but this film fell so far from even mediocrity I honestly can't figure out how it ever got produced and released. M. Night was harping about how this movie was ""absolutely terrifying,"" before its release, yet there was not one scene in the entire movie that was even a little bit scary or suspenseful. A little too big a fan of himself perhaps, but that's another matter completely.<br/><br/>Several times we saw the boom mics fall down into the camera view, and the ""special effects"" were so bad that everyone in the theater laughed at most of the scenes, even some of the more key ones that should've been dramatic. The acting was the most horrible thing I've seen in a big budget movie, and I say that with absolutely no exaggeration. M. Nights direction and writing were laughable. I don't know what else to say about it. After watching this movie I felt robbed. I want my $15 back for those tickets.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing is that the movie is so bad that I know it must sound like this review is exaggerated, but it honestly is not and it's difficult to get that through when a movie is this bad. The acting is the worst I've ever seen. The plot development is terrible. The pacing is terrible. The writing is terrible. The direction is terrible. From the opening scene, I should've known right then to turn and run, but this is one of those movies you just keep thinking ""it has to get better, right?"" But it never does.<br/><br/>I think the real twist in this movie (other than the total cop out, afterthought, ridiculous ending) is that after watching it, you actually want to kill yourself.<br/><br/>After this, I can honestly say I will never pay to see another M. Night movie, and I hope that many people agree with me so that we never have another ""The Happening"" from this narcissistic no talent writer/director."

"andell","3","2","7","16 June 2008"," There is a 17% chance you might find this movie good...
","...and about a 99% chance that you will hear this title when it comes to awarding the Golden Raspberry award, while an equal chance you won't hear it once during the Oscar telecast! To summarize this film as best I can, the environment strikes a blow towards the extermination of the human race. The trees, long suffering at the hands of humans, begin to seep toxins (and obviously, a breeze...how that happens I'm not sure!!!) which cause a reaction in humans.<br/><br/>What kind of reaction? Well, it prompts a zombie like state in which the human victims seem unable to prevent themselves from killing themselves, however they do have the foresight and planning to plan out ways to kill themselves.<br/><br/>And kill themselves they do: whether its jamming a hair pin into their throats, walking the plank on a construction sight, steering a riding lawn mower and then proceeding to lay under it, or feeding limbs to lions, the level of uncomfortable ways to die seem to be ratcheted up over and over again! There's nothing really unique in the idea of nature vs humanity, however the common sense in this film is lacking, and it is that which becomes incredibly annoying! For instance Julian (John Leguizamo) pulls a number seemingly out of his head to express the chances that Trenton, NJ, where his wife was headed, is safe from the toxins. Of course, the minute he separates from Elliot (Mark Wahlberg), we know its only a matter of time before he bites the big one! Another problem is that the film seems to turn upon itself in its own contradictions. For instance, this toxin which is theorized produced by the trees, grass and bushes creates a sudden sense of disorientation which prevents the infected from speaking or remembering what they were doing just before- however in the zombie like state, it doesn't prevent them from devising rather complex methods of ending their lives. So in essence, its not hallucinations that the toxin prompts, but rather it is mind control! Does that really make sense? I know that Hollywood is sounding the alarms about the planet in part because there doesn't seem to be the political will to tackle the problem, however enough is enough.<br/><br/>As a side note, if you have lost someone to suicide, or are susceptible to suicidal ideation's/planning, or if you are horrified by the thought of suicide, this film really isn't for you. Having lost a family member to suicide, I found watching it problematic!"
"one_more_vendetta","6","2","7","15 June 2008"," A good movie, but not Shyamalan's best
","After being extremely let down by Shyamalan's last film, ""Lady in the Water"", I did not know if this movie would be worth seeing. Since I enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" so much I gave it a chance. I was pleased with this decision.<br/><br/>The happening has been advertised as Shyamalan's first R rated movie. I believe this is due to the pure shock factor this movie has. Through out most of the movie my jaw was dropping to the floor, not because of gore, but because of shock. This movie shows excellent portrayal of what real people would do in this situation. Despite the criticism, Mark Wahlburg has a pretty good performance as Elliot Moore, the science teacher. His part could have been written better, but he does a nice job of acting it out.<br/><br/>The reason this movie is not excellent? The plot. This movie does not have a clever way to put things together like in Shyamalan's other films. The climax in this film hardily exists. This movie has an OK idea but Syamalan did not do anything to make it more interesting. However this does not ruin the movie. The violent deaths and shocking scenes keep this movie alive. 6 out of 10."
"snl-4","3","2","7","15 June 2008"," Dumbest Movie Ever?
","The good news is that this movie is short.<br/><br/>Of course, this makes you wonder what they left out. Were there scenes even more inane than the ones in the movie? <br/><br/>You've probably already seen the ""spoiler"" that the plant kingdom apparently gets ticked off at human beings for global warming or nuclear power or too many people choosing plastic instead of paper. So, the trees, shrubbery, etc. begin to emit a neuro-toxin that causes people to become dopey and then kill themselves.<br/><br/>Sad to say, but the most ""entertaining"" part of the movie is the variety of creative methods used to commit suicide. Sure, there are several pedestrian self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head, but at least some people have enough imagination to hurl themselves off a construction site, climb trees so they can hang themselves over a country road, play Roy vs. Montecore at the Philadelphia Zoo, run a Jeep into a tree (did the driver think to disable the airbag before hitting the gas?), test the safety features of a commercial lawn mower (I see a lawsuit coming), and face-plant into a glass window.<br/><br/>You also have to hand it to the plant kingdom: they may be green and immobile, but the trees sure know how to rub it. They could have just produced a toxin that would kill us; but, noooooo, they have to emit something to make us want to kill ourselves. Now that's sending a message.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is fine. The problem is that Shyamalan had an interesting idea and then decided to try to stretch it into a movie. It would have been great as a 20 minute student film, but no more.<br/><br/>Any claim this guy may have had to being the next Hitchcock (or even the next John Carpenter) is gone with the wind."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Even in his less successful films, writer/director M Night Shyamalan usually delivers a thought-provoking, unique looking final product. This one, while not one of his better efforts, is no exception.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert fell in love with the insight shown by the characters in the midst of a wake-up call from nature. I say it is a terrific premise, and one most of us have at least thought about, yet it falls way short of showing us the insight of people into their own lives. Granted the dialog is limited, but most of these people just seemed dazed and confused.<br/><br/>None of the sub-plots are well developed and we are left to do most of the thinking and consideration ourselves. The talented director really just throws the idea out there. Actually, very little happens other than a few people are frozen in time until they walk backwards and harm themselves. The film does come alive briefly during the segments with Ft Worth's own Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones, one of the most bizarre senior citizens whom could ever hope to encounter.<br/><br/>With all the missed opportunities and ""inside jokes"" like the nursery owner (Frank Collison) proclaiming his love of hot dogs, this one borders on boring rather than melancholy. Sadly Zooey Deschanel and Mark Wahlberg show little in their roles and John Leguizamo's sniveling role is an embarrassment for all men and his judgment is certainly outside the realm of reasonable. Don't miss Spencer Breslin's (Abigail's brother) brief, but fun role.<br/><br/>All said, this would have made a better Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode since Night refused to work too hard on this one."

","While there was some cheesy acting, disturbing death scenes, mass paranoia and hysteria, these things make up the components of a cult classic. I wouldn't be surprised if, like many of Shyalaman's features, turns into a midnight movie. Think about it. Besides what I've already mentioned, there's a doe eyed heroine played by Zooey Deschanel who stumbles around from scene to scene. Now recall all the old paranoia horrors and you'll find every nuance of The Happening as cheesy but equally frightening as any other cult classic. No matter which way you look at it, The Happening raises many questions about humanity environmentally and internally. People were afraid of Russian terrorists and aliens in the fifties and we're afraid of virtually the same things, this just happens to be a modern retelling. <br/><br/>Additionally, I have to give a shout out to the person who wrote the review titled ""the not so happening"". The fact that this person thinks that ""Failure to Launch"" is a good movie completely discredits his/her entire elementary reasoning in their review. Enough said."

People were going in to the movie theater expecting a hardcore scary movie, so they came out thinking this movie had really poor acting, and a dumb storyline. My personal opinion is that the movie was more comically than people realized; they mistook funny moments for bad acting. And when you think about it most of Shyamalan's movies have a comically aspect to them. So if you're going to see this movie go with an open mind; just don't walk in thinking this is going to be the scariest movie ever, or you'll end up disappointed."

The scene of the hangings springs instantly to mind. And the truly terrifying performance by Betty Buckley. As a horror film, and as a person who enjoys the scare factor of a horror film, I can say this film does not put the genre in a bad light, nor has M. Night. Shyalanan let himself down. The film offered a good blend of horror and sci-fi, and at times, despite cheesy, a comedy edge to it. I feel that if the protagonists had shown a greater bond with each other, and formed emotional attachments with the audience, i would have been more gripped and involved with the film.

","OK, first of I am going to say that I have been satisfied with some of Shyamalan's previous movies, like The Sixth Sense and to some extend Signs. That said I cannot say that I found The Happening remotely satisfying... and I normally love these kind of movies were you are supposed to get the feeling that something huge and extraordinary is going on, whether it will be aliens, natural disasters or a strange virus. To get to the point... the acting in this movie is the worst I have seen since... well since I saw Show Girls. It was that bad. At times I was wondering if this was some kind of a new public joke, to see how long people were going to watch such bad acting. The plot seemed random at best and the dialog is... well it is.... my god it is bad. This is what you would expect from a school play (a really bad school that is). The movie constantly got you thinking things like, ""what the hell was that all about"", ""what? WHAAAT?"", ""no your kidding me right?"" and ""please don't let it be the plants"". I just got home from the cinema and to be honest with you, once again, I am shocked to see the score on IMDb. Over 6... who gives this movie over 6 in score. I will give this movie 3 stars (and then I am being generous). 1 for the first 5 minutes of the movie which was actually kind of good, 1 for at least trying to make a new sci-fi movie, since I strongly believe that we don't get enough of those, and at last but not least, 1 for making me laugh my ass off at certain scenes which was so weird, so misplaced and so poorly acted out that I was almost peeing myself.

"ndlogik","5","2","7","13 June 2008"," The opening scene and (some of) the performances were about it...
","What starts out strong sometimes burns out fast, and The Happening, a ""psychological thriller"" based on an unknown phenomenon leaving mass suicide in its wake, is no exception, as it fails to live up to the hype, or even it's writer/director's past achievements.<br/><br/>Certainly not M. Night Shyamalan's best, this film left me feeling cheated, and like I had been condescendingly preached to. It falls prey to many of the trendy plot vehicles utilized in a slew of modern thrillers - as my brother said while we were watching it, ""terrorists are the new asteroids."" I've seen worse movies to be sure, but this was extremely disappointing based on Shyamalan's previous body of work. Not to rehash what I'm certain a lot of other reviews say, but of course Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were awesome. I even liked the Village quite a bit. But everyone runs out of steam sometime and it seems Shyamalan has reached a point where the initial ""surprise"" we expect has evaporated, and we're left running on empty.<br/><br/>What starts as a great premise, one which hearkens back to the best of Hitchcock and The Twilight Zone, comes up short here in a thin, weak script, and a tragic loss of pace which turns what could be a genuinely spooky thriller into little more than a dark comedy. I'm sure my opinion is a little slanted, as I tend to laugh at a lot of horror movies, but there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments here which are severely misplaced, to the point that they draw laughs away from the intentional jokes inserted in an unnecessary attempt to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>The performances were decent, with Ashlyn Sanchez (as the little girl, Jess) giving the best performance, par for the course now in Shyamalan's films. I disagree with some of what I've read in that I feel Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel gave decent performances. John Leguizamo was excellent as always, but the script left all three of these fine actors chewing scenery, as we are left to build tension ourselves in a failed attempt to create environmental and circumstantial dread.<br/><br/>Add to that a number of plot devices we can assume were introduced to build character involvement, none of which are followed through effectively, if at all, and the audience simply doesn't care about these people, preventing any horror or tension from building.<br/><br/>SPOILER: As can be expected, Shyamalan seems ready to depart from his ""spooky buildup, then a mind-bending twist"" formula, but this one, which simply ends right when one expects it may finally be getting good, could use a little twist, or at least a squeeze of lime. There is simply no flavor here, and the pacing initially whets your appetite for a main course that simply isn't coming.<br/><br/>My other, personal diatribe involved here is not so much against this film, but more so against the MPAA and the movie ratings industry itself. Believe you me, I LOVE the GORIEST, and MOST OFFENSIVE movies around, and am not easily, if at all, shocked. That said however, the whole ""M. Night Shyamalan's first R rated film"" angle that is being beaten to death in the marketing campaign for this film is a load of hooey. I have seen WAY gorier and more offensive stuff in PG-13 films, and if this is the same R rating as we get for both Pretty Woman AND the Saw franchise, then god help any confused parents trying to decide whether this is acceptable fare for their children. Take my word for it, it IS... unless you count those kids being bored to death. (Watch ""This Film is Not Yet Rated"" for a great explanation of the bizarre MPAA ratings system.)<br/><br/>Overall, I'll suggest that you wait for the DVD on this one, or even better, torrent a cam version. Even with that crappy quality, you won't miss anything."
"YouSeenThat","2","2","8","26 December 2008"," Move along. There's nothing happening here.
","I tend to take everything that I read on the Internet with a grain of salt, but given the steady stream of rumblings from the Internet crowd pronouncing that The Happening was pretty bad, I felt that I needed to take a look for myself. Now normally I wouldn't give the Average Joe's opinion much weight, but the fact that The Happening had slipped to the Movie of the Week at my local cinema in the space of seven days, it gave some credence to what I had been hearing - The Happening just wasn't happening.<br/><br/>For once, I'm in complete agreement with the Average Joe.<br/><br/>I'm not going to reveal too much of the plot, just on the off chance that you might actually want to see The Happening, but like most of Shyamalan's films, the less you know about it going in the better. Okay, so here's the basic setup: The Happening revolves around a family on the run from a largely unexplained natural disaster with the potential to cripple the continental United States  possibly even the entire world. The story opens in New York City, where we are soon alerted to the fact that an inordinate number of citizens appear to be topping themselves in bizarre and gruesome fashions. In typical Yank overreaction, fueled by media hype, the nation suspects that they are in the midst of an advanced biological terrorist attack from enemy, or enemies unknown.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the premise for The Happening sounded reasonably interesting  akin to the sort of inventive horror fare that you might expect to see coming out Japan or Korea. Despite the fact that the theatrical trailers hinted at this film being another one of those 'end of the world' blockbusters that crop-up around this time every year, much to Shyamalan's credit, the film doesn't rely on clichéd explosions and ridiculous action setpieces to entertain. Instead, the meat of the film revolves around the random collection of characters and their relationships as they try and escape the chaos enveloping them. The protagonists (for a lack of a better word) will certainly act as a catalyst for some amusing/interesting debates once the credits roll. Come to think of it, this sounds like familiar territory. It's been well publicized that the director is a devotee of Alfred Hitchcock  hmm, I can't help but think that The Happening may be Shyamalan's homage to Hitchcock's The Birds obviously minus the titular birds, oh, and the fact that The Happening was bloody terrible.<br/><br/>As mentioned previously, The Happening doesn't need to rely on expensive CGI effects or massive explosions to tell the story  it's all about the characters and their journey. Now just about anyone with an IQ above twenty should be able to appreciate a character-driven story, but what happens when your characters are idiotic and unlikable? What happens when the very actors portraying those characters put in a performance that would rival a plank of wood or, dare I say, maybe even Keanu Reeve's on his best day? <br/><br/>I don't know if Shyamalan was specifically going for a C-Grade horror movie feel, but from the woeful banter between two characters on a park bench in the opening scene, to the foreboding few last seconds of celluloid, I almost thought that I was watching some well-financed film student's end-of-term project that had found its way onto the big screen. Think Italian Spiderman with a multi-million dollar budget.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely woeful  preschool pageant woeful. I haven't cringed that much during a film since Ed Norton stomped some black kids teeth into the gutter in American History X, nor have I been that embarrassed for another human being since Richard Simmons appeared on Whose Line Is It Anyway. The whole cast sucked. Period. While I'm not going to single-out anyone for a special mention, I was expecting a lot more from a line-up that contained the likes of Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo. I almost had the feeling that they were having a laugh was this for real? Did they skim over the script, find out who/what the protagonists were and collectively decided to ham it up purely in protest? If you want ham, have Bruce Campbell on speed dial.<br/><br/>If the poor acting didn't kill all immersion in the story, the characters sure will. It's hard enough trying to emotionally invest in the well-being of a bunch of clowns who can barely deliver their lines in any sort of credible fashion, but multiply that by a hundred when those characters are also complete morons. Their motivations. The idiotic crap that came out of these characters mouths. I'm going to lay the blame squarely at the feet of Shyamlan and his screenplay. Case in point, take the hippie plant nursery owner espousing the virtues of the humble American hotdog like the director was getting a kickback from the National Hotdog Foundation... oh, or what about the lone soldier doing his best Gomer Pyle impression. Christ, even Pyle wouldn't have been caught dead uttering the phrase ""cheese and crackers"" when the world is going to Hell in a handbasket.<br/><br/>After twenty minutes in, I couldn't give a toss as to whether these characters lived forever or died that very instant.<br/><br/>I've decided to keep this review relatively short and sweet - I was going to go on an atypical rant about how M. Night Shyamalan is the most overrated director working in Hollywood today, how his work is little more than a film student homage to Alfred Hitchcock films, and how he struck it lucky with The Sixth Sense but meh, slamming Shyamlan is almost a national sport these days. After watching The Happening, I really can't be bothered wasting any more time on this guy  the proof is in the pudding.<br/><br/>Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com"

"Cheryl15","1","2","8","16 July 2008"," Say Good Night to M.Night - SPOILERS
","I have given M.Night movies their last chance.<br/><br/>In 1999 I was blown away by a film written and directed by a local unknown writer/director. The Sixth Sense was nothing like I had seen before. It was one of the few films I had seen where I had NO CLUE what was going to happen. It was well written, directed and acted. I looked forward to M. Night Shyamalan's next film.<br/><br/>Next came Unbreakable. It was not really my ""kind"" of film, but enjoyable. I was still a fan. His next film, Signs, was filmed in my neighborhood and I watched Mel Gibson rehearse, and followed Joaquin Phoenix down the street in the Philly burbs. I found Signs to be suspenseful and, again, well directed and acted. The Village may not have been a 10, but the cast was fantastic and the twist worth the price of admission, in my opinion. I was still a fan.<br/><br/>Then came Lady In the Water. I am still trying to figure that one out. At least people talked about it. And Paul Giamatti was in it. Not much else I can say. My faith in M. Night was really fading...but I was still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. I mean, he DID write and direct The Sixth Sense! NO MORE. M. Night, you have lost my paid admission. Perhaps you have lost your place in Hollywood, too. The Happening was the worst movie I have seen in...well, ever. The writing was watered down, the characters were one dimensional and the actors brought nothing to the role (wasn't Mark Wahlberg nominated for an Oscar once???). He and Zooey D. seemed embarrassed to be in the film. There was no suspense after the first 10 minutes. The shock and awe was there (a man gets run over by a lawn tractor and blood spurts from a head wound like a cheap horror flick) but no substance. This film had the look and feel of a student film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: After approximately 10 minutes of setting up what could have been an interesting film about human nature being ""controlled"" by some toxic substance of earth, ended up being 80 minutes of people running away from the wind. Literally. I did not buy this premise one bit and the only possibility of a unique view (the lonely women who couldn't grow plants played by Betty Buckley) ended up being squashed when she, in turn, is killed by the plants in the wind. Oh, then all of a sudden when the two main characters venture out into the ""wind"", the toxins stop. How convenient! Oh and make sure that you end this story with the ever cliché pregnancy. I couldn't have guessed that one. the theater emptied with SILENCE. There was nothing to talk about.<br/><br/>This film felt like a student's attempt to force feed you the director's view on global warming and that if we keep abusing Mother Nature, it will lash back like in some science fiction film. I have given M. Night Shyamalan his last chance to ""wow"" me with his talent. Fool me one, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me. It is over."
"glanda-1","1","2","8","12 July 2008"," What a crap!!!!!
","I have just wasted one and a half on this boring movie, what's a crap. The title of the movie is ""Happenning"", but, believe me, nothing is happening! I agree with the previous reviews, this director is constantly deteriorating in movies he has been directing and this movie just touched the bottom. The idea of the movie just sucks. The leading actress is a disaster! And her acting was bad enough to incorporate nicely into this bad movie. I don't mention Mark Walberg, who participated in writing the screenplay and is playing the main character. If you don't want to waste a time, stay away and go see other movie, because any movie you will choose will be better."
"mynameispaigelaino","1","2","8","9 July 2008"," This movie is funnier than You Don't Mess with the Zohan.
","This movie was hilarious. The trailer made it seem sort of scary, but I had no idea it was a comedy. Mark-E Mark was such a funny science teacher! He was good at talking about science, but I liked him better in New Kids on the Block! It made sense how the math teacher used math a lot! I liked that.<br/><br/>I laughed when Mark-E Mark's wife didn't really care about other people and was just acting so silly. She didn't make any sense at all! It was hilarious.<br/><br/>It was silly how they ran away from wind like that! It was also pretty comical when things that were obvious to the viewer went completely ignored by people in the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like when the people hurt themselves! It almost made me not want to watch the movie. I think that movies can be funny without the use of violence! People getting their arms ripped off by lions is NOT FUNNY, even when it's fake!<br/><br/>All and all, I thought this movie was pretty good. It sure was funny! Parts of it were sort of boring, and I didn't really understand why other people in the theater weren't laughing? Maybe they just didn't get it!<br/><br/>As soon as the credits for this movie started, my 56 year old father stood up and said, ""That was s***,"" and walked out.<br/><br/>He's so silly!"
"parul-chawla","9","2","8","30 June 2008"," well made and definitely a must see.
","I watched the movie VERY late because of all the criticism the movie got. But in the end i decided to watch it because Mark Wahlberg's movies are usually good/entertaining.<br/><br/>It was honestly very good; the characters were realistic, as were the scenes in the movie - huge sense of realism, and people should have been able to relate to it..However, people are looking for something more dramatic and more climatic, like the end of the world or something, which this movie doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't meant to be flawless, it was meant to portray human nature and the actors and the director achieved this.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a movie that makes you think and please don't mock the script, it was honestly very well made and its a very thoughtful movie.<br/><br/>The only other movie i saw from Mr. Shymalan was the sixth sense, which was years ago, and i liked his directing style. His movies are different, because they're not over the top - The idea behind this movie might be hard to digest, but do watch it, and think about the message that the movie is trying to relay across..."
"ikon_666","9","2","8","28 June 2008"," I have to disagree with most here.
","This movie was the best Shyamalan movie since The Sixth Sense. Most people don't realize that his writing style for this is less focused on the fear factor of a pandemic, and more on characters that are scared, but are mostly trying for a way to improve their situation and out-think the danger.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie was incredible, especially for Wahlberg, who usually just comes off as corny, actually had many lines that fit his persona, and fit his character.<br/><br/>The casting was great, the directing was great, the action was great, even the ending wasn't bad. <br/><br/>I think M. Night Shyamalan has finally matured as a writer."
"JoseBaldizon","Null","2","8","27 June 2008"," Another underrated film by MNS
","To all: The Happening was a good film. There,I said it. Some people disagree, but their reasons for finding the movie bad or tasteless bothers me (but doesn't surprises me). I remember people giving The Village bad reviews initially because not everyone understood the film for what it was right away. Looking back on it now, I think most people will agree that Village was a great film. I think Happening is receiving the same initial bad rap that Village got, but in time most MNS fans, and others who watched the film will conclude that Happening was a good film. <br/><br/>I feel people are misunderstanding Happening. Two main complaints regard the acting, and the plot/script/story. As I was reading the reviews I began to think that I had misunderstood the acting. For a second I too started to think that the acting was bad. But thankfully I read someone's comments regarding the acting and dialogue:<br/><br/>""If the dialog seems simplistic, well, look a bit deeper and realize exactly what 'regular folk' might say or do if the events of this Happening actually were occurring... this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends... not with the bang of snappy repartee or quotable sound-bytes, but with the whimper of incredulity and dread.<br/><br/>Complaining about the acting or dialog in The Happening is like complaining about the 'jumpy camera work' in Cloverfield.""<br/><br/>Just like in all MNS movies, I felt that the acting was on point in Happening. The acting is not only a statement on how people ""might"" behave during such a catastrophe, but a statement on how people do behave even when there is so much to lose. Consider this: right now I'm writing this review, and shortly, you'll be reading it as if there's nothing better to do in the world. And at the same time of my writing, and your reading, the USA is fighting in a war! Yet here we both are, concerning ourselves with issues ridiculously less important as if nothing were happening at all.<br/><br/>The beauty of Happening (much like Village) is that it leaves most of it's audience thinking ""This is ridiculous/lame, because it could never happen."" Unfortunately, Happening/Village weren't portraying events that ""could"" happen, but events that have and are happening. People leave the theatre bickering about how preposterous the plot/story was, but in actuality the only thing preposterous is that the film was a clear portrayal of our world today and no one realized it. <br/><br/>But anyway, I won't keep going on and on. I just hope no one gets dissuaded from watching the film, and that those who gave it negative feedback rethink their opinions."
"wolflorien","9","2","8","27 June 2008"," Excellent blend of intelligence and imagination
","I know a lot of people don't seem to understand M Night Shyamalan. I really enjoy his films and with the exception of 'Signs', I have always found so much to think about and talk about after. This is no exception and I was pleasantly surprised after having read the reviews.<br/><br/>If you liked the mellow side of Sixth Sense, and the un-Hollywood drama of Lady in the Water, then I think you will enjoy this film. I know that it has been said that the characters react in very odd ways  but I would say that this was a lot more true to life. There is a real Hitchcock feel to the whole thing. If he was making films now, this is what I think he would be doing.<br/><br/>I've never seen Mark Wahlberg in a bad film, and this is no exception. From the way he deals with his students at the beginning, to the way his character adapts to the tale as it unfolds  it's all excellent stuff. The reaction of other characters - from their voyeuristic fascination, to their complete non-reaction, was refreshingly realistic.<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed a film this much since Lord of the Rings. It's not an action movie, - it is more intelligent than that."
"future152004","7","2","8","23 June 2008"," A Movie ahead of it's time
","Before watching this movie don't go on the internet and read reviews about it at all. Because if you do it this way, you will not be truly open minded to what the movie is trying accomplish. And before watching this movie really ask yourself how you feel about the state of the world today, considering all the talks of it ending in 2012.<br/><br/>I thought Mark Walberg and Zooey Deschanel did a great job with the movie. The problem that I had with M.Night's previous work ""Lady in the Water"" was simply, the characters didn't act normal, and they all seemed to strive to be too peculiar due to the fact that this was an M.Night movie. I saw this to be the problem in the first 10 minutes of the ""Happening"", but it was quickly rescued starting with the believable acting role of John Leguizamo. In the end it was additionally all brought together by the very complicated relationship of Walberg and Deschanel(Which was great!) The reason I say this movie was ahead of it's time is because it directly deals with scaring one not by folkloric trickery, CGI, or funny shaped monsters, or super sudden and expected killing patterns, but by the scientific possibility of something that could totally happen to our planet.<br/><br/>Of course majority of the thrill seeking youth won't be excited after having seen this one, as it doesn't have to do with a Big Bad Wolf, along with three little Piggys, or some super predictable eerie killing creature that can't be stopped until the end. Even adults who don't broaden their minds will have a hard time grasping hold of this film. People always want the norm, and things to happen in the natural order of the standard desire. After watching this movie I know that the fact that M.Night can scare me by the howl of the wind, and the crinkle of leaves and plants is a true art form in itself."
"hsasani","9","2","8","21 June 2008"," Shyamalan as a Thinker / Filmmaker in today's Cinema
","M. Night Shyamaln's best film yet! Do not fall in the trap of what the critics say. Remember Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock which was not well received by the critics at the time it was released. Now it is #9 on the AFI's 100 greatest films. M. Night Shyamalan and Darren Aronofsky are two great filmmakers of their generation.<br/><br/>Terrorism is not just a social happening; it is environmental. Terrorism is not something from outside. It is something from inside. It is our intention which makes the environment murderous. The environment responds to what is ""happening"" within us. And the environment includes humans, animals, plants, and the air we breathe. It is everything. <br/><br/>Our actions might have an appearance of benevolence, but our intentions are the source of real benevolence OR malevolence. Offering food and shelter to someone when we just do it because we have to is NOT benevolence, as was the case with Betty Buckley's character. The movie is full of different characters with different intentions. The John Leguizamo's character with gossipy and envious bent, the soldier's supposedly protective-and-serve attitude with his obsession toward his gun, two young boys with prying arrogance and a sense of entitlement. <br/><br/>When you truly want to live for someone else, to serve someone else, to love someone else, then you will survive. That is the intention which is fundamentally woven into the fabric of this planet and the universe. The rest leads to destruction, sooner or later as the movie tries to point out. So does the theory of Punctuated Equilibrium stating that how we adapt to our environment decides our fate as a species. Our individual fates are bound with our identity as a species."
"sexi_tweety21","8","2","8","20 June 2008"," It Was Good
","In my opinion, i thought that the movie was really good, weird and different. It has a different concept from other scary movies and even though there was no reason cause of the events causing the people to harm themselves, the script was excellent. Although The Sixth Sense And Signs were box offices hits, i believe that this one will be a hit also.It's Shyamalan's first rated R movie and i believe that for his first one, it's very good. It's much better than Lady In The Water. Mark Walberg, & John Leguizamo did an excellent job in this film, so did M. Night Shyamalan.I recommend to everyone to go out and see the movie."
"chaingangsoldr06","7","2","8","20 June 2008"," The Happening isn't what people seem it to be.
","I took a day off and actually watched this movie. I analyzed it as I watched, but The Happening actually surprised me more than I expected. I anticipated a HORRIBLE film, but it wasn't half bad. The plot line was excellent. Mark Wahlberg could have done a better job, really. But I guess we are SO used to him being such a bad-ass that him being a serious character was, well, kind of disappointing. I work at a theater and everyone who has come in has asked me if that movie is good. All I can say is ""If you ignore the ending, it is."" The ending isn't a BAD ending, but it isn't an ending that we get from Night. There is no plot twist. It's what we see is what we get. I actually enjoyed that..for once. I also liked that the fact that this could possibly happen. Plants do react to human stimulus, and if a plant feels threatened, it produces what it needs to in order to get rid of what is attacking the plant. So, from a perspective of a theater worker and a movie lover, I'd pay 8.50 to see this movie. I'd pay 19.99 to get it on DVD. It's not what people expect, and that's what makes it actually appealing."
"aewardiv","9","2","8","19 June 2008"," Masterpiece of Humility and Altruism over Arrogance and Selfishness
","Another masterpiece from the maddeningly misunderstood and much maligned auteur M. Night Shyamalan. Beware: spoiler alert!! The Happening is a first-rate, suspenseful, Hitchcockian morality play chronicling the struggle between rational man and an unknowable world. Humanity consists of selfish arrogance (or selfish insanity) and unselfish humility. When confronted with the unknowable, only the latter endure. Along with the main characters--a married couple and a child--we watch helplessly as the selfish and self-assured attempt to explain, flee, or conquer The Happening only to meet their own grizzly demises as comeuppance for their nasty, selfish, and brutal lives. Survivalists, jingoists, and proselytizers, among many others, reap what they sow while the humble, kind, and unassuming lead characters continually exhibit the behavior that insulates them from The Happening. Our heroes are forced to care for a child, nearly left behind at a small-town diner, and almost blown away by shotgun blasts. But they persevere and even thrive while others do not for one reason and one reason only: they do not presume to have all the answers and are always considerate and selfless - even in the middle of a crisis. Shyamalan's lesson is that we should live our lives with humility and altruism despite being surrounded by a sea of presumption, pomposity, materialism and egotism. Of course Hollywood has no idea how to market Shyamalan's films and this time they're banking on the willingness of 15-year-old mall rats desperate to part with their summer movie dollars on any horror flick that comes their way. Of course this picture, like all of Shyamalan's work, belongs in front of an educated film audience willing to challenge themselves and dig beneath the surface for enlightenment through art. Sadly, nearly everyone--critics and audiences alike--failed to ""get"" this film just as they failed to get each of his masterpieces that came before. But that shouldnâ't surprise Shyamalan as nearly everyone succumbs to the happening too."
"jykim9","9","2","8","19 June 2008"," A MUST SEE FOR ALL GENERATIONS (or maybe not so for the really young kids for some violent images though)
","Come to think of it, I have watched all M. Night's movies whether they were on theaters or after they were released on DVDs. It seems as though the director comes back on top every other films. First it was the sheer genius work of Sixth sense, and then the downer..., the ""unbreakable"" (what the heck was that, really!?). After that it was the good old, ""Village,"" (I truly loved it). Then it was that intellectually insulting (as far as the ethnicity studies & anthropological aspects go) ""lady in the water."" And now this time, M. Night comes back with his game on a full throttle. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the HAPPENING. <br/><br/>It's a story about "" the attack of the mother nature."" Although it was a bit hard to read between the lines and some sequences time to time, the message the movie conveys just overwhelms you and makes you think about Human vs Nature relationship again and again.<br/><br/>Some reviewers argued that the acting was just so unnatural and unrealistic. But one must keep in mind that that was done all purposefully to give a unique look/feel to the movie. In its simplest term, acting wasn't the most important part of the film. Some people also criticized that script was just too poorly written. I say those who say so are not much of readers. The script was near perfectly knitted together and riddled with clues and signs so cleverly that makes an educated reader go, ""wow."" Let's face it though, yeah.... not so much Drama-Drama. But why? Because the movie really isn't about it, either.<br/><br/>We humans arrogantly think that we ""own"" the nature that surrounds us. And that's a flat out ignorance and gravely destructive misunderstanding. We humans are mere part of the nature that allows us humans to be who we are. The mother nature owns our destiny no matter how hard we try to overcome all the natural disasters that occur every year around the glob. No more unrestricted drillings of oil on land and ocean and exploitation of forestation by cutting down trees. And to top it all off, the issue of over-population is going out of control and makes the provisional conditions of food supplies all around the world worse and worse each year.<br/><br/>M. Night goes to the extreme and tells us a story of what if the mother nature says she's had enough and decides to preserve herself by getting rid of those who threaten her own existence here on earth. And that threat turns out to be us, Humans. This is s a powerful message and one should not ignore it as just a thing in a summer blockbuster movie. <br/><br/>I say the movie is for all generations because it is perhaps the biggest issue that we all face and everyone should take part in learning about it. I kinna regret that M. Night chose to go rated-R for this project for I would have hesitated to take my own children (if I had children that is) to go see it all together because of its graphic death scenes (This is why 1 minus 10 stars.) But I guess that was also well intended and absolutely needed in the directors mind. <br/><br/>In the movie, only adults die of this ""neuto toxin"" released by plants. And we see two kids die only in the hands of adults who shoot them with rifles to save their own fannies. Perhaps, this is why M. Night only wanted adults to come see his movies. To make us think about our actions and responsibilities we have for our children."
"kirktoons","8","2","8","18 June 2008"," Loved it!
","I loved it!<br/><br/>Another horror (or was it sci-fi?) movie for adults, or at least for people of all ages who have more than two brain cells to rub together. We're beginning to see more of those and thank Yog-Sothoth for that! I was beginning to fear the genre (not gen-dre by the way, just genre ending with an almost silent ""e"") had died and gone to teeny bopper cat-jumps-on-the-table-and-that's-supposed-to-be-a-very-scary-moment hell.<br/><br/>Shyamalan claims he just wanted to make a B flick. Well, folks, he missed his mark once again. I say he perpetrated a damn good, atmospheric film. He's got a knack for setting up nearly silent, eerie screen moments that really put you on the edge of your seat. In his way, he's got as much timing and pacing as Stephen King does. The actors do a very good job (I can't believe Wahlberg used to be a pop idol: he's actually become a pretty decent actor), there's some very interesting camera work, and I felt I was told a captivating story.<br/><br/>Is it flawless? Nope, but it's really, really well done nevertheless. It kept me there and involved 'till the end. It was worth my bucks, my time, and writing about it.<br/><br/>Is the ending bad? Nein, mein Liebling. The ending could have been more flamboyant (I'm thinking, say, of the hand that emerges from the grave at the end of Carrie) but I think that anything else would have been cliché. I liked the ending just the way it was. The story's mainly a snapshot in the life of the main characters and life, from what I know, usually just ends without fanfare, explanations or big revelations. So it's a perfectly ""legal"" ending to a good movie.<br/><br/>The last two characters we see in the movie are, if I'm not mistaken, a gay couple or at least gay friends. I really like the way they're portrayed: very naturally as just two human beings walking and chatting in the park on a nice summer day. This, in its own small subtle way is a masterstroke. To a person like me who is sick to death of hearing and reading about gay this and gay that all the time (I mean : who cares?), it was very refreshing.<br/><br/>I'm really curious to see what Shyamalan's going to come up with next.<br/><br/>Now, if he could just learn to spell his name right...<br/><br/>Kirktoons"

","After his last film, Lady in the Water (which was garbage), I wasn't really expecting much. Especially since I've heard so many horrible reviews of The Happening. Well, I'm hear to report that I was very pleasantly surprised. I found it to be an excellent, and sometimes brilliant film by Shyamalan. On a basic level, the cinematography was incredible, as well as the music by James Newton Howard. I'll try and explain why I liked this film without using too many spoilers. <br/><br/>I thought the film was shot beautifully, and the acting by Mark Wahlburg and Zooey Deschanell was particularly touching. Interestingly, many people I've talked to have said the acting was really bad, and the script was atrocious. I found that the acting and dialogue was done in a certain way to set a certain tone. True, the lines were not ""Juno-witty,"" but they were definitely realistic to how people would talk in such a situation. Very simple statements. They didn't have to say too much, because Shyamalan's visuals told most of the story. With that said, I thought the acting was really good.<br/><br/>SO people everywhere on the East coast start acting weird and then kill themselves and the quickest way possible. An act of terrorism? That is what they think, but it turns out that (spoiler alert) it's really plants. OK, that isn't really a spoiler, it's pretty obvious. Let me explain further. Plants are proved to adapt and evolve over time to create defenses against harmful things in the environment. This film takes that a step further, explaining that humans have become that harmful thing, and when humans are around plants have adapted to release a neurotoxin that causes the human to commit suicide. <br/><br/>I thought this was a very interesting concept, and could have been elaborated on further, but hey it isn't the plants' story! It a story of love between a husband and wife, and what they choose to do when threatened with the certainty of death. In addition to this, the film has a very obvious message. Without being too political, the film makes a strong argument that we have now become a threat to our planet, and presents a very realistic way that nature, or God, could solve this threat. This film was very thought provoking, at least for me, and I found myself thinking quite a bit about the deeper messages. <br/><br/>The film was very suspenseful, and had a lot of very disturbing imagery that will stick with you for a while. Being Shyamalan's first R-rated films, expect some graphically depicted suicides. Rather than delivering a flat-out suspense thriller, it becomes much more as the film also serves as a social commentary and message movie. I think a lot of people just wanted a no-brainer thriller with a twist ending.<br/><br/>There are a couple points of controversy I want to address. It seems the vast majority of people hate this film for a couple reasons. For one, it doesn't have a twist ending. All of Shyamalan's films up until this point have had a twist ending. This one doesn't. Kinda. I'll explain in a second. Until this point Shyamalan has tried successfully to surprise the audience with each film. I think here, it is definitely a surprise that there is no twist. The twist is that what you see is what you get. Also, I think a lot of people just don't get the film. They think it has this corny ending after a silly plot about plants killing people. <br/><br/>If you truly understand the ending, I think you will get a lot more out of the film. (SPOILERS HERE) Throughout the film Mark Wahlburg's character refers to the mood ring he wears, and how the different colors it turns represents different human emotions. Also, during the scene in the greenhouse, a character mentions that with a certain technology, plants give off a certain ""color"" based on the environment they are in and how they are treated. It sounds kind of silly, but it actually is true and real technology. In the film, plants and humans alike both give off ""energy"" that can be sensed by the other. That is where the ending comes in. Even though the harmful toxin is in the air (the old lady died, remember), the two lead characters are able to survive when they go outside to find each other. It is suggested that the love the feel for each other is so strong, that the energy they give off is not seen as harmful by the plants, and therefore they live. It's also seen when the girl is on the swing. On the other hand. The old lady is giving off such a negative energy that she is killed. This will make more sense when you see the film. (END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really loved this film. I thought it was beautiful, suspenseful, and thought provoking. If you like M. Night's other films, and go in with an open mind, then I think you will really enjoy this film as well."
"wji222","7","2","8","18 June 2008"," Why is it so hard for Americans to find a good movie these days?
","Because we're looking in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Shyamalans new flick is not perfect in any sense of the word. The dialogue is chunky and awkward, the acting follows accordingly into sometimes seemingly mild absurdity. The R rating is completely wasted, especially since it was hyped by the media. And worst of all, Walberg is miscast in his role as the leading protagonist.<br/><br/>But the message and theme remains and it is clear as a bright blue morning.<br/><br/>To say that this movie is a walking ""green"" advertisement would be to oversimplify. This movie is about the power of fear, the complexity of human relationships which are at the same time beautifully simple in moments of extreme duress, and most of all, a nod towards the overall discourse of our modern world towards trying to find ""simple"" answers in regards to unexplainable phenomena. For those critics that slam this movie because it leaves us with a hanging string would be to prove Shyamalans very point: that as a society, we have become unfamiliar and yes, uncomfortable with whatever does not hand us answers in percentage, mathematical, or clear cut formulas. This movie is not supposed to provide any clear formulaic answers, merely present us with an exaggerated situation and then allow us to come to our own epiphany.<br/><br/>How do I know this to be true? For the reviewers that have actually seen this movie, then you know that there were those moments of complete quiet on screen. Where only the wind breathed life and the grass swayed ominously and Walberg and Deschanel ceased their constant running and looked fearfully out into the open green fields. What were they looking for...what were they running from? They didn't know, not for sure...only that something was after them, something they could not stop, something that they could not see, touch, taste, or hear. Only something that they could feel. If not clear enough, these intense moments of human frailty are then reiterated in the form of a child running limply beside Deschanel's character. In those moments, Shyamalan's brilliance takes center stage, allowing us as viewers to pause and consider and finally realize, along with Walberg and Deschanel, that the glory of being human is our ability to choose love over fear, that within our most frail moments we have only two things: our fellow humans and the beauty of the physical world that surrounds us. Everything else fades into obscurity. This was meant to be the only answer and ironically, within our modern age, it was the one answer that most viewers could not seem to grasp."
"jdkraus","6","2","8","17 June 2008"," Interesting...
","I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that this was a good movie by M. Night Shyamalan. It's not his best but definitely not horrible or bad like ""The Village"". Instead of focusing on science-fiction and fantasy that he has done in the past, his eyes are on Mother Nature.<br/><br/>The film opens with Mark Wahlberg's character Elliot Moore instructing a class about the honey bees' populations that are dramatically decreasing across the world. I've never heard of such a case, but after doing a little inquiring and research, I learned that this is known as CCD or Colony Collapse Disorder. It is unknown why this is happening. If the bees go instinct, it could very well cause the extinction of the human race.<br/><br/>The film's plot brings in the question: What if plants and nature can turn against us by our abuse and hate? As an airborne toxin sweeps through the Manhattan, making people kill themselves, Elliot Moore, his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) are forced to flee Philadelphia and travel cross country to avoid the toxin.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" is a very interesting movie that captures suspense, mystery, drama, and character development that is well in Shyamalan's capability. He once again proves to be one of Hollywood's most daring and unusual directors. The score by James Newton Howard is haunting and the work of the cinematographer helps plaster the landscapes that bring the winds of destruction.<br/><br/>Sure, ""The Happening"" may seem unrealistic like many Shyamalan movies are, but is it? Could nature turn against us? I'm probably one of the few who appreciate this movie, but again, it is not Shyamalan's best work partly because of the R rating. It was rather shocking to watch the explicit scenes of violent suicides and murders that made me jump and at time gasp. To me, it did not seem like Shyamalan's style since all his other movies are PG-13 or lower. The other thing I did not like about this movie was its pace. The film seemed to go by too quickly. There is some character development but not enough to make it moving like ""Signs"" or ""Lady in the Water"". I was also hoping for Shyamalan to make his appearance in the film like he does in his other ones, but he doesn't. 7/10 -Give it a chance; it's better than what most critics say."
"loganx-2","7","2","8","16 June 2008"," Good Horror, Not The Greatest Shyamalan(but NOT that bad)
","M. Night Shyamalan, tries to make a summer horror movie, with no pretensions. The problem lies that pretensions are what make some artist's good, it's their ambition(insane, and annoying at times though it may be), that makes them so vital. ""Lady In ...(read more)The Water"" was ridiculous but it was interesting, it's arguable, it has ideas greater than itself. ""The Happening"" is an example of what you see is what you get. There is no twist here, just survival and some thin guess work for a plot, some very intense sequences, and an ending which has some subtle hints at environmental crisis and the woes of global self-destruction.<br/><br/>People continuously go see Nights movies expecting ""revelations"", when at best he's made some clever twists and subversion's of standard speculative fiction conventions; ghosts, superheros, aliens, fairy tales, utopias and monster myths, etc. He stands out as much as he does because he makes interesting genre films in places other's wont tread, or tread poorly. At a time when all movies are either franchise attempts or remakes or both, it's nice to see someone(anyone), at least try and think of something new.<br/><br/>It just feels like people expect Night to be Hitchcock, when really he's somewhere between him and Larry Cohen.<br/><br/>So what's left is a good pop corn horror film, with some original images, good music, a few awkward bits in the dialog, but over all decent writing with some light comedic touches(very needed), for effect. I think as a director overall he's grown, while as a story teller, he may be running on steam. Even though it's not as thought provoking as his other films, it's got all the suspense and dramatic tension, audiences have been waiting for since ""Signs"". So a little disappointing, but overall still worth checking out.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Following): There's a lot places the plot could have actually gone, there are theories that the evolution of flowers helped wipe out the dinosaurs, which I was just sure this movie would mention, but it Dian't...or maybe something more with communication between human and plants(hinted, joked at, but never done). The movie makes it clear that ""man"" is the problem, like the ending of ""Planet Of The Apes"", one can imagine M. Night Shyamalan somewhere on a beach banging his fists into the sand shouting ""You blew it up you maniacs"" at the statue of Liberty, however in 2008, pointing out that man is self destructive an enemy of the environment of the planet, is like shooting fish in a barrel. Every movie from Godzilla to Frankenstien tries to point out how were messing up the natural balance, only Night doesn't seem to see any possible end in sight, just the beginnings of crests on a terrible wave of future problems(which is fair, and if nothing else honest), and so it seems the optimist of ""Lady In The Water"" and ""Signs"" where we had hope and each other to believe in, has finally given in to modern pessimism (remember all those cars driving away from the dinner)...were all f*&ked, we are a disease...but at least we got movies."
"herndona1","8","2","8","16 June 2008"," Good Movie - Bad Reviewers
","It makes me crazy when I read reviews and the people writing them criticize a film and don't even have their facts straight. How can you understand a complex movie like The Happening when you didn't get that Alma and Elliot were ""married,"" not dating as a previous critic stated. I think the actions of people in a crisis is explored in such a subtle way that I wish I had a pause button to think and talk about it more. The only thing I wanted more was back story to the main characters. I wanted to be more invested in their survival not frustrated in trying to understand why a father would abandon his child to look for his wife that he was not even sure where she was. I do have questions, but think that M. Knight has delivered another complex thoughtful film here."
"mdarmocida","7","2","8","16 June 2008"," A Fine SciFi Movie
","Having read all the bad reviews I just had to see this movie for myself. After viewing it, I can't understand why so many people are bashing this movie. In fact, those giving this movie a bad review are probably among the same egg-head crowd that gave good reviews to real stinkers like ""No Country for Old Men"" or the real snooze-fest ""There will be Blood.""<br/><br/>First of all, it's true that there were some unbelievable parts/premises in this movie, but that's why it's called ""Science Fiction"", emphasis on the word fiction. For the SciFi genre the acting was fine and realistic, as were the events and circumstances. The movie flowed in a fine coherent manner, and while not a spectacular flick, I would say it falls somewhere in the middle of the road. At the very least, it's certainly entertaining and makes you think. Lastly, the movie was just what I thought it would be from my impression by the coming attractions.<br/><br/>I can only surmise that those that didn't like this movie were expecting something spectacular from MKS. However, I never really thought MKS was such a great writer/director in the first place. So I've taken this movie at face value as another SciFi flick. If you're expecting ""The Sixth Sense"" then don't see this movie, because you'll be disappointed. However, if your expecting a decent horror flick (or don't even know who MKS is) then you'll probably like this movie."
"moutonbear25","6","2","8","16 June 2008"," Half Happening
","Something the supposed contemporary auteur, M. Night Shyamalan, has never been quite good at is getting directly to the point. He usually likes to keep us guessing the whole way through and by the time the expected twist tries to catch us off guard, we are either completely floored or entirely annoyed. In his latest offering, THE HAPPENING, he finally learns how to get straight to the punch but that, as it turns out, is just as problematic as keeping us in suspense. Shyamalan seems as if he has been somewhat humbled by his recent difficulties finding an audience but from the moment his name appears ominously in the credits as the man who does everything (writing, producing and directing), his presence looms over the premise with an air of obnoxious knowing.<br/><br/>THE HAPPENING first hits Central Park and we are given no time to breathe before the scenario turns apocalyptic. People stop in their tracks, repeat random phrases and find interesting or perhaps just easily accessible manners in which to kill themselves. No one knows what's happening, except for Shyamalan, who appears to be reveling in the delirium from the rustling trees above. The affliction spreads and the mystery is at first certainly engrossing. Whatever intensity the scenario creates though is unnervingly undone by the cast's delightfully laughable attempt at keeping it classical. Mark Wahlberg as enthusiastic hopeful, Elliot Moore, leads his wife and best friend (Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo) toward safety, despite having no idea where that is. His naïve optimism is cute when it should be compelling but he can hardly be blamed for what is clearly Shyamalan's overall approach.<br/><br/>The classical style and contemporary reality ultimately clash and it becomes clear that Shyamalan's biggest obstacle is Shyamalan himself. His bigger ideas are solid but muddled by the little ideas he throws in to keep things interesting. Naturally, the tragic events are initially assessed to be terrorist attacks. Shyamalan paints America as a panic stricken populace that know who to blame when they cannot explain what is happening. They don't even question the possibility of it being a more organic threat until too much damage has been done. This is in itself heavy enough to sustain intrigue while making smooth criticism of the American government as shepherd and its people as sheep, but when you meet the people he is criticizing, they are so futile, prattling on when they should be in crisis mode, you wish they would just breathe in the bloody toxins already and die. The promise of a more satisfying film always seems just out of reach and a little help behind the scenes, primarily in the writing department, would help Shyamalan find the focus he so desperately needs.<br/><br/>THE HAPPENING is passably suspenseful, occasionally intriguing but mostly ineffective. It feels contrived, as though Shyamalan were trying too hard to win back our graces, doing so in such a false fashion. Perched comfortably at his pulpit, he preaches about protecting the environment but without ever communicating any actual passion for it. Consequently, the pet cause feels more functional than it does pertinent. And all the while, you can feel him looking down at you, disappointed that we don't get his genius when what he really should be doing is looking inward to see that perhaps he is just not communicating as clearly as he could. Then he might be able to see that we want to love him; he's just making it too hard to do so."
"benecjt","8","2","8","16 June 2008"," Do not listen to the naysayers; this film is actually quite good
","I am not sure what people expect when they go to see an M. Night Shyamalan film. Do they expect to see a ""twist"" ending? Academy award winning acting? Stellar writing? If so, they you will be disappointed with The Happening. However, if you want to see a somewhat original, mildly shocking, and entertaining film, this is a good movie to see.<br/><br/>The Happening is not a frightening film, where you will jump out of your seat or scream with fear. However, there are scenes that you will not expect that will shock you a bit. The dialogue is sometimes a little corny, but it at times is very funny. Some people may think the premise is ""laughable"", but there have been many, many more far fetched movies made recently that do not get this type of criticism. <br/><br/>People love to criticize M. Night's films because they hate him. They do not bother to watch the movie with an open mind to see the cleverness of the writing, the message within, the subtle humor, or the human struggles that are always present in his films. Many of his critics do not bother to see the movie for what it is. They instead say ""it's not The Sixth Sense, so therefore it sucks"". On one Message Board thread, people are criticizing his writing because Mark Walberg's character says ""with whom?"" (which is correct) rather than the more common ""with who?"". They criticize the writer because he portrays a teacher that uses proper English! That is a great example of him receiving undeserved criticism. They are not interested in giving you an honest critique of the movie; they are interested only in bashing Night every chance they can. I wonder how they would have criticized Night for butchering the English language if Elliot said ""with who?"" instead?<br/><br/>Well, I think there is a lot to this movie, and I would encourage you to go see it. But go with an open mind, the the attitude that ""I am going to be entertained by this"", and you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes may disturb you. There is not a lot of blood and gore (as in the Saw movies), although there is more than any of his previous movies (including The Sixth Sense). You see a lot of people die, so if that bothers you this movie may not agree with you. The ending is very subtle, and there is no twist so do not look for one. I don't necessarily agree with Night's message in this film, but it did not ruin the film for me. This is a drama that is wrapped around a couple having marital difficulties in the midst of a terrible ""event"" that has befallen the northeastern United States, and it shows how they survive through this crisis (similar to Signs). No aliens this time, however.<br/><br/>I saw the movie twice. The first time I took my wife, and the second time I took my oldest daughter and her fiancé. I appreciated the movie more after seeing it a second time. That has happened to me previously with some of Night's films, specifically with Signs and The Village. I missed things the first time but seeing it again helped me to appreciate the movie all the more. <br/><br/>Go with an open mind and enjoy the film. At times you will gasp, laugh, cry, and be sitting at the edge of your seat. Both times I saw it the audiences appeared to be satisfied with the film. I know I was."

","and not expect to be spoon-fed or expect a super-hero movie. Maybe the expectations for M.N.S were too high. Cut him some slack. It was a good movie with a great message. It requires some thought people. And if you actually can do that,you'll get it and realize what it is about and how subtle and powerful the movie and messages are. And how good the actors portray the knowledge of what they assume is the end of the world and their own mortality. No super-Herod. No super-honeybees. No riots in the streets or panic. Just the quiet knowledge that nothing was coming to save them this time. People that hated it expected that and should go see one of the super hero movies where the lines are black and white and can keep hoping for a savior at the end. This is not a black and white or good and evil movie. It is a shades of gray movie. There is no clear-cut right and wrong side. And I can understand the plants and trees getting their hate on. Watch them dump toxins in the river and then say you can't eat the fish from that river or burn down thousands of acres of rain forest a day. It doesn't take much thought to get into his head and think - why wouldn't the plant's, who all life depends on, say enough is enough. It's a fine plot for a thriller. It's a heck of lot better than 99% of the slash crap out and what does that say about the state of mankind and your movie dollar? So those of you that hate it and rated it a 1 star, it makes me wonder what you found so outrageous or horrible about it. No need to answer, I just find it amazing that you didn't like it. Especially those of you that got Signs and unbreakable. Those of you that didn't, it doesn't surprise me that you didn't get this one either. Anyway. It's a good movie and well worth seeing."

Night since the Sixth Sense all the way through Lady In The Water (yes i liked The Village and Lady In The Water) but this time he hands in a confused movie. The movie starts out really good and then by the middle where walhberg and his family are trying to find a place to hide it starts unravaling. The acting was good, I liked Mark Walhberg, lots of pepole though he was miscast. Zooey Deschanel, who I really like, was the one that felt out of place. I liked her, but not as good as I had hoped I would. John Leguizamo was also good. The movie isn't scary or suspenseful, its also not a horror movie, it's more of a drama in my opinion. They are trying to promote this movie as ""His first R Rated movie"". Big deal there was hardly any blood or language to earn its R Rating.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I liked this movie, but after a while it started to lose me, the ending needed something... Its hard to review this movie without giving anything away (which its not that big a spoiler).

Amongst its many failures as a movie worth $20 and 2 hours of my valuable time, let's examine its complete and utter incompetence in the realm of character development. Had Mark Wahlberg even *cared* that Zooey Deschanel was having an affair (or if she even *were* having one!), perhaps we might have been impressed with their later reconciliation. Nope.<br/><br/>Holes in the plot? Two words: ""Alpine Lace Cheese"".<br/><br/>One example from the many dozens I'm sure I could cite would be why new-mom and new-dad let little Rumer wander around in the ex-Betty Buckley's house - o - anachronistic - horrors knowing that her recently and extensively mutilated body lay just around the corner nestled comfortably on the residual shards of broken glass in one of those charming cottage-y windows.<br/><br/>Even so, couldn't they have at least gone with the so-clichéd traumatized - youngster - remains - mute - and - later - launches - sequel - esquire - subplot? Might I add that it would have been the work-of-a-moment to give Buckley's character a quaint love of plants (so we could feel indignant when they later carved her into little pieces), but no.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ms. Buckley, what in the sex-bot-heck was that frigging doll doing on her bed anyway? Come to think of it, I don't want to know.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, my message to MNS: that ""Make An R Movie With Absolutely No R-Rated Shots"" free-ware you downloaded that promised to auto-gen screenplays with all kinds of quirky don't-go-anywhere mini-plots and bare-bones dialogue was a PRANK, a prank, I tell you.

","So what can we expect from Night's first R-rated outing? Meh, really not that much. Just like his past couple, Night's films are really beginning to be pretty damn weak. And with his latest flick, The Happening, which sounds like a Bentley Little book (only if), you're given the same Night treatment. A movie that works and doesn't work all at the same damn time.<br/><br/>In The Happening you got people killing themselves due to a supposed neuro-toxin that the plants are dishing out. Why? Because we're not treating Mother Earth so nice. Well, that's one theory. The idea is kinda cool, revenge of Mother Nature. But when you can predict what's going on, by the oh-so obvious direction (cue mysterious music with gloomy shot of swaying trees) the movie immediately becomes an adventure flick instead of some sort of mystery. So, about 20 minutes in, I get the jist and the only thing I slightly care about is how they're gonna stay alive. The way the movie played out was okay enough, I guess, but the writing and acting by all involved, minus Leguizamo and the slack-jawed dude from O'Brother, were laughable and completely overly dramatic. Marky Mark....why is he so damn breathy in all his friggin flicks? If his character isn't abrasive, forget it. The writing, God the writing. I don't know what's going on here, but if anyone truly thinks this is professional stuff, go to the zoo and jump in the lion cage. And what a stupid scene that was......was that guy made of jello? Arms do not pop off that easily. Ugh....<br/><br/>The Happening's good aspects is the production value. It's a great looking and sounding film. But the story, writing, acting, and even direction is all average to weak. With barely anything interesting or shocking happening after the first 20 minutes, the movie just pulls you along for an average, uneventful feeling ride. Go see it if you're a M.Night Fanboy or you're easily impressed."
"gfink02","1","2","8","13 June 2008"," What Happened???
","First off, I had to come back and change my rating from a two to a one to offset all the 9 and 10 star reviews. Right now the IMDb rating is 6.3 and I'm pretty sure that as more people actually see the film, this will drop significantly. It would appear that there is currently a flood of people calling this a great film which is like calling a pile of my dog's waste products an artistic masterpiece. Now on to the review:<br/><br/>I was really excited about going to see this film on opening night. I like Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo and even like most of M. Night Shyamalan's films. The previews looked pretty good and there were some good reviews.<br/><br/>My God, what happened? The acting from the beginning felt very ""B Movie"", and upon reading other reviews it appears Shyamalan has said this is intended as a B Movie but that is certainly not how it has been marketed. The opening ""horrific"" scenes were pretty much covered in the previews. Actually, most of the stuff that should have been frightening was covered in the previews, albeit briefly.<br/><br/>I agree with others here that Wahlberg was grossly miscast. Zooey Deschanel was charmingly funny in some parts and in my opinion gave the only real relief from an otherwise total flop.<br/><br/>-------SPOILERS BELOW-------------------------- <br/><br/>Now for the plot. The plants are fighting back. Yep. Not only that, they are coordinating attacks on specific groups of people. Large groups at first, then they start picking off the smaller groups with amazing accuracy. You know an attack is coming when the plants manipulate the wind to blow their toxins into the crowds. You see an attack coming as the heavier wind is blowing like a sheet across fields, etc. Yes, really. Not only that, they attack a group in a field but leave another group in a different part of the same field unscathed. I know Wahlberg says something about having to be close to the source or the toxins will dissipate but then how do you explain the construction workers on top of the fairly tall building getting hit so effectively? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Now I'm all for suspending belief and enjoying a movie for what it is but when a movie is trying to push a message (like this one definitely is) of what COULD happen, I would like at least something to make sense. Very little makes sense with this film and as others have stated, the acting is sub-par and overdone, the screenplay is weak at best and I felt there was little entertainment value at all. I found myself looking at my watch trying to gauge how much longer this would last within the first thirty minutes. I left the theater feeling I've just wasted $20+ and an hour and a half of my life.<br/><br/>If you want to see a truly scary movie about the consequences of what we're doing to our planet, go rent ""An Inconvenient Truth"". It's more frightening and will be a much better use of your time."

","4 outta ten for a rated R is bad, doesn't even feel like its a movie from 2008. as everyone said poorly acted and just a waste of my money n time. OK the beginning started nice we seen many of those movies before but then 30 minutes into it, it all started going downhill. A little blood here and there makes this movie a rated R what a joke on these movie makes. well its a good movie for those that make the epic movies and the scary movie,lol i would get a kick to see this movie being mad fun of, now that is something i would pay to see. And for the director wow I think he was on his lunch break or something while filming this. If these are the types of movies we gotta get for the future Hollywood should hire me and i will film people walking around trying to run from the wind.....now thats a true joke trying to outrun the wind. Imma laugh for days on that one."

","This movie had a great build-up. I was anxious the whole movie to see what was causing the suicides. But the end just didn't do it for me. I get it...save the earth or it'll kill you. It was just lacking substance to me. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlburg did a good job playing a nerd, not usually how we see him, but he was funny at times. I didn't think Mark and Zoey had any chemistry in this movie. I know their characters were having problems, but still, it just seemed awkward every time they talked. <br/><br/>There seemed to be such potential with this film. But I believe it came up short in the end."
"robertallenandersonjr","8","2","8","13 June 2008"," Not as much happening in this as you would expect
","The Happening was a very weird and suspenseful movie. It had a very weird vibe to it the whole movie through. It kept you on the edge of your seat for the most part. I think you will really feel bad for the characters and what they are going through. It kind of was sad at some parts. Half of the story was the love story between Mark Whalberg and his wife Zoey Deshanel. They pretty much were always fighting and couldn't get along. Some scenes were not meant to be funny and just made you laugh at times. It wasn't intentionally meant to be funny and it kind of was. For the most part though this movie will have you saying wow and think to yourself what if this was really happening. The same stuff was just pretty much happening over and over again. Their wasn't as much happening as you would think from the trailer though. Their weren't a whole lot of scenes that make you jump. The messages were very good and I think were a main part of this movie. The acting wasn't amazing but not bad it was pretty god. Mark Whalberg has played better roles but did a good job. Zoey Deshanel didn't do such a good job. I think they could have had someone else play her role. Overall though this was a very suspenseful movie and pretty fun. Go see it if you want a movie that will have you saying wow after it."

","This is a terrible film. Mark Wahlberg acts like he is latently gay throughout the movie and Zooey Deschanel is wooden and frequently just looks like she does not really know how to act at all. The movie is basically a propaganda piece from the Club of Rome/ New World Order movement to convince human beings that they are a cancer on the planet and that the world would be better off without us. According to Shaymalan, some things are 'acts of nature that we will never fully understand'. If scientists in the past has had this philosophy we would never had understood anything about our planet.....it is intellectually and scientifically lazy."

Who takes 60 million dollars on a Hollywood movie to intentionally make a B movie, this guy is stupid.<br/><br/>I loved the sixth Sense and Mark Walhberg. But man, this is the worst acting performance mark has ever done. He is one of my favorite actors, this was disappointing. He played his character as kind of a homo and his girlfriend just woke up after a seven day drug binge. Both there acting was way below B, I have seen better acting on the Disney channel.<br/><br/>As for the ""vision"" of the movie, it fell flat. I understand there was suppose to be a message two things I can come up with of the top: Playing of the US fear of terror attacks and being vulnerable. And somehow a philosophical message that what we are doing to the planet is going to eventual kill us- global warming etc, etc. But no one got the message. Point is, the main reason you make a Hollywood movie is to 1: make money and 2: to entertain the masses.If you want a deep philosophical message to be sent out in a movie, make an independent movie, where at least their might be an audience that can render your so called ""vision"". After hearing this movie was horrible, I had to be fair and see for myself. And well it was the worst big budget Hollywood movie I have ever seen...literally.<br/><br/>60 MILLION DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN- SHAMYLAN SHOULD HAVE USED THE MONEY ONSOMETHING THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE LIKE A CURE FOR CANCER OR HELPING OUT THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, STARVING KIDS IN Africa. 60 MILLION ON THIS MOVIE WAS A JOKE- JUST LIKE THE WHOLE MOVIE"

Night Shyamalan has delivered the message quite good but not perfect; as people these days are so simple minded and ignorant that you just have to spell everything out for them like a 2 year old. i was very disappointed about the bad reviews that this movie has received and more upsetting that people are talking and laughing throughout the whole movie when i went to see it. sure it has a bit of a horror kick and surprising jolt out-of-your-seat moment as my girlfriend got surprised a couple of times, even some funny scenes.<br/><br/>so i'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone nor ruin it. but as you watch the movie, think about these things...location where these events are happening, time when these events occur (there's a reason M. Night Shyamalan noted the time and location throughout the movie), people's reaction to these events, how they react to such event, how they feel about these occurrences, how they deal with these events, take a closer look at the scenes toward the end because there's a meaning to them...it's almost subliminal. so think a moment after you see this movie...think about humans, people, us, and our connection, our instinct, our reaction, our perception, our way of thinking, and so on...<br/><br/>it's not a sci-fi horror movie or stupid meaningless movie. this is M. Night Shyamalan's style of telling a story and sure it's not as obvious and direct when he communicates his message like his other movies but it delivers. i'm not defending him as the best writer/director or anything of sorts because not all of his movies are great. but he does have a stylistic way of communicating his messages to his audience."

It takes a taboo issue of suicide and makes it involuntary, which is totally disturbing. Put yourself in the movie, no matter how strong a person you are, you too would be committing suicide just like everyone else. Shymalan is great at making you think about how you would handle the situation he presents. <br/><br/>2. People keep saying the acting was terrible all around. That's just not true. There were 3 great characters, all portrayed perfectly by Jeremy Strong, Betty Buckley, and Frank Collison. <br/><br/>3. The movie was not too long. In fact, it was the perfect length for the story. I never got bored. <br/><br/>Problems with this movie... 1. Mark Wahlberg should always be a bad guy.<br/><br/>2. Some of the suicide scenes were just grueling, in particular, the later ones, which just seemed like audience punishment. By the end of it, I couldn't even think of a method that we didn't see, or wasn't mentioned.<br/><br/>The movie definitely gave me bad dreams, which is part of the masochism of seeing scary/suspenseful movies, so all around I'd say good job, but there's no way I'll be re-watching this one. 7/10."

","This movie isn't THAT bad. I went in with extremely low expectations based on what I have read about the film in the last few days and have to say that although it by no means a great movie, it is still worth a look. If any other director besides Shyamalan had directed this, it would not be getting such a bad rap. It's return to B movies. Movies that are by no means brilliant, but at least they're entertaining. He really set the bar high for himself with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable and it seems that people are expecting each of his films to be a home run. But even those two movies had flaws. Most films do. This one just has a few more than others. The performances are a little wooden, yes. It tends to get a little preachy and, OK, the dialog is often flat and pointless...but, is it entertaining? Yeah, it is. Like I said, I went in with low expectations, though. When I heard about this script about a year or so back, I thought it was an amazing idea. But, for the last few weeks, word of it's flaws and plot holes has gotten around. It wouldn't hurt Shyamalan to get a little assistance in doctoring some of his scripts. And that is the movies major flaw. It was a great idea, poorly executed. It could've been his best, in my opinion, but too much hype and a little arrogance on Shyamalan's part place it just below his first three efforts in the genre and right above Lady in the Water and The Village."

If you commented negatively on this movie you are ignorant. Night's movies so good in the fact that the horror of the movie is not knowing and that scares people. That is why I liked the movie.

"hadar-20","8","2","9","15 June 2008"," M. Night strikes back: My theory of The Happening
","While watching this movie and being rocked back and forth between brilliant suspense and horror and campy comedy, I became convinced of one thing:<br/><br/>Shayamalan is angry.<br/><br/>What he did is basically this: He made a B movie about killer plants. A timely and Eco-friendly theme, no doubt, in this day and age of global warming and pollution. But more than that, I think this is his answer to all his critics, and I'm surprised that the critics didn't get it.<br/><br/>We already saw glimpses of that in the character of the film critic in Lady In The Water. But here M. Night is in full ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore"" state of mind. What with the Lady In The Water debacle and the book that came after that, basically painting him as an ego-maniac. Now, I don't know the guy, but I know he's a brilliant, original, filmmaker. Lady in the Water was a misfire, but I'll take a Shayamalan misfire over many other by-the-numbers, boring, recycled movies. (Just look at Made of Honor, for Christ sake.)<br/><br/>What he did is a marvelous cinematic exercise. He made a ""bad"" film on purpose. That's right. The actors ham it shamelessly. The close-ups are at times ridiculous, especially in the second part. I have never seen any movie like this. It moves from moments of brilliance (the first 10 minutes) to near-camp (Whalberg in the class room).<br/><br/>There's this crazy old lady... Shayamalan isn't in this film, but I think this lady personifies his state of mind just as well.<br/><br/>And of course, the final masterstroke is the twist. The twist is there is no twist. It just ends. This was most surly done on purpose and knowingly. Shayamalan needed to lower the impossible expectations. The critics are waiting for him to fall. Again. So he makes this movie, and he makes it in such a way that he trumps everything. The complaints about his plots, about his twists, about the over-sentimentality. (Wahlberg actually breaks down and cries several times in the course of the film.)<br/><br/>The real mystery here is how he got, or rather, convinced Mark Wahlberg, an accomplished actor, to give such a campy performance. (the kid in the film is the best actress of them all. Again, I believe, on purpose. She's the innocent of the piece).<br/><br/>The Happening is also very violent and scary. It's also very funny and again, campy. The dialog, the performances. I don't know how to describe this film. Again, It's nothing like I've ever seen. It's a filmmaker fighting back the criticism and simultaneously making a disturbing horror film... which is also a spoof of his own style!<br/><br/>This guy is insane. Bravo."
"kgbellinger24","7","2","9","15 June 2008"," Great Thriiler w/o character.
","The Happening, was chilling, effective and misfired. The Happening delivered a fine and effective thriller with intense and creepy scenes, yet the the actual characters were miscast, poorly written, and empty. It's funny that Night specifically wrote the role of Elliot for Wahlberg, which gives one of his worst performances, if not the worst. I couldn't take him seriously as a science teacher, he seemed tacked on, his lines about science seemed very contrived and fake. That was probably the biggest misfire, because the antagonist is based and validated by Elliots lines, so when we can't take the teacher seriously how are we gonna take the event seriously? That's why people were never fully intrigued about the science and interpretation of the horrific event. However, the biggest and most tragic flaw about this movies is that Night never gave this movie character. The movie was simply a thriller with no good story. In fact this is what Night has derailed in his past two movies. He has the gift of genuine suspense, but this time he writes an empty story with empty characters. If this movie had a moving story about a family on the run, and a credible main character, this would be up there with the top disaster movies. However, that won't happen. <br/><br/>7/10"
"Psalm52","Null","2","9","15 June 2008"," I WAS a Whalberg-hater.
","Have been from the days when we each trained separately at Gold's gym in H'wood and he was well-known at the time ('96) as Markie Mark. He then kept a pretentious, steroid-taking posse around him CONSTANTLY that served to his every self-absorbed whim and would unnecessarily block other gym members from using certain weight-lifting equipment if his Lord Mark was using it. Total prima-donna behavior, but I commend Mark Whalberg (the actor) for choosing this role in ""The Happening."" Anything is an improvement over his generic, bad-boy shtick in violent films like Four Brothers, Shooter, and The Departed. I commend Whalberg for choosing a role that requires professional acting skills evident in his performance. He's well-supported by Leguizamo and the rest of the cast (in my humble opinion.) That aside, I enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's film. Great premise and definite nerve-wracking early sequences set the tone for what's to come. I hadn't seen one of Shyamalan's films since he directed ""Signs"" and I think he makes a worthy effort. I can quibble about the last five minutes. I prefer a downbeat ending like the scene in the field outside the desolate farm house which is eerie and the music is perfect. The last five minutes after that scene is an anti-climax.<br/><br/>At the screening I attended, this geek nerd exited the theater and loudly announced within everyone's ear-shot that he would personally punch Shyamalan on the nose for writing such a disjointed screenplay. I think that kind of opinion is too harsh. ""The Happening"" is NOT a brilliant horror film, but it certainly is atmospheric and nerve-wracking in several sequences."
"notorious_dmp","7","2","9","15 June 2008"," It Is Entertaining.
","Lets face it. Anyone who can get in front of a monitor can be an armchair critic. You can go on any movie site and listen to a bunch of people discuss dialogue, acting, etc. But who still goes to movies to go actually see a movie? M. Night is not going to be tossing out Oscar winning performances in a movie advertised in this manner. I liked the movie, and disliked the movie, and this is why.<br/><br/>First off, the movie get your brain moving a bit. There was some laughter at scenes that I don't really feel like spoiling although when/if you do see it, you will see. It seems that people, when they see a horror movie, they go and try to do the macho thing and nitpick at EVERYTHING just to deter themselves from the actual movie. The movie had some jumping parts, and some chilling parts, and some laughing parts. However if you watch closely and try to avoid some kind of corny dialogue (yes I contradicted myself but hear me out), you might leave the theater trying to comprehend what exactly went on. It's a thinking movie. Also, as seen in the previews, the construction site scene is just beyond unsettling. You'll love the sounds of corpses hitting pavement.<br/><br/>The bad thing? The ending. Another contradiction that I just made is that the ending leaves you thinking, but it also leaves you kind of empty. It lacked a good punch to put away some answers. It could have been played out better, but then again Im just an armchair critic, Im not getting paid to tell the director how to end it.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie to you? Only under two conditions. If you haven't been thwarted away by people/critics saying it was garbage or if you'd like to just go see a movie that kind of makes sense and kind of doesn't.<br/><br/>It is really up to you.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Firstly, this is not a HORRIBLE movie.<br/><br/>That said, it doesn't live up to the expectations of people who are fans of Shyamalan's better movies. My wife brought to my attention that people are overly critical of Shyamalan's works, and I agree. Had this movie been written, produced and directed by some guy we've never heard of, critics would herald ample praise for this movie.<br/><br/>Frankly, it was good and bad, so I'm giving it a ""more-on-the-plus-side"" 6 out of 10 stars. The movie has an astoundingly good premise. The more I heard about this movie, the more eagerly I awaited its debut. Even for the first half of the movie, the anticipation of action kept me from blinking for nearly an hour, despite the fact that the dialogue felt forced and unnatural. The suspense was nauseating. Ultimately, it got irritating. The suspense became pretentious and wholly unnecessary, not to mention redundant and predictably well-timed. From the middle of the movie to the end, the flick was completely devoid of surprise. The climax was completely not necessitated, making you feel like the protagonists deserve whatever they get! The ending itself was a waste of film. I could have walked out of the theater 7-8 minutes early and I'd be writing the exact same comment here.<br/><br/>I disagree with most of the ""The Happening's declivitous crappies typifies Shyamalan's directorial career"" comments I'm hearing.<br/><br/>If there's one good thing I would say about this movie, it's that it mystified you initially and frightened you by making you feel so isolated.<br/><br/>If there was something bad I would say, it's that this movie had SO MUCH POTENTIAL to be a really scary, crazy, unbelievable-but-tangible masterpiece, but it is what it is - a decent movie, but a real SNAFU when you look at what it could've been.<br/><br/>Final word: Props to Shyamalan for making a high-budget blockbuster movie that contained about 10 minutes of shots of trees and grass swaying in the wind. I hope you didn't pay too much for those ""special"" effects."
"TermlnatriX","6","2","9","14 June 2008"," Unintentional
","James Newton Howard's score is the best thing about this film. That isn't to say this film totally blows as the majority seems to say. No, this isn't worse than 10,000 B.C. it's tightly directed, and Shyamalan keeps the pace quick and snappy. The progression of events is fast, we get treated to bits of information every so often, music is brooding and fitting for this type of film. So what's wrong? Unintentional or intentional ""comedy"", I can't tell which for sure, but the fact that the stupidity outweighs 'intentional' and Mark Wahlberg pulling Nic Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" tells me this film suffers from bad writing and bad acting, making my conclusion to be - unintentional.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is a capable actor, but he's a parody here and he isn't alone. Maybe this is Shyamalan's fault, allowing this from his actors, or his overall direction of actors.<br/><br/>The ""shocking"" moments, are not all that shocking either. However, Shyamalan's utilization of the landscape is effective, and in my mind the 'greatest' suspense occurred during the very end of the film, which felt less comical and more hard-hitting.<br/><br/>All comedy aside, thinking back on this film, there is certainly a deeper layer that underlies the film. The closest comparison I could think of is The Mist."

The indication of something fatal approaching is the direction of wind  the trees shaking and the grass quavering. Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher, and he is on a run - from these unusual events - with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and his friend's girl child Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). To avoid death, Elliot tries scientific methodology of analysis, study, interpretation etc. but fails to understand the ways of these happenings. As mysteriously the happenings starts, they end also without any logic, science or reason.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie MNS brags about science, intelligence etc. and I was thinking what the hell  why is he showing off? Also MNS is upfront  in the beginning he presents the concept of the movie  Not all things can be understood by science and reason. That is the concept and the core of the movie.<br/><br/>Most people expect some cause and effect relationship. That is how our minds are trained. MNS presents the concept very casually in the beginning but follows it up diligently till the end. Did he fool the audience? NO. Only that audience who thought they were intelligent  but actually who are not intelligent enough to respect nature and natural events and happenings  did not get it.<br/><br/>The movie holds your attention from the beginning till the end. MNS has a great style of presenting his narrative  that engages, builds, and challenges the audiences. Great stuff! He is a master of the medium and his concepts.<br/><br/>In an interview he told that this movie is simple  it does not have a twist in the ending. And there is none. Fools mights consider this movie a fraud, but it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel and Ashlyn Sanchez have played their part as per the role. The narrative is simple, but edge of the sit.<br/><br/>Full marks to MNS! If you have not liked the movie, you must be the one who is falsely considering him/herself intelligent  a scientific person, who requires answers for everything. Let me tell you  there are no answers for many things in life and nature. Earlier learned the better for your intelligence! (Stars 7 out of 10)"

","Yes, it is an awful awful movie, but really I think it's like a big (pardon my language) 'screw you!' to the movie industry. It had its frightening moments and funny moments but it was really a parody of everything. There is a very interesting warning given off. It was so terribly acted by very good actors that it all most makes me think that it was made for people to realize it's exact message and purpose.<br/><br/>There were parts where I was just think 'what on earth is going on?' Markie Mark does not act like this! Also there was no twist, I don't believe there was a cameo, and there was too much gore for Shyamalan, I really think it was a film made with a message and I loved it!"

","Absolutely truly, THE HAPPENING IS NOT HAPPENING.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalhan (sp) lost his freaky spunk after Signs. This was quite a good idea. What if nature turned on us? By why make it so boring? Add more suspense, and less of Zooey Deschanel's big eyes every few seconds.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is always pleasant and awesome actor in my opinion, but I hate him for accepting this crap. He did well with what he had to work with. The cast isn't that bad with John Leguizamo and his daughter in the film Ashlyn Sanchez are great, & Spencer Breslin is great to see (last I remember was The Kid).<br/><br/>I don't understand the R-rating. They were maybe 2 gruesome scenes at most, involving a man impaling himself with a lawnmower & a guy getting his arm ripped off by a lion. Two kids did get brutally shot with a shotgun as well, but nonetheless, a R-rating? Please.<br/><br/>Enough of my ranting, I am just disappointed in M. Night Shyamalhan for wasting my time."

","Following the inanity of the borderline train wreck that was 2006's ""Lady in the Water,"" writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan rebounded in a very big way with his next film, 2008's ""The Happening."" His contribution to the type of eco-horror film that was all the rage in the 1960s and '70s--I'm thinking of such films as 1963's ""The Birds,"" 1972's ""Frogs,"" 1977's ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" and 1978's ""Swarm""...not to mention the little-seen 1976 Spanish classic ""Who Can Kill a Child?""--the film seems to have divided his fan base and resulted in a bona fide critical flop of sorts. Indeed, the woman who I sit next to at work, a big admirer of film auteur Shyamalan, hated the film, although she professes a love for ""Lady in the Water,"" a picture that I found to be both ridiculous and downright stupid. Go figure. THIS is why there is both vanilla AND chocolate out there, folks!<br/><br/>In the film in question, what is at first perceived to be a bioterrorist attack occurs in NYC's Central Park, where droves of people are compelled to commit suicide in horrendous fashions. We then zoom in on Philadelphia schoolteacher Elliot Moore (very well played by the hugely likable Mark Wahlberg), who, along with his wife Alma (the pretty and kooky Zooey Deschanel), best friend and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his adorable daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), leaves the city by train after a similar attack occurs in their vicinity. Eventually, Julian strikes off on his own to search for his wife in Princeton, NJ, leaving his daughter in charge of the Moores, while it soon becomes apparent that this is NOT an instance of bioterror that has been afflicting the entire Northeast after all, but rather, a bizarre case of nature gone amok. The very trees are emitting a chemical--perhaps in an instance of self-defense--that has started to compel humans to do themselves in! (This action does not strike me at this particular moment as being all that far-fetched, afflicted as I am today with allergy symptoms brought on by tree pollen!) The Moores and Jess head into the wilds of the Pennsylvania countryside to escape the widespread violence, only to fetch up at the home of an isolated woman, one Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley)...a demented biddy who, in retrospect, strikes the viewer as a warm-up for the demented oldsters in Shyamalan's 2015 film ""The Visit."" But even this isolated locale does not seem to be a safe haven against the arboreal threat that has suddenly arisen....<br/><br/>Amazingly, ""The Happening"" was nominated for no less than four Golden Raspberry Awards--for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Wahlberg), Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. In ""Empire"" magazine's list of the 50 Worst Films of All Time, the film came in at the #8 spot! Are these people kidding?!?! Have they never seen such films as ""Blood Freak,"" ""Dracula vs. Frankenstein,"" ""The Astro-Zombies,"" ""Horror of the Blood Monsters,"" ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" and ""The Worm Eaters""? THESE are truly horrendous and ineptly made pictures, worthy of anybody's contempt. But ""The Happening""? Really? This film is expertly made and well acted by its cast of appealing players. It also looks terrific on the screen, is loaded with any number of suspenseful moments, is laced with pleasing bits of humor (my favorite: Elliot talking in fear to what turns out to be a plastic plant), and is capable of stunning the viewer by dint of a pleasing number of shock moments (such as the sight of one man offering himself up to the giant cats in the Philadelphia zoo, a young woman casually sticking a rather long hairpin into her neck, and the truly awesome spectacle of a half dozen construction workers blithely diving off the top of a building to their doom). The film is nowhere near as bloody as the 2001 Japanese stunner ""Suicide Club"" (how could it be?) but yet manages to startle and impress, nevertheless. And if the film does not provide one of Shyamalan's patented twist endings, it yet contrives to wind up on a note of not-so-unexpected pessimism. Like the Hitchcock film referenced above, a clear-cut explanation for the bizarre events in the film is never vouchsafed, and we are left to be content with these words of wisdom from the Wahlberg character: ""There are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of Nature."" And perhaps not so coincidentally, ""respectful awe"" was the feeling that this viewer was left with by the conclusion of this hugely impressive and effective film. Very much recommended...."

","The Happening has many of the big budget Hollywood visuals you expect to see, but everything behind it is so disappointing. I can't really say anything new about, so I'll be brief: Idea, actually pretty cool. Which actually makes the rest of it even more disappointing. Script: terrible. Bad dialogue. Boring plotting. Improbable situations. Acting, horrible. The script is partly to blame, but I think there's lots of blame to go around for this one. I have a big ""screen crush"" on Zooey, but other than being absolutely adorable she contributes nothing (she's not a great actress to begin with, so I guess this is what I expect). Fortunately for her, she's not the worst one. Wahlberg, I don't even know where to start. <br/><br/>If the concept has any draw to you, skip this movie and just use your imagination.

The science fiction plot you could read and sum up in a sentence and might entertain you for about 30 seconds, but to make a movie out of it and drag it out really isn't that strong of a concept.<br/><br/>Spoiler: The concept is that plants are attacking humans as a warning to them, at no point do plants scare you enough to mildly entertain you, and this is watching is on a huge movie screen.

It wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, there were some stuff I found disappointing. First, the film had a decent first half but started slowing down its pace the second half where. Another thing is didn't like was the characters, there wasn't a whole lot of character development throughout the film or anything interesting about them. Mark Wahlberg did an okay job as his character, the rest I wasn't quite satisfied with. What this film needs is more inspiring characters and maybe a better plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the film. The whole premise of how everyone gets chased by a virus that causes them to become suicidal was quite interesting (and a bit weird some ways). To be honest, I'm not so sure why this film got so many negative reviews from audiences or even the critics. I think this is worth watching, especially if you're a fan of supernatural thrillers."

One of my favorite M. Night films.<br/><br/>I thought the event was far scariest than most things in films, the idea of people stopping, talking in gibberish, and than killing themselves in mass was chilling, and this is one of the few films that I sometimes don't want to look at because its scary, and I've seen Cannibal Holocaust more than this.<br/><br/>Mark Walberg's acting is comedic, but very likable, I don't know if he's suppose to be funny but he is, I like him a lot in this movie, but I didn't like how they made his wife into sort of a bad person, and Eliot so innocent. It's kinda bad writing for him to be so perfect and innocent and than make his wife into the bad guy.<br/><br/>My guess is M. Night wrote this film when going through the same thing in his relationship and ""The Event"" is a metaphor for what he felt was happening to his wife.<br/><br/>So it's kinda biased from a relationship point. I wouldn't have a problem with it if Eliot didn't seem to have any flaws other than being a loveble goof.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is pretty great, and John Leguzamo does a good job as usual, he is one of my favorite actors, and he doesn't half-ass this role, but he ain't getting an award.<br/><br/>It was creepy, thrilling, if your attracted to the idea of people committing suicide in mass than you should like this, but if you can tolerate Japanese movies, Suicide Club is better but 1000 times weirder.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, but a lot better than most horror movies, disaster movies, action movies. It's superior to most crap people call good these days, if you're into this and you have a liking for M. Night like I do.<br/><br/>My really score for this is a 7.8 because I'd buy it and I enjoy watching it, but maybe others will think it's stupid, so watch the trailer and if it looks stupid to you don't bother but if it seems like your cup of tea give it a try."

He doesn't project a big enough presence. If he calmed down, he could actually do better than this high school drama level acting.<br/><br/>The odd deaths are somewhat distracting. I get that it's a big selling point but it's a silly cartoon. It becomes a matter of how to make dying crazy. I like more the confusion of not knowing.

","I rented this movie from Family Video (great place, you should go there), because I saw it on FX, but only bits and pieces. So I rented it and brought it home, and watched, and enjoyed it. Come on people! What's with all the hate? I don't understand. The only thing this movie did to M. Night was increase his number of haters, but he still made it anyway and that is one of the reasons I am a fan. He did put a spin on the disaster movie genre though, and these days those just get really repetitive and clichéd. So you know the storyline, right? Yeah. So, I thought the movie was very good, and has a lot of stars in it. Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and the little girl, Jess, I have no doubt she could make it big someday. This movie was shocking, disgusting, disturbing, and awesome all at the same time, which isn't really that common today. Usually it's just the first three, and not the latter. The first part of the movie really held all of the gross and disgusting parts, and the second part of the movie contains the real storyline. The movie is good all the way through, so don't get me wrong, but all of the _______ happens in the first part. Yes, I did the line on purpose. There are a plethora of awesome scenes in this movie, all put in perfect sequence. M. Night Shyamalan is a fantastic director, and he directed Signs, The Village, The Sixth Sense, those are his most well known movies. I think this movie keeps the awesome streak made by his movies going, and others don't, but I really think if you like surreal movies you would thoroughly enjoy this movie, as I did. I was absorbed in the movie completely, and I was entranced by the awesomeness, sort of. That was kind of weird. It was very realistic most of the time. It was surreal. I was thinking sometimes, ""Did that just happen?"" Another thing I can say about this movie is that you shouldn't trust the reviews. The reviews trashed this movie pretty much all the time. STUPID CRITICS! No offense Owen Gleiberman and Joe Neumaier, I kind of like your reviews most of the time. And Joe, how could you trash Pacific Rim?

This movie was so diabolically pointless, self-serving and self-indulgent that words could never do it justice. Such a fall from grace from the man who brought us The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable""<br/><br/>In many ways, that sums this film up perfectly. On a second viewing, an almost three years later, I feel that I have just a little more to say, but none of which is particularly good, except for the fact that I have increased my original one star/candle review to three out the maximum of ten! Shyamalan was a rising talent and now he has fallen far from grace, especially after the flop that was The Last Airbender. In this film he managed, whether by some misguided design or just by poor direction, to get some of the most amateurish performances out his cast imaginable.<br/><br/>I mean, I know that I'm hardly Mark Wahlberg's greatest advocate but he's still miles better than this, as is his counterpart, Zooey Deschanel, who both put in embarrassingly poor performances, but not just bad, but something that I would expect to see in a church hall! This was amateur all the way, with the only saving grace being the otherwise precise Shyamalan direction. But that's not to say that it wasn't boring or that he was directing a pointless narrative. The concept was slightly interesting but handled in such a ridiculously cack-handed and misjudged manner that I doubt anyone would dare suggest this idea again, let alone finance of film it.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ""Twist"", if you would call it that, but it is original, I grant you that, but interesting enough to support a movie?

","After the East Coast states are suddenly and inexplicably hit with a rash of mass suicides, two high school teachers and their loved ones come to believe there are neurotoxins in the air, being spread about by the winds, and valiantly try to escape. Prolific writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has crafted yet another intensely unsettling scenario (this one with more violent undercurrents than what is typical for the filmmaker), yet--once again--his conclusions are not half as interesting as his set-up, which ultimately leads to dissatisfaction. Shyamalan loses touch with his audience, not by producing theories and later disputing those theories, but by failing to go deeper within his own conception. ""The Happening"" dribbles away piece by piece, cut off from suspense by a rather staid sense of not-extraordinary dynamics (which include the character conflicts). Mark Wahlberg keeps a cool, rational head and works hard to convince us he's a baffled Everyman caught up in a panic-ridden situation; the character is constricted by the writing--he isn't allowed to branch out and take on an added dimension--however Wahlberg performs well under these restraints, despite a tendency to overwork his facial muscles. Cast as his unhappy wife, Zooey Deschanel's wide-eyed performance would seem dotty and out-of-place under any circumstance. The film is narrow in scope and doesn't improve by the third act, which may be a reason why Shyamalan wrote in the additional plumes of showoff bloodletting (such as a lawnmower incident which is held too long). He keeps the attention all right, but not in admirable ways. ** from ****"

","The tranquil setting of Central Park becomes a nightmare as people come to abrupt stops in the Literary Walk. The wind plays on the trees and there is an eerie sense of doom in the air. To make matters worse, all over the city we watch in horror as construction workers throw themselves from scaffolding to their deaths.<br/><br/>The scene changes to a Philadelphia high school where science teacher, Elliot Moore, is trying to interest his students into the lesson at hand. There is an interruption from the principal because she wants the staff to know about the alarming emergency in New York. Elliot and his wife Alma, are planning to leave the city with his friend Julian and his family. On the train they learn that Philadelphia has been undergoing the same sort of problem, a phenomenon that most of the East Coast is experiencing.<br/><br/>Although there is no sight of panic, the passengers are alarmed. Alma's cell phone has been getting calls from someone called Joey, which she doesn't answer them. The train stops in a small town in Pennsylvania. The passengers flock to the only diner nearby, where the patrons learn about horrible things happening in the city they left behind. What to do? Julian, who is traveling with a small daughter, Jess, is concerned because he hasn't heard from his wife who was on a trip to Princeton. He decides to leave Jess with the Moores and go on his own. Elliot gets a ride from a strange man that wants to stop at his home where he has a green house to pick up things for a trip West, as all the announcements in the news are asking people to do. It appears whatever is happening is concentrated to the Easternmost side of the country.<br/><br/>The strange thing finally catches with Elliot and the people he is traveling. There is no place to turn to be safe. Elliot decides to divide into small groups and try to stay away from the blowing wind. Elliot, Alma and Jess get shelter with one strange lady that lives alone in an old house. Unfortunately, what they feared is getting to them and there is no way to turn.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyalaman, the director of ""The Happening"" has a passion for telling stories like this one, where mysterious things always happen, as is this the case in this tale of a strange force that seems to come from the trees as the wind plays with them. In a way, it's like nature's revenge for what we humans have done to the environment. The director, who wrote the screenplay, has fallen out of favor lately because of his misfires. ""The Happening"", on the other hand, is like a cautionary tale, beautifully photographed by Taj Fujimoto in which the awesome beauty of the Pennsylvania country is at the center of the action. The film will no doubt infuriate some people, but it is not a total failure. Although a bit far fetched, one can't dismiss it completely because it tells a good story in its 91 minutes running time.<br/><br/>The best excuse to watch the movie is the work of Mark Wahlberg, who is perfect for Elliot Moore. This actor, usually seen in action movies, proves he is a natural in his take of the science teacher who understands the dangers he is facing. Zooey Deschanel's role doesn't allow her to do much. John Leguizamo, playing against type, has some good moments. Betty Buckley appears as the mysterious Mrs. Jones."

","It's not easy to criticize someone who seems like such a genuine nice guy, but it's hard to believe that the same person who wrote ""The Sixth Sense"" also wrote this movie. But then, the only movie that Shyamalan has written since ""The Sixth Sense"" that was original and cohesive and intriguing was ""The Village."" He seems to be a classic example of what happens to many talented artists once they snag the big bra$$ ring.<br/><br/>This movie starts off well, although the opening is suspiciously similar to that of Stephen King's novel ""Cell."" The cast is extremely likable. Mark Wahlberg plays against his usual urban tough guy type, playing a milksoppy quasi-hero, which is very appropriate for this milksoppy movie.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo stretches a little. Zoey Deschanel, unfortunately, loses her trademark quirky charm in her cardboard characterization of a wife on the verge of straying--a subplot that arises through ponderous dialog, rather than action.<br/><br/>This rather lame dramatic device is an early warning sign that Shyamalan is pulling his creative punches once again, and the last two acts of the movie have all the grit and pizazz of a 1970s TV movie. Actually that's unfair--to superior TV movies like ""Duel"" and ""Trilogy of Terror."" <br/><br/>The characters literally meander through a thin storyline with a monotonously obvious plot. At its worst moments it grinds to a sodden halt, like the scene where Leguizamo has bummed an ""urgent"" ride, and the driver waits for what seems like an hour while Leguizamo delivers a valedictory goodbye speech to his chums.<br/><br/>Shyamalan needs to stop aspiring to direct ""horror"" films, he is obviously too genteel for a genre that has spawned the ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" and ""Ring"" and ""Living Dead"" franchises. Even bloodless masterpieces like Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" would be lucky to satisfy a mass audience today, and ""The Happening"" is far from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Considering the somewhat laudable attempt at delivering a message (which is old news, thanks to Al Gore) to the masses, the ""surprise"" ending is simply trite, and only makes us hope he wasn't setting up a sequel. The Gaia Theory deserves better.<br/><br/>Catch it for free if you can.

","M Night Shyamalan is known for making slow moving dark masterpieces like The Sixth Sense, Signs & Unbreakable. His movies ""The Village"" & ""Lady in the Water"" were pretty average ones. But with ""The Happening"" we are watching Shyamalan's worst movie till date. I dunno whether he was on a tight budget or what, but he has completely messed up this time.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of this flick were pretty descent if not good. Things were moving in an orderly fashion. We could sense that the virus is spreading and is slowly and slowly becoming airborne. We could see the remaining residents running away from the infected zones. But what follows in the next 60 minutes is something very disappointing, something for which you won't have thought while paying for your tickets. The director completely loses his grip on the narration and starts to deviate towards various alternatives instead of concentrating on the way the things were being described before. The part in which the couple and the child reach the house of an old woman was completely out of senses. It was put in an abrupt manner in the best part of the climax. The ending of the movie makes no sense at all for at the least Shyamalan fans.<br/><br/>If you are a hardcore Shyamalan fan don't watch The Happening (even if you come across any positive review). You will go insane and scratch your head at the credits ""What the hell was that?"" Let this film die in peace."

","Mark Whalberg had two films in 2008. They both sucked. I mean, they both blew. One caused Max. Pain and the other one was happening. But not much is happening in The Happening. The Happening is a film that starts off good but quickly falls apart. In every M. Night Shamylan film there is a twist in the end of the film. There is no twist in this. The whole film is just a bunch of people running from wind. Anyways, to the plot.<br/><br/>The film starts off in Central Park. Out of nowhere, a woman stabs herself and it doesn't even hurt her. After that, everyone starts to kill themselves. Supposedly, the wind is causing these people to commit suicide. Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel star as The Moores, an estranged couple who are having problems. Eventually, they are also running for the wind.<br/><br/>Let me point some good things out about this disaster. I love Zooey Deschanel and I like Mark Whalberg and I feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for them because they're in this film. After not so great films like Lady in the Water and The Village, M. Night Shamylan brings us his worst film yet. I really wanted to see this film and all I got was an incredibly disappointing mess. The Happening isn't the worst, but it's one of them. <br/><br/>There is nothing to this film at all. I was excited for this film because it's a shamylan film. But The Happening really did suck. Please don't rent it. Don't pick it up at a rental store. It would be a waste of your four bucks. This wasn't the worst film of 2008, but it truly was one of them.<br/><br/>The Happening:*/****"

","i have liked shyamalans movies so far, thought sixth sense was overrated and thought lady in the water wasn't as bad as people were making it out to be. just like with lady in the water, the happenings idea and story are good, but something is missing. in this case it feels like he came up with the idea for the story and then ran out of ideas when it came time to continue the movie past the initial reveal of whats happening. i know its not shyamalans style but instead of people killing themselves it would have been better if people were killing each other. instead we got people killing themselves and since everyone offed themselves now the survivors are running around from what appears to be... the wind. a large portion of this film was just people running from nothing really, they didn't now what they were running from for most of it and there wasn't an actual thing to chase them.<br/><br/>mark wahlbergs stab at more ""dramatic"" acting didn't turn out so well. his answer for dramatic acting was raising his eyebrows and or squinting or ending a lot of his sentences with an upward tone in his voice. he felt VERY out of place in this movie. i hate to say it but his place is in more action like roles where he doesn't have to be dramatic. either way im anxious to see what shyamalan comes up with next."
"yomama117","6","1","3","5 February 2009"," Why So Negative?
","I think people are so harsh on this movie simply because they raised their expectations through the roof. This may sound obvious but consider the trailer. It just shows you people dying (seemingly) everywhere, literally just dropping dead, no one knows what's going on, hang on to your hats kiddies its the apocalypse! There are SO many things you can do with that. I read somewhere that this should've gone the way of Andromeda Strain (extraterrestrial bacteria for those in the know) but really, if someone came up to any of you and said ""the premise is people everywhere are dropping dead. Make a story. GO!"" I guarantee you'd lose count of all the ideas that spring forth. Aliens, terrorists, government experiments, some kind of doomsday weapon, take your pick. Moving along, the idea that it's nature itself that's responsible (and is out to get us) isn't directly obvious and let's face it, not among the most exciting. If instead of the theatrical trailer, Fox came out and said ""look we're making a movie about killer trees and it's got Mark Wahlberg"" how many people would get excited? Not very many. So instead you've got one of the most kickass trailers released that summer but instead of a proper apocalypse, you've got some creepy scenes and and a Greenpeace message. So yes, if you were expecting Dawn of the Dead sans zombies that sounds lame as hell. So put aside Body Snatchers and I am Legend for now, and I'm fairly positive The Happening will start to shine better.<br/><br/>That being said, I won't deny they dropped the ball. I'm not going to get into debates on how good/poor the acting is. I've found that critics (both professional and the parent's basement type) use that as a first-stop shop on the road to flick bashing. Yes some people are abysmal at emotional portrayal and should leave the business but for the most part actors don't usually place on the extreme ends of the spectrum. Bottom line is, people who hate the movie will bash the acting, while people who enjoyed it (or are fans of the actors involved) will defend it. Thus it may be a waste of time debating it.<br/><br/>No I want to focus on the story itself. I felt it was well done until about the middle. Yes as many reviews have already pointed out the whole problems with the plant neurotoxin and the wind and also the immediate (and often creative) suicides that followed exposure detract from the overall atmosphere of the movie. It's scarier when you believe people just stop moving and drop dead, as opposed to seeing the suicides and going ""wait a minute, what just happened?"" If you want to scare people, you don't want them to question your horror creation. You may want them to beg and plead that it can't be true sure, but stopping to debunk it scientifically? Not the way to go.<br/><br/>If that was just a fumble however, the final clumsy toss-up comes in the scene where Elliot and Alma and Jess leave the relative protection of the houses and meet on the field. Bam! There goes any credibility the characters and the movie had left. No more marriage insecurity, no more concern for the kid, no more concern for personal safety, just grade A corn and cheese at its finest. Then I guess they remembered they had a movie to finish and decided to reset everything back to normal a mere three months after how many million died? Not to be accused of a Hollywood ending, the final scenes may have well been tacked on at the beginning because nothing was happening. Just boring everyday life. The France scene tried to re-establish the fear and the message of the movie but by then it was too late.<br/><br/>So what's the point of this rambling post? This movie had an awesome premise and unbelievable potential, but instead dumbed down into a decent, fairly creepy start with a terrible ending. Is it amazing? Not really. Is it the ultimate mess-up, the most idiotic thing to happen to the movie industry since Batman and Robin? Probably not."

","I thought the overall concept for this film was brilliant and I still enjoyed it because of the questions it leaves you with. I'm just not sure how the same person who wrote Sixth Sense and The Village could have written this.<br/><br/>The problems for me were mainly in the dialogue, some of the things Mark Wahlberg said he just wouldn't, I mean really. And the woman on the phone to her daughter in Princeton - would the daughter really not have mentioned until asked halfway through the conversation that everybody outside was dead?? I also don't understand why Zooey's character was made to be so weak and flawed, it was never resolved - I mean characters start out that way usually so they can be redeemed through what happens. But I don't think she was, unless it was in her caring for the young girl, but if so I missed it.<br/><br/>And I also had a problem with the fact that the main characters were never hit with this deadly whatever-it-was, even though they were running around outside for most of the movie, instead of getting inside where it would obviously be more safe.<br/><br/>M. Night perhaps needs to have somebody proofread and edit his material in future. He has great ideas, but lately the practical application of them is lousy. If I were a writing teacher, I'd make him do it again."
"lambiepie-2","5","1","3","1 December 2008"," This could have been good, I think.
","I am probably of the small minority who thought that M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" was a so-so, highly predictable film and that ""Signs"" was a thriller at his dark comedic best. ""The Village ""didn't bother me so much and his other films, well, I just can't say anything about them others haven't already said. So here comes ""The Happening"" and I've gotta tell ya, the ball really, really dropped on this one. It could have been one of his better films.<br/><br/>Who's to blame? Well... ya never know. When I can see that a story and plot is on its way somewhere and then goes South, its so easy to blame the writer, producer and director (in this case, M. Night Shyamalan for all.) But nowadays, I give just as equal blame to the studio (financier), test audiences and distributor as well.<br/><br/>The first 1/2 hour to 40 minutes was a little dark even for M. Night Shyamalan but I enjoyed watching this side unravel. I loved the mystery - What was going on? What was it? Then I began to notice the things that bugged me. One thing I would not have done was leave the classroom background and try to get into the ""family life"" of a few of these folks. It didn't work. I though sticking with the young adults would have been more interesting.<br/><br/>But the biggest thing that bothered me was finding out what the problem was. I was incredibly let down. Not because I didn't believe that problem wasn't a possibility... it is. But because of the dark way M. Night Shyamalan laid it out in the beginning, he wimped out in showing the audience ""what it was"". Ruined the film for me.<br/><br/>I agree with my friends who had also seen the film that it needed to stay with its dark & violent tone. But if so, therein poses a problem for M. Night Shyamalan. How to make what is happening go from supernatural to...well..horrific scary. And if he could, how not to make it look so silly and get the point across. Here's where he should have gone back to ""Signs"" for a possible answer. That point may also lie with Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" of a formula of which I also thought could have help him out of the supernatural/horrific problem of something we never considered a threat before.<br/><br/>I pondered the almost silly suggestion of one of my friends who thought he should go ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" forest kinda thing, while another one of my friends added, ""Well at least he could have a rogue philodendron the little girl brought home earlier that gave clues as to what was to come, or some ivy crawled up the side of the house and then you see folks dead."" I laughed at that, but there is a point.<br/><br/>The film isn't horrible, it just doesn't hit the mark intended. You may be left thinking there is more that could be done to get the point across since it began so ""not"" of the M. Night Shyamalan formula. But I can also see the challenges in making ""what it is""...believable and memorable to an audience. Me...? Well, I would have went with the mysterious crawling ivy."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","28 November 2008"," Overall a pretty poor movie. Interesting concept, poorly executed.
","Night Shyamalan struck gold with ""The Sixth Sense"" and perhaps because of its success he believes he has the Midas touch in film. But once again he clearly proves that he doesn't. To me the concept of this movie was interesting and unique, but Shyamalan is proving to be a rather poor script writer. The dialog often is silly, and there is no smooth flow to the whole movie.<br/><br/>The two main characters are Mark Wahlberg as Elliot Moore and Zooey Deschanel as his wife Alma Moore. They do fine, especially Whalberg, but Shyamalan didn't give them much to work with.<br/><br/>Suddenly something very strange happens, in New York's Central Park. Whole groups of people stop in their tracks, then one might walk backwards for a short distance, and then do something totally out of character to kill himself or herself. This is to portray their normal senses being short-circuited.<br/><br/>Through the news media panic starts to grip the east coast then eventually the nation and the rest of the world. Is it terrorist activity? Is it government testing gone awry? Prophetically, in the high school class that Elliot teaches he makes the point that sometimes bad things happen in nature for which there is no explanation. He used bees mysteriously dying as an example. Later a farmer used a different example, where a tobacco plant can sent out signals to a particular insect to help the plant protect itself. The implication throughout the movie is that plants all around us perceive a threat from groups of people and are sending out a trace chemical that causes our brains to be short-circuited.<br/><br/>Interesting concept, but a poorly executed movie."
"Sister_Spooky","3","1","3","27 October 2008"," Weak, weak, weak.
","M. Night failed in his attempt to make a darker film than his previous. The death toll is higher and the violence is bloodier, but there is no palpable threat. It lacked the air of paranoia that makes his films so gripping. The plot ""twist"" is yawn worthy and never really peaks. At the heart of Night's other films is always an interesting family dynamic, but there is hardly any character development in this film. The plot begins before we get any insight into the lives of the people we are expected to sympathize with. To be honest, I didn't care if they lived or died. Moreover, Night compiled a group of usually vibrant actors, and somehow got them all to deliver flat and unnatural performances. This film is a total disappointment and has absolutely no redeeming qualities."

","I stated that the review contains spoilers, but to be fair the movie was spoiled long before I typed up this review. It was spoiled before they even started filming.<br/><br/>Imagine this, In the US in 2008; plants are mad at humans for hurting the environment so they spray poison in the air that makes you commit suicide. Now, imagine that Mark Wahlberg is running away from the poison filled wind (no, I'm serious, running from the wind) in a field, with some kids and his annoying wife. Mark and his lame crew run faster than the wind apparently, because they find a hut in the woods where some old bag lives. They shack up with her for a day and she yells at Mark Wahlberg for looking at her doll? What? The old woman starts gardening, then turns into a zombie for some reason and kills herself. Also, at some point two 8 year olds get shot for attempting a B&E at the wrong house. If you have imagined the paragraph above, then you just saw ""The Happening"" and saved yourself an hour and a half.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was when John Leguiziamo tells us he'll be right back after he gets his wife out of the poison. If you can not burst out laughing during this exchange, you're a better man than me. At this point in the movie we know his time is severely limited, because he says good bye for 2 full minutes. Unfortunately he should have spent the time he wasted saying goodbye on doing something cool, because as it turns out, he had a total of 3 minutes to live. Unfortunately, his death as well as every other death in the movie, (except for one out of place lion mauling, which owned) was pretty much done off screen like a made for TV USA movie. <br/><br/>Finally, the end of the movie is probably one of the lamest ends to a movie that I can think of. Really Mark? You need to hug your wife right now, outside in the poison field? Really? I wish they died. <br/><br/>Rent shooter instead."

This movie starts out fast and very interesting so you can get right to the action, but it ends very disappointingly. Although, the ending wasn't all that happy, it was mostly happy ending bull.<br/><br/>A family is on the run from an incident that no one knows of. It kills everyone by making everyone freeze, some walk backwards for a while, and all hell breaks loose. They kill themself. Strange idea for a movie? Well, read on. A teacher who is part of that family are one of the teachers dismissed from the school. They have to evacuate. Leave the city. But as a science teacher, he knows what goes on. It's the plants, too many people can start hell. So that's what's helpful in their fight. In the end, it's all over as soon as it had begun but then starts again in the other country. But right before you see that it starts in another country, you see all this boringness about the family now has a baby, a child they ran with is now their daughter and is now going back to school, yada yada yawn.<br/><br/>So, this movie is pretty good, but if you are one of those bloody, love the endings where everybody dies kind of horror person, you will be disappointed.

","'The Happening' contains blatant ideologies of global warming and is trying to warn the American audience of the effects of global warming by scaring them into submission. I wouldn't go so far as to say this film is scary in any way, frankly it is poorly thought about and the idea that the wind and effectively climate change is chasing you is appalling. Also i don't think the thought that it makes you kill yourself is at all scary so why make a horror that just doesn't scare? Well the film maker has tried to warn the audience about the effects of global warming. In my opinion the idea behind this was a good one conveying messages through the medium of film normally works BUT the ideologies must be much more subtle and not forced upon the viewer. The film concentrates far too much on conveying it powerful ideologies and not on the generic and entertainment side of the film.<br/><br/>There are many obvious flaws in this film and i did not find it entertaining, i think that for this film to have worked much of it would need to have been changed. It needs to be more generically conventional, in fact it is so generically confusing that it is hard to completely tell what the film is trying to be.

","First some background. Loved Sixth Sense. Unbreakable is one of my favourite movies ever! Signs was a disappointment. Hated Village and Lady in the Water was only just OK. I stopped seeing MNS movies in theatres after Village. And after Happening, I will still be waiting for video.<br/><br/>The movie fails in so many ways; let me address them one at a time. The first most glaring reason is its main star, Mark Wahlberg. While I have liked him in some roles in the past, he completely fails to bring to life this goofy science teacher. I don't know why MNS chose him, because I never would have. While Walhberg is good sometimes, he has a very small range, and this was just not the right role for him.<br/><br/>Secondly the gore. Completely unnecessary, especially as I feel as though MNS is just not comfortable with it, which is why all his movies in the past have been very PG-13. All the gory and non-gory scenes happened in the same way as MNS treats all his scary scenes. It cuts away at the last moment, or the view is obstructed somehow, etc. Which I have always loved, as MNS is very good at crafting a scary scene. But here it was as though the producers were like ""Ok MNS, your movies are failing and we need to tap into a different market, so just add in a couple gory scenes and we'll see if we can get the horror crowd."" So in the end, we get a patchwork effort were only some of the death scenes were gory, and they were usually very poorly done, and still, honestly, kinda tame (nothing like Grindhouse).<br/><br/>Lastly the story. All I can say is that it just wasn't executed properly. There was too much emphasis on trying to explain everything, while trying to maintain a theme that you can't explain everything. And the explanation was not satisfying at all. And the scary/death scenes were...well...just not that scary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately MNS is slowly becoming a two-hit wonder."
"rparham","5","1","3","23 July 2008"," An open letter to M. NIght Shyamalan
","Dear Mr. Shyamalan, <br/><br/>First, let me preface by saying that I am no basher of yours. I saw and enjoyed your first film, The Sixth Sense, and even managed to avoid learning the twist despite the fact that I didn't see it until it was on home video. I thought your Unbreakable was wildly underrated, being the first ""realistic"" comic book movie that many have forgotten. Signs is, to date, your strongest work, in my opinion, featuring a palpable sense of dread and unease to keep you on the edge of your seat. I didn't hate The Village, although it was hardly your shining moment. However, when you made Lady in the Water, it did seem to be an exercise in self-indulgence more than anything else. Sorry, I call them as I see them.<br/><br/>I state all that to let you know where I am coming from, when I say that The Happening just isn't cutting it. It is not terrible. I have seen terrible, and The Happening ain't it. However, The Happening does come up wanting quite significantly, in many respects, some that are just impossible to overlook.<br/><br/>I will give you points for an interesting premise, in which people in major cities in the US Northeast suddenly begin killing themselves without much warning. Then you introduce us to Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, who flees the city with wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), with his daughter in tow. We see them escape the city and end up getting stranded in the countryside, where theories about the incidents, originally blamed on terrorists, start to multiply, and the search for a culprit focuses on a more, shall we say, natural cause.<br/><br/>You know, I will say, your setup had a great deal of potential. Several scenes in which individuals take their own lives without warning are effective. There is a scene late in the film, which I will not repeat here because we both know what scene we are talking about, that is disturbing. You had a good starting point, I will give you that.<br/><br/>However, what really kills The Happening is the performances of the actors. It seems reasonable to assume that, since most of the actors perform in a similar manner, that a lot of the problems are attributable to your direction, I am sorry to report. Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, most of the supporting cast, are all wooden, monotone, lifeless. All the actors seems as if they are reciting something from rote that they needed to regurgitate for a school project. There is little passion, energy, or life to the performances. Some rather cheesy dialogue compounds the problem, so that many scenes are almost laughable. What this does is drain all the energy out of the scenes, not to mention the tension. What should be a riveting, claustrophobic thriller, ends up with almost no atmosphere or suspense at all. It doesn't help that your film gets a bit preachy at the end, which is a somewhat similar issue that befell your Lady in the Water. I don't mind that your films have a ""message"", but could you tone them down a little, it makes for a more pleasant viewing experience.<br/><br/>All in all, I am certainly not going to give up on you, Mr. Shyamalan. You showed enough power and promise in your early days to remind me that you have plenty of ability. You just need to work a little harder on the execution. I say this with only your best intentions at heart believe me.<br/><br/>Your humble viewer, Gerald"

However, cap it off with 'B' actors, a meandering story that gets forever to get wherever it's going, and a ten-minute denouement filled in with ex-lip syncher, Marky Mark, walking the streets of wherever and a TV shrink explaining the whole story to us over a five minute interview - and utterly - predictable ending and... well, you have the usual M Night dreg (Sixth Sense notwithstanding).<br/><br/>Nature isn't the only thing getting away with murder in this film - as I've written before, if The Sixth Sense hadn't been M's first film, none of his other POS' would have ever seen celluloid.<br/><br/>Give it a rest M, you've been scamming us for too long!"

","What a disgusting thing having to film such boring action ! It is the first movie I see from this director, and I must say I used to enjoy Mark Wahlberg's acting much more in the past... He should have worked on his part through the studying of Indiana Jones' 4 pictures. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing : terrible plot (just watch ""Children of the Corn"", don't bother seeing its awful ersatz 'The Happening'. Actors are bad, the plot is boring, the action ridiculous, and actually, even the set isn't great. There is such a lack of suspense that one loses interest after two minutes (i.e. 2 out 10). I personally would have liked to see a dubbed version -in french, of course- because then it would have given an excuse for the awfully boring hours I spent at the theatre."

","I have just finished watching the movie in its entirety. After such an amazing trailer for the film I have never been as disappointed with a title in my life. I had just begun to gain credibility for Mark Wahlberg after some shoddy films nearing the end of the 90s and the turn of the century. There is no introduction to the film and there is a 2 minute outro which similarly explains nothing. At times the acting is cringe-worthy. What had the potential to be one of the greatest story-lines for its genre has been ruined by terrible direction and terrible acting. I would advise any cinema-goer to avoid the film. I watched the film and rated it 2 on the site, I will never have the 86 minutes of my life returned, this I resent.<br/><br/>I have been browsing a wide range of comments on the film and have balanced the good and the bad. The voting graph probably reflects the personalities of the people watching the film. I wouldn't consider myself a film buff but like to think that I usually have a very good taste in films: this is a film to avoid.<br/><br/>If you disagree with my comments then I can have no qualms as everybody is entitled to an opinion, however, I will say this: if you have something better to do than watch this film then by all means do it."

","Are you supposed to laugh when Mark Wahlberg breaks down in tears? ... I didn't think so, but everyone in the movie theater (including me) did. Everything about Wahlberg annoyed me in this movie, and it really started from the 1st second he was on screen. His almost childish voice (he made every line in this movie sound like a question), his manners, his 'i-am-so-shocked-by-this-look', and well pretty much the delivery of all of his lines. Oh and about the story? Plants that cause you to kill yourself?!?!? Really?!?!?!? The whole movie seemed like an excuse to shock the audience with some horrendous forms of suicides. The only thing that got me through this movie were probably Zooey Deschanel's blue eyes."

","My hands have been full these past few years defending M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village' was a beautifully haunting stroke of genius and a personal favorite of mine. 'Lady in the Water', while certainly outlandish and a tad self-indulgent, was an enchanting fairy tale with a worthy message. While both of these films have been the target of an absurd amount of lashing, Shyamalan was made Hollywood's go-to whipping boy.<br/><br/>And here we arrive at 'The Happening'. Shyamalan's first R-rated venture. An eco-thriller which poses the question, what if Earth were to one day simply purge itself of mankind? It's a terrific set-up, thought-provoking in typical Shyamalan fashion. But unfortunately, I won't be taking up the task anytime soon to defend 'The Happening' as I have with his previous efforts. I didn't hate it, and I don't think it's quite as bad as some have claimed, but I simply cannot defend it.<br/><br/>'The Happening' would have made a great short story. The makings are there, the potential is great. But a good story does not always a good movie make. A promising and disturbing start ultimately gives way to something much less suspenseful as Shyamalan's script begins to tread water. For perhaps the first time in his career, 'The Happening' becomes a shoddy piece of work from the man who once brought us 'The Sixth Sense'. A few memorable scenes stuck in a poorly constructed picture. The film simply gravitates without much direction or insight.<br/><br/>Shyamalan, who has been able to draw some fantastic performances from actors in the past, instead seems to bring out the worst of this cast. Mark Wahlberg, whose career has been on the upswing since his Oscar nominated performance in 'The Departed', is at times painful to watch here. Awkward close-ups mixed in with awkward dialogue. He seems lost and confused, probably trying to remember what possessed him to take on this role. The rest of the cast, which includes John Leguizamo and a zoned out Zooey Deschanel, just doesn't have anything to work with. They're all wandering around aimlessly waiting for Shyamalan to explain himself.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers, you've seen 'The Happening'. In between frightening scenes of deranged suicide, there's not much to pass the time or make a movie with for that matter. This is Shyamalan at his dullest, his weakest effort to date and a sore disappointment. There's a great environmental message here worth listening to, but it deserves a much better movie. Something compelling, something worth seeing. 'The Happening' had potential, but Shyamalan ultimately leaves it to suffer.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","Once again M. Night Shyamalan dose not disappoint with his disappointing movies. i recently had the unfortunate pleasure of sitting through MR Shyamalan's latest dumpster baby of a movie the Happening. Well folks like the village and unbreakable his steady decline in the quality of films has not broke. heres whats going on...a mysterious thing is happening people are killing themselves because of it Marky Mark (an otherwise decent actor who phones it in big time) and that girl who was in Almost Famous for a few seconds are on the run from the ""happening"" they of course figure it out and live while everyone else dies. no big surprise there. but in the midst of what should be world wide chaos due to this unknown event people are relatively calm and almost seem bored. the script would be better suited to line a parrots cage with, the usual twist and turns in one of this guys films are not predictable because they are absent. the film sluggishly mopes about without ever invoking fear or dread; something you might expect from a film about unexplained mass suicides. the characters are transparent and dull and most of the conversation is useless. for a few minutes this guy talks about hot dogs...""do you like hot dogs? hot dogs are underrated. got the mustered"" what is that all about. turns out hot dogs would have been an even better villain killing people left and right then what the true ""horror"" was. as for him trying to shock people with his first R rated film...well have you seen the commercials then you've seen the scary parts already don't worry seeing them out of context is better then having to sit through this junk feast. in short save your money. i have the uneasy notion that this film will have the same effect on its viewers that it dose on the people in it offing themselves. Oh and a quick note to MNS thanks for begin a huge tool and trying to capitalize on peoples fears by having people in NYC jumping form buildings to that horrific sound. if your form NY you know what i mean, this guy shamelessly slapped that scene on screen to invoke fear and to say look how i reached people. well MR Shyamalan i too want to reach people namely you and kick you in the nuts. go see a constipated dog trying to squeeze one out it will be more suspenseful i give you my word."

","I'm from Philadelphia (actually, about 5 minutes away from the director's home.... and am a huge fan and also thrilled that Philadelphia has a man of this talent and caliber. So, I'm not all that unbiased. I'll only say that I thought the movie began brilliantly and petered out after the first 30 minutes (more or less what most are saying). But, what most disturbed me was that at least twice, recording microphones momentarily popped into the top of the scene...Now, how in the heck could that have happened in a film directed by someone of his caliber? Reminded me of those awful westerns in the 60's where, from time to time you'd see the plume of a jet overhead. Geez-Louise Knight... get it together!"
"sobeit712","8","2","10","6 July 2008"," It's actually the best M. Night Shyamalan's movie so far
","It's actually one M. Night Shyamalan's movie that has a relevant meaning. Unlike many of those who hated this movie, I'm actually not Mr Night's fan. I mildly enjoyed 6th sense but generally found all of his other movies pretentious and heavy handed, except this one. This is his only movie so far that doesn't have a twist ending, which is a good thing! This time, Mr. Night doesn't mind showing you the blood and gore, which really took me by surprise. The visual horror is a double edged sword. It can be funny to watch, which may take away some seriousness of the subject. It also takes away the subtlety. Once you see it happening in front of your eyes, you are somewhat desensitized.<br/><br/>Though there are no plot twist, I am still quite intrigued and involved through the whole time. I'm literally glued to the screen, anticipating and guessing what will happen next. The pacing is effective and dialogue are simple and down to earth. It makes you feel those characters are more real. Regardless if the characters are likable or not, you still care what's happening on the screen and how the story unfold.<br/><br/>Some people complain that the characters have no depth. Here's the thing about the movies that are depicting catastrophic event: because of the time span are usually limited to few hours or a few days in these type of movies, there's very little room for character development. Therefore, the director would usually tell a bigger story through the characters, not so much about the characters. I really don't care that much about any one individual in the story about extinction of human race. I'm more concerned about how story unfolds through character's eyes.<br/><br/>Some people also attempt to analyze and criticize the science behind the story. Well, here's what I'm going to say to that: unless you are a real biologist, don't bother trying to criticize the plot because you only come off sounding really stupid and ignorant. Nobody can yet explain some of the plant behaviors and we are only finding out more and more unexplainable things about plants recently.<br/><br/>It is definitely quite different from all of his previous movies, yet, you feel the similar tension build up. There are some flaws here and there, but generally speaking, it is a very entertaining experience without the pressure of pulling off some unbelievable plot twist. Therefore, I enjoyed it much much more than his other movies.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked about this movie is that you can find humor in the most unexpected situation. The over the top gore and hysteria at certain moments really comes off rather comical. I'm not sure if they are intended or not, but they let you peer inside human psyche in a very bizarre way. I won't give out too much details in case you haven't seen the movie. <br/><br/>All in all, it's surprisingly good, engaging and entertaining. The character may not have witty dialogs or use fancy word play, but who really give a fly pig about fancy word play? If you want unrealistically pretentious fancy word play, go watch a sitcom, in which every single word uttered is carefully crafted to make you go: yeah, that's really smart and funny and inventive. People in real life don't talk like that."
"jmhammerstein-980-842586","9","1","4","15 August 2017"," great movie
","The happening is a great movie. It's about something that effects humans in a way that makes them start killing themselves. First, people become confused. Then they kill themselves. It is revealed after some suicides that plants have released some sort of toxin into the air that reverses the survival instinct in humans, and therefore they want to kill themselves. The plants do this because of the bad effects people are having on the environment. The suicide parts are scary. Examples are a woman sitting on a bench next to another woman in New York City. This is the first suicide. The woman who kills herself tells the other woman she doesn't know where she is or something. The woman sitting next to her thinks she's joking and says something in response. The other woman then pulls something out of her hair and stabs herself in the neck with it. Other suicides include a man getting into a lion's pen at a zoo and a lion bites or tears his arms off. The movie is very scary and creepy and the plant's toxin thing is a very interesting idea. It's not as good as the sixth sense. It's way better than signs and way way better than lady in the water. Lady in the water is awful and signs is fairly bad. M. Night Shyamalan really came back good with this one."
"sethmlanders","3","1","4","6 December 2015"," Worse than you can possibly imagine...
","Okay, so it's not Shyamalan's worst film but it comes pretty close. Mark Wahlberg is very talented but he looks confused most of the time. The plot is about some sort of wind that makes people do crazy things. On certain sources, this was labeled as a horror. While the trailers appear that way, there is nothing scary about it at all. I never felt frightened or at the edge of my seat, it's wind and plants for heaven's sake!<br/><br/>The first five minutes had serious potential but then it went completely downhill. I could not take any of the dialogue seriously. There's nothing wrong with campy horror movies but there's no satire or humor for it to be considered that. It just gets ridiculous with a moronic anti-climatic ending that I won't give away because it's not worth explaining. Avoid this movie, I want my time and brain cells back."
"pannuage9","1","1","4","23 December 2010"," The Best Waste Of Time award
","This movie, if you would like to call it that, is nothing more than an embarrassment to anyone with the slightest of intelligence. It's quite horrific and painful to endure something so pretentious, yet the story still thumbs it's nose at you, asking you silently, ""Are you still here, watching me sucka?"" This piece rates up there with a Uwe Boll film.<br/><br/>It should have won an Academy Award for The Best Waste Of Time. In fact, I can't wait to buy the Blu-ray edition so I can waste more time listening to M. Night on the bonus features talk about how good he is and that his idol is Alfred Hitchcock. Also, he does a cameo for every single one of his films in his Honor. How unoriginal is that???? More like blatant plagiarism, I would concur.<br/><br/>One has to wonder how M. Night ever became a director. Further investigation on Wikipedia, reveals an affluent upbringing and 8mm camera, a most unusual combination for a pretentious young spoiled Indian kid. I tend to give directors a chance and watch some of their other ""work"". Oddly, I could not but help notice his films share a similar vein amongst themselves. It almost seems he uses a cookie cutter template for his script and drops in fresh character names for his next movie. Nothing like beating an already dead Harp Seal, right?<br/><br/>We see the same mundane story unfold in front of us for each of his new releases, yet he manages to ensnare some big name celebrities to draw us in like a moth to a candle. Is there not any more pre-screening allowed? Oh, and isn't life grand when you have a lot of money but no imagination?"

","I think people have just gotten used to hating on M Night. It seem like every time he is about to put out a movie, everyone just goes off about how bad it will be. This is a movie that truly explains that they are all wrong. I rented this movie on iTunes only knowing that it is about plants that are attacking people. I first though that it was going to be some kind of over the top completely fake story. I was wrong. Every moment was enjoyable to me and I could not stop watching it. This is a film that makes me wonder how people hate movies like this. It seems like the only movies these days have super special effects and famous people. Nobody is enjoying a story anymore. Hopefully this will curve and people will like stories again. Maybe then M. Night will shine, but for now he will not be getting the best of reviews from the world."

Then, when the event started again at the end of the movie, it was TWO men walking together? Both times, one of the people were talking and started acting weird. I found it weird how the event seemed to start with a couple of the same sex. Was there a significance or is this just a coincidence? <br/><br/>Anyways, I thought it was an interesting movie. I have only seen a few other movies by M. Night and one can certainly tell this is one of his. It's twisted and thought provoking. There was no cameo appearance though, was there? That's kind of M. Night's signature to his movies. So that is surprising."

It's just a fun thrill ride, with an environmental message so ham-handedly forced in I honestly believe it to be an intentional parody.<br/><br/>If anyone else had made this movie it would have been lucky to gross half as much, but would have been praised as an awesome splatter film. Instead, because of M. Night, lots of people paid to see it, and then complain about it. I seem to be the only one who believes that he can bounce back if he swallows his ego.<br/><br/>One thing that can't be denied about this movie, though, is that while you may not like his screen writing, he knows how to direct a scene."

","OK. The Happening. I have four words: it's not that bad. People complained that the story doens't make any sense, that the acting was terrible (John Leguizamo sucked, though), and so on and so forth. Seriously, though. The Happening, sure, wasn't the best movie, but it wasn't the worst movie. It had violence (thank God of that), Mark Walberg did better than most people think, and the story was fine (except the part about what was killing the people). The music was phenomenal. James Newton Howard is a genius.<br/><br/>Now, on to the bad things. God, John Leguizamo was a horrible actor in this film. He doens't do well in too serious movies. There was almost no definite moral to the film. It was like all other horror films: it kills people off.<br/><br/>So, I end my review with the percent of this film, and thats a 5/10."

We will have our turn.<br/><br/>I do not think that the trees and grass will finally get fed up with us and eliminate us as a threat. But, M. Night Shyamalan postulates that as a possibility. His subtle, slow film that allows one to think about what we have done, what we are doing, and what the possible consequences are will not be a big hit with the viewers that are looking for transformers or zombies, or ass-kicking action, but it is a message that deserves to be heeded.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were perfect for this film."

","A staggeringly bad delivery of a really interesting premise. When you find yourself praying for the main characters to die horribly, and soon, you know the film makers have got it badly wrong. Compare this to the less conceptually interesting but brilliantly made Cloverfield, taking one recent apocalyptic instance, and I'm wondering if my vote of 2 was 2 too many....<br/><br/>The list of cinematic crimes committed here is too lengthy to bother with. Those which, however, particularly offended me include the wildly inaccurate depictions of the effects of gun shots on the human skull and of a long pin in the jugular (no budget for fake blood?), the comedy car-meets-tree scene and the painfully sentimental and cosy 'return to normality'.<br/><br/>This is just a terrible film. Now imagine this directed by Romero or any other stalwart of the End-of-the-World genre and the pictures in your head will be far superior to this pasty and dreary exercise in banality."

","Shylamalan has had his successes, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. However, in recent times he has failed to deliver. The Happening unfortunately continues in the same disappointing vein.<br/><br/>The Happening follows the flight of a husband and wife, and a child from a chemical induced matter, which is driving people to suicide. It is a chilling prospect but in retrospect Shylamalan has tied his own hands. It is a concept which is difficult to actualize without an emotional core, and far-more difficult to conclude.<br/><br/>The film is a mighty flop, apart from fleeting moments of tension, and a good performance from Mark Whalberg in a role in which he is ill-suited to, it is awful. The Happening has no emotional engagement it is a mere film of flight, running away from a threat and nothing of substance in-between. Zooey Deschanel, although very photogenic, only manages to produce one emotive display throughout which involved her beautiful eyes, we needed more<br/><br/>I respect Shalayman's message, bringing forth an issue which is a the forefront of many minds today, respecting the environment and not over industrializing the planet but it doesn't work. Maybe the issue is not dealt with enough or strongly enough but it is a rather flimsy deliverance."

Here we are with the ""plant guy"" who all at once tells us it's the plants. Okay, he knows botany, but how does he know what's going on when the only news that has been given out is that the country is under attack from terrorists? Oh, I know. Watch out for that daisy, there's a hidden toxin under those petals. And the acting. Even more stilted than the dialogue. And those facial expressions. What was this, acting class 090? And as previously noted, every single actor in this movie, okay the main actors, were not right for the part. Even Buckley, who is a fantastic actress, could not save her character's role. It made no sense. Shoot, the entire movie was a waste of time. Or as my hubby likes to say, There's 90 minutes I'll never get back.

","Like M. Night's popular Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis and Signs with Mel Gibson, I assumed that The Happening would be a movie that was difficult to discuss without giving away an important revelation that gives meaning to the story and people's bizarre behavior. In the case of the two former movies, we saw that the thoughts of the protagonist(s) were all a big, beautiful, though troubling, metaphor for the reality of things. I enjoyed Sixth Sense and Signs for that reason. The viewer stumbles along saying, ""Okay, that seems a little puzzling there, but this is science fiction, so I'll suspend disbelief."" Until in the final few scenes the author gives you the final piece of the puzzle, and it's ""Aha!""<br/><br/>So I'm watching The Happening with all due diligence, as bizarre stuff just cascades seemingly out of control, and the lead charactersthe Moores (Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) seem to be the protagonists hereact rationally one minute then inexplicably the next. Until finally the movie ends, and I'm still waiting for the Big Metaphor that strings it all together... and waiting, and waiting.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2008"

The thing is, The Happening started out fast-ish,then amidst that action,there was some kind of annoying sub-plot(a bit like the kind of thing you might see in Friends)where Elliot's (Wahlberg) wife admits to having an affair, hiding mobile phone calls and the like. Its almost laughable that something like this should be in the script when the characters lives are in stake. There would be no room to even develop that sub-plot anyway. There's hardly any atmospheric music (I mean,Dark Knight had me on the edge of my seat,because of the music, and its by the same guy in The Happening, isn't it?) For me, it just went off the boil after the first 5 minutes. The main thing that keeps a movie rolling for me is music. If it isn't there, it will fail. Within The Happening is an interesting story that could have worked if the pace was a lot speedier. And the dialogue? Nah. Must...try....harder!!"

","It's at times like this I'd wish I were more eloquent. I've just sat through this tripe and my only response is to consider slapping myself in the face. The reason I don't is that I may one day perhaps bump into the writer and slap him instead, and so I'm holding it in reserve for that.<br/><br/>Wahlberg, a (generally) superb actor - what are you doing here? The participants in this flick are prone to an almost trance-like state, and I can only guess you took your cue from that for the whole film. You're too decent an actor to be appearing in this - next time, when you're picking a role, go by the script, not by the director's name.<br/><br/>I can only guess what the directors directions were - ""err, just walk around a bit and say the words written on the script... and... action ! Yeah, I know it looks poor on paper, but The Sixth Sense was good. Remember? Remember The Sixth Sense? Forget about Signs, that was a mistake... This is me being good again..."" This is crap of the highest order. Generally, I like my eco-proselytizing a little less ""on-the-nose"". The way the ""be kind to the planet"" message is delivered would make even the staunchest Greenpeace-supporter puke.<br/><br/>All those involved (and yes, Shymalan, you especially) should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. To those that bankrolled this POS, take a good hard look at the reviews either here or on metacritic before you give ""golden boy"" Shymalan his next paycheck.<br/><br/>Come in Mr Night, your time is up."

","so let's get on with it right away. <br/><br/>""what???"" was what i said when the film stopped with that ""28 Days Later"" ending. so what was that killing all those people? was it the ""wrath of nature"" or maybe that devilish witch-acting mrs.Jones or more prolly the two knitting grannies with gas-masks on? but, thinking of it, it was just an overrated writer/director that did all that. following the same patterns when writing and directing a plot is what he's been always doin with the exception of this very film which did not have any ... and to get through it there are 'good' and 'bad' ways for killing people in a movie and i'm more than sure that this one was one of the worse ever ...end of story <br/><br/>neeeeexxxtttttt!!!!"
"Lyserod","3","1","4","16 July 2008"," Not happening
","This movie is such a disappointment. There are only a few moments where you get scared, and the rest of the time you're bored. Even the suicides become boring and impersonal (only the first one is in close-up and shocking.) Most of the suicides are from a distance, or you only see their feet as they pick up a gun and shoot themselves. We don't really get to know the characters, so consequently it doesn't really matter when they die. The big reveal comes too early in the story and the ending is a big let down. All it seems to be is an exploration of how many ways you can kill yourself. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."

","Man I was looking forward to this movie so incredible much! I thought: M.Night as the director and freaking Mark ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg in the lead role, I mean - I'ts a given combination! BUT unfortunately this movie took me by storm the first 9 maybe 10 minutes, and there after it really stunk! Totally predictable, very bad acting (even from Mark Wahlberg), a lot of clichés and the worst part was the whole story. Okay, I really do admit the plot to be original but I've seen M.Night Shyamalan write ten times better ones! One other, very disturbing thing was that almost every ""mature"" character was using words like ""chill"" and other words from the streets... WHY? It isn't realistic, God damn it! Basically NOTHING in this movie is realistic and not even the movie itself was filmed particularly good. No great looking angels, no cool special effects (except for the wind flying through some grass, which even I can do in my films) and I can go on like this for days, giving this movie constructive criticism but if I go over to some positive criticism I'll give M.Night some credit for making an original idea, thinking about the world's environment AND making this movie pretty descent after all, with only $60,000,000 (normally today a movie costs about $100,000,000).<br/><br/>M.Night Shyamalan. If you read this (most likely not, but anyway): Keep the good work up and try shooting in some exclusive and fresh angles! One thing I would have done with the ending is when Elliot Moore walks over to Alma Moore, at the end, I would have rewind the movie back to its very beginning and then I would have fade in the words ""IT'S HAPPENING"" and then I would have fade out and fade in to ""THE HAPPENING"" - THE END =)"
"pantherstud9","4","1","4","10 July 2008"," Hmmm. . .what to think?
","Well, I think M night is a genius; I always have. However, this movie has me a little moved. I mean, I think the fact that wherever they went they were in danger gave the movie a good sense of fear, but there was way too much graphic violence. I'm not a fan of modern day ""horror"" movies that show people getting killed in the worst way. It doesn't interest me, but what I have always liked about M's movies is that they were original and some were a little frightening at points. In the end, his movies tended to make sense and I always liked how the little bits and pieces of clues throughout the movie came together in the end. . .This one was not like that. I did get a sense of fear, but I was more disgusted than anything. I did like how the movie wasn't just the same old pattern, but it just lacked that M night""ness."" There were a few ""clues"" planted in the movie, but for the most part the answers were given away and in the end I just kind of felt let down. I mean, he didn't even give a cameo:( I don't, however, think that M should stop writing. I love his movies and I'm sure his next one will be better. We aren't all going to make a number one single you know? I'm sure Hitchcock made a couple of flops in his day. . ."

","The happening wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't all that good. The movie starts out with so much promise, as the opening scene is probably one of the best I have ever seen. It really draws you in and makes you want to see more. The problem is there really is no more. The acting in this movie is great. John Leguizamo plays a short, but good part in the movie. Mark Wahlberg again shows he can sell any role he plays. The storyline as a whole was a pretty good concept, but as M Knight always does, he never really gives closer, and I think thats why I rated this movie only a 4. I don't like when I finish watching a movie I have no idea what happened. For me I thought it was just OK. I don't think I would recommend this movie but I wouldn't try to talk someone out of it who said they were going to watch it."

","This is one of the most boring movies that this summer has produced; it is clear now that Mr Shyamalan's magic touch is no more and another proof that banking only on one talent - in this case supernatural thriller , unknown and terrifying around us , with as little visualization of this evil , unknown and in all of us as possible , cannot work forever; the movie is also a painful slap on the face of Mr Walberg ,as no one in this film in fact knows what he /she is doing .An interesting basic idea ,but horribly presented , plants as evil force and bunch of people running somewhere , and dropping dead , and that's that !"
"laura-vanbaren","3","1","4","7 July 2008"," Slapstick
","Alright, first I really need to say that when I first read the plot line of this movie, me and my boyfriend both thought of a rip-off of Suicide Club, an Asian production. Thank god it wasn't, or maybe it should have been and maybe it would have been a better movie if it in fact was a rip-off. But no, Shyamalan took a perfectly interesting storyline and made a slapstick movie out of it. Where you think the movie could be okay, especially if you know Mark Wahlberg is starring in it, you should better keep your money in your pocket and really don't go see it in cinema's. This is one movie which I'd like to see copied, so that the director knows it isn't worth buying it.<br/><br/>The Happening tells the story of a weird phenomenon which causes people to commit suicide. Of course people all over America are fleeing and it isn't before long that Mark Wahlberg discovers it might have to do something with the plants. Together with his wife and the daughter of his best friend, he's trying to survive in a world that's gone crazy. Well, that's it for the story. Could be pretty interesting, no? Well, that's what I thought, but Wahlberg is being a stupid comedian, who isn't funny when he has a funny line, but who is funny all the more in the rest of the movie, which causes the movie to be a bad comedy at all the wrong and mismented times. The acting is really really REALLY bad and should be nominated for a stupid Razzie-award, or whatever it is called. It looks cheap and the only person I really believed in this mis-production, was the woman who heard her daughter commit suicide over the phone. And if it wasn't her, then it was her dog.<br/><br/>DON'T GO WATCH IT! IT SUCKS!"
"Ozzy2000","1","1","4","3 July 2008"," Another pathetic film in fact one of the worst I have ever seen
","I have just seen one of the worst films ever made...""The Happening"" in which nothing is happening which makes ""The Happening"" nothing.<br/><br/>One of my favorite actors Mark Wahlberg obviously did the film for the money as he spurts out his share of ridiculous gibberish dialogue. He is the only name actor in this ridiculous film about a huge toxic breaking wind. The film defies all scientific and medical plausibility about how toxic contagious spread. Also the idea that a virus or ""bug"" could suddenly make you violently and actively suicidal is so crazy it's make you laugh. Especially the scene in which a man suicides by letting his industrial lawn mower ride over him and another scene about an elderly women who kills herself by headbutting windows and walls. Those scenes left the audience in screaming fits of laughter.<br/><br/>The film reached a new cinematic low when Wahlberg's character communicates from a room in house to an ""OutShed"" some thirty metres away through a pipe in the wall. Even a twelve year old could figure out that you don't get high fidelity sound through old water pipes over a long distance that must also have perpendicular bends.<br/><br/>I also noticed M. Night Shyamalan carefully places Indian nationals in almost every scene and they surely must be family and friends.<br/><br/>Shyamalan uses his usually cliché suspense and intrigue techniques combined with scenes of graphic blood and gore to the standard measure.<br/><br/>The scenes of people monitoring the magnitude of the suicidal virus on the TV news in public cliché is about as cliché as you can get. I think that most people need a leader to unleash that side of them that can see the the absolutely ridiculous side to things they see otherwise they sink into this quiet reverence and dismay at the graphically violent scenes. <br/><br/>This film had no scientific plausibility and the way Wahlberg delivered his lines made me certain he was offered a great deal of money for the role. He is a really great actor why he stooped to this ridiculous crap alludes me. <br/><br/>The act of suicide is a combination of complicated deep-seated depression combined with the long standing premeditated sense of purpose or some really passionate psychologically motivated processes. The act itself has never been associated with organically or other forms of toxicity and even if when a physiological imbalance or causality could be diagnosed the onset of the act of suicide would and could not be that sudden. <br/><br/>I mean if the mental faculties were available to determine which process would result in death then surely other faculties would be operative. <br/><br/>Which ever way you look at it the process was ridiculous. Also why in America? why not in some extremely populated region like India where the Director M. Night Shyamalan comes from. I guess in India the only way to suicide would be drowning in the open sewer puddles which would also look pretty funny. Imagine 1600 million people in such a highly populated place with negligible means of suicide people would be head butting each other for months. <br/><br/>Another really stupid film by this way too over-rated Film director M. Night Shyamalan. He should stick to Bollywood films that have Indian nationals dancing around ""Maypoles"" as they celebrate the grant of their Australian permanent residence or the birth of their eight child here. Shyamalan must be a hot favorite for the Rasberry award this year. Minus ten stars and its good night M. Night Shyamalan never again!"
"Pantalaimon60107","7","1","4","23 June 2008"," Too Much or Too Little... I Can't Decide
","I suppose this movie is likable. It works. It succeeds at telling a story, and is a nice return for Shamyalan. But... Is it just me, or is both too much and too little shown? I wonder: Do we really need to see all of the violence that there is in the film, if it's only backed up by an unsatisfying, relatively non-violent ending? I also wonder: Can the sentimentality of the film be backed up without more characterization of Elliott and Alma and the situation of their relationship? Let's start with the ""too much"" idea first. Why do we need to see Central Park being affected by whatever it is, whatever you want to call it? Why do we need to see workers jumping off of a building? Would it not be more frightening to simply hear about the events through radio broadcasts? The uncertainty would definitely scare me more than seeing what is actually happening. Granted, the ""seeing"" part of things is wonderfully mastered. It just doesn't invoke terror as simply hearing about the events might. To move on with the ""too little"" idea... Wahlberg and Deschanel are both talented, but are not given enough to really work with. The opening scenes make Deschanel like she does not have the slightest idea what she is doing on film. She simply stares at her phone. This induces more laughs than curiosity. Alma's relationship with Elliott just exists. When Leguizamo's character tells Elliott that he saw Alma crying on their wedding day, it does not offer any real insight. Seeing Alma and Elliott interact makes me think of them being more like strangers than being husband and wife. More interaction between them, aside from the obvious dialogue, would help to bring credibility to the unjustified ending. As for other complaints... The supporting cast of characters is predictably killed off, although the violence hardly ever becomes too graphic. One of the biggest complaints I can register against the movie is the whole reason for the events. Plants? The film would have been better off without any explanation whatsoever. That, as well, would have added to the horror. Still, I did more or less like the movie. It did what it came to do, and did it well enough to be more than simply passable, but not well enough to be admirable. There just should have been more or less than there was."

","There is no tension at all during this morning. I attended at 935p movie with about 30 people and besides a few jumps from the audience it seemed like everyone was bored.<br/><br/>After the first disease scenes there is no suspense since we know the outcome for everyone infected. The method utilized may change but we know exactly what's going to happen and that ruins the suspense of each of these infection scenes.<br/><br/>PHL 30th Street Station - if NYC had been contaminated with some sort of infection I believe every east coast city would be clearing out. 30th Street Station seemed like a normal afternoon.<br/><br/>During an emergency I would imagine television/radio/Internet ratings are enormous.

I actually started surfing the Internet towards the end of the movie hopeful that it would end soon.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Signs and was hoping for a movie similar to Signs but this movie was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The title says it all: Not Happening. The entire theme of the movie. Nothing much happens."
"sofaking203","2","1","4","22 June 2008"," Awful...
","I have always tried to give M. night a lot of credit, but this movie was awful. The acting was dry and very unenthusiastic. I gave up trying to like this movie when the army officer was suddenly worried by saying ""Cheese and Crackers."" Even when someone would be dying no one would seem to be surprised. In the very first scene when the woman stabs herself with her own hairpin the woman sitting next to her just has a blank look on her face. Although I will give props to Shymalan for the humor in the movie. Such as when he starts talking to the plastic tree I found that scene to be pretty funny. I've always liked M. Night and always defended him but after watching this movie...he made that impossible."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","3","1","4","20 June 2008"," This is a Serious Casualty
","The first film that I watched from M. Night Shymalan was the terrific Signs. However, since then he has been getting worse and worse. The Happening may be even worse than the disastrous Lady in the Water. It starts off brilliantly, but soon dissolves into a lazily written, poorly constructed and unintentionally funny failure.<br/><br/>A large-scale disaster is occurring. Nobody knows what is causing it, but anyone who is caught up in the deadly incidents is driven to suicide. With news of the epidemic heading towards Philadephia, school teacher Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), along with his friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez), attempt to flee. However, the supposed attacks are spreading quickly, and no one knows when the epidemic will strike next... <br/><br/>Shymalan kicks off the proceedings with pizazz in an intense opening which is both chilling and disturbing. However, he starts to lose his bearings in the second half. The film is also too short to be effective, shooting past details as if it can't be bothered to realise their full potential. If this is Shymalan's attempt at a comeback, I think that it's time for him to call it a day. His heart doesn't seem to be in it, and his direction is too pretentious and ultimately inept. I think that I'm just about finished with Shymalan myself.<br/><br/>Shymalan also pens the script, which contains some awful dialogue. One man says, in reference to the supposed attacks, that ""there appears to be an event happening."" What event? Is the circus coming to town? There is also one horrendously cheesy moment in which Wahlberg's character attempts to communicate with a plant. The script is one of the films biggest weaknesses. Some of the communication between the characters is just downright outrageous.<br/><br/>For me, the acting is a mixed bag. In my opinion, Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo deliver the strongest performances, crafting characters who I came to care about and who I could invest in. Wahlberg's solid performance may in fact be the best thing about the movie, whereas Leguizamo's final scene is especially affecting. However, Zooey Deschanel made me feel more uneasy in some scenes then all of the suicidal maniacs put together. At times, she seems so lifeless, so strange that I tended to stop thinking of her as a normal person. Meanwhile, young Ashlyn Sanchez fails to convince in her key scenes as the daughter of Leguizamo's character.<br/><br/>There is another flaw. Whilst Shymalan knows how to start a premise, he doesn't necessarily know how to end one. This is especially obvious in The Happening, where there isn't any real ending or closure to the story. But to be honest, I was glad that the film didn't go on any longer.<br/><br/>The musical score is effective, if nothing exceptional. It creates a strange and intense mood, and does what it needs to do in the long run. Technically, the film is adequate. There are some moments where the technical crew are superb, such as in one scene where two cocky boys upset one crazy survivor. My biggest disappointment is that the brilliance on display in this scene and a few others doesn't last for long. <br/><br/>Overall, The Happening is a bundle of missed opportunities. Whilst it has serious promise in its premise, it is let down by bad execution, some lacklustre writing and truly shy film-making. This film isn't anywhere near the visceral thrills of films such as 28 Days Later. In fact, there isn't really that much blood to speak of. So far, The Happening is the worst casualty of summer 2008, smacking the final nail in Shymalan's coffin with a resounding crack."
"subDmediafan","5","1","4","20 June 2008"," Just OK
","Mr Shymalan, where have you gone?<br/><br/>Let's be perfectly clear, this is no 6th Sense, or even Signs. It's better than Lady In The Water, but thats not hard to do. That said, it's still a decent flick. Keeps your attention, some imaginative scenes, and storytelling. The idea was good, but the execution and development were bland by Shymalan's own standards.<br/><br/>This is not Marky Mark's finest hour, matter of fact, none of these actors put in a very memorable performance. The dialogue was very much lacking. The characters were simple and straight forward, most came and went without any development. None very believable, especially Private Auster and the Mrs. Jones. Not so much because they were poor actors, just poor characters. A bumbling idiot as an Army guy and a paranoid reclusive old woman with a nasty attitude, but a sense of hospitality for no apparent reason? Sorry, just not quite believable to me.<br/><br/>I thought the camera work was very good, lots of sweeping scenes and great odd-angle shots. Colorful at times, dark and eerie at times. Well done.<br/><br/>******MINOR SPOILER COMMENT*******<br/><br/>As far as the story. Do we really need yet another avenue for left-wing environmentalist propaganda? Global Warming? Gov't conspiracy? C'mon M Night, you used to be way beyond this sort of thing. I still love the work but it's really a disappointment to see another director fall into the ""we are __________(fill in the blank.. Americans, Humans, polluters, etc.), and therefore we are evil and should be punished"" mold that envelopes and dominates Hollywood. M.N.S. used to be a breathe of fresh air, now he seems to have discarded his individualism to become just another stiff towing the radical left message that owns Hollywood."
"on_the_can","5","1","4","18 June 2008"," Umm....
","...I just don't know. That's probably the best way to describe my, and quite likely everyone else's, reaction when this movie's credits started to roll.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a lot of promise. New York's Central park suddenly grinds to a halt and its once bustling inhabitants start walking backwards, talking in gibberish and eventually committing suicide. We then flash over to a construction site where workers begin throwing themselves from their gerters to the ground below in front of the teary eyes of their friends. The incidents are assumed initially to be the result of some sort of bio-chemical terrorist attack and New York is eventually evacuated. Neighboring Philadelphia soon follows suit and this is where we are introduced to our main characters, played my Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo and his on screen daughter. They, along with thousands of others start their trek away from whatever the hell is going on.<br/><br/>If this ever actually happened we'd all be quaking in our boots, combine that with the strong opening and you are easily strapped in and genuinely curious to see what happens next. The problem is the movie runs along at a relatively slow pace, which you will probably gladly sit through in anticipation for the pay off at the end...unfortunately, there really is no pay off to look forward to. The cause of the Happening is presented early on as a theory and doesn't take long before it's presented as likely fact by our protagonist. The ora of mystery that falls over the first 30 minutes of the movie is more or less destroyed by this epiphany and there's little more to keep you guessing. By now you care enough about the characters to root for them and keep you invested, but by the end I still felt cheated out of something, I just didn't know what. M. Night Shyamalan's made a career out of surprise twist endings that turn your entire perception of the preceding film on its head. If ever there was flick made for that it's The Happening, but he decides not to cash in and instead turns it into what feels like a 90 min PSA for global warming.<br/><br/>As far as acting John Leguizamo is the stand out while Wahlberg is good but not great as he often is. I like Zooey Deschanel but she's wooden and unlikable for the lion's share of the movie, which isn't at all her fault given the dialog and scripted personality she's handed. You do get a sense of her improv prowess though, during two scenes of solitude, while she waits and fidgets impatiently.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is without question a talented director, however. As week as his story is, it is also well shot and paced. There is some very clever camera work that actually manages to be scary in of itself. Creepy almost in its simplicity. I don't think he's earned the rank of today's Hitchcock like some have bestowed upon him, though. Talented, yes, Hitchcock, no. Some of Alfred's stuff is better than others, but I've never seen a Hitchcock film I didn't like.<br/><br/>Like I've said or at least implied the movie's entertaining enough to keep you from looking at your watch, but by the end of it you can't quite understand why. Maybe it will appreciate in time and fewer expectations. I will gladly give it a second chance.<br/><br/>But a warning to gore fans. The movie's promotions like to highlight the R rating this receives but given the lack of graphic violence, course language or even suggestive humor I don't think Shyamalan was going for the R rating so much as it was just given to him."
"e_tippett","5","1","4","19 June 2008"," Bad acting, choppy writing
","Everyone in this movie except for Mark Wahlberg could have been recast, with positive results, and no one would have noticed. Leguizamo is wasted as some geek math teacher with no common sense. Everyone in the movie seems to have inappropriate emotional responses to things not yet in evidence. Some of the time the characters' facial expressions do not in any way match what they are talking about; they talk about very tense, upsetting things with no expression. The leaps of logic that people make are in no way logical, and Elliott's hissy fit screaming ""give me a minute! give me a minute! give me a minute!"" does not fit with his character, and really, it isn't as if people are harassing him for a decision. There was no chemistry whatsoever between Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, strangers on a bus could have been more connected than this ""husband and wife"", even with the purported marital problems that seem to have been exaggerated. The way Elliott talks about Alma to Julian as they exit the school, it seems as if the marriage is hanging by a thread and he almost seems to be setting Julian up to be prepared for Alma to be an angry, distant, mentally unstable twit. Julian for his part treats his child as if she were about to go postal, which she never does either, and at times his character seems forced, as if only thrown in to have another ""star"" name in the credits."

I wanted to show my support by going and watching this film. But it sucks. After the first 20 or so minutes, I realized that nothing new was going to happen. Whalberg figures out the plot half-way through the movie, and for the rest we're just watching him and Zooey D. run around in fields, interact with a crazy lady, and then figure out they're OK at the end. As a friend of mine said after we left the theater, Shyamalan had one great idea and made a movie out of it. But one great idea doesn't make a movie. I sincerely believe if he would have built on it and created some sub-plots that it could have been a good movie. But he didn't and man oh man was it boring."

The problem that is blighting many recent horror films.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely atrocious, no emotion, no feeling, nothing. Wahlbergs performance was at best, terrible. Zooey Deschanel was laughable in her cringingly lacklustre role. The best way to describe all of the performances in this film is by calling them wooden. No-one stood out and even characters with precious little screen time acted like they couldn't be bothered.<br/><br/>The dialogue was simply inexplicable, some of the lines spoken in the film were jaw-droppingly abysmal and it wasn't scary, not one scene of this mess was in the least bit horrifying. Though the UK version being cut probably didn't help matters.<br/><br/>The premise of the story was brilliant and could've been done successfully, but this is a complete sham of a movie and I wish I had thought with my head instead of my heart.<br/><br/>Terrifyingly awful."

He made one good film with a big twist which was almost 10 years ago. Anything else? it is nothing like Hitchcock in terms of suspense. It had a bad soundtrack all the way through it, which was meant to supply some tension into our brains. Hitchcock for one didn't show off his camera equipment in at least 4 scenes. Even if he did I would have let him off for doing so as his films were good and they probably spent less time in the editing room as they barley had one years and years ago.

One of the more important scenes happens at a construction sight, but I will offer no spoilers here.<br/><br/>Cut to a teacher (Mark Wahlberg) talking about the disappearance of Honey Bees with his class where he is soon interrupted by the vice principal, who leads him from the class to the auditorium where all other teachers have gathered and are discussing what has happened. Of course school is dismissed, and Elliot Moore (Wahlberg) is soon leaving town with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) his friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) to escape what is happening. They are soon confronted with the fact that whatever is happening is now spreading from bigger cities into the smaller towns and on. WHat happens along the way? I will say no more. I will say though that you do learn what is causing the problem. At least Shylaman doesn't leave us hanging.<br/><br/>I loved the idea. THe plot is preachy but I think it could've worked much better if Shylaman had let someone else write the story. Like I said above the dialogue in this movie is really bad, and the actors seem embarrassed or just not sure what to do. THe Happening suffers from some of the same things that hurt The VIllage a couple years ago. Shylaman is good with building suspense and making things ominous and spooky as he always has been. I also loved the score to the movie, but none of these things can save this movie from being anything but below average. Sorry, but this movie cannot be recommended."

","First off i need to say that the acting was the wost I've seen in a long time. All the actors seemed to be forcing there lines and over doing it. The acting was so bad that it was distracting me from the movie itself. I do need to give credit to the crazy old lady though. She was the only person i thought did a good job. She was the main reason i got a little freaked out. The fist part of the movie was pretty good but after that it went all downhill. I think that the plot itself was o.k. and if more time was spent writing the script and shooting it then it could be a good movie. Nothing really changes through out the movie besides 'holy crap more wind RUN!'. They never really go into anyones personal story stopping me from caring if anyone died. I also think that some of the ways people were killing them self's was a little cheesy and i found myself laughing with the rest of the crowd at many parts. I was also sad to see that the was no good twist. I was really looking forward to it but it was reveled half-way through and all i could think was ""thats it? the plants want revenge? really?"" Overall i think if it was written better and had MUCH better acting then this could have been a good movie but I'm sad to say i think this was a total waste of time. Although I think I'm going to starting watering my grass a lot more....even if its raining."

","well i had scene the trailer a couple of times and was really excited about watching this movie, however since it's beginning till it's end it was a downhill road. first of all while i always found Mark walhberg to be an OK actor (not excellent but not bad) he was terrible at this movie i mean come on i know you want to seem as a ""normal"" nice teacher but even nice teacher lose it you are running in the middle of a field with everybody killing themselves around you and you don't even hug your wife. everybody is killing themselves you don't know what to do or where to go and here you are giving a smiley face it's unbelievable even the kids in the movie were acting better. Following that while i always found disaster movies and books my favorite science fiction section this movie failed in all sense. while i appreciate that for one time the movie hero doesn't save the world. However the plot is completely incoherent a small example for not telling the whole movie is when John Leguizamo is in the car searching for his wife then he finds everybody dead while logically you turn around he just keeps moving. these small plot loops who could be easily fixed if you proofread the script . finally the direction and the used clichés are just terrible. while you might be tempted to watch stay away from this movie!!"
"uva3021","4","1","4","17 June 2008"," A response to the movie: Brief, thought provoking, and reasonable
","Movie had low production quality, less than mediocre acting, and an unreasonable and overly dramatic message, unless M had a message that transcended the apparent message in his movie: This country is in large part driven unfortunately by fear. Fear is the feeling that inevitably permeates throughout society. Having said that, the biological ""attacks"" didn't originate until a woman screamed. At the beginning and the end. Why did the woman scream, was it because of the fatal chemical excretions of the plant-life or was it for something else unrelated, but the ever-present fear that resulted from that scream was the catalyst for the spread of the fatal chemicals. Then the fear spread throughout the northeast and was attached to those that were scared, regardless of the size of groups. Whalberg and Deschannel near the end were unharmed because they were experiencing at that moment ""Love"" as opposed to ""Fear."" The end with the scientist developing a theory of this biological toxin being a response to the environmental and progressive fiendishness of human civilization seemed to be direct and obvious in its message. Yet could that message in itself be drawing on the ""Fear"" that has driven society for so long? I doubt M has the cleverness or even the time to indulge in such possibilities or complexities in writing this movie. It's making good money, so mission accomplished I guess.<br/><br/>The Movie itself had, like I said, low production quality and less-than-mediocre acting regardless.<br/><br/>4.5/10"
"iris2486","4","1","4","16 June 2008"," Too bad
","I, like most comments I'd read before this went into ""The Happening"" as a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work. Granted, it's pretty obvious his career has been on a steady decline since he blew everyone away with 99's ""Sixth Sense"", but still somehow his films always have that sense of tension and startling discomfort that very few directors are able to consistently maintain. These techniques (along with obviously one of the great plot twists in recent history) made him such a smash success with Sixth Sense, and also made films like ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" oddly enjoyable and totally suspenseful. Even the disappointing ""Village"" maintained many of these same characteristics making it at least enjoyable until the lame twist of that movie. At first I was hoping to leave ""Lady in the Water"" totally out of the equation, chalking it up to M. Night trying (and failing) something new, breaking out of his own box he'd created, something that eventually had to be done, at least giving that weird and hardly enjoyable movie a point.<br/><br/>Now, onto ""The Happening"". The trailer was promising, and that eerie feeling of paranoia and helplessness that made ""Signs"" so intriguing was back. So I went in with high hopes, especially since I'm also a fan of Wahlberg (who seemed to have improve with every performance leading up to this) and the always good Zooey Deschanel as seemingly capable leads. Everything was going well, until the movie started.<br/><br/>The opening sequence was possibly the highlight of the movie, which is pretty annoying considering none of the film's antagonists are even introduced at this point. Already though the screenplay is evidently forced and for lack of a better word, lame. Laughs were heard all throughout the theater at just the basic dialogue of the movie, whether it be someone who's supposed to be terrified replying ""cheese and crackers"" or Wahlberg reacting with a 'shocked' ""Oh no!"" after several people are attacked by this 'happening'.<br/><br/>The actual plot of the movie isn't bad (SPOILERS AHEAD) but it essentially turns from a super-natural horror mystery into a unnecessarily boring and flat chase movie which finds a goofy, bumbling, uncomfortable looking Mark Wahlberg and a detached Zooey Deschanel who seemed like her only true work on this movie was letting M. Night film her (admittingly amazing) eyes in super close ups for half the movie, basically running from maybe-abandoned house to maybe-abandoned house from the big bad toxins in the air. This could have been pulled off much better with characters who we cared about, or at least characters who would react like a real person would in this type of thing. Instead of the total paranoia, shock, and disbelief that made a movie like Cloverfield so popular, we're given ridiculous small talk about how cool hot dogs are. I wish I was kidding.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo's character is totally useless in the movie, and Wahlberg and Deschanel's relationship is so obviously forced that you're almost rooting for one of them to kill themselves then end up together. In fact, the happy ending that at least these two get ends up being cheesy and stupid. Not to mention the huge amount of emphasis put on something so insignificant as a mood ring gets.<br/><br/>You'd think with all of these detractors, at least the gruesome suicide scenes would make this a cool, eerie movie. But no, unfortunately some of these scenes induced as many laughs in the audience as the terrible dialogue did. Aside from the opening sequence (which even itself had terrible dialogue and awful characters you were just couldn't help rooting against) I remember only being creeped out at one of the scenes, the haunting mass hanging scene. Others were just seemed totally forced and well, dumb. Whether it was some idiot turning on this big lawnmower and casually laying down in front of it or some crazy old lady (who sadly may have been the scariest thing in the movie...not a compliment) smashing her face through a window?, the scenes seemed like something a 15 year old might think up, not the guy who made us all squirm in ""The Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>With all that, I gave the movie a 4. Admittingly, it may be just me remembering M. Night's previous films and giving him bonus points for those. Or maybe I sort of welcomed the whole 'plants' plot and just wished for more (aka a lot more) out of it. Either way I (along with the rest of the audience) walked out extremely disappointed, laughing more times then I screamed, only remembering the movie for Zooey Deschanel's eyes."

There was nothing ""subtle"" about the movie. The moral was spoon fed to us from the first scene with Wahlberg's discussion about the bees. ""Sometimes we just don't know why nature does things"". (Even more proof that it WAS plants). Scene after scene had cringe-worthy moments and dialog. ""I don't feel comfortable expressing my emotions"" was said twice--TWICE so we really get it and hope that she will learn to express her emotions (and be ready for the reward of motherhood) by the end of the movie. But DOES she? You'll have to see the movie to find out. ""If you take my daughter's hand, you better mean it,"" cut to slow-motion close up of Zooey taking the girl's hand. The ""crazy"" plant man talks to the plants and waxes on about hotdogs. But how do we KNOW he's crazy? Zooey helpfully points at him, then points at her temple, twirls her finger, and mouths the word ""crazy"". Yes, just like your four year old nephew would. And finally, ""what was the color of love""? ""I can't remember."" Are you EFFING kidding me? That's just straight-up insulting. I heard Al Gore watched this movie and promptly went out and strangled a spotted owl with his bare hands Mark Wahlberg was visibly uncomfortable throughout the entire ordeal, as if he hated the movie as much as everyone in the theatre did. The film reached its low point when our heroes encounter a crazy man who talks to plants. How do we know he's crazy? Well, because Zooey Deschanel looks at him and then points at her temple and twirls her finger around, giving us the universal third-graders sign for ""crazy"". Yes, she actually does that, just in case M Night's ACTUAL DIALOGUE didn't make that clear. All in all, a stunning failure even by the standards of a man who continues to make nothing but stunning failures."

On the other hand the movie ended so quickly and with such an anticlimax I was left , or so I felt, a little bit cheated especially since the very final scenes just lacked originality and just lacked the response I assumed it was going for .<br/><br/>I think my whole problem about the film was I was expecting something special from such a great writer/director but ultimately I set my standards too high and this time he just didn't hit the mark."

We get to see gore and shock and awe (MNS has decided to get with our need for explicit violence), and for a while it looks like a WMD attack. Then it becomes something more difficult to grasp: it's nature, and she's p.o'd at us for global warming.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays a nerdy school teacher, and it's difficult to watch him struggle to get into the skin of the character. As an actor he's best at showing us pent up anger, frustrated rage, and sociopathy. As a dweeb he just seems lost. In fact all the characters in this soap opera seem lost. I get why the Director wants to show ""average people,"" but ""boring"" people? He's married to a borderline, who's self involved and immature, and his friend (John Leguizamo) decides to let him know this at the outset of the movie. Why? Who knows! The end of the world seems a little more pressing than marital dynamics.<br/><br/>Everybody heads to the countryside, because someone deems it's safer, and yet nature seems to track them down and get them in bunches.

MNS decides to unleash Betty Buckley as a Norma Bates clone on the trio, but luckily she's felled by the suicide spores and has the funniest suicide scene in recent memory.<br/><br/>This is not a horror movie, but it is pretty horrible to watch MNS descend once again into adolescent movie making.

"Michelle-Picciano","4","1","4","14 June 2008"," The Happening is a satire...
","I first hated the film, but after thinking about it, I really do think Shyamalan meant for the film to criticize environmentalists. I believe, in other words, that ""The Happening"" actually spoofs, satirizes, or criticizes environmentalists who assert that our actions hurt nature and therefore we concomitantly hurt ourselves. Some reasons appear below, although more evidence would likely appear after I -- or someone who wants to email me -- more circumspectly examines the film: 1. Shyamalan created an absurd premise: Most environmentalists have stated that humans' wasteful lifestyles threaten natural life (plants, trees, water, among other elements); consequently, then, through hurting nature, they claim we hurt ourselves. Perhaps Shyamalan literalizes this idea since ""The Happening"" centers on plants, trees, and grass, thatbecause people threaten themrelease toxins which first confuse people, then paralyze them, and then convince them to kill themselves. In one absurd scene, for instance, a police officer stands in the street, wind blows such deadly chemicals over him, he freezes, then grabs his gun and shoots himself directly between the eyes. After he falls, a nearby, infected pedestrian finds the officer's gun and also shoots himself; a businesswoman then sees this same gun lying on the street and repeats the act on herself. If we accept that Shyamalan literalizes the environmentalists' theory, then the film's absurd circumstances actually make sense: because people threaten these plants, and such plants defend themselves through compelling people to commit suicide, the environmentalists' theory seems very literal; these people literally threaten nature and end up actually killing themselves. Dialogue further supports this idea: one prominent environmentalist in the film claims that trees talk to plants and plants to grass, creating a defense against humans. Because Shyamalan writes that such plants actually communicate with each other, we can certainly believe that he means to literalize the idea that plants have feelings and, therefore, hurt us to defend themselves, further underscoring the idea that, the more we hurt nature, the more we hurt ourselves. (Shyamalan evokes Philip K. Dick's science fiction, since this writer also and more famously literalized several theories.) 2. Shyamalan lampoons the film's nature-conscious characters: One man, who owns a green house, first mentions the idea that plants defend themselves against humans, and that's why people are dying. This guy, however, also uses binoculars to spy on neighbors; he loves hot-dogstheir shape and tasteand feels like people underestimate the food. Another woman, whom the main characters encounter much later in the film, lives alone, with no electricity; she makes everything herself, from only natural materials. Unfortunately, she also creates self-resembling dolls, hits children, and lives in paranoia; Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) repeatedly labels her ""crazy."" Because only the environmentally sensitive characters seem insane, Shyamalan suggests that these people are crazy because he means to lambaste environmentalists; ""The Happening,"" then, amounts to a film that satirizes them.<br/><br/>3. Shyamalan compares environmentalists to Pinocchio: In the film's second or third scene, Elliot (Mark Wahlberg), a high school science teacher, wants one male student to develop more of an interest in science. He tells this ""heartthrob"" that every year his nose will grow a particular inch longer. Elliot's statement resembles the environmentalist's claims that the sea level rises a particular measurement every so many yearsan effect of global warming. If you really analyze this scene, though, you realize that Elliot, through saying that his student's nose will grow, subtly compares the pupil to Pinocchio: whenever Pinocchio lies, his nose grows. Perhaps Shyamalan insults environmentalists here: through evoking the argument about growing sea levels, and then conjuring up images of a liar, the director implies that such environmentalists lie. This idea further supports the notion that ""The Happening"" satirizes environmentalist causes. (I thank Nick for uncovering this detail.) 4. Statistics in the film are claimed useful, but actually wrong: Throughout the film, characters like Julian (John Leguizamo) and Elliot mention that statistical probabilities comfort people. In one scene, while a girl hyperventilates over seeing dead bodies, Julian gives her a mathematical word problem, with statistics, to distract her (it hardly works). Julian also declares that there's a ""62% chance"" the chemicals never affected Princeton, New Jersey, where he's headed. He's wrong. Environmentalists, apparently, often cite statistical probabilities to support their belief that the earth will soon falter, and critics often refute such statisticsor at least claim they debunk them. Shyamalan, therefore, further lampoons environmentalists through such absurd characters asserting statistics and then finding themselves wrong.<br/><br/>5. The movie involves too much over-acting: Mark Wahlberg, Zoe Deschanel, and other actors over-act, or just act absurdly: Wahlberg seems too serious at inappropriate times; Deschanel widens her eyes too much. When trouble emerges, they exclaim lines like ""cheese and crackers,"" rather than 'dammit!' or 'shit,' or even 'Oh No.' (Dick also wrote such dialogue in his novels.) I believe that even the film's last line amounts to absurdity: two European teenage boys walk through a park and realize the plants have attacked their continent; one boy, amazed but unaffected, exclaims, ""Oh My God!"" The other one, the plants' chemicals intoxicating him, calmly says ""My bicycle."" It all makes no sense, suggesting that the film constitutes a farce or spoof.<br/><br/>6. The film's beginning suggests incongruity: The beginning scene displays beautiful blue skies, and the only problem involves tense violins, creating a crescendo of eventual sadness and drama. The blue skies stay beautiful, with bright white clouds, but only the music makes them tense. Since the blue skies are natural, we might believe that nature, what we actually see, is fine, but because the violins are man-made, the only source of tension is manfabricationand therefore any drama or problem unnaturally exists because man has fabricated it. Such an interpretation supports the claim that ""The Happening"" lampoons environmentalists through implying that problems with natureglobal warming for instancedo not actually occur; environmentalists have fabricated or dressed up these problems."
"BabyCheddarGoldfish","4","1","4","14 June 2008"," It Happens
","The non-spoiler part comes first, so if spoiler tags didn't scare you away, read on. I am a fan of Shyamalan's Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. I thought those, while not necessarily prolific, were very fun. The Village was more of a dud, and Lady in the Water was painful. I was hoping The Happening would be like his earlier works. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The good part of the movie is unsurprisingly, the suspense. MNS crafts it superbly. But the rest of the movie was just bad.<br/><br/>HERE BE THE SPOILERS The characters were not particularly strong -- the acting didn't feel natural (i.e. the girls in the first scene, Wahlberg teaching) and their actions didn't seem sensible. A large part of the story revolved around keeping a small girl alive after her father and mother died from the plants. Wahlberg and his wife take it upon themselves to protect her. Yet for some inexplicable reason, they let her watch people get killed over and over again, and, at Mrs. Jones' farmhouse, they bring her outside where they think the happening will kill them all. They want to be together when they die and the poor girl apparently has to suffer for their renewed love.<br/><br/>My other big problem was the plot and premise in general. Sure, having plants as the baddies sounds like it could be real fun, but the execution of said idea was just poor. At times, it bordered on self-parody (like when the officer and then the taxi driver and then a lady kill themselves in Philadelphia, in succession, with the same gun). And of course, what ""the happening"" actually is isn't explained (beyond some land equivalent of the red tide, which the plants use as a defense mechanism to protect against careless humans). There's a whole discussion throughout the movie about how science can't account for these certain forces. It's not convincing.<br/><br/>The culmination of all of this is, of course, in the ending, which was pathetic. The plants have rapidly evolved to kill off the pests that are humans, the incompetent and destructive would-be stewards of earth. The very last scene even shows this process happening again. So on one hand, Shyamalan establishes people as irresponsible/bad. Yet at the same time, Wahlberg's wife finds out she's pregnant. There is of course, a happy scene (it's a happy thing, right?) to make sure we as the audience realize that their lives are, for the most part, back to normal. But the next happening and the birth are very conflicting images and point to opposite conclusions. While this is not necessarily bad in concept, the concept is executed horribly.<br/><br/>So if you like Shyamalan, see the movie. If you like good suspense and can trudge through some bad plot to get it, see the movie. But if neither description fits you, heed the adage that (I paraphrase) ""crap happens"" and avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I won't go in depth, and I'm not going to say ""Boycott This Film"" because thats up to you, but hear me when I say that The Happening is a truly awful movie. Like everyone else, I was intrigued after I saw the rather creepy trailers for the movie. Besides Lady In The Water, I have loved and understood M Night's films. I think he is a wonderful director, who has incredible ideas. The idea part is where The Happening messes up completely. I read someplace that M Night thought of the idea on his way home from work and thought ""What if nature suddenly turned on us?"" A very disturbing and interesting premise that did not gel as a movie. It's like he had this original idea, but added lame characters instead of any explanation and believability to back up what could have been a terrifying movie. <br/><br/>The acting here is the worst part of the film. Rumors say that the lead role was written with Mark Wahlberg in mind, which I find hard to believe since he is wooden and totally wrong for the part just like the annoying Zooey Deschanel and a little girl that cannot act or cry. The script is mostly to blame as the dialogue doesn't flow and seems strained. There are unintentional funny moments, and the lines that are supposed to be humorous, just turn out pointless. The wind effect to make the plants look menacing, was stupid and added laughter instead of terror. I really like the themes in The Happening, but the characters ruin every ounce of suspense we could have felt.<br/><br/>Overall, The Happening scores points for another incredible James Newton Howard score and some (just a few) genuinely spooky scenes, like the opening scene in Central Park. But besides that I highly suggest that you don't see this movie and wait for a movie where the main character doesn't talk to houseplants and tells it that he isn't a threat. As for the R rating, some blood here and there just to add shocks to this dull and lifeless disappointment!"

It should have been re-written as a spoof on eco-horror films. Bad...simply bad. Sure there's some creepiness here and there, but any first year film school student can produce a creepy moment.

I used to use the following guideline...If there is a LOT of advance hype, you can bet it is because they want a big opening box office take, not because it is a great movie. It seems the really good ones gain momentum on their own, and people rave about it, causing it to gain strength and large viewing audiences. Mark Wahlberb will probably look back on this as one he should not have signed on for. It is sure beneath his usual fare. Also, there is no reason whatsoever to take anyone under 18 to see this.

I like Mark Wahlberg, but his acting in this was horrible, he spoke to everyone in the film like he was speaking to a child that stole the last cookie from the jar. All of the deaths were edited too, the screen cut away whenever something good was going to happen. Then in the middle of the film, after all of the commotion, everyone starts running away from the wind. How can anyone do that??? Then they meet an old crazy women with dolls and a fetish for slapping children. Then the massive conclusion.... Pregnancy.<br/><br/>I laughed with my wife to be in the cinema throughout. Avoid it if possible."
"PennStateGirl","3","1","4","14 June 2008"," A Disappointment
","I just left the theater and was so disappointed in this film. I am a great fan of M Night Shayamalan and was excited to see it. The first problem is that the acting is the worst I've seen in a very long time. Zooey Deschanel was just horrible. She spent most of the film giving us a ""deer in the headlights"" look. I get it...she was supposed to be scared. She didn't look scared, she just looked stupid. Mark Wahlberg wasn't much better. I felt like I was watching a tongue in cheek comedy. The bad acting was followed by a very lame ending The entire film was done to give us a politically correct message. Sad,thin plot...horrible acting. I've seen better ""made for TV"" movies! Such a waste of time!"
"npep2","2","1","4","14 June 2008"," Do not pay for this film.
","By far M. Night Shyamalan's worst film to date. The plot was terrible and was only exacerbated by very terrible writing/dialog. It seems that Shyamalan has taken a page out of George Lucas' book when it comes to writing. Throughout the movie you will keep saying ""are you serious?"" or ""there has got to be more."" I went into the movie not expecting much and I got exactly that. It is almost insulting that Shyamalan thought he could pass this movie off as a legitimate suspense film. When there are moments in the movie which are supposed to be eerie I literally broke out laughing at how ridiculous and unbelievable it was. I must give credit to the actors however, for managing to keep a straight face as they delivered their lines.<br/><br/>Avoid paying for this movie at all costs. Watch it as part of a ""double feature"", download it, or wait for it to come to DVD and then borrow it from a friend. Any way you do it, just make sure you do not spend a penny to see this movie. The hour and a half of your life that you lose is more than enough payment. No one deserves to make money off of this film."

Those types of movies are a dime a dozen and for him to fall to this level really stinks. The acting was really low grade and almost laughable at some parts.

"hsemhsem","3","1","4","14 June 2008"," Why The Happening is a disaster of a movie
","First off, the concept is mildly interesting. An apocalypse as a result of a defense mechanism by plants as a response to global warming. Mark Wahlberg is decent in the lead role, the score is appropriate if not special and the direction produces some fairly effective moments of genuine tension. However the script is an absolute embarrassment, and the premise is lazily thought through and clumsily introduced. It is strongly reminiscent of The Birds, but the reason The Birds is possibly the greatest horror film ever made is that the descent from banality into nightmare is slowly and carefully judged and subtly allows the viewer to make their own connection between the bird attacks and the sexual awakening of the lead female character. The Happening comes out as being completely depth-less, Cloverfield seems almost meaningful in comparison, and that has a tremendous thrill factor that The Happening lacks completely. Ultimately it is the ineffective and amateurish script that really lets the film down and makes it almost impossible to recommend to anyone but those people interested in how to construct unnerving park scenes. The worst film I've seen this year, a post previously occupied by Jumper."

Which I think makes the actors look bad. Zooey Deschanel is generally speaking a good actress, or at least a believable one, (Winter Passing, Hitchhikers Guide) however, in this film, I am very conscious of the fact that she rehearsed these lines. Leguizamo was also given some awful lines and directions.<br/><br/>Secondly there are wayyyy too many close ups in this movie. Shyamalan was trying very hard to force us to connect with these characters through technical visual cue's rather than through their performances.<br/><br/>Third, there was definitely some over the top, and uncalled for acts of violence that were fairly useless to the plot line, shot in slow motion; again, shyamalan trying to force us to connect.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Wahlberg and Deschanel reminisce on their first date and the dialog is just awwwwful, not one ounce of believability.<br/><br/>the soundtrack was also a little over the top. the best part of the film though was that it certainly had some really funny moments. <br/><br/>with all of that being said, I had a good time watching this film, although, I would have preferred to wait for it to come out on DVD."

I can't believe so many people buy into this outrageous crap. What happened to educated individuals with the ability to think and reason for themselves? If Holllywood or the mainstream media print it or say it, people just suck it up and believe it as if it is scientific fact.

Signs and The Village were so-and-so and Unbreakable was only marginally more tolerable than this, but The Happening has got to be his career low so far.<br/><br/>As if his direction wasn't bad enough. he also wrote the script, and what a catastrophe this turned out to be.

","I found this movie totally retarded. I saw a few other posts claiming a lot of people who don't like the movie probably were expecting just your typical run of the mill thriller movie... enter the stereotypical leading man who saves the day. I totally disagree.<br/><br/>The problem with this film begins with the story itself. I'm not sure if maybe it was a matter of delivery or acting, but I just couldn't swallow it. Plants and trees somehow cause people to commit suicide. Supposedly it's an airborne thing this seems to be in pockets mostly where large groups of people are concentrated and is just limited to a few states on the eastern part of the US (at least at first). The main characters of this movie somehow quickly arrive at this concocted conclusion, drop everything in their lives, head west, then stop and head for rural unpopulated areas.<br/><br/>There were just one after another case of bizarre situations, but I watched this move the entire time thinking I just can't see it happening this way in real life. The situations might be bizarre, but real people would never react this way. Although the acting wasn't all that good, I can't blame the actors or actresses. It almost was like Shyamalan had an idea, wrote it down and then let everyone just work out the details with no real thought. It was just a total mess.<br/><br/>I guess everything else about the movie, it's music, directing, acting, photography, etc.., really make no difference if the story itself is really bad.<br/><br/>I'd recommend skipping this one. I wouldn't even waste time watching it on regular network TV. It's just not worth it."
"Spit_and_Image","1","1","5","4 December 2008"," Night couldn't stay ahead of the wind
","Terrible. Terrible script, terrible direction, terrible acting.<br/><br/>Talented actors are shown as characters who alternately are zombies with blank faces and dead deliveries or idiots who somehow cannot manage to come up with an even half-sensible thought. Elliott's (Mark Wahlberg's) turn as the latter is BRUTAL - Shyamalan took a good actor, playing an apparently intelligent science teacher who's served as the guide for a group of toxin survivors, and made him into a blathering, stammering moron as the people he's leading press him to ""do something"" and he frantically begs them for ""time to think.""<br/><br/>Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley) goes from an apparently sweet hermit lady into a raging lunatic in a second, cracking the hand of an 8-year old girl who reaches for a cookie set out as part of the meal that Mrs. Jones is serving. And the 8-year old, implausibly, doesn't cry, scream, protest, whimper, run off, or otherwise react in any way. She's EIGHT!<br/><br/>In terms of shooting, I appreciate that Zooey Deschanel has beautiful eyes. I get it. I really do. But I don't need to see them so close, so often, to the point that I think you're shooting through a fish-eye lens and if I look really close the next time the shot goes in, I can get a retinal print from her. When you shoot her like that, you so often make her look childlike that she BECOMES childlike. Which is really weird when she's married, talking about affairs, and ends up pregnant at the end.<br/><br/>And the dialogue.... If randomly dropping poorly-written and context-inappropriate exchanges into the middle of other circumstances is good writing, then ""The Happening"" may be ""Citizen Kane."" But I think it makes the characters seem like they have an attention-deficit issue.<br/><br/>I'll even go so far as to make a writing suggestion to Night Shyamalan: it doesn't matter if your movie is about plants releasing toxins to kill off chunks of humanity in self-protection; you still can't make a character tell others to outrun the wind, without making it sound ridiculous. Because it IS ridiculous."

It looks to me as if he comes up with these bright (!) ideas that doesn't make any sense, and because of that the movies don't really have satisfactory finales.

","So the tagline for The Happening is ""We've Sensed It. We've Seen The Signs. NowIt's Happening.""<br/><br/>We've sensed it? Sensed what? Seen what signs? Yeah, we've seen ""Signs,"" but THE signs of some mysterious coming disaster? Maybe this ""we"" in the tagline is referring to the people that live in the parallel world takes place?<br/><br/>At any rate, the first half of the movie is a wonderful exercise in Shyamalan's ability to create an eerie atmosphere and to insert the unusual and otherworldly in an everyday situation. There are weird events taking place that are at first assumed to be the work of some kind of biological terrorist attack. There appears to be some kind of toxin that causes people to become lethargic and then suicidal, leading to some morbidly fascinating scenes such as one in which one construction worker after another silently walks off the scaffolding of a building, falling to their deaths on the ground below.<br/><br/>But it is in the reality of the situation that Shyamalan is completely lost. He doesn't have the first clue about how to direct groups of people, which takes away any sense of realism that the movie might have had. There is a scene in a café early in the movie where a large group of people are huddled trying to figure out what to do. One person mentions that the incident doesn't appear to be affecting anyone in an area 90 miles away, so everyone immediately stands up silently and marches out of the café without a word. It is impossible to see these as real, frightened people and not the underpaid film extras that they clearly are.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo turns in an outstanding performance but it overshadows his role, which doesn't command such a powerful actor. Mark Wahlberg is very watchable, as always, but it is sad to see so much character and plot development that literally goes nowhere. <br/><br/>It's difficult not to think of Village of the Damned when watching this movie, but the movie really falls on its face when one guy starts talking about, get this, a mysterious ability that plants have to target and kill specific predators. <br/><br/>I won't reveal the intricate details of what ""the happening"" is, but when it is revealed, the movie instantly turns irretrievably dumb and makes me pine for the time of the giant bug movies of the 1950s. All I will say is that there is a point in the movie where Wahlberg talks to a plant, asking it permission to be in a house. The goofiness is through the roof in this thing.<br/><br/>I also love the use of dialogue in the movie. There is one scene near the end of the film where Wahlberg and his wife have reached a state of hopelessness, believing that their deaths are imminent, and they start talking about the mood rings they tried out on their first date, joking about how the color that turned up indicated that she was horny. Great conversation to have in front of your 9-year-old just before you all suffer a quick and mysterious death!<br/><br/>The ""climax"" of the movie is the perfect description of the reason for my summary line, and the film ends with an indication that it's not over, and with me sleeping soundly and indifferently on my sofa"

","This is a good film marred by some of the worst acting I have seen in an A list movie such as this. But I was thoroughly engaged with the plot and if you are familiar with Shyamalan films, you cant fail to see his signature all over it. <br/><br/>Shyamalan loosely uses his plot structure of Signs as a template for the Happening. Only this time, there are more gory sequences than in any of his previous movies. Quite effective they are too that it made me squirm a few times. There are also moments of brilliance. In fact the movie starts magnificently, with a chilling opening sequence and there are great moments of foreboding fear peppered throughout. The main plot is something you will either buy into or you don't as with all Shyamalan's films. But the least you know about it, the better so I wont go into it. That said, if you don't buy into it, then there is very little else to enjoy because the acting and dialogue in this film is atrocious and potentially ruins the whole film. <br/><br/>Mark Whalberg plays the main antagonist but for the life of me, I cannot figure out what the hell he is trying to play. A wise teacher, a dork, a wise dork, or just plain annoying? I am just not sure and I didn't care as the performance was dreadful. Its clear that we are supposed to root for him but he is so unlikeable and irritating. Most of the other actors struggled to gain my sympathy too. Ultimately, I think the blame has to be on Shyamalan's terrible dialogue and shockingly sloppy direction over the actors. One thing I had always bank on with Shyamalan, is his ability to draw out great subtle performance from his leads. So what the hell happened here? Its as if he turned into an Ed Wood style film maker by calling a wrap on every first take. Its frustrating as there is a brilliant story here and excellent cinematography but its like looking at a great scenic painting with matchstick men graffiti doodled on it.<br/><br/>Its a damn shame."

The last grabbed the creatures tail and said; ""an elephant is like a rope."" Of such varied opinions, depending on your perspective, is the film ""The Happening."" I've read a lot of different views about the film, and, yes, it appears that I have a very different perspective.<br/><br/>First, and this is not directly about the film itself, I do not think graphic portrayals of suicide are ""entertaining."" I don't buy the ever increasing representation of so called ""realism"" that today's film makers seem to think is vital to what they are trying to communicate.<br/><br/>We've reached the point in our society where we can sit in darkened theaters eating popcorn, drinking Coke, and chug it all down while we're watching absolutely realistic portrayals of the most gruesome and downright sick representations of self inflicted death that you can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>This is our version of ""feeding the Christians to the lions."" I imagine the ancient Romans were also enjoying their snacks while they watched people being eaten alive by animals, burned alive etc. and indeed they also called it ""entertainment."" Just because we're doing it with special effects does not make us ""better"" than they were. What we're doing is just as much a sign of sickness, and is just as dangerous as what is portrayed in ""The Happening."" Our sickness is also self destructive. History has proved that; we're just not paying attention.<br/><br/>Regarding the movie, I honestly think that the story line itself had the same overall quality as Hitchcock's ""The Birds."" It they had underplayed the deaths, instead of throwing them in our faces with hot ""air sick bag"" graphic portrayals, it's possible they could have had a truly classic ""fright film"" with as one reviewer stated, the atmosphere of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode.

If we didn't want to believe this with these first three examples ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" completely sealed the belief that we had.<br/><br/>For ""The Happening"" everything seemed to be changing. From an ad campaign that showed little or nothing about the story until a trailer that only anticipated an apocalypse film, the assumptions began to run and we thought that Shyamalan was returning; the star director-screenwriter of ""The Sixth sense"" is back. But it didn't. I can summarize what I think of this movie in two words: Great disappointment. Why? <br/><br/>Because even though the premise of nature vs. man was interesting and the beginning of the tape, with that single number of suicides, that impacts any, like the story line advancing becomes more predictable, unbelievable and culminate with a very bad ending, so messianic, the couple protagonist survive through a coincidence of fate (where love also has something to do). Because the moral conflict that facing the players is irrelevant, the woman who refuses to mature and the men that can't understand the needs of his wife, in some point of the movie it disappears like a breath of air. Because the performances are appalling, one of the worst Wahlberg roles, you don't believe him absolutely nothing because the majority of his lines are stupid and lacking in naturalness, and neither Zooey Deschanel do a good work, in fact, Does anyone believe her character?. And because, Does anyone remember the end of ""28 weeks later""? Yes, France too.<br/><br/>To summarize, the movie isn't good because it is not what is expected of someone that made a great film the first time. OK, I must admit, it was beginner lucky."

","It wasn't that long ago that I thought M. Night Shyamalan was a genius. However after Lady in the Water and The Happening, I now believe he is a talented filmmaker who caught lightning in a bottle early in his career. Perhaps it is time that M. Night Shyamalan rethinks the notion that he can write, produce, direct and still deliver a quality film every two years. His work is starting to like it has been rushed out the door without fulfilling its potential.<br/><br/>The Village, Lady in the Water, and The Happening all had a workable concept at the core. In all three cases the actors delivered. However at the end of the day it was the writing that brought the films down. It is time that M. Night Shyamalan either quits rushing his half developed ideas into production or brings in someone to help complete his stories.<br/><br/>While watching Lady in the Water, I felt like the actors were improvising at times and making the story up as they went along. I believe this is a result of M. Night Shyamalan making the story up as he went along. The good news is that The Happening is a much better product than Lady in the Water. However, the thoughtful writing that made Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs so enjoyable has all but left the building. The frustrating thing about The Happening is that you get a briefly glimpse of the magic that made M. Night Shyamalan's earlier films so enjoyable. However the magic quickly fizzles. The Happening is simply a compelling idea that fails to play out.<br/><br/>Sad to say it, but I have absolutely no reason to recommend this film."
"cyclopsgr-1","6","1","5","4 July 2008"," Did it actually happened?
","I watched ""the happening"" yesterday at a cinema in Athens (Greece) along with four (4) others.First of all i have to confess that i am deeply sad of the damage pirate downloading from the internet does to the movie industry.I am a horror/thriller movie fan.I have watched hundreds of movies in the past and in my opinion this one was atmospherically scaring enough.There were moments i even spoke out loud (oh no, and things like that) and trust me i am not used to express my anxiety,fear or terror with the rest of the viewers. There is one thing that i hate in movies in general that i consider to be the worst thing to happen that descends me in reality and reminds me that this is just a movie i watch and these characters are just actors pretending their script.Do you imagine what is this that turns me down in a movie? ? Whenever i see a microphone hanging from the top of the screen in the middle of the plot i feel completely stupid.I would excuse it in a b-movie or in one of a low budget.But not in an M. Night Shyamalan movie.I wonder don't these guys watch the movie closely in the montage to cut off mistakes? Watch carefully the dinner scene at the old house with the old lady and you will notice a microphone hanging in the top middle. Except of this 'The happening' i think is a good movie not a masterpiece, i would say 'THE MIST' was much better in acting and in plot.If you want to spend an interesting evening i would suggest it with no remorse."

","This is probably most underestimated movie of a decade. Shyamalan suffers greatly for his first widely known picture - 6th sense. People thought it was about twists and ghosts while it says there are no ghosts, there are our dead relatives of which memories are still strong and alive. We owe sometimes something to those who were living among us. MNS always takes the genre only to say something original using language of that genre. He took comic hero in Unbreakable to say that being hero means staying with wife and kid. In SF styled 'Signs' he was talking that there is no senseless life and all things you don't understand in this moment may find reason later (glasses full of water everywhere - those glasses are the signs, also asthma etc.). 'The Happening' is something like catastrophic movies of 70's. And whats the ultimate catastrophe? Marriage crisis. Everything what's happening is just metaphor. Thats why danger ends when heroes draw together. World loses all reason because they have forgotten what is the color of love (green). Dialogs are simple, but good. Acting also. All fits to scheme of normal people trying to survive. They are not superheroes meant to save the world but only to save themselves."
"Systematicer","8","1","5","1 July 2008"," Just a few personal thoughts from me for people who have already seen The Happening
","I have always found the idea interesting of nature being more interwoven with human beings and their actions than we can scientifically prove at this time in history. After all, human beings don't stand above nature but are a part of it, and maybe you could even say nature created us, making nature a part of us. <br/><br/>So consequently any movie that incorporates and deals with this idea becomes a more valuable movie to me, no matter in what form this idea is part of the story. If it is something like nature protecting its population against an outside threat as in War of the Words, or if it is nature protecting itself against the threat that is the human race, as is the idea of this film. I especially enjoy the concept of human race being like a virus to nature. <br/><br/>In The Happening this is very much the case and nature reacts to the human disease suddenly and mercilessly. It starts in the biggest park in the biggest city of the world. Makes sense...well, movie-sense, to be fair. At the same time it hits some construction workers who are high up on a building three blocks away from Central Park. Makes sense...well...exactly, it makes movie-sense. Next we have another park in an American city that David Lynch loves to hate. Ding dong. Now it's clear what's going on here. Nature VS Humaniy: Round 1 <br/><br/>People...Americans...New Yorkers, to be specific, naturally assume it's a terrorist attack. Makes sen...exactly. It's something we had in many disaster movies since 9/11. War of the Worlds, Cloverfield,... That's how it is and I'll just leave it at that. In The Happening it obviously isn't terrorists. Nature turned against humans, in the most original way that I have seen so far in a film.<br/><br/>Back to the plot. Our protagonists, a science teacher, his girlfriend and their friends, another teacher with a daughter, want to leave the affected area (the thirteen colonies of Great Britain, basically) but their train stops in the middle of nowhere in some little town because the train conductors ""lost contact"". Long story short, turns out that smaller and smaller groups of people are being attacked. If you can say ""attacked"". Either way, it's a fascinating concept, I think. I asked myself what I would have done in this situation. I thought it probably would be the safest to get away from any other human life form and stay at a place where nobody else is around within a radius of a mile or so. <br/><br/>The audience that I saw it with reacted quite strongly to the film. The biggest reaction came from, what I think was quite a mundane scene. After waking up in the morning Marky Mark searches for the old lady at whose place they stayed the night and enters what supposedly is her bedroom. He slowly approaches the bed. We, the audience, don't see much. We see some legs on the bed as he opens the door. Legs that look like that of a doll, which in the end turns out to be just that. Absurdly, though, Wahlberg, while slowly approaching the bed, says the old lady's name to the thing on the bed. He must have seen that it is a doll, right? I mean, come on. Anyway. So we have tense music playing and all that and then we finally see the doll on the bed. The camera stays grotesquely long on the doll's face and we start to ask ourselves if maybe the old lady turned into the doll. Gladly the film doesn't go that way. We learn that the lady in fact did not turn into a doll when she suddenly screams at our hero and jumps out of a corner. And she jumps and screams at the audience, as the camera is right in front of her. She looked freakier than she did the evening before. And the theater jumped and screamed too. I don't know what was up with that. Had I seen this scene alone at home I would have thought to myself that this is some weak and conventional crap, but since I witnessed what strong reactions the scene got I can't possibly condemn this conventional yet bizarre scene. <br/><br/>Overall the audience was quite jumpy throughout the whole film and especially during the suicide scenes. But it also got quite a few laughs. One such scene I remember because it got the biggest laugh from me was when the science teacher spoke to the plant, saying that he comes in peace. I found it amusing but not ridiculous. While speaking to the plant he notices that it is a plastic plant. ""I'm talking to a plastic plant."" That was a good joke, I thought. Other than that I remember that the scene with the construction workers apparently falling down the sky evoked some laughter. And I understand why. It was a most grotesque event, in a film that was full of grotesque events. Frighting, but so unusual and out there that you can't help but be amused by it. <br/><br/>One of the main reasons why I watch films is because they can make you believe that something you know won't and can not ever happen does actually happen. You are safe and after two hours it's over, which is why you just role with it. And that's what the audience's job is when there is something outrageously unlikely shown on screen - to role with it. You are not doing yourself a favor if you reject the most outrageous concepts of cinema. The filmmaker's job is it to build a vehicle that you can role with, without the passengers falling out of the vehicle, if you pardon my allegorical speaking. Well, this ride worked for me."
"thgregory-1","1","1","5","1 July 2008"," Lets face it, this was in no way a work of art.
","The fact that I have seen someone actually call this film art is a horrible disgrace to the art of film. Whether or not the film had a ""B"" movie vibe, the film was still a horribly produced film. This film failed to meet any level of decency in my opinion.<br/><br/>As far as the comment which called this film art is concerned allow me to address another thing. That same comment says that we are conditioned to follow the typical movie set up which includes a hero who knows all the ""right"" things to do and say and is witty and what not and that we expect these grand sequels. Well allow me to point out there is a reason we like to see a hero in a film and that is because any worthy movie has a worthy protagonist to watch. The protagonist doesn't need to be a hero but should obviously be able to somehow combat his own narrative problem. <br/><br/>A work of art is something in the ballpark of 2001 A Space Odyssey, Donnie Darko, any number of Wes Anderson films, and of course the numerous films done by the Coehn Brothers. If this movie was meant to be a ""B"" movie it was still horribly done and completely ridiculous from the begging to the end. I am sorry but this was quite possibly one of the worst mistakes I have ever seen. <br/><br/>As for the director, he is still a talented director and in my opinion made a mistake and it happens directors will almost inevitably make a film that is par or even below par."
"Cinexcellence","6","1","5","29 June 2008"," The Happening is a mixed bag
","The Happening is the latest from director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense). I've enjoyed most of his past work (including Lady in the Water). I wanted to see this without knowing too much about the film. So on Thursday afternoon I turned off my RSS feeder and pretty much avoided the Internet like a plague. Armed only with the knowledge of the previews, I watched The Happening Saturday afternoon.<br/><br/>The story follows Elliot and Alma Moore (played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel), a couple living in Philadelphia, the setting of most of Shyamalan's films. A catastrophe strikes in New York, causing large numbers of people to commit suicide. Fearing the growing threat, Elliot and Alma flee Philadelphia in an attempt to escape the attack.<br/><br/>The Happening has a peculiar balance between humor, seriousness, and the morbid. The film was advertised as M. Night Shyamalan's first film with an R-rating (""for violent and disturbing images""), which I think ended up being a problem for the film. Many people have compared him to Alfred Hitchcock (""the master of suspense""), and rightly so. In previous films, Shyamalan has worked well in the PG-13-rating. He's great at introducing suspense and startling the audience. Think of the sprinklers in Lady in the Water. With his latest film, however, the horror is justÂ…there. There were suspenseful moments that I liked (the trees, he tracking shot with the policeman and the cars, etc.), but a good deal of it seemed there just to justify the rating than advance the story.<br/><br/>The acting in the film didn't do it for me, either. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, two good actors I might add (Think The Depareted and All the Real Girls), just didn't seem to fit. Should we blame the acting or the script? I don't know. Coupled with that is the on-the-nose dialgue.<br/><br/>I liked the relationship between their characters. The change in Zooey's character from the beginning to the end is especially intriguing to me. I would have loved to see more development between their characters.<br/><br/>Now I loved the concept of the film. The idea behind the film. It's so fantastic, but it's also somewhat believable, which is a feat in itself. As far as the story is concerned, I also loved the way it ended. A really nice touch.<br/><br/>I guess it boils down to how much M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make The Happening feel like a classic ""B"" disaster flick and how much of it just didn't work. Maybe I need to watch more movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing."
"jihad1990","1","1","5","28 June 2008"," Do you call it a movie?
","Well what do you expect from M Shylaman..... nothing! A waste of time.<br/><br/>The happening should not be categorized as a movie it should be categorized as a TV sequel. I mean, how can you compress the story for 90mins? I don't even get the point on what he is trying to convey to the movie. 1 hour of wind passing by and killing people?! There is no even proof that the nature is responsible for killing those people because the story is not sufficient in supporting such claim... Isn't stupid? I don't believe either that this is for smart people, because the story is dry there is nothing to think or thrill of.<br/><br/>I give it 1/10. poor plot quality."

","What else could you expect from M. Night. Shyamalan? It was in his typical style which brought a certain something to it. There was hardly any ""gore"" which from speaking to some people they found disappointing, but I feel it just added to the feel of the movie... it's not meant to be a gore-fest. I'm certain however if the certificate had of been raised to an 18 we certainly would of seen the complete scene of the man getting run over by the lawn mower.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to any of Shyamalan's fans, but don't expect loads of blood. A couple of jumpy tense moments but that's it.<br/><br/>There's a good message in it."

We went in with no great expectations for horror or ""monsters"" because that's not what Shyamalan does. His movies are intelligent thrillers. The horror is in your own mind. I liked the movie, although the acting was bottom notch. The idea of plants fighting back was fresh. The gore was almost too much for me, personally, but bearable. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."

I am a massive movie fan, and although I cant say this is one of my favourite movies, I honestly don't think its one of the worst I've seen. The characters are all rather boring, apart from Mrs Jones, who I think was one of the only interesting characters to watch and one of the only characters that kept the audience guessing. I found some of the scenes scary. Afterall, it is supposed to be a frightening movie. Its at least disturbing. My advice though is, please don't show this movie to emos.

"bgolden-2","1","1","5","24 June 2008"," Sorry, but don't waste your money!
","I am a big fan of every Shyamalan movie since the first. Most people don't like ""Lady In The Water"" or ""The Village"", but I think they're great! I own all his movies on DVD. The reason I say this is so that you know I enjoy his work and didn't have anything against him before setting foot in the theater.<br/><br/>With that said, I can't believe how horrible ""The Happening"" is!! I can't say the acting was bad since Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo were both great! The problem was that they were both over-shadowed by Mark Wahlberg's in-ability to act! He acts like my grandmother drives!!!...and she's dead! I don't understand why he was chosen to lead this movie when M. Night has made so many good choices in the past -i.e. Bruce Willis, Paul Giamatti, etc.<br/><br/>Secondly, I've always loved the ""big picture"" moral to some of his movies. ""Signs"" taught us that everything happens for a reason, no matter how bad. ""The Village"" showed that you can't hide from your past. Even ""Lady In The Water"" kind of made you feel that everyone has a purpose in life. But without giving anything away, this movies ""message"" - if it was intended - is so corny that I was in shock! I'm not saying he has to stick with a formula to his movies, or that they all have to have a deep meaning, but at least treat me like an adult! I'm not spoiling the movie, just saying that I've never felt so scolded by a film before! Hopefully I've saved you some money. But more so, hopefully M. Night learns a lesson with this film and goes back a few steps. I'm still a huge fan - I've loved 5 out of 6 films he's directed that I've seen - I just hope I love the next one!"
"Whitewolf34","5","1","5","24 June 2008"," Could have been worse really.....
","After hearing the negative buzz surrounding this film, I still felt obliged to see it, hoping that people were upset there was no 'sixth sense' type ending. <br/><br/>What I found were flaws that didn't really effect the story itself, but rather the actual process of the film. The plot is actually pretty good for a horror movie, with the scary parts working pretty much every time. <br/><br/>It was the casting I was most disappointed with. Usually Mark Wahlberg is awesome(where was his Oscar Nome for Boogie Nights?) but is terribly miscast here. Usually M. Night casts perfectly, but Wahlberg's best performances come from his intensity and fearless roles. Here you frustratingly want that from him, but is held back by almost whining his way through his lines. And poor Zooey. I really don't know what she's trying to do in this film and found it uncomfortable to watch her seemingly struggle to 'act'. I absolutely adore her in her other roles, so I blame you M. Night. <br/><br/>But the story works as a good piece of horror. Where do you hide from mother nature?"

The movie just goes down hill from there, and as for the ""R"" rating, well that probably the biggest mystery about this movie as it was easily a PG13.<br/><br/>sigh... sadly I think M.

I kind of expected him to be like one of those authors that write the perfect first novel, and then disappear.<br/><br/>One thing NOBODY has mentioned.

","I like M. Night Shyamalan and all of his movies, but every one has gotten worst than the last. Of course this was supposed to be his comeback. So wasn't it usually supposed to be good? Well unfortunately not, and as the viewer next to me (you'll be hearing about him) said, ""Oh great, a movie by Shamalammy ding dong"" which is exactly what Shymalan was like with this movie. And right after that he said, ""I'm gonna hate this"". And we did. The whole theater did.<br/><br/>This movie started off bad and only got worse with the plot, acting, and dialogue. The actors are never believable and Shyamalan would have been better off with someone like Bruce Willis. And there is nothing to say about the god-awful plot. Plants? Really, you can't think of anything better than plants? And there is no suspense. Nothing builds up to the reason why people commit suicide and one big complaint. Where was the twist? Every one of his movies should have a twist. Maybe it was for the better and and it saved us from watching an even worse movie. <br/><br/>One good thing. One. The soundtrack was well done and ominous working well when the crazy lady starts smashing her head into the walls and windows.

"neil-476","5","1","5","19 June 2008"," Could be worse. But could be quite a lot better.
","I'm an old enough film enthusiast to remember what it was like before the internet - you found about films from the newspaper film critic, maybe a movie magazine programme on TV, maybe a movie magazine from the newsagent. 3 voices, maximum, and easy enough to ignore. These days, the quantity of opinion on the IMDb alone means that, if you're inclined to read about films before you go to see them, it's almost impossible to go in without some preconceptions.<br/><br/>So I took my seat knowing that The Happening had a substantial bad press, and I find myself wondering what I would have thought about it had I not been carrying the opinions of others with me. Because I didn't find it as bad as it was painted.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - it is heavily flawed. The worst flaw is the script. There is much ""direlogue"", character development is somewhat illogical, you leave the movie with thousands of unanswered questions (hundreds of people are dumped off a train in a small town, have a meeting in a diner, and then scream off in a host of cars - er, where did those cars come from? I didn't spot a Hertz next to the diner), there are moments when you really aren't sure what sort of film you're watching, the villains of the piece menacingly wave their branches around (ooh, scary!)... and I think the script and direction are responsible for Zooey Deschanel giving what is likely to be the worst performance of her career. And, given the amount of career she still has left, that's saying something (it gets better towards the end, but in the first half of the film she is astonishingly bad).<br/><br/>So what is there that's good? Well, the idea isn't bad. It would better suit an episode of Twilight Zone, but it's still a reasonable idea for a movie. The film gives a nice sense of a small group of people doing their best to survive as civilisation crumbles around their ears. And there are a number of sequences which successfully deliver quite effective shocks.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that I'm easily pleased, and that I have a particular soft spot for crumbling civilisation stories, I quite enjoyed The Happening (dreadful title, though)."

","I enjoyed this movie knowing I would be in the minority, as I tend to be a bit more discerning in my taste in both books and movies.<br/><br/>It is of course understandable why the masses-who have been raised on the top forty pap of todays commercially engineered fare, where demographics are used to gauge and tweak the final product in order to harvest the highest take at the box office-would dislike this movie.<br/><br/>MNS I consider to be a modern day artist with a great creative imagination. It takes courage to try and produce an original and creative story that would perplex your average run-of-the-mill, garden variety movie goer, who is easier entertained by comic book plot machinations, where the hero and the villain are drawn out for them, requiring nothing of the movie goers own mental participation.<br/><br/>Today our planet, is being inundated with man's scrapping of the planets skin to get at the earthy pustules of fuel, cyclones kill thousands, earthquakes kill more, record tornados, rivers cresting and flooding the mid-west,brain eating lake amoebas, bird flu, mrsa, Ebola, acid rain, flesh eating virus, and man pours millions of tons of contaminates into the air, dumps billions of tons of sewage into the rivers, streams, lakes, and the sea. Last year it snowed in down town Bagdad when it hasn't happened in distant memory, and on the same day a tornado touched down in Vancouer Washington where they have never had tornado's.......so why couldn't the earth evolve a self defense mechanism? Or maybe it has.....and we're beginning to reap the evil we have sown. <br/><br/>It so easy to want to see a movie where the villains are laser toting aliens from outer space, or drug crazed murderers, sporting the latest shades, and cool glocks. Or the glamorized conflicted hero who eventually destroy their Nemesis with violence. These movies of course most be decorated up with the latest special effects, explosions, car chases, and/or erotic couplings to further spike the response of the numbed cerebral cortex's of the programmed movie masses so they fork over their money like zombies.<br/><br/>No one wants to consider that the collective defense of the planet's flora could ever evolve a way to save itself from the planets real enemy.....us. Movie goers do not want to think of themselves as the evil enemy of Mother Earth....because then how could the movie have a happy ending?<br/><br/>This movie also requires the viewer to fill in some of the blanks, MNS doesn't spell it out for you, yet he puts in all the hints, the evidence for you to follow....This is a good satisfying movie, but it is not for everyone. It requires the movie goer to think in the bigger scope of our imagination, where on this bluish orb teeming with life, hurtling through the cold vacuum of eternity, that maybe we really are the earth's terminal illness....and the planet is reacting, with spasms, fevers, and anti bodies.........."

","The Happening is M. Night Shyamalan's first collaboration with 20th Century Fox (his previous films were financed by Disney) and, probably because of the shift in production company, his first R-rated feature (a bit of an oddity, considering Fox even had Die Hard 4.0 reduced to a PG-13). Does this mean it's a full-blown horror movie? No. It's just as low-key and subtle as The Sixth Sense or Signs - with added blood.<br/><br/>The ""happening"" of the title refers to a bizarre incident that occurs in Central Park, New York, and then spreads to the rest of the city. Basically, we're talking about some sort of airborne virus (perhaps released by terrorists) that causes sudden inability to speak, disorientation and, finally, an urge to commit suicide. The substance or whatever it is starts invading other states as well, and soon all of the Northern East Coast is contaminated, causing people to run for their lives. One of them is a Science teacher (Mark Wahlberg) who tries to save himself, his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and a colleague (John Leguizamo). As the situation gets more and more unbearable, he comes to realize the ""virus"" might be nature reacting to all the bad things mankind has done to the world.<br/><br/>Some might say The Happening is a horror version of The Day After Tomorrow, minus the ice, since both flicks seem to warn us about toying too much with nature. It's a good point, but Shyamalan goes beyond aiming for sheer popcorn entertainment: unlike Roland Emmerich's disaster movie, his work is more paced, poetic and thoughtful. He gives his theory time to breathe and reach through to us, while at the same time retaining a sense of mystery, obviously inspired by Hitchcock's decision to not reveal too much in The Birds (in fact, he revealed nothing at all). Perhaps, though, it's best to draw parallels with Spielberg's War of the Worlds, echoes of which are to be found in the tone of the film and Wahlberg's humble ""common man"" portrayal, aided by Deschanel. Leguizamo, on the other hand, although a terrific actor when he gets it right (see Land of the Dead), isn't on screen long enough to really make us care for him.<br/><br/>And now, what most people argue about in a Shyamalan film: the ending. It's fairly safe to say there's no twist (what was it gonna be? Aliens? Or maybe it was all just a dream?), and that's a good thing because a parable of the fall of humanity wouldn't benefit from that kind of closure. However, considering the awesome build-up (the scene where an infected man gets eaten by lions truly justifies the R), it's a pity to see The Happening end on a syrupy note. At least until the real epilogue is revealed, one that proves, once again, that Shyamalan really has realized the Signs misstep won't be repeated.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","I purposely went into this movie knowing nothing about it. We learned from his debut film and hit ""The Sixth Sense"", that you should not try to find out about his movies' plots before you go see it. After the success of ""The Sixth Sense"", the reviews had been mixed. However, I still consider his movies must-sees on the big screen. While I liked ""The Village"", ""Signs"" was just so-so. But I positively hated ""The Lady in the Water"" to the point that I almost walked out on it. After that, I have learned not to expect too much anymore.<br/><br/>Now in this latest one ""The Happening,"" the concept is very interesting. People in the Northeast United States are suddenly stricken with an inexplicable urge to kill themselves. You can imagine the tension built around people trying to figure out and escape this unknown entity that seems to be coming from the wind and the plants around them. As I wrote that last sentence, it seems to be an absurd storyline. But on screen as directed by the suspense master M. Night, it was not bad at all. The way it was rendered made me empathize with the plight of these hapless people.<br/><br/>The lead star is Marky Mark Walberg was like I have never seen him before. He plays a high school science teacher in Philadelphia in this one. He struggles with his own problems with his wife (played by the very cute Zooey Deschamel) as he tries to escape the unknown scourge of nature. The train they were riding to get out of town had to make a forced stop in small town Filbert, Pennsylvania as transportation systems also go haywire. From there it was a process of figuring out how on earth they could keep alive.<br/><br/>Maybe it will take an open attitude to like this film. Skeptics and nit-pickers will find a lot of things to criticize. For me, I liked this movie as a whole. The corny parts were there all right, but I felt they can just be glossed over without affecting the overall feel. Just be there to ""enjoy"" the tension and the atmosphere of the whole (hopefully unreal) human experience unfolding on the screen. It is most definitely there for all of us to feel and be enveloped in.<br/><br/>P.S. As a bonus, they finally showed the trailer of the very hush-hush upcoming ""X-Files"" Movie!!! That is definitely my most anticipated movie event in the coming month."

Why didn't anyone talk to him at the funeral scene? M. Night, do you honestly believe that no one figured out your 'twist ending.' Give give me a break...And as for 'The Village,' you mean to tell me that a blind woman can navigate her way through the woods and find her way to civilization? Are we really that stupid to fall for such an idiotic plot as that? I mean, did she secretly have a gps navigator telling her when to turn left or right? And why in the hell would anyone want to subject their loved ones to a 'terror' beyond the woods...rather than face the reality of day to day living. STUPID! 'The Village' was such an easy film to figure out. Hey! What about those ridiculous aliens in 'Signs.' I laughed so hard when I saw them.

","Okay, let me start by saying that I'm a HUGE M. Night Shyamalan fan: I loved his early movies and especially ""Unbreakable"" which is (by far) one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>BUT... even if all his movies have flaws and I can understand people not liking them, I just don't understand what's happening to him...<br/><br/>He still managed to make me want to SEE this movie because I thought the story would be gripping and fascinating but as with ""Lady in the water"", it seems M. Night Shyamalan has lost his magic touch.<br/><br/>The beginning is good, very good... I liked the fact that nobody knows what's happening, I liked all the mysteries, I liked the graphic deaths (there's much more blood than in his previous films)... I liked everything about it... I was so happy to finally get the feeling I had when I watched ""the 6th sense""... THEN everything went wrong... from the dialogs (which are by far some of the stupidest dialogs I have ever heard... everybody was just laughing in the theater) to the story itself which can not have been written by an adult...I like when a movie appeals to our inner child but here... come on, the end is PATHETIC!<br/><br/>Nowadays a lot of movies only rely on CGI and stunt scenes, so they hide their lacks of stories behind huge effects... here there's no CGI, almost no stunt scenes so since there's no story, the movie is just empty... it's like passing a beautiful gate to take a road which leads nowhere. <br/><br/>The revelation of the mystery is made half way through by one of the supporting roles (so what's the point of watching the rest?), there are COUNTLESS sub-stories that are really boring (what's the point with the lady in the house?, what happens to the people in the other house? What about the little girl) and it ends just like that, leaving a feeling of huge disappointment.<br/><br/>As for the actors...what can I say.... it just seemed to me that they were not concerned and bored throughout the movie... they must say those lines and you never believe one word of what they say...there's absolutely no chemistry between them and you can not believe those two are married. I love both of the leading roles but I have to say they have never been that bad in a movie.<br/><br/>So this movie has a good beginning but that's about it... oh yes, there's another good point in the movie... it is short... <br/><br/>Please M. Night Shyamalan, go back to what you were doing, I'm missing you so much and even though I still trust your ability to make good movies, I still hope you'll react in a good way and make movies you used to.<br/><br/>So for me it's probably M. Night Shyamalan's worst film to date...and it hurts me to say that !"

"zarcom1","Null","1","5","16 June 2008"," It Happened One Night. . .
","As a writer, I enjoyed The Happening because I recognized it immediately as M. Night's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.<br/><br/>He pulls out headlines from the news--the disappearance of bees, the mysterious red tide, a lethal prehistoric bacteria discovered in Australia--and uses the real or perceived threats from these as the backdrop to develop fear. In fact, the three fears are shared and spaced evenly in the beginning, middle and near the end of the film.<br/><br/>Instead of killer birds, there are killer plants. Well, actually the plants emit the neurotoxin that induces people into a state of creative suicide. Instead of the caged peace-loving lovebirds in Hitchcock's film, there are small houseplants--like cactus and succulents present in the homes they seek refuge in. True, there is no icy blonde like Tippi Hendron to save, but Zooey emits a blue-eyed vacant look and she's emotionally detached. Instead of crossing over by motorboat to the sleepy community of Bodega Bay, the main characters enter the small town of Filbert, which coincidentally, is the name for a small nut. The action moves to smaller and smaller groups and locations until it centers on three main characters--the husband, wife and their friends' 8-year old daughter.<br/><br/>There are horrific and violent scenes implied in the movie. We see the calm movement of people intent on offing themselves via lions, lawnmowers, guns, ropes, broken glass, etc. Sort of reminded me of the Suicidal Bunnies book.<br/><br/>Most fans of Night are used to tidy endings wrapped up with a bow--endings filled with heightened emotion and resolution. But he left this film open-ended, much like The Birds. The first attack was a warning to mankind. The plants are mad, menacing and malicious. Are they out to rid the planet of mankind, because man has not been kind to the planet? Maybe. We kill plants, don't we? And eat them! Not me though. Really, if any plants are listening, I've never liked salad.<br/><br/>At the conclusion, the happy family is filled with the promise of life back to a semi-state of normal except with a lot less people on the streets. Also the promise of a positive pregnancy test. Life goes on, right? The conflict is over. Things are back to normal. . .or are they?"
"seawalker","5","1","5","16 June 2008"," A good idea, but not allied to a strong story.
","Out of the films that M. Night Shyamalan has made that I have seen, ""The Happening"" is definitely the worst.<br/><br/>The dialogue is terrible. The acting is variable. (The worst culprit is sexy Zooey Deschanel, who is wide eyed and, actually, kind of dreadful. Also, no matter how good he has been in other movies, Mark Wahlberg is just not a high school science teacher. Think how good somebody like Tim Robbins or Jeff Goldblum might have been in the same role.) The plot meanders about, going nowhere in particular, and at no particular speed. It is true: ""The Happening"" is a disappointment. For M. Night Shyamalan the halcyon days of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" seem a long, long time ago. (Can I admit at this point that I have liked all of his films, including ""Lady In The Water""? Credibility blown, methinks!)<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is still a genius. (Yes he is, and I will get my Brother to fight anybody who disagrees with me.) Even a minor entry in his oeuvre is a little bit special and something to be savoured. There is not a Director today (OK, maybe David Lynch) who can match him for generating a mood of dread, disquiet and other worldliness. There are moments in ""The Happening"" where you literally hold your breath as you wonder what is going to happen next: The start and end sequences, the final moments of Betty Buckley and John Leguizamo's characters, the conversation with the railway staff, the wind moving through the trees...<br/><br/>""The Happening"" has a good central idea and is an unashamed environmentally aware movie, made at a time where every Tom, Dick, Harry and automobile corporation is jumping on the Green bandwagon. It imagines a logical conclusion of the Gaia Hypothesis: If the Earth is a single organism, and is being threatened, what would happen if the Earth tried to defend itself against the aggressor?<br/><br/>It is a good idea, but sadly, ""The Happening"" has not allied it to a strong story. Such a shame, but M. Night Shyamalan will be back. Do not doubt it. He is a true original and we need more true originals."
"evos_vossie","1","1","5","15 June 2008"," Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.
","First and foremost: This is the first movie I actually walked out of in a long time. After seeing the kids scream profanities at a few hicks in a shack in Pennsylvania and then getting their brains blown out in the most artificial, robotic way possible I instinctually left the theatre. The rest of the day I suffered the indignity of having the sequence of a slow-motion Whalberg running and yelling ""Noooooo"" burnt into my psyche. One of the worst moments in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The overall message of the movie was actually quite agreeable. Despite the horrific acting and shock effect like death scenes which the movie seemed to be using as a crutch, I ended up rooting for the trees not only because of the mindset of humanity inside and out of the realm of ""The Happening"" but also because of the lackluster effort that spawned this movie in the first place. Aside from the disastrous acting and dialogue, the directing seemed to be the worst aspect of this film with the emotional scenes coming at the audience like shrapnel, a completely awkward subplot consisting of some sort of dysfunctional relationship between the protagonists, and John Leguizamo fumbling with math riddles as the death potion is coming through a slit in the ceiling of his party's jeep to name a few. Where as Indiana Jones was targeting ten year olds, The Happening seemed to be targeting idiots in general with its asinine like presentation of what was a potentially promising plot. If you want to retain your appetite, I suggest staying as far away from this smelly turn as possible."

","This movie is soooooo bad that I actually had to stay until the end to see how this horrible piece of crap ended. M. Knight should actually dig into his own pockets and offer me a refund, followed by a personal apology for misleading thousands of moviegoers into seeing this bad film. People please do not be fooled by other "" so called reputable critics "" such as Ebert. He lost touch with reality years ago and cannot be trusted as a reliable source for reviews any longer. Ebert is now to films what Milli Vanilli was to music and M. Knight is not far behind. I thought the Sixth Sense was a good film, not great but good. I thoroughly enjoyed Signs and felt it was well done. My favorite M. Knight film was Unbreakable. It was not only extremely clever writing, brilliant cinematography, and wonderful acting, but M. hit every feeling and emotion he was going for in this film. The Happening however is just a bad effort and his career may finished after this one."
"sendlukeanemail","7","1","5","14 June 2008"," It's not what you think- nobody else has said this.
","It does not matter what I think of his back catalog. M. Night has done something different in ""The Happening"", and I believe it should be seen as nobody has seen a Shamylan film before, and certainly not this one.<br/><br/>The trailers for this film made it look very ominous, mysterious, and downright scary. However when watching this film, I'd be surprised if the hairs on your arm stood up even once. There are a handful of tremendously well done scenes, eerily frightening- the construction workers throwing themselves off the building has to be M. Night's best shot in all of his work- however the rest of the film will leave you shaking your head in disbelief.<br/><br/>Why? Because the answer to what exactly is ""happening"" is presented very early on- in the first half of the movie. It's the plants, emitting a toxin causing humans to commit suicide, exacting their revenge on mankind for their mistreatment at our hands. The rest of the movie follows the main characters as they run through fields and towns, spewing ghastly dialog and witnessing people ending their own lives in disturbing fashions.<br/><br/>So why is the secret given away so quickly? Why the blatantly preachy dialog and ridiculous ""save the earth"" commentators seen on the televisions? Why isn't it all that frightening or suspenseful? Lets search our options. Did M. Night just flop and make a terrible, un-suspenseful movie with very few frightening sequences? I don't think so. M. Night has proved that he can make a scary movie with plenty of suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat moments. Was the script just awful? Yes and no. With a few exceptions, the script was boring, gave away the secret immediately, and felt way too preachy. So what is the answer? THIS FILM IS A SATIRE. A satire is defined as ""the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc. "" The Happening seemed to me to be mocking the modern day hysteria over ""global warming"" or ""climate change"", what with the ""Go Green"" movement hitting the accelerator.<br/><br/>I believe that instead of what appears to be a flop due to ridiculous acting, dialog, and overwhelming preachy-ness, M. Night Shamylan has created a masterful satire, brilliantly mocking modern day paranoia. Will anyone else see it like this, or is this even what Shamylan wanted to create? I don't know. Time will tell."
"saichotic","8","1","5","14 June 2008"," Hindu Philosophy 101
","I'm not being bias here but I think one has to be raised with an eastern way of thinking or have some knowledge of it in order to appreciate a film like The Happening. For example, I'm a first generation American born Indian and I grew up hearing that we should respect all beings including plants even the microscopic beings we can't see. This means we shouldn't curse, fornicate like cats and dogs, and be violent with each other. Essentially, everything we do and say can affect our environment in either a positive or negative way, depending the way we behave. If you notice the film follows a formula in which the deadly wind follows those who break these rules...that is why if you are in a smaller group the chances of being around someone who is a threat is less. I also heard that Mahatma Gandhi used to tip toe around his house because he knew that with each footstep he was killing dust mites and other microscopic bugs underneath his feet. This may or may not be true but the point is that I can believe it because I was raised with this non-violent approach to life. It's a very Hindu and Buddhist philosophy that is new to people and hence, it is misunderstood. What M. Night is trying to say in his film is simple...respect nature. My mother once pointed out to me that one should be like a tree. At first I didn't understand because my environment (Georgia) didn't allow me to think outside of the box and that kind of talk would get you beat up because people would think you are a pagan or a tree hugging hippie. What my mother was trying to say is that nature deals with anything thrown at it and it never asks for anything in return. It just gives. A tree can go through the harsh winter and come back with leaves during the spring. I liked the film and for a change something we usually ignore day to day is speaking out. See the brilliant irony in it? The plants are fighting back. That's genius. It's not zombies or mutants. It's something we can't touch or run from. The only problem with the film was that I think M. Night should have put a little old Asian man or woman saying things about nature instead of the Caucasian guy eating hot dogs. It would have been more effective and the characters would have at least seen his advice as wise from an eastern point of view instead of cuckoo in the head. It's easier to hear Bruce Lee say something about nature versus any Tom, Dick, or Harry because it is coming from someone's mouth who is raised with that philosophy and it's more acceptable. Even Quentin uses an old Oriental man to say all the wise things in Kill Bill. Using an old and wise Asian man or woman would have reinforced the idea of showing respect to nature and perhaps by the end of the film, people would have began taking better care of the earth. Instead, the movie ends where it begins...with a bunch of clueless people walking around like a bunch of dopes not caring about anyone or anything. Perhaps, M. Night wanted to keep it unresolved...showing us that to err is human."

Night has hit his peak and is now on the decline.<br/><br/>And his big twist at the end of ""The Happening"" could have been seen a mile a way. It was the same old formula that most horror movies use. The threat appears to be gone, but then reappears at the end with a new set of characters. It's been done countless times.<br/><br/>M. Night is known for his clever twist endings. (WARNING - Spoilers for other M. Night's movies) Bruce Willis is really dead in ""The Sixth Sense"", Sam Jackson's character is Willis' arch rival who created all those disasters in ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"" was set in present day. These were all really well done. But this half ass attempt of a ""twist"" was a joke. Who knows? Maybe M. Night has just given up and went for the predictable ending.<br/><br/>And what was with the acting? At times, Mark Walberg felt like a dopey cartoon character. I thought I was watching Dirk Diggler. Walberg needs to stick to the tough guy roles, that's his strong suit. Not the dorky high school science teacher. And not to generalize, but mostly everyone else wasn't very convincing in their roles either.<br/><br/>The story had a good premise but could have been executed better. Walberg suspected that the plants and trees were the cause of all the unexplained deaths. So he says ""I know, let's go hide in the woods!"" Positives, there were some. The scenes where people did themselves in were good for some scares. Also when they came across those guys that hung themselves made me jump a bit. But overall not so good.<br/><br/>For Night's next feature, maybe he should hire a writer and get a competent casting director. Or better yet, he could revise The Twilight Zone or Tales From the Darkside and do half hour episodes on late night TV. I'd watch it."

","Having just come from this movie, I cant help but get the feeling that the movie itself was indecisive. It seemed to attempt to combine Shyamalan's trademark suspense with more contemporary, quirky humor, with somewhat disheartening results.<br/><br/>I will say that when the movie creates suspense, it does it with amazing skill. This, however, is also the problem. This is only WHEN it creates suspense, and it rarely does. Less than a third of the movie held the thick atmosphere I came to see. It almost always seemed as though the unsettling atmosphere depicted in the trailers would last for about 5-10 minutes before the pace of the movie was broken by humorous moments.<br/><br/>Humor was quite prevalent through this movie, though half of it seems to be unintentionally delivered through awkwardly worded or poorly delivered lines.<br/><br/>The musical score, though enjoyable, was occasionally over-the-top, and altogether so dramatic that it even became amusing, especially in the beginning. This didn't happen too often, though, so it did not greatly hurt the film<br/><br/>The plot was nicely thought out, with references to real life scientific occurrences, and with the main plot itself actually bearing relation to factual phenomenon.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this movie was not absolutely terrible, it simply could have been much, much better, especially when faced with what possibilities the plot held. Despite being nicely filmed, the movie does not deliver what was promised, and the combination of genres it seemed to attempt broke the pacing and atmosphere. Overall, these factors were severely detrimental to the overall feel of the movie and made it so that it was impossible to become truly immersed in the world of the movie."

I still have hopes that it will be better, but one more movie like this, and I will not be watching him any more. I only gave this movie 2 because it's have a rather potential plot.

"noartfuldodger88","1","1","6","7 January 2009"," So...what was happening?
","I went into this movie expecting a little action, suspense, and that weird M. Night Shyamalan twist. Not exactly what I saw. After watching Signs, which I found to be a quirky, fun, alien flick; The Sixth Sense, tragic, but touching; The Village, personally, it didn't interest me; and Lady in the Water, again, no personal interest, I've seen a digressive trend in script writing in the Shyamalan films. Each one becomes more strange and less enjoyable.<br/><br/>First off, in the opening scene the viewer is hit right away with a few disturbing suicides. Granted it does lay the ground for the rest of the movie, but it doesn't allow for any guessing at what's going to happen the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Second is the awful acting from all the characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the actors, but they were forced, painfully, into the script and their characters. Mark Wahlberg's character acted as if the world was coming to an end before he even knew the full extent of what the epidemic was. Not only that, he never got any more frantic or worried as the story developed. Zooey's character looked promising at first, with her nervous attempt to ignore her phone. But she never seems to wise up to the fact that her life is in danger, and life as she knows it now is going to change for the next couple days.<br/><br/>Okay, so the trees are taking their revenge. I can give the producer the benefit of the doubt that this will give the movie a sci-fi feel. Unfortunately too many elements of reality are left out. How come only some people at the site of attack are affected? If it's an airborne toxin, shouldn't everyone be inhaling relatively equal amounts? If the flora is so apt at communicating with one another, why don't they attack the entire globe? Quite frankly, it's never proved any where in the film that it was the trees, and the professor at the end who says that's what caused it comes off looking like a lunatic. Also, the toxin that is supposed to attack people's survival instinct isn't even what's presented in the movie. According to its portrayal, it appears to turn people into suicidal sociopaths<br/><br/>I understand some comments and review that state this was not meant to be a ""good movie,"" and that it was meant to be ""B""-rated. But let's face it Mr. Shyamalan has to understand that's not what the majority of his audience is looking for. For those of you who enjoy bizarre, anticlimactic movies that leave you wondering what the point was - this is the film to watch. But for the masses, many of us have learned appreciate what some call the 'unrealistic perfection' Hollywood has labored years to produce. It gives us a chance to escape from our own reality. Not that The Happening had even the slightest tinge of reality in it."

Also, did anyone note the number on the front of the school bus near the end of the film? 2010 probably as in the year 2010. Maybe Shyamalan the soothsayer is giving a heads-up to the keen observer. Watch it again and see what goodies you troll-up, then again, maybe Shyamalan is losing it.<br/><br/>The acting is so preposterously brutal it just has to be for the aforementioned reason."

","This movie has a good start off. But the term leaving to the imagination has a limit and thats what this movie crossed badly. Why are people killing themselves? Its never explained. Why is this happening? Its never explained. Is it the plants? obviously not, plants don't have cutting edge brains or chemistry to cook up an aroma to make everyone pause at the same time and then kill themselves!!! Did everyone suddenly get depressed at the same time then decided to kill themselves? if thats so how about people taking antidepressants they should be immune. The writer of this movie obviously doesn't know one thing about psychology, biology. There's that one line in the movie where the girl says 'Calculus' and then kills herself. Maybe the people who worked on this movie hated college so much they'd rather die then go. or maybe everyone killed themselves for fun and amusement. We'll never know the purpose of this movie because it simply has no plot. With too little information whats the point?! I guess if you enjoy seeing a mass suicide with no background, facts, whatsoever you'll like this movie. otherwise its just meaningless and just plain dumb."
"jbdriesenaar","5","1","6","29 November 2008"," Better than expected
","After reading several reviews, I expected this movie to be terrible. Partially due to my low expectations, I had a good time watching it.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is quite creepy and really works to drag you into the mystery. The build up of suspense is well done throughout the movie. Unfortunately the movie doesn't really go anywhere with that suspense: there is no satisfying answer to the mystery. On top of that, some scenes are lacking logic and the acting is so-so.<br/><br/>However, as a frequent B horror movie watcher, I've seen and been entertained by a lot worse. It's not the classic people were hoping for, but I don't regret renting it."

","Wow I've not seen a film this bad for ages, well at least a couple of months. Fundementally the film is bad really on every level. Bad enough that I've decided to write a comment on it. Mark Wahlberg is practically on his own here with some truly appalling acting left right and centre of him and a production which stinks like a sewer. The love interest Zooey Deschanel remarkably appears to have a career!!???? which includes a main role in Tin Man. This girl is an APPALLING actress, truly very very very bad, I mean you've honestly gotta see her performance to believe it. But sadly she's not on her own with some really terrible support. An appallingly weak concept for a film, poorly rendered both in effects (ILM!) and in direction (the director of 6th sense I understand???) with what appears to be the most limited budget in Hollywood - but was it shot in the US? somehow I think not, it looks like it was shot down my road behind a hedge. There's nothing worse than a character describing a big event that we don't see, and that happens every five mins in this film. ""Ohh there's a big visually interesting thing just happened, we can't afford to show it so I'll describe it!"" So you get endless reams of extras and bit parters poorly describing events that happen off camera. Stay well away from this film, the makers do not deserve to be encouraged!"

"bukumi","8","1","6","31 July 2008"," Really Enjoyable Movie
","""The Happening"" is an enjoyable ""B"" movie with fine performances by Mark Wallberg, John Leguizamo, Betty Buckley, Frank Collison and others counterpointed by performances that could be homages to the wooden and over-ripe acting in the ""B"" movies of yesteryear. This adds to the interest and fun of the film.<br/><br/>There are no real smart characters - no one to hang onto as a role model or fantasy figure - in ""The Happening."" Like the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""The Happening"" benefits (in this instance intentionally) from scenes that seem poorly acted or seem poorly directed. For example a television newscast, the huddle of train conductors in the small town and the alarmed soldier on a country road can be interpreted as over-ripe but do add to the enjoyment of the film if one is aware of what's afoot. <br/><br/>Wallberg's big scene in which he tries to think of the right course of action to take and direction to run is not unlike how an average person like myself would react in the face of fast approaching, horrifying death with no apparent way out.<br/><br/>I appreciated one of the story's premises that holds that safety is not always to be found in joining larger groups, especially for hermits.<br/><br/>""The Happening"" is a cleverly layered film that will find a place on our cultural list of must talk about films for respectable reasons. This film will survive the reviews and would be critics who over the next five years will download the film or rent its DVD version for a second look. ""The Happening"" will be remembered longer and more fondly than, say, ""The Dark Knight"" that for those of us who are older than 20 is a been there - done that kind of film going experience."

"lawrencejohnson804","9","1","6","12 July 2008"," In Defense of ""The Happening""
","There will necessarily be a lot of ""spoilers"" in this review. First off, I concede that it's a matter of taste whether or not someone likes or does not like a movie that uses plot, dialog, acting styles, and so forth to clothe the ideas behind the film, as MNS typically does.<br/><br/>But, having said that, it doesn't seem fair to the director or to those who sincerely desire to know something substantial about the movie in question to dismiss it out of hand because the things mentioned above are not to one's taste. At the very least, it's not very informative.<br/><br/>I think that a better way to approach ""The Happening"" is to recognize that, like all MNS's movies, the central theme is the importance of connectedness between people, or between people and nature, if you will. For instance, in ""The Sixth Sense"" there is the alienation of the boy from the sorrows of those who die violently and of the main character (Willis) even from himself. In ""The Happening,"" this theme is broadened to contemporary people's alienation from each other and from all living things. One of the first lines, after all, is a woman telling her friend dispassionately that she left off in her book ""where the killers decide what to do with the crippled woman."" Then there is the estrangement of the Wahlberg character from his wife, and to a lesser extent from his friend (Leguizamo). The idea is implied that this alienation has somehow spread to the natural world, which in turn intensifies it and revisits it upon people as a compulsion to destroy themselves. There is a clever use of color--as another and more insightful commentator has mentioned here--to indicate what is really going on, especially in the references to the ""mood ring."" And so, while Science is able to explain the phenomenon to a certain extent, it really cannot get at the heart of the matter. (For example, a scientist in the film predicts the end of the happening, but the viewer is left with the impression that the love and self-sacrifice displayed by the two main characters cause the end of the event.) Thus, at the dramatic climax of the film, ""Mrs. Jones,"" the most isolated of anyone shown, is also ""attacked"" by nature, while the couple, physically separated, are drawn back together through a true love and ""connectedness"" to the other, even at the sacrifice of their own lives, and so are unscathed and bring the happening to an end. Interestingly, neither can remember which of the colors of the mood ring indicates love, suggesting that it is green, so that in a sense, this truly is a ""green movie,"" as some have said.<br/><br/>I don't imagine for a minute that what I've written covers the many nuances and subtle symbols of this movie, but what I have mentioned, I hope, would help others at least to appreciate that there may be more to ""The Happening"" than (as some seem to think) a failed thriller or horror movie."

","I thought it was good... my friend wanted to see it and I kept poking fun at her referring to IMDb saying ""look is crap, everyone is saying so""... first thing I did after I saw it was send her a txt to say ""nope you were right, it's well worth a watch"". Personally I think people that talk about the directors as to whether a movie should be good or not are the biggest tossers of all, this movie worked for me, it kept me entertained, refreshing approach, that all that matters. Yeah I noticed the bad acting, whether or not it was purposeful or not, who cares, I rate the way it was done, I enjoyed the awkwardness of it all, it added to the strangeness. I think back about the movie and try to imagine it being acted out better and I just can't picture it. Other people giving it 1 or no star... geez... I seriously couldn't take their view seriously, what would they give movies like Freedomland or Ghost World out of interest (Now They are BAD!) People are saying that it is truly a waste of 1.5 hrs of their life, $11 movie ticket, rental etc. In this case I am truly glad that I decided to find out for myself."
"drnrg31","8","1","6","7 July 2008"," A Wake Up Call
","I guess I would fall under the crusader type reviewers here. Shayamalan's movie's have always given me something to think about. I hold respect for him as a director for this. Weather it be that we walk with the dead in ""Sixth Sense"" or that we are not alone, like in ""Signs"". Even the fact that there are super extraordinary individuals among us, as in ""Unbroken"". All these films have one thing in common. Realism taken to the next dimension. The one we are afraid to admit.<br/><br/>This movie again touches on a very serious subject. Yes we are killing off the planet. Yess it's 90% the governments fault...and yes a higher power must prevent us. Or at least the planet itself. It's an amazing plot when you really think about it. The plants have always been dismissed as decorative symbolism, but they are much more than that. They were here on this planet way before the first human touched foot on land. Watching and analyzing the way ,us humans are destroying our planet with toxins, pesticides, etc...Who says they can't think? They react to sunlight, darkness and weather just like all of us. Shayamalan takes this theory one step further and presents the plants as heralds of bad tidings. They communicate with each other, alter our thoughts and ultimately show the population what will happen if the o-zone layer is completely wiped out. That's right, I said the O word. That is really what the message the film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>On with the acting, While I will agree with the ,lot and say that perhaps Wahlberg was not at his strongest, he did pretty much carry 80% of the film on his shoulders. A little more attitude would have really given him a commending performance, but as a high school science teacher, he couldn't be that tough. Another favorite of mine is John Luegazamo(I apologize for bad spelling). His character had some real promise, but was completely deduced to a confused, desperate supporting role. John usually brings Sass and Attitue to a film. Another miscast on Shayamalan's part. Both of this actors were restrained to an extent that I could only call ridiculous.<br/><br/>The female lead, played accordingly by Zooey Deschanel was surprising to the least. I had never seen her act before and to be honest I was about to dismiss her as the typical wife role. To my chagrin ,she turned out a pretty charming performance. Her gorgeous next door girl looks really helped a lot as well. In fact, my friend completely mistakened her for Mary Elizabeth Winstead as first glance.<br/><br/>The rest of the aspects of the film were above level, but not amazing. Quite a few flaws in direction in that we are left hopelessly to use our imaginations on a lot of ""Off Camera"" scenes and it did leave me with a somewhat dissatisfied feeling. The end was another big question mark. Somhow the film wanted to achieve that feeling of satisfaction from a Twilight Zone episode, but fell short of expectations, especially in the final scene with the French. Who adds Foreigh dialog and no English subtitles? It also completely dismisses the original theory of the "" wake up call"" What did work ,was the pace. Keep moving forward or East, as used in this film. What I did like was the hopeless or dead end feeling I got as the survivors move from state to state ,only to meet their demise. It brings up an important factor. The plant life completely overpopulates us and if this scenerio was ever to happen, we would be completely over taken by the planet."
"pmdawn","7","1","6","7 July 2008"," A Different Kind of B
","""The Happening"" is a very hard movie to review. But I'll try.<br/><br/>The first thing to be said is that M.Night made something really different. It's a disaster movie in which the disaster is quiet, intelligent and vengeful. It's a movie in which events all happen outside, as opposed to the likes of ""The Mist"" and specially ""Lady In The Water"". It's not like ""War of The Worlds"", despite some similarities. And it's not really a horror, but many horrific events take place - some more shocking than the most gory horrors out there, but it's all done in a way to - dare I say it? - detach the viewer from the experience.<br/><br/>Yes, that is it. There is no backstory to the characters we follow, and a good deal of mystery. However, would you really care about these silly things if your life was on the line? <br/><br/>Haters say that the acting is bad. I respectfully disagree. There are many little details in this movie, and the main characters' odd and childlike behavior is just one of them. The weird scene cuts, the exaggerated and unexpected gore, even the improbable enemy. Shyamalan himself said that this was supposed to be a ""good B-movie"", and if that was his intention, he did it.<br/><br/>As an Entheogen Enthusiast, I loved the main concept. I would suggest to anyone who liked this movie to visit Lycaeum and Erowid on the web and learn more about our fauna.<br/><br/>I think ""The Happening""'s real flaw is its very uniqueness. It can't be easily defined in a genre, because M. Night once more decided to play with the very way movies are shown. The ending, however, was great, and thank God, not really a ""twist"".<br/><br/>All in all, a good film, a relevant subject, and a step in the right direction for M. Night.<br/><br/>7/10"
"kitsune451","9","1","6","2 July 2008"," Very impressed
","Before going into the theater with my mother I had to admit that I didn't know what to expect. I had heard equally good and bad things and wished to see for myself just what kind of movie this was going to be. After a shaky time with The Village and Lady in the Water I was very pleasantly surprised with the wonderful quality and solid story presented in The Happening.<br/><br/>The two things that impressed me the most were the simplistic and realistic dialog that was very refreshing and took away from the feel that I was watching a scripted movie. Witty banter is entertaining in its own right and has its place, but this allowed me to feel more like I was watching actual events taking place which only added to the disturbing feel.<br/><br/>This of course brings me to my next point in that once again MNS shows his knack for packing the biggest punch without having to use the blood and gore tricks of other less frightening movies. Simple scenes such as the construction workers one by one jumping from the scaffolds or the gun slowly peeking its way from the door and then the window are disturbing and terrifying in ways that gore fests could never be. Sort of like watching a car wreck, seeing it happen, knowing it's going to be bad, and knowing you're powerless to do anything to help. He has a way of turning even the simplest acts such as walking through a room into heart stopping scenes that have you waiting for the worst.<br/><br/>For the most part I was very happy with this movie, the cast, the dialog, and best of all the pace that it took hitting you hard right off the bat then letting you relax before throwing its next punch at you. The only real gripe I had was towards the ending. While I liked the fact that the incidents only occurred on a small scale in the US instead of the overused 'the world is going to end' theme most things like this take on I was rather disappointed with how cliché and overused the final part was. Perhaps it was necessary to have the second attack in Paris, but I have to admit that I expected a little more from him then something so simple and common place. Or at least expected it to be presented in a new fashion."

","The Happening  Does anybody know or care? Rated: R Time: 1:31 Stars: Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, and others Final Grade: C- Summary: I'm reminded of the song by the group Chicago  ""Does anybody know what time it isdoes anybody care?"" This is lightweight plot centered around a Philadelphia high school science teacher(Wahlberg) and his wife(Deschanel) and their flight to safety while all around them are either dropping dead from some mysterious presumedly airborne toxin or shooting each other or committing suicide in any variety of gruesome ways. If you want a lightweight horror flick with minimal plot, lots of blood, guts, gore and stupidity, well, you found it.<br/><br/>Our story starts out in New Yorks central park were people are freezing in their tracks and when they're not putting guns to their heads, they're dropping off of buildings or walking in front of carsfor no reason. Needless to say, there's some folks that are either survivors or just happen to live longer and they run like hell out of the city.<br/><br/>News of the events sweeps to Philadelphia, as does our plot, and shifts to a high school teacher who's wife would rather share tiramisu with her new boyfriend than try to understand reality of needing to evacuate in the presence of a catastrophic event. She's a real bimbo, but a cute one and I don't think anyone wouldn't offer to share his tiramisu (or anything else) with her, given the opportunity.<br/><br/>Recognizing the pending threat, our science teacher and his wife bolt from town into the eastern Pennsylvania farmland. Needless to say, the plague follows to Philadelphia and beyond. More people die, more commit suicide and you're forced to watch it, all the time wondering what the hell you're doing in this theater with this stupid movie.<br/><br/>Well, as you would expect, at the end, teacher and wife survive, reunite and guess what, she's preggersand the movie ends, all is right with the world and we cut to the credits I'm sorry folks, but this flick is a waste of time. What's hilarious is that at the end of the flick, even though it's 3 months after the event has stopped, all appears to be returned to normal in Philadelphiawhen during the movie, basically all live from the Mason-Dixon line to Nova Scotia is presumed to be dead! Beam me up Scottie, there's no intelligent life in this movie.<br/><br/>But, at the end of the day, it does make one take a moment to ask themselves some simple questions: If you had to totally bug out of your home in 15 minutes, what would you take with you? Where would you go? How would you get there? How would you communicate with the rest of your family? This flick is about survival in a major catastrophic event. How would you do? Would you survive? Something to think about  since there's really nothing to think about in this movie.<br/><br/>And that's the way I saw it, From Where I Stand.<br/><br/>( The writer is a frequent contributor to www.fromwhereistand.info )"

","B-movies don't come much better than this! Whalberg's annoying is-my-voice-just-breaking accent is perfect for the role of an apparently doomed science teacher backed up by the wonderfully ditzy Zooey.<br/><br/>As the story goes it is absurd and ""out of this world"" paranoid although seemingly down to earth and, albeit for me to say, timely in these days of threat after threat. Our protagonists start their journey from gloom to doom in the unassuming all consuming city of New York. Chillingly reminiscent scenes of people falling to their death without compunction serve to remind one of the awful events of 9/11. The explanation for these events are not explored to the fullest and it is to the films credit, as disasters can never truly be understood.<br/><br/>Where many have found flaws in this film I felt I had finally seen M. Night's reconnection with reality. Seeing dead people, weirdos living in a cul-da-sac, crop-circle-tastic aliens and fairy tales without faries are put to the side so the director can treat the audience to a meatier stew.<br/><br/>When leaving the theater I couldn't help but be affected by the notion the wind could actually kill me. Hats off, M. Night. You put the buzz back in 'B' movies."

The only time in the entire movie that I got creeped out was the scene toward the end when Mrs. Jones has been infected and she starts banging herself against the house.<br/><br/>As for the acting itself, I love all of these actors. I think they are usually very good and very strong. In this movie, though, they seemed weak. There were several times during the movie that Mark Wahlburg had me cringing with the way he was delivering his dialogue. It felt sort of like watching a bad high school play.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie should have been much much better. I love M. Night Shyamalan's movies and I will continue to watch them.

","M. Night Shyamalan has come a long way since the Sixth Sense. After I finished watching the film the ""one"" thing that impressed me was the way he presented it. I sincerely felt that it was the depth and reality of each scene that was impressive and not the scariness.<br/><br/>Now the answer for the question ""why only 6 if I liked the movie? "". M Night Shyamalan is famous for showing off the Microphones used in his production, and this is what he does in this movie as well. The Mic can be clearly seen on the top of the screen in one of the scenes where Mark Wahlberg is sitting and talking in the Model House. Doesn't anybody review the final print!!. Even after all these criticisms (Even in one of the Scary movies) if he continues to do this , it will point to his inefficiency as a director.<br/><br/>The music is really haunting. James Newton Howard has succeeded in creating a Hitchcockian atmosphere with his music all through the movie. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is impressive and blends well with the directors way of storytelling. The cast easily fits into their characters but none impressed me.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the picture , and I would prescribe it for people who like classic and realistic horror and not the zombie or creature horror.<br/><br/>As a fan , I look forward to seeing more work from M Night Shyamalan which is equally brilliant as this and his previous works.<br/><br/>The "" AVATAR "" written on Jesse's school bag , is that a sign of things to come?? :)"

When the trailer for 'The Happening' was released on quicktime, I was hooked, and desperate to see this movie. So imagine my disappointment when it turns out to be a bit ""hammy"".<br/><br/>It's difficult for one to pinpoint what is wrong with Shyamalan's latest offering. A fantastic premise is brought down by dull, uninspired acting (especially from the female lead- Deschanel), poor dialogue and a very flat conclusion.<br/><br/>'The Happening' also commits what I consider to be the cardinal sin of movies, it reveals too much infomation within the opening act. We learn the stages that those affected by 'the event' go through and an overly-strong hint is given as to what is causing it. Bad form Shayamalan, very bad form.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that Shyamalan will learn from this poor effort, and re-focus for his next film. If not, God help us."

With the clunky dialogue and strange acting by Zooey Deschanel, however, even the ever reliable Mark Wahlberg and the sadly short screen time of John Leguizamo couldn't make audiences take this seriously as a remotely intelligent thriller.<br/><br/>The Happening gives a flavor of being unintentionally funny though, so once you decide to just roll with it, then you will enjoy the build-up to the freaky climaxes and just laugh yourself silly.<br/><br/>At least it wasn't as bad as Lady in the Water."

","Let me say The Happening is not a total mess, but if we compare it to The 6th Sense, then yes, it is.<br/><br/>The cast. My favourite actor of this movie is Mark Wahlberg. He plays Elliot, who is smart, strong and handsome. That actress who is supposed to be Elliot's wife doesn't seem to be very talented, but at least she is not annoying and I kinda like her. All the other actors are pretty good, so I have no rebukes.<br/><br/>The plot. No offence, Mr Night, but the environment thing doesn't make sense. I agree that plants may poison, but they have no brains, so how can ""the happening"" be a warning? Why is the wind so important, if toxic is exuded to the air that people breath? The comedy. Actually, I love all the jokes which are told in the movie. They sound naturally.<br/><br/>The horror. OK, the scene with the pin is laughable, because it cannot be possible. But the movie has its moments. Sometimes it's really scary! The most frightful character is Mrs Jones. God, she freaked me out! The end. Not bad! It's luck there is not absolutely happy ending. However, I am happy the main characters are alive. It would add some dramatic, though.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I never intended to watch The Happening. It was just a boring day as usual and I thought I'd watch the film. Surprisingly, it turned out much better than I expected! I don't know why so many people seemed to have hate it ... but I definitely thought it was good. The film kept me thinking a lot, which is what Shyamalan wants his viewers doing. The storyline is really good and definitely made me wonder throughout the film what that ""natural crisis"" was (which we eventually found out halfway). But that isn't what Shyamalan's trying to do. He doesn't want the viewer to enter the theater, watch the film, figure out what the crisis is and then leave. He wants to make you ... think. Think and try to get this message he's getting across. Good thing is, I got the message :P (And I shall not reveal it, so as to make you keep thinking ;) )<br/><br/>-----((SPOILER AHEAD))-----<br/><br/>For those who said that the film has a typical happy ending, ... obviously you were just thinking about Elliot and his wife. The main bit you should be thinking about is the ending where the whole crisis begins to take place in another country (which I think was France). That's the ending. And I'm sure people killing themselves due to ""the happening"" isn't a happy thing to cheer on about.<br/><br/>So overall, I think that the film wasn't the best film I've ever seen in my whole entire life that it deserves such a fantastic score :P But, it was a great film. Great but not the best. It got my full attention, as I sat there wanting to know what happens next and also thinking about what may happen next or why something may be happening. And also mainly, thinking about this message he's trying to get across.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film to those who really want to think and not watch the film for the sake of entertainment. I wouldn't recommend those who love horror flicks to watch it, either. It is filled with gore and whatnot, ... but if you don't like being made to think, then it wouldn't be good for you :P<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8/10"

While she shrieked full throttle I was giddily laughing next to her.<br/><br/>This is the appeal of a Shymalan film...he manipulatively dazzles the audience with the unnatural both visually and with his dialogue...the screenplay brazenly disarms and charms at the same time that it delivers it's story and horror. At the heart of the film, through the maze the characters are forced to travel through to stay alive, is also a slow tuning in as though with a microscope on the heart of innocence, that individual potential, that humanity as a whole has lost in its relationship to our planet.<br/><br/>Like a spirit channeler, Shymalan has delivered a warning with this film and has managed to do so by filtering our current climate through his particular film-making genes to produce this incredibly unique film. Certain horrific images are familiar and I won't print in here why, but as we've experienced certain events in recent history, so Shymalan has re-invented their cause but the images viscerally make the viewer uncomfortable in terms of this film being a portent of our present not our future.<br/><br/>As far as the actors, Marky Mark...sorry Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are a fine pairing in this story...there are moments especially of humor that are both original and precious or should I say priceless.<br/><br/>M. Night Shymalan truly delivers...but then...I've enjoyed all the films he's made so far and the Shymalan attackers with their claws out for his unDisneylike bad boy behavior should go pick on someone their own size...like Michael Bay...and let this guy make his own movies HIS WAY so there.<br/><br/>***I just want to add I think reading a lot of these reviews this screenplay was over the head of a lot of the people on here...I have a respect for a lot of my fellow filmmakers, but how off the mark can so many be to not respect the genius in this screenplay? As Hitchcock did earlier with THE BIRDS, Shymalan took what appears the most benign from our natural world and created horror and purposely used the B horror movie structure purposely to deliver something so much deeper...not only that, what he based this on is actually a reality (if you're into not sleeping at night thinking about this stuff check out James Rollins current book The Judas Strain)...the fact that our abuse of our planet could have dire consequences for us is the heart of the message...his choice of every word is with weight and thought because he's a master of his craft as a screenwriter...to compare Shymalan's work with anything else out there right now is ludicrous this is a a true original and his work demands thought to see through the layers I think he hit it out of the ballpark with this one."

","We went to see the Happening, I thought it was good, what spoiled the movie was the constant showing of the microphone during the making of the movie. ""the top of the screen"" I don't know if this was supposed to be in it or what but it was a downer to me. All in all it was a good movie that got me on the edge of my seat a few times. I might see it again if I rent it but not buy it, whom every checked this movies over needs to be fired. I liked the Actors in it, and the thought of the Plants/grass and Tree being the cause was a pretty good thought. The one thing that got me was that they thought it only got you if you were in a large group so what went on with the old lady. She died, do you think it could have had something to do with aggression that she felt toward the Man, woman, and child? That lawnmower sen bothered me, also the sen where they went to that farm house for food and help was kind of gross to it just shows you how helpfull people can be (not)"
"jpstewart83","9","1","6","18 June 2008"," Very pleased.
","I was very pleased overall with he movie. I must say though that I am big M. Night fan. I loved Lady in the Water although many people I know hated. I think they are crazy. I didn't know what to expect after readying so many poor reviews but I thought the movie was great. I think to many people come in with out of this world expectations for his movies and they always want a surprise ending. Not all his movies have surprise endings nor do they need to. Yes the movie has a certain feel of other movies but it is still very unique. It is a fast paced thriller at the beginning and does get kinda slow at the end. Although the old lady at the end is CREEPY. Over all I don't think it was on of his best but it is still a very solid movie that is much better than some of these reviewers are rating it. I think they love to hate M. Night or else they just don't appreciate something deeper from their movie going experience."
"snewhous","8","1","6","17 June 2008"," Another hit from Shyamalan
","Shyamalan self-deprecatingly described ""The Happening"" as the best b-movie ever, and that description fits really well. You won't be moved or touched by emotional poignance or be blown away by an astonishing twist at the end. However it will definitely scare the heck out of you.<br/><br/>I am a big Shyamalan fan and find the constant hatred for his movies a bit weird and one-sided, like some group-hysteria phenomenon. Suddenly all critics despise him (panning this movie, I heard it got 11% on Rottentomatoes.com) and moviegoers follow them like sheep. Its similar to the mass-hatred of Jonathan Safran Foer. I understand some people hate him, but honestly, 11%? Compared to Hulk, or ""Whatever Happens in Vegas,"" or Spiderman 3, or ""The Good Shepherd"", or a million other pointless movies? While the typical blockbuster is a concept or gimmick film, Shyamalan creates real stories, with real characters.<br/><br/>As the movie builds up speed, the suspense rachets higher and higher. The disease is terrifying, and as we see different people killed by it, the symptoms - stopping walking mid-stride - become scarier and more horrible each time you see them. I won't give any scary surprises away, but there were dozens of moments when my heart stopped, and I'm still frightened by the movie a week later.<br/><br/>However, there are also plenty of moments of comedic relief - reinforcing Shyamalan's classification of this movie as a b-movie. Mark Wahlberg has great timing, and stops for a couple of hilarious moments throughout the movie, no matter how grisly the events are. I really appreciated this - nothing in the middle of horror like a few good laughs, Wahlberg talking to a plant and so on. There were also some moments that were perhaps inadvertently hilarious - but if S. was making a B movie, why can't it all be funny? Stop listening to the critics. Try watching Lady in the Water, Village, or Unbreakable again. See this movie for some fast fun thrills without the agonizing idiocy of typical Hollywood."

","I thought this film was pretty good. Its not like his other films though and that was a little disappointing. I found it really creepy throughout. On occasions it was a bit slow but that made me creep out even more. Mark and Zooey were a bit wooden but that also seemed to add to the creepiness i wonder whether they were told to do that. Having said that both of them in previous films have that blank look on there face at times especially zooey. The trailer makes the film look like it is this big event that keeps unfolding but really all that stuff happens in the first few mins and from then on we see further subtle moments but a lot less action. I know one thing Jaws made me scared of the water. Now when i walk in a field and see the wind blow across the grass and trees, in the back of my mind something will stir a little.<br/><br/>Having said that enough with the environment films already enuff with the political middle eastern terrorist films too (which i found this to mirror both things). Can we find a new subject please.<br/><br/>Its not a masterpiece and it wont make u go wow.

","This movie's bad reviews are in part due to the marketing approach. Marketing of this guy's films always push towards horror. Not sure why that is when only one of his movies can actually be called a horror film (The Sixth Sense.) People go in expecting scares and a shocker of an ending.'The Happening' is NOT a horror movie and there is no shocking ending. If anything the movie is more along the lines of 'The Birds' in that is slow paced, character driven, and there is never really any hard fast reason the tragic events happen.<br/><br/>It is not the best movie ever made but it held my attention and made me think a little as it moved along. I liked it but I am not buying the DVD. There ya have it."
"menlittlec2","7","1","6","16 June 2008"," If you don't want the know the ending Don't Read!
","I am not a M. Night fan due to his movies usually have a twist with no ending. I did like The Happening. I was not impressed with the characters. Mark Wahlberg (science teacher)character was to suppose to be the ""Hero"" in this film, but it seemed the mark was not met. It starts out in the park two women reading on a bench and almost like time just stands still, but then everyone start killing themselves. At the time four main characters are trying to get out of the city. The train there on stops in a small town and won't go any further due to what they think is a terrorist attack. They then find out it may be toxins in the air and it's hitting bigger cities not so much smaller towns. Mark, Zooley, and the little girl start in a group with just another man and women. As they're trying to leave town and notice there really isn't anywhere else to go they find the Military Officer (which seems to be two cents short of a dollar) and a few other groups. Their theory is stay away from the roads and the huge group starts to walk to a smaller town. Once Mark (the science teacher) discovers that the toxin is going after larger groups they split up. Of course the first group is affected by the toxin and dies. The three find a house (which they think is abandoned) where this strange lady lives with no electricity, no neighbors, and grows her own food. What more could Mother Nature ask for. Then the old lady goes a little stir crazy and Mother Nature takes her out. Which leaves the three alone. This disaster only lasts about 48 hours at the most and ends showing your three months later. Zooley, Mark, and the little girl make it through the tragedy and move on with there life as if nothing happened (other than the little girls parents die). The last scene two guys walking in a park having a conversation Mother Nature starts all over again.<br/><br/>In reading several reviews, I have a different aspect of the movie. Yes, Mother Nature is mad at the world due to humans being disrespectful to the earth and to others!! I guess you can say were not economically stable right now, there is a lot of ""hate"" in the world, not enough people going ""Green"" and certain parts of the world are over populated. So Mother Nature puts toxins into the air to send a message. Why did M. Night pick New York to be hit first and then spreads to the East Coast? New York has a huge population; it's polluted (just like any other big city/states) and extremely unfriendly (don't mean to offend anyone). Mother Nature decides to just stop the toxin and feels it's done enough damage for humans to appreciate and not take the world for granted. Yes, I feel there is an ending! So how does it end!!! Mother Nature decides to start the toxins all over again. So what major area do you hit next that has the same reputation as New York? If you couldn't figure it out ""France"" (once again not to offend anyone).<br/><br/>Definitely a worth while movie!"
"anwyyn","8","1","6","16 June 2008"," Pretty darned decent for its genre .....
","... if you can figure out its genre, that is! ;p I was expecting horror and was handed a sorta sci-fi comedy with The Happening. One moan from behind me in the theater was all that told me someone didn't appreciate just *one* of the so-called 'graphic' scenes. If you can call any of these scenes graphic ... which I don't. I've seen worse (*much* worse) on prime time television! The humor of this movie was obvious and there were many titters throughout the theater during many of the lighter scenes. The Happening was decently acted, decently presented, and my niece and I exited the theater giggling over having expected graphic horror.<br/><br/>Ain't no horror, folks! And as for the R rating the film was given, how about dropping it to a PG? It deserves it! :) You want 'graphic' and so intense you just can't seem to make it very far through a movie (if you're a 45+ woman as I am)? Try flipping the channel to 'Hamburger Hill' the next time it passes through TVland ... I haven't been able to get through that one *yet* as much as I may try. Or sit through 'Black Hawk Down' ... though that one is likely rated R for language as well as graphic war scenes. I *can* get through *that* one and watch it again and again as well as 'We Were Soldiers.' 'Apocalypse Now' is rather iffy ... depends upon my mood. LOL! And that's my opinion. Graphic blood and guts scenes in 'The Happening' are minimal. Humorous chit-chat outweighs it. We enjoyed it though could have waited for the DVD to come out instead of wanting the 'theater experience' ... enjoy it! :)"
"tothekor","7","1","6","16 June 2008"," Not His Best But A Certainly A More Original Concept Than What We Can Expect From Hollywood
","M. Night creates a decent movie here. It certainly isn't his best but it isn't his worst either. It's an original tale and that's refreshing from Hollywood now-a-days. Which is probably why the critics are hating on him right now. I've noticed that most critics have touted the studio line and have endorsed the worst slock ever created and panned the truly original pieces.<br/><br/>Some of the violence seemed overtly gorish, probably just so M. Night could say it was his first R rated film. He probably could have created a just as a suspenseful movie without the R rating.<br/><br/>Still, the general concept is intriguing."
"bethie0365","2","1","6","16 June 2008"," this was horrible
","I first must start out by saying I love M. Night Shyamalan's work. I was blown away by the ""Sixth Sense"" and even ""Signs"" was a nail biter. His movies are suspenseful but not distasteful. The gore has never been a piece of the story. He is one of the best storyteller's in the modern day but this movie fails on many levels. <br/><br/>The opening scene captures our attention immediately. From there, it goes downhill. <br/><br/>The storyline is lame..plants? Come on! It's got so many loopholes in it that it's hard to follow.<br/><br/>The plants attack crowds that grow smaller and smaller as the story progresses, yet in every scene of attack , there is always someone that doesn't freeze. Even when they begin to realize it's the foliage, they trek onward through fields and tall grass-why not stay on the road? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>The acting is even harder to grasp. Poor Mark Walberg...LOVED him in ""The Departed"", this is simply not his genre. He's too much of a tough guy and you just cant relate to his teacherly persona. His wife-the doe-eyed lame actress just simply missed the boat. John Leguziamo's character was an unnecessary waste of film and just added to the confusion. And poor Betty Buckley-the deranged loner who takes them into her home. I felt like it was something out of Stephen King's ""Misery""-gone-bad. <br/><br/>The problem is, as good as the premise may be for a story of revenge-driven plants, you just cant relate to the characters or follow the story. There is no connection.<br/><br/>The repetitive suicides at first are too graphic and not necessary ..it's almost as if that's all he had to work with so he continued to come up with as many different ways to kill oneself as he could to keep the story moving. <br/><br/>The ending left me with confusion and emptiness with no resolve. <br/><br/>And in the end, the result is a poorly directed, poorly acted film that will not go down in the history books as a hit of our time. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie. Save your money and rent it on DVD when you have nothing else to do."
"atlastorm","6","1","6","16 June 2008"," Education over Entertainment
","The happening is an average film with a good premise. Among all the possible causes that could exterminate the human race, few would have given trees and plants a chance to wreck havoc on (by far) its greatest enemy - the human race. This sudden u-turn humbles citizens in the North East of the US (amongst the worst sinners when it comes to the environment), and brings them to their knees - literally. People just drop dead, and this confuses everyone - the actors, the audience, and seemingly, even the director. This is where the movie falls - because nobody knows how to react during this 'act of war'. The actors are always in a state of shock and/or awe, and even the writer/director does not commit to emotions whole-heartedly. It's as if M. Night Shyamalan threw a stone into a pond and then ran, not bothering to take the movie to places where it could have gone. Alas, this is what ultimately leaves an unfulfilled taste in our mouths. If only....this and if only...that. There are so many different ways the screenplay could have gone, and we are dissatisfied by the fact that the director asks us to sit on what seems to be a roller-coaster ride, and it ends up like a pram-ride. Shyamalan, with his brilliant imagination, once again puts an interesting issue on the table, and everything can be summed up by Wahlberg's great monologue with the plants - ""All this while I have been talking with a plastic plant."" We expected the real thing Night."
"Jsimpson5","5","1","6","16 June 2008"," Predictable Ending
","I saw this film yesterday and needless to say it wasn't the best film I've seen in a long time. Basically people starting killing them selves for no reason what so ever and nobody knows what is causing the problem.<br/><br/>While the ideal is quite good, there are some problems with the film in general. The first problem is the cast. Several of the characters are miscasts and this is a problem. Zooey or as I call her the ""Thousand Yard stare lady"" plays the wife of the main character. Her eyes seem out of focus the entire time and she just looks like she is looking out into space the entire time.<br/><br/>The film wasn't very scary at all since when something bad was about to happen you could predict what was going to happen. The ending of the film was pointless and predictable as well.<br/><br/>Overall this wasn't a great film, so avoid unless you have nothing better to do."
"rokk141","1","1","6","15 June 2008"," A Complete Disappointment
","An uninspired performance by Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast poisons this film. Aside from a few select scenes, emotion is absent as characters watch those they know kill themselves.<br/><br/>The scarce emotion that does exist seems misplaced. Betty Buckley's performance as Mrs. Jones, an old woman who has avoided contact with other people for years is laughable. Her random transitions between a kind hostess and a paranoid witch are awkward and comical when it shouldn't be. Buckley never seemed to decide how to play the character, and the strange directing did not help.<br/><br/>The plot itself was decent at best. The plant outlook felt thrown at the audience so often that the ending didn't have any shock to it. All in all, it's an intriguing concept by M. Night Shyamalan that simply does not translate well onto the big screen."
"notlib","7","1","6","15 June 2008"," Don't miss the point
","Seems as if a lot of movie goer's are missing the point of this movie. The first fact is: Tree's and plant's can't count how many people are in a group. Toxins may have been emitted by the tree's but it was not on a conscious level. Bad stuff happens to good people and bad people. People too often grab on to any information that is mentally acceptable to them, whatever their brains can grasp. First it was terrorism, then the government, then nukes, then revenge of nature, please, the story was about human nature not nature nature! As far as the acting goes just how does one react when their imagination is telling them something that their logical brain is saying is impossible. Bad things happen, life goes on."

These days Hollywood seems to underestimate the intelligence of the typical (or maybe not so typical) movie goer.<br/><br/>The Happening, good green concept but just not developed enough for a movie.<br/><br/>First, Mark Wahlberg...well Boogie Nights showed your best acting asset. As for this movie, I could not envision Markie as a credible teacher, your quips were good and well written to keep your students involved in science but you seemed so shallow. Your script was just embarrassing and corny.<br/><br/>The Wife, who was she? is she a cheater or pre-cheater. Joey Joey Joey.I think M.Night would have done better as in his ""Hitchcock"" fashion in doing a cameo...not a voiceo...as the voice of Joey...if this was innocent and she was concerned Joey was obsessed and calling her cell phone after a dessert..why did she program his name in her phone for all to see???? Betty Buckley....wow...there must not be many parts around...who were you? what was your deal? At first, I thought she controlled the bushes, the grass and the trees and had some type of green connection..but wrong....she was just a loony placed in the movie. (maybe she begged M. Night for a part to revive her career, oops what career).<br/><br/>John L. OK...so you are a math teacher...you just didn't make any sense in your role...just not developed...a friend of Mark W., father of child and lover of wife, who is missing from the movie looking for a doll..didn't she see the news? and know that a ""happening"" is occurring?"" And I was disappointed as I thought the trees, grass and bushes wouldn't kill again because Markie and his wife had re-found love and that was the cure, but not....it goes on again a few months later in Russia I think. (Could he make us suffer through Happening 2- Russia) Overall, this movie lacks development of characters, connection of characters, poor script and acting is just so so...Mr Hot Dog Lover man was the best actor...Jeremy Strong, where did he come from? very similar to a Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura goes to Iraq in his character definition. There was no leader..or Mark W. couldn't pull it off as the lead in this movie...(Sniper was just as bad!!)...Mark is just not a lead...<br/><br/>M.

","Although I found the subject matter in the film engaging, I felt that Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were miscast in their respective roles. Their shallow acting, except for a very few convincing moments, took the punch out of this movie. For me, I found the extras and minor characters more convincing; but for them, the movie would not have been engaging at all! The acting done by the couple who owned the green house, was especially good and they should have been the main characters as their relationship-their acting-was more convincing. The lady the main characters meet in the old house was also extremely well acted and riveting. The talents of the little girl and John laguzamo were also under used. But when it came to Mark and Zooey's performance, the air just went out of the balloon; no deep emotive content and very disconnected from what was happening. And deep emotive content is what was needed in this film, Mark and zooey would have taken the heart out of Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable; movies requiring mature acting; even the Village would not have survived. So M Night's character driven movie lacked just that, the characters to truly leave you with the impact of what was happening!"

"tlooknbill","5","1","6","14 June 2008"," Life's a boring movie and then you die and there ain't anything you can do about it.
","That's pretty much the clearly unintentional plot line of The Happening. <br/><br/>Boy! I wanted to like this movie, but I had too many mixed feelings about it. The premise is sheer genius, but becomes buried, obscured and confusing within the thin disaster film type drama and shock value of the character's reactions and interactions of what is happening to them.<br/><br/>It's like the movie Village of the Damned. So what if kids are taking over the minds of the adult community and making them do their bidding. That gets old after a while. We want to know WHY, HOW and WHERE it could lead. That's why I never thought that movie was that scary. If you're going to mess with the psychology of the human mind, you'ld better direct the mind accordingly. The Happening suppresses this.<br/><br/>I would've opened the movie straight off before the credits with the Einstein quote about the disappearing bees that is briefly and obscurely shown on the teacher's blackboard a little ways into the movie. <br/><br/>I completely missed this due in part to the second rate soft focus print of the movie I viewed at my local theater. This would've immediately set the tone to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief since it's a real quote from a respected scientist and addresses a very real, ominous and mysterious situation we live in today. <br/><br/>But no, I was left with too many contradictions as to what exactly is causing people to commit suicide. Nature taking revenge by producing hormones that secrete psychotropic, suicide inducing chemicals into the wind like a bad cold front to fight its enemy-humans? Genius! I believe it! <br/><br/>But then why are some humans spared and others not? OK, I guess nature is selective? Show us why it's selective. OH! I know! It spared people who were in love! That's it! NO? This is all I thought about through the entire movie. And then it ends so cheesy and anti-climatic with no explanation. So I guess life's a boring movie and then you die and there's nothing you can do about it.<br/><br/>Note to Mr. Shyamalan, could you remake this movie, please. There's a masterpiece in there somewhere."
"jaredmobarak","5","1","6","14 June 2008"," Cheese and crackersThe Happening
","The premise for The Happening is intriguing as hellMother Nature using its natural defense mechanisms to fight back against humanity. By releasing a neurotoxin, everything green has decided to show its true strength; earth will not rollover and watch itself get suffocated anymore. This synopsis alone shows the environmentalist bent being portrayed, but very unobtrusively. Sure the groundwork is there, ever prevalent, lurking below the surface, but credit Shyamalan for refusing to make it the centerpiece of the taleuntil the end of course. I wish he would have trusted us as an audience a bit more in that regard. The visuals are handled with deft precision, the wind and flowing foliage is gorgeous to experience, yet completely frightening at the same time. The detail and fluidity of realism is a feat to behold, but once you realize the intent of that motion, you want to turn and run yourself. If nothing else, Shymalan is a definite master of mood and enveloping his audience into the world he creates. Whereas a film like Signs shows his manipulation too strongly, leading us by the hand, step by step, to the end, Night has definitely honed this skill by putting us into the world in order for ourselves to end up where he wants us, thinking we got there all on our own. This is what makes The Village resonate with me so much, he never tried to trick me, he just let me wander in and uncover the secrets. He does much the same here with our fears of terrorism and closed-minded views when it comes to the far-fetched (Mother Nature fighting? Yeah right). By showing how each character reacts to what is happening, we are allowed to pick the one we agree with and see how he/she will fare and find out what is really going on.<br/><br/>The problems come in with the uneven tempo and mood that's laid out. This is a dark story of death and destruction, containing moments that are not for the faint of heart. Believe me, when you see our leads travel with a certain age demographic you will get lulled into the sense of security that, oh, now nothing will happen. I'll just warn you that anything can and will occur, despite any preconceptions you may have. However, with that cynicism and unabashed freedom to carry the story to any end, Night decided he needed to temper it all with comedy and humor. While a little of this is a plus, he goes overboard here. Some moments are cringingly bad to watch and make you wonder how he didn't cut the scene completely, or why no one recommended that he do so. Yes, there was the unintentional humor brought to the forefront by the crowd I saw the film with, but some of the stuff was just too over the top that it must have been done on purpose. I truly believed Shymalan told his actors to ham it up for some end game, but when nothing resulted, (no Haunted Honeymoon sequence when you find that all the craziness and camp was a result of the entire film being a radio show), I only had to blame the cast for its amateur sensibilities and the director for his inability to get the performances needed.<br/><br/>Before I go into detail, I just want to mention the one person who got it right. John Leguizamo is absolutely fantastic in a smaller role as a math teacher. He embodies the role and the responsibilities his family life carries with it to perfection. Start to finish, not a single false moment. This cannot be said for anyone else. Zooey Deschanel has instances of brilliance, but also way too many of her manic jittering and wide-eyed stares that work so well as the drugged out hippie in ""Weeds"" but not so much as the emotionally troubled wife here. Mark Wahlberg is half great, half bad. When he has his moments of levity, pretending to be that cool teacher goofing around while subliminally still teaching something, he reminded me of his delivery from I Heart Huckabees. Where he fails is when he attempts to be a normal suburbanite. Truthfully, he can't pull it off. He is from the streets, his speech patterns are from the streets, and he should not be made to pretend to be Johnny Do Good. All he does is inflect words that make him appear to have a weird staccato and horrible grasp on the English languageit's too forced.<br/><br/>So, while visually stunning and intriguingly plotted, the end result becomes too campy to hold the weight that Night sets out to have. The scientific stuff if interesting and handled well enough to be believable, never taking us out of the world we are transported too. I also loved the ""Twilight Zone""-esquire conclusion, showing the bigger picture of what really is happening. Whether it was just cast wrong or played wrong, the acting is too stilted at times, the script uneven and laughableDo you like hotdogs?and in the end disjointed enough to sometimes lose your footing on what is happening. Humor is necessary to allow the darkness to breathe, not to take us off course only to steer back sharply. There are the makings of a very good film here, I just think maybe a bit more work was needed to excise it from what finally hit the screen."
"nefertari86","5","1","6","14 June 2008"," Yawn
","I went into this movie fully expecting it to be like the last two Shyamalan movies I saw Signs and The Village: no so veiled religious symbolism and social commentary, an abrupt anti-climactic ending, and the slight feeling that I was cheated out of a good thriller. I was prepared for all of that...too bad those things weren't what made The Happening so awful.<br/><br/>When they first introduced the idea about the plants I thought it was interesting. However, when they escalated that to scenes with characters trying to outrun the wind, and suck up to a ficus it got just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Although, M. Night Shyamalan movies do tend to be more character driven than plot driven overall so maybe the strength of the characters would hold your interest right? Unfortunately no...most are just plain dull and while putting on terrified expressions seem to have a pulse rate you'd guess was barely above comatose, and the few you're at all tempted to like are quickly killed off.<br/><br/>The two I liked where John Leguizamo as the likable best friend who brilliantly played out the old joke of 'did you know that X number of statistics are just made up on the spot?' And Frank Collison as the eccentric nursery owner who first solves the mystery of The Happening. <br/><br/>The main character played by Mark Wahlberg reminded me of how many people said that Scott Speedman's character in The Strangers was such a wimp...well if they liked Speedman in that movie they'll just LOVE Wahlberg in this one. He plays a high school science teacher who embodies all the worst stereotypes of teachers, and is a complete joke as a scientist! Even more boring was Zooey Deschanel as his wife. Her character seemed pretty under developed, and the parts that you did see weren't ones you liked. I spent the entire time either wanting to slap ""Alma"", or, being a Bones fan, marveling at how much Zooey really does look like Emily. The two have basically no chemistry together so the old storyline about two characters in a crumbling relationship being brought back together through shared hardship just didn't work that well. The scene where, on what they think is the brink of death, they reminisce about their first date put me to sleep rather than melting my heart, and I didn't feel any enthusiasm for the happy news they got in the aftermath of The Happening. <br/><br/>The creepiest character, by far, was Betty Buckley as the isolated shut-in who lived without any connection to the outside world including electricity. In regards to her this was one time where I agreed with Alma...I'd rather take my chances with airborne toxins than take shelter with ""Mrs. Jones""! I couldn't help but wonder, though, whether she was stuck in at the last minute because Shyamalan realized the airborne toxin idea wasn't creating as much suspense as he'd hoped.<br/><br/>The final 'twist' can hardly be called one because I don't think it'll come as a shock to anyone. <br/><br/>As a 4th year biology student, I do agree with the idea that humans are the biggest threat on this planet, but this movie was a poor exploration of that idea and may have even set back acceptance of it! The premise could have been interesting, and the plant idea, while far fetched could probably have been pulled off, but, alas, as a cautionary eco-thriller this one fell flat, and, as a character driven exploration of the the human condition, it feel even farther!"

","So...im kinda a fan of Shyamalan movies..all of them...but this one rly left me kinda unsatisfied for 2 main reasons. First in global the movie was a bit too slow and boring..it needed a bit more action overall.<br/><br/>There's a lot of predictable yet surprising scenes also witch make it better. The acting of either walhberg and dechanel are rather weird and seemed a bit forced..like artificial..not something that is uncommon on shaymalan movies so im used to it. I expected also a bit more than just a ""tree-nature attack""... trying to make it as natural as possible made the movie missing something, a bit more fantasy was needed in my opinion.<br/><br/>So...second reason and this one i would like to know if any 1 also seen it on the movies...because i did and it made me laugh and discredit a lot the movie and the effort put into it. The situation was that i actually saw many times along the movie in many scenes the actual microphone to enchance the actors speech, on the screen...really..some times u could actually see almost the whole thing. i ask what the hell is that shyamalan? did u actually reviewed the movie before u launched it? cmon.."
"bmeeker2","5","1","6","14 June 2008"," Rent This
","In a story such as this, you're supposed to want to root for the main characters, your protagonists. Mark Wahlberg does some of the worst acting I have ever seen, which sent my theater into peals of laughter at just how awful it was. His wife did not garner any sympathy from me either, and I found myself rooting against her.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie will make you leave the theater asking questions, but it also led to a lot of grumbling from our audience. Granted, it was just one theater and granted, it's just my opinion, but this movie is not a gem, NOR do you need to go spend money to see it in a theater. Save your money and rent it. There's nothing in this movie that after renting it, you'll say, ""Awww, I wish I'd gone to the theater for THAT part!"" It just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>In closing, I enjoyed The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, found Signs and the Village weaker, felt Lady in the Water had a mythical quality to it I could get behind, and was as I've written, disappointed with The Happening. Trust me. Rent it."
"TOMNEL","6","1","6","13 June 2008"," So many elements of this film annoyed me, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.
","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be having trouble keeping his writing and direction fresh. The Lady in the Water was his worst attempt at originality with not only a strange, boring incoherent plot, but with stupid flat characters and boring dialogue. In my opinion, this is his second worst film, and this was not bad...well, maybe it was, but it was still pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>Strange events begin to happen, starting in Central Park. Everyone in the park stops, walks back a few steps, says some pointless drivel, and then kills themselves, in many various gruesome ways. The mass suicides begin to spread, and people begin to leave their homes to find a place not contaminated by whatever is causing this strange reactions in humans. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher, and with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and his co-worker's daughter Jess, they travel to avoid this strange plague.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is the terrible dialogue. Some lines had me cringing and wondering what Mr. Shyamalan was thinking when he wrote these clunky words on paper. Had he been watching corny romantic comedies and bad sit-coms and figured he'd make a science fiction/drama with the same bad lines? My least favorite line in the movie, and possibly one of my least favorite lines I've ever heard is where John Leguizamo's character dumps his daughter off on Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. When Zooey reaches for her hand, Leguizamo says ""Don't hold her hand unless you mean it!"" What the heck does that even mean? He's dumping his daughter off on them, and he tells her not to hold his daughter's hand unless she means it...means what? Means that she wants to hold her hand? What an awful line and delivery, and there are many of these little ""gem"" lines throughout. The writing for each character is the same, making even the little 8 year old girl seem like an adult, and I would rather hear diversity in the characters instead of hearing a movie full of M. Night Shyamalans. The actors seemed to even change for their roles. Mark Wahlberg gives an odd performance as a normal person who isn't a jerk or a tough guy. It's hard to tell if his performance is bad or good, it's still weird to me, but his character was likable, so I guess it was effective.<br/><br/>The direction artistically is good. It looks nice, and the camera work looks just fine. But, when the characters talk is when Shyamalan's weaknesses in direction show. Instead of making individual characters, he has them all act the same. They all whisper for dramatic effect a lot, and they cry a lot, no matter the situation. It just gets annoying. It's similar to the writing in that it gets repetitive. This is one of the few movies where more establishing shots might have actually helped it, just to give the audience a break from unrelenting sameness.<br/><br/>Now, this movie has some very bad qualities, but it is not a bad movie. From the very beginning I was interested and entertained, and even some of the awful writing caused an uncomfortable laugh in me and some others in the audience. The plot is pretty original and unique, and though it could have been handled a little better, the plot was developed nicely. There were also a few jump scenes, which is hard to produce when nothing really jumps out at you, and each scene takes place in the daytime, but the jump scenes are still thrown in there. The suicides are gruesome and fans of the violent and morbid will love the blood and gore, even though Shyamalan didn't go overboard with the violence. He wisely used it sparingly, but enough for us to get how horrible these events truly are.<br/><br/>So M. Night Shyamalan has come a long way from The Sixth Sense...a long way down. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece, and it seems his techniques are getting old, but aren't totally useless. He made a suspenseful movie, despite the silliness of everything. Don't expect a classic going in, because you won't get one. Put your standards lower than they would be for ""Lady in the Water"" and you might find you can squeeze some goodness even out of the bad.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins. R for gruesome violence."
"Foxbarking","3","1","6","13 June 2008"," A Big Disappointment
","After a couple of very bad films, I had hoped that good old M. Night would have finally rebounded with ""The Happening."" The previews for this film all looked very good. The premise was pretty interesting as well. However, as interesting as it may be, the movie can not capitalize on this.<br/><br/>I won't go into any detail about the film, because there are more than enough reviews and such where a reader can get this information. However, just know that there are a few creepy scenes, but other than that, this movie is a waste of your time and money. There really is no suspense, the explanation for what is happening is very lame and the acting is sub-par.<br/><br/>If you really want to watch this movie, save it for a rental. I really wanted to like it, but it made it pretty impossible to."

"das417","5","1","6","13 June 2008"," An underwhelming ""disaster"" movie
","Humanity faces many dangers to its existence. War, plague, nuclear weapons, global warming, and a host of other problems haunt the minds of millions around the world. While the list is extensive as it now stands, M. Night Shyamalan believes he has found something else to add to our collective unease....<br/><br/>And, in doing so, he and The Happening fall flat.<br/><br/>Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a dedicated biology teacher in Philadelphia high-school. His life revolves around his students and his neurotic wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) which both provide for a stable, if perhaps rather uninteresting, urban life. With his close friend and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo), Elliot has a comfortable life that is stable as it is predictable. Even rumors that Alama is unhappy with the marriage, rumors of course that Julian is more than ready to encourage to ""help"" his friend Elliot, isn't enough to shake Elliot out of his self imposed scientific mindset which of course all high-school biology teachers rely upon.<br/><br/>That is until something unexplained happens in New York City. Without warning, or explanation, dozens of people suddenly become disoriented as listless. Even more terrifying is that those affected begin committing suicide on a massive scale. Self inflicted gun shot wounds, impalement's, and throwing themselves off high rise buildings are but a few of the way that dozens, soon to be hundreds and then thousands, end their own lives. What's worse is that whatever it is that is occurring seems to be quickly spreading out from New York and affecting the entire Northeast of the United States.<br/><br/>While no one has a reason or explanation as to why this is happening, Elliot, Alma, Julian and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) escape the city along with anyone else who can get out. However, they soon discover that there is no escaping from ""the happening"" that is destroying the populations of some of the largest urban areas in the country. Abandoned in a small rural town outside the city, the four and the rest of the train's passengers discover that they are on their own and expected to find their own way through whatever it is that is forcing thousands to destroy themselves.<br/><br/>The plot above sounds like an exciting thriller that would push the audience to be engaged with the plot and the characters who we would of course care about. However, unfortunately that does not happen (no pun intended). Instead of an intelligent plot and deep characters, The Happening is instead full of poor attempts at humor, bad dialog and unintentional laughs. It is explained that the plant kingdom has somehow decided to declare war on man and that by releasing a toxin in the air it has unleashed a weapon of mass destruction where there is no defense against. There is no nothing more dangerous sounding than the evolution of plants, right? <br/><br/>The Happening centers mainly around Elliot, Alma, and Jess running from one field to the next while Elliot tries to find a scientific reasoning in order to keep them all alive. What this amounts to is running from the wind (how is that possible?) and staying in small groups because the plants ""know"" where the larger groups are. As with all disaster movies there are encounters with those who don't want to help and desperate situations where the characters resort to things they otherwise would never have done. The problem is that once we know what is causing the happening to occur it all seems so futile and even amusing. The wind blowing in the trees? Well, that means your days are numbered.<br/><br/>The Happening is a good idea that unfortunately had little to offer in substance and whether or not there was an intentional environmental message behind it is irrelevant. There are many things we need to worry about but thankfully plants trying to kill us with toxins isn't one of them. <br/><br/>5/10"

","Absolutely loved the idea of the film. The general plot was amazing and the story would have made such a good horror/mystery film if it was done properly. Unfortunately it wasn't. It felt like a few horror scenes linked together loosely with a storyline that didn't have much substance. Some bad and wholly unnecessary CGI. If this were M. Night Shyamalans first film then it would have been a great start. I think he said it best in an interview after ""Signs"" when he said something along the lines of, music is a fill in for a bad/empty script. Way too much music. BUT, the horror scenes were very good, some great creepy scenes and as i said i loved the idea of it all. overall one of the better horror movies of this year."
"kundan-nitrkl","7","1","7","1 August 2008"," Never go by the ratings. I found it interesting !
","I had some time before watching this movie so checked out some reviews. All of them were pointing me not to watch. I consider Shyamalan as one of the gifted and talented director so I watched the movie anyways and I was not a bit disappointed, at least if I go by the reviews. One must be able to appreciate the hard work put in by Shyamalan. Its a original story, made nicely enough to capture your attention throughout the film. New York city is suddenly attacked by some mysterious agents which drives people to commit suicides and this is spreading. The people are clueless. There is chaos. Elliot and friends try to get out of the city into a safer place but it doesn't always happen the way you want it to be. Elliot has to save his love and his friend's daughter out of this and then begins an adventure.<br/><br/>Its been Shyamalan's trademark that in his movies the characters are always above the story and same happened in Happening. Mark, I thought, was perfect for the job. The others were not much attractive but one must not miss that since Mark is the main protagonist and the movie completely revolves around him. Mark was excellent. With the occasional comedy and romance thrusted in, the movie was worth the time. The plot is good enough to hold you back and spasmodic thrills bring chills. I consider this another excellent piece from Shyamalan although it will be always below Sixth Sense or Unbreakable but I admit I have enjoyed every movie of him. It deserves a better review and rating than this. Take my word, never go by the rating and you will find it good enough."

"jbushy14","7","1","7","16 June 2008"," The Happening (look past the media)
","Despite all the bad media surrounding this film I still went to see it. And I was pleased with what I saw. In previous work M. Night Shyamalan shows that he is a writer/producer/director like none other. He doesn't worry about how glamorous the film is. Instead he paints the picture as if you were there. His use of mainly one camera in all his movies make you feel like you are witnessing the events. For movies now-a-days we want the special effects and the gorgeous style of shooting along with a happy ending. M. Night Shymalan changes this. As I stated above his style is different. But in his previous writing he doesn't give us the happy ending we crave. (I will not say how The Happening ends) And the lack of closure in his previous work make the viewer think. The viewer can't just walk out of the theater and discard the story just witnessed. Instead they think about the film and forever remember the story. Overall I think you should look past the media and listen to how you feel. Don't be afraid of the unknown."
"clogan-1","1","1","7","15 June 2008"," Crosses the line between entertainment and preaching.
","Mr. Shyamalan has crossed the line between entertaining the audience and preaching a green message. The movie holds almost no value as an entertainment. At most it is a Manifesto for being green. We have heard stories that the success of his other films had ""gone to his head"". Someone should have been able to intervene and the tell the director that the writer needs help. I was a loss as to why I should care about the Science teacher or the kid or even Zooey Deschanel's character, eveb with her incredible blue eyes. The movie should have been on SCI-FI with less budget and less hype.<br/><br/>In short miss this film and hope for better work in the future. Maybe studios should only give Mr. Shyamalan one job. He seems to do pretty well as a director. This movie is just wrong on so many levels that if there was an honest voice of decent some in the creative process then things might have come out differently. As it is being the king isn't so good for movie making."

","There are only two reasons I am giving this four stars: 1.) I got into the movie free with a pass 2.) I saw the 'Strangers' the week before<br/><br/>M. Night makes me think of a young director who is trying very hard to be a modern day Spielberg by covering a multitude of paranormal ideas. He seems to have the vision and imagination, but lacks the patience in terms of executing his original thoughts. I found a similar link in this movie to the Village: he gives us the twist way too early, making the last forty minutes or so a long, drawn-out conclusion. Had he the patience to wait the appropriate length of time to 'reveal' the twist, these movies might have had a stronger impact. The acting is not very good at all and the attempts at witty dialogue sound too much like a 'Scooby-Doo' cartoon. I honestly couldn't find one good moment of acting or dialogue that didn't feel like a cartoon. People are panicked by the wave of death, yet they really aren't. The Army guy who shows up is plain stupid and suggests an underlying belief by Night that everyone in the Army is ignorant. M. Night then throws out the 'if we were more nice to plants, this wouldn't have happened' politics, revealing his 'greener' side and appeasing Hollywood hippies and producers alike. Very sad. I love apocalypse movies, but this one certainly isn't one by my standards. Literally twenty four hours after the start of bad juju, love prevails and saves the day, ending the catastrophe. But wait, not so fast....it's happening again all over...no shock there. I would have rather seen the trees and plants come to life and kill everyone than have them run away from the wind. I suppose for my apocalypse flavor, I'll have to hold on tight for the film version of Stephen King's 'Cell' and hope that Eli Roth can deliver something more shocking, better acted and overall more disturbing than 'The Happening'."

","Alright, first off, I'm going to go ahead and possibly mark myself as insane and say: I liked this movie. Now, before you dismiss me completely and say I have no sense of movies or characters or what truly defines what should be considered a good movie (or that I will just automatically like anything by M. Night), let me explain.<br/><br/>No, it wasn't terribly scary. No, it wasn't the most easily interpreted movie in the world. No, not everything was laid out nice and neat and perfectly placed. No, it wasn't like so many horror/thriller movies out there that take part in gore-fests and naked screaming girls who are so ridiculously unbelievable that you want to throw popcorn at them.<br/><br/>But then, isn't that a good thing?<br/><br/>Everyone is constantly complaining about a lack of originality in Hollywood's latest plethora of movies, and then when one finally rolls around we write it off as 'stupid'.<br/><br/>Well, I don't think it was stupid. Not at all. It was a classic M. Night movie.<br/><br/>It was more about what 'you' brought to the movie than what he told you straight up. It's all in your head, and that can make a really good movie. I don't think that the actors were poorly cast or 'uninspired' (a word I've heard all too frequently when someone describes this movie). They played the parts as the parts were meant to be played.<br/><br/>Like real people.<br/><br/>They walked around, talked with friends, worried about things without necessarily saying they were worried and showed concern without necessarily voicing said concerns. They reacted in different ways-- which people do-- to an insane and scary situation.<br/><br/>People died in this movie. Everywhere, people died. They killed themselves. Because they couldn't help it. And so what if the cause was plants? It's just as believable-- and much more original-- as if it were the government or some germ warfare. And in the end, it wasn't about the fact that people were killing themselves or that plants were retaliating against mankind's treacherous actions against nature. It was about love. When you boil it all down, it was about love. And maybe the reason so many people don't like this movie is because they either don't understand it, were disappointed it wasn't part of the aforementioned gore-fest, or can't see the importance of reading the signs. Maybe the problem is no one wants to 'think' when they're watching a movie. No one wants to 'interpret' or walk away and mull it over in their minds. But if you don't do that, you lose something.<br/><br/>If you don't like kind of artsy, love-will-conquer-all, have-to-think-about-it movies, you probably won't like this one. But don't worry: there are plenty of people out there who agree with you."

I can easily compare it to ""children of men"", or even ""cloverfield"" (not the camera angle or the action of course) where there is a story that you won't fully understand because the director doesn't want you to and it is not the focus of the movie, but rather the focus is on a small group of people who are experiencing certain events and you get to see how they react to them.

","I remember how fond I was of this one when I first saw it at the cinema and for purely nostalgic and personal reasons it deserves an extra star! It focuses on married couple Elliot and Alma (Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) and father and daughter Julian and Jess (John Leguizamo and Ashlyn Sanchez) evacuating away from a rapidly spreading plague in which the afflicted are forced to commit suicide. Watching it again years later, it has lost its edge that I remember so well; but there are elements in it that I think still make it worth watching. The premise itself is quite a good one and I think explored pretty well with a very jarring opening sequence and the symptoms of the infected repeating themselves and walking backwards is still quite chilling. It is relentlessly violent at times and I admire that about it; it takes its subject and goes full throttle with it. James Newton Howard produces another memorable and spooky soundtrack; I haven't heard another one quite like it and the main theme has stuck with me all these years! On another watch, I realised just how great Zooey Deschanel is in it; I think it's her best performance and that's saying a lot considering she's good in anything she's in! John Leguizamo's delivery of the line 'Don't take my daughters hand unless you mean it.' still gives me shivers and perfectly encapsulates the desperation and intense mentality everyone would have during an epidemic like this. If you're expecting a good twist or big reveal at the end you'll be sorely disappointed but I think the randomness and mystery of it all is what M Night was going for; personally I didn't mind it but I understand how it may frustrate some viewers. Despite its flaws, it's a pleasure of mine due to the aspects I've mentioned and there are a couple moments of awkwardly delivered dialogue that are hilarious"

","""The Happening"" (2008), who green lit this?! This ""movie"" is supposed to be a thriller film, right? Well, the ""thrilling"" part is what I'm questioning, it somehow got turned into a lackluster comedy! This ""film"" is yet another one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. Dull cliched story, horrible acting, cheap special effects, boring sets/locations, and a generic predictable soundtrack to attempt to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. Usually, screenplays written by M. Night Shyamalan suck, and this is no exception. ""The Happening"" is, by far, his worst screenplay and ""movie"" he has ever made! But, the premise is actually sort of creative. A virus that infects people and causes them to commit suicide, that really sounds like a tension-filled idea! That was what intrigued me to watch this ""film"" in the first place. When I saw it, talk about a massive disappointment! But, saying that is an understatement. This is one of the most poorly executed movies that I have ever seen! Their basically running from the wind. Whee! The acting doesn't help matters either. That being said, most of the actors and actresses are great actors in other movies and shows. However, I think that the film makers forgot to tell them that before they went to act in this ""movie"". Probably the absolute worst performance in this ""film"", which surprised me, is from Mark Wahlberg. Now, outside of ""The Happening"", Mark Wahlberg is a great actor! But in this ""film"", what happened? The worst actress in this ""movie"" is Zooey Deschanel. Her line delivery is nothing short of a joke. Also, her neutral expression looks like a deer in a headlight face. Or, she just pooped her pants and she's trying to hide it. The rest of the actors and actresses suck too in this ""movie"". Being a movie made in 2008, you'd expect all the special effects to be great, right? Most of them are fine, but a lot of them are obviously CGI. Whenever M. Night Shyamalan produces a movie, he usually tries to maintain a PG-13 rating. However, at the last second, the other film makers convinced him to make it R-rated. Therefore, a lot of the shots with blood were digitally added. Granted, that can work if it looked realistic. But, in this ""film"", you can obviously tell it was animated and added in at the last second. The sets/locations are boring and accentuate the dull cliched plot of this ""story"". Finally, the soundtrack is generic and cliched. Honestly, I cannot remember a single note from this ""film"" score. For a soundtrack to work, it has to be good and memorable. This one is bad, and not memorable! ""The Happening"" had a fairly decent concept behind it, but once again, poor execution ruined it's chance to shine. There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this ""film"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. ""The Happening"" is a waste of cinema, and is not worth watching. Be warned, if you do watch it, make sure you don't have any dangerous objects nearby and that you're on the first floor. This ""movie"" may cause suicide! M. Night Shyamalan, I have to ask: what in the world were you thinking?!"

","... As stated by Mark Wahlberg in the 'The Happening'. This absolutely phenomenal and in depth dialogue really describes this film perfectly. It is obvious Wahlberg was breaking the fourth wall at this particular moment while referring to the film.<br/><br/>In all honesty though, i can and will never understand how this film is directed by the same director as the masterpiece 'The Sixth Sense'. M. Night Shyamalan isn't know for his consistency, but the difference in quality between these two films is just enormous. There is probably not a single other director out there that has a greater gap in the quality of two of his films. There is just no explanation how Shyamalan turns from The Sixth Sense to this bunch of nonsense. With the knowledge that Shyamalan is in fact actually capable of producing something amazing, the fact that this film is such utter trash really supports the suggestion that this was done on purpose.<br/><br/>Now for the substantial part... The Happening is horribly acted, lazily and poorly written & terribly framed and photographed. Now, Mark Wahlberg is an actor that in the past has proven himself to be an adequate factor in most of his films ( See his performances in either Boogie Nights or The Departed ), so his absolutely atrocious performance in this film is for the most part also thanks to Shyamalan, who also wrote the screenplay. Shyamalan's screenplay is full of illogicalities and unintentionally funny moments. There are so many scenes in The Happening where something bad happens, and never do any of the character seem to react to it. They just stand there, not moving, like a bunch of 'uninvolved observers!' as Zooey Deschanel states. This is a recurring theme throughout the film. There is for example a scene in which some people hear a gunshot from behind a hill, and they do absolutely nothing. They do not run away or run towards it. They just do nothing except stare in front of themselves. There is also a scene where two characters are blown away by shotguns from inside a house on a porch, after which two other characters sit in front of said porch for another two minutes while the shotgun guys are still in there. Wahlberg also talks to a tree, which is saying enough. There is also a lot of irrelevant newspaper exposition, which is ofcourse one of the most annoying forms of exposition because it involves characters nobody knows who talk about circumstantial things which do not tell the audience anything we did not already know. But hey, Shyamalan thinks his viewers are idiots, so why not? In short, all of these nonsensical character moments make this one of the worst screenplays ever made.<br/><br/>As for the acting, everyone is complete garbage. Mark Wahlberg, who as stated before is definitely not a bad actor, obviously doesn't look like he wants to be in this film, perhaps due to some feeling of shame as he must have already felt how terrible this was going to be. Unfortunately for him, this performance does really make him seem like a bad joke, although Shyamalan's dialogue doesn't help either. His immortal sarcastic utterly unconvincing line delivery of 'What? No!' really emphasizes his will of being in this film. Although once again there is a lot of dialogue that no actor could have pulled off convincingly. Zooey Deschanel is nearly as bad as Wahlberg, but i think if the screentime of both characters were reversed that these roles would also be reversed, since she is too absolutely terrible. 'Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented' is ofcourse a terrible line of dialogue by Shyamalan, but Deschanel's delivery is something else entirely.<br/><br/>The cinematography is plain bloated and ugly, with absolutely terrible framing. There are many weird choices of close ups instead of widescreen ( Especially in a sequence that is supposed to be intense when another group is being executed behind a near hill ) which really create an awkward and unintentionally hilarious situation. This is not like a Leone film where the close ups are so immersive and involving due to it being an emotional and visual responder to when something is going to happen, but just an awkward piece of framing that becomes an unintentional hilarity. These are dumb characters with dumb dialogue standing still like a bunch of idiots while people are getting slaughtered. Close ups here do not emphasize the intensity, but only emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation. Not to mention there are many shots where certain people are simply not in frame. The rule of thirds is almost never used and it results in many unremarkable and ugly shots.<br/><br/>The only positive about 'The Happening' is James Newton Howard's score, which was a superb emotional piece. Too bad for him it is wasted on such a terrible and forgettable film, although the unintentional hilariousness of it will still linger in a lot of minds.<br/><br/>The Happening is a terrible film. Yet it is still a very likeable terrible film, because of its laughably unconvincing line deliveries and horrendous dialogue. Unfortunately Shyamalan was really going for the psychological terror approach here in the context of Hitchcock's The Birds and thus this does not really work out since the framing and the deliveries of these horrendous line make this more like a comedy than something that is supposed to be disturbing or scary, because both are nonexistent in this film."

","That is the explanation for this movie to exist. It's one of Shyamalan strangest movies, and that's not exactly a very good thing.<br/><br/>A mysterious chemical virus or something like that makes the people that is affected to commit suicide. Here are involved a science teacher, Elliot (Mark Wahlberg), his wife Alma (Zoey Deschannel) and a friend of them (John Leguizamo). The story started pretty well and for the first 40 minutes or so it was interesting and despite some very stupid things of the script and some average acting it was good. But then they start trying to run away from the wind and the movie started to fall down and the last ten minutes were just awful (sad ending but no, it's a happy ending, no, wait, it's a bad ending. What's that?) The logic for explaining the virus that is a mystery of the nature and we'll never understand it and that's it. Probably Shyamalan didn't knew how to end the story and how to give it a reasonable explanation and came up with this. <br/><br/>The actors were at parts good, specially the main three, but at other parts were bad acting. (Mark Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant like it was going to answer him...) Zooey Deschannel has some good moments and she is beautiful, but a pretty face don'd make an actuation good. And well, all the extras were just useless. Also, was it necessary to add all the disturbing and graphic deaths? Some of you may like it but I found it at parts funny and at parts disgusting, but no serious.<br/><br/>On the good side I have to say that Shyamalan is still able to create tension and give the movie the feeling it needs by the camera work he is used to (despite here being less noticeable). And also the score by James Newton Howard, not as good as in other Shyamalan moments but still provides some very good moments.<br/><br/>In general this is a very entertaining and interesting movie until it reaches the hour of duration or so, where it falls down a lot, but I'm pretty sure that if you're a Shyamalan fan you will enjoy it at most of it."

","The career of director/writer/producer Shyamalan is something of a mystery. Neither Signs or The Sixth Sense are bad movies - at least not in a way that makes you regret that you've spent the time watching them. But then there are those of his films that make you feel exactly like that, and it makes me wonder why this guy still gets to make movies. After Earth. The Visit. The Happening. How can someone go from good to incomprehensibly bad and still have the continued support from the industry? I guess his name for some reason still makes money.<br/><br/>The Happening is a B-movie, or at least it feels like it. The characters are incoherent and act and talk like they're in an exploitation movie from the seventies, and it's not done on purpose - like Machete-on purpose. Most of what comes out of Mark Wahlberg's mouth sounds weird, and his reactions are constantly disproportionate to the situation. He's not a favorite actor of mine but I have never experienced his acting this disjointed before so I'm guessing it's a directorial issue. Zooey Deschanel's performance doesn't sit right either, and the fact that the two characters are supposed to be married is simply laughable. There is no chemistry between them whatsoever.<br/><br/>If the acting and characterization is flawed, what about the story? Well, I do find the premise of the film somewhat intriguing. Unfortunately, it's presented in such a way that it comes off as highly improbable - almost as a joke. The awkwardness of any dialogue concerning the underlying cause of ""the event"" doesn't make things better. Because of the bad writing the attempts to scientifically explain the infection falls completely flat.<br/><br/>Thinking about watching The Happening? Don't. Watch the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers instead. Similar idea - much better movie. Heck, even the remake from 2007 will do."

I decided to start off with in my opinion one of the worst but at the same time one of the best movies I've ever sat through, The Happening.<br/><br/>I only need to say the name of one man and you know how bad/good this movie is ""M. Night Shyamalan."" Anyone who's ever sat through at least one of this director's films know that he is famous for making good actors turn in horrible performances and it carries on over with the happening as none of the actors seem to be acting normal at all but easily the most entertaining is our main star, Mark Wahlberg. Like Shyamolon, if anyone has seen any movies with Wahlberg in it know how good he is as Wahlberg always seems to turn in brilliant performances, but the Happening is his exception. He seems to deliver his lines in this weird over emphasised tone. Now at first I didn't really think much of it in the first few scenes he was in as I saw he was playing a teacher so I was thinking teachers usually need to speak like this when they address their pupils but as I saw the movie go on, I realise that this is his whole performance. Zooey Deschannel is probably worse than Wahlberg's. Her delivery is about as equally bad but the thing that seems to put her that extra step in front of Wahlberg on the bad acting scale is her facial expressions. She seems to widen her eyes in a lot of the shots, some of them when it's even unnecessary to do it. Everyone else basically delivers the same sort of acting you would expect in a Shyamolon movie.<br/><br/>It's also really lazily written, particularly the script. It's hard to describe how lazily written the script is so what I'm going to do instead is quote a few of the lines from the movie.<br/><br/>""You like hot dogs right?"" ""Cheese and crackers!"" Keep in mind that this is a sort of post-apocalyptic movie and there are just some random lines that are put in this movie about food for some reason.<br/><br/>""All we have left is cough syrup"" ""Look I don't know if you guys have read an article in the New York Times about honey bees vanishing."" I think that should be enough to tell you that the happening is a really bad movie. When I was going into this movie, I was expecting some sort of ""the triffids"" esque movie, but I just got a poorly directed, badly written, horribly acted post-apocalyptic drama. Avoid this."

Zooey Deschanel plays his wife who is unexplainably clueless. John Leguizamo is featured as another teacher, as well as Ashlyn Sanchez as his speechless daughter. One must be speechless when you audition for a film and get thrust into this crap. Betty Buckley plays an elderly woman who obviously hasn't kept up on her medicine after all the mumbo jumbo she belts out. One could say that this contrived idiotic farce is a reference to the rapture but for all the laughs being played out through suicide, it leaves the impression that no one was on the ball when this hit pre-production. One must wonder what's happening with M. Night Shyamalan. Score: 3 / 10"
"messinaitaly","3","0","1","23 May 2015"," Good Concept, bad result
","This movie had a lot of potential. I know that people think the idea of trees causing people to kill themselves is crazy, but it's actually a good idea. Why do I think this? Well most trees are connected via roots. Now lets say that a tree connected to other trees is infected with the biological chemical that caused people to kill themselves. Because the trees are connected, the chemical could spread to other trees and release the chemical everywhere like in ""The Happening"". Even though the concept is good, the film is still bad because of it's horrible acting and screen writing. The acting is unbelievable and silly while a lot of dialogue has nothing to do with the movie. The worst of it being about the hot dogs. What was Shyamalan thinking when he added the scene about hot dogs? What does that have to do with the trees and events happening? In conclusion, if it wasn't for the screen writing and acting, this might have been a pretty good movie, but instead contributed to Shyamalan's continuing downfall."

","Went into this film not really knowing what to expect, I remember there been a bit of hype for this film when it first came out however I do not understand how. <br/><br/>After about 10 minutes I could tell this film wasn't going to be great, the whole thing seemed slightly off from the start. The camera work seemed very poor with multiple close ups of everyones faces every 2 minutes, the acting wasn't great especially from Zooey Deschanel who had a blank face for the entire film, there was no substance to any of the characters and there were multiple moments in the film where it just felt awkward.<br/><br/>The film was almost like a comedy in places where I did actually laugh, the way in which the two boys were killed was just ridiculous and Mrs Jones' house was another weird inclusion to the film with a deranged old woman who was supposed to be creepy but instead found myself laughing at whatever she said.<br/><br/>The ending was stupid as was the whole plot to the film, I recommend not watching this film and it is by far the worst film I have seen Mark Wahlberg in."

","Okay, most of us film fans will say that we loved M. Night Shymalan's 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable.' And 'The Village' and even 'Signs' were more hit than miss. However, when it came to 'The Happening,' something... happened.<br/><br/>Whereas his other films were all logical (or at least logic in a supernatural setting), had a good story, acting and pacing, The Happening didn't seem to have any of them. What it did have (and its main high-point in my opinion) was a very creepy premise. One day - for no reason at all - people start to commit suicide, en masse. Why? We don't know. They just do.<br/><br/>Therefore, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel must do their best to unravel the mystery while at the same time trying not to succumb to the urge to kill themselves. And it doesn't really work. For those few people who try to praise this movie, they say that its high-point is that it is a MYSTERY and therefore not meant to be solves. Others just get frustrated by the little information we - the audience - are given concerning what's actually happening.<br/><br/>Oh, and that's another thing, people keep using the word 'happening' at least once in every conversation - presumably in case you've forgotten what film you're watching. And it gets annoying after a while.<br/><br/>Another low point is Zooey Deschanel. Don't get me wrong... I like her as an actress and she's been good in other projects. However, here, she delivers her lines with about as much passion as a tree blowing in the wind. There's an absolute lack of chemistry between her and Wahlberg, who, by his own admission, only took the part so he could play a teacher (as opposed to his usual roles as criminals or tough guys).<br/><br/>I've watched The Happening twice now. It's not anywhere as good as Shymalan's previous work, but - somehow - it retains enough weird and dark charm to warrant a second viewing for me. Don't expect every question to be answered and, if you can live with the frustration after ninety minutes then you may hate it a little less than most (a bit like me).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"rwpiercey","5","0","2","4 May 2014"," The Happening is an unfortunate mix of an undeveloped script with good potential and a haphazardly approached vehicle for an environmental message.
","Created in 2008, The Happening follows the adventures of Elliot Moore (played by Mark Wahlberg), his wife Alma (played by Zooey Deschanel), and for a great portion of the film, their more-or-less adopted daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). Other characters make appearances, such as Jess's actual father (Julian, played by John Leguizamo), but none of them tend to stick around for very long. In fact, most of them feel forced, as if they were inserted into the film artificially in order to create more emotional content for the main characters and their situation, but this usually falls short. The main message of the film, that we are destroying the planet and it will eventually seek revenge, is told by way of a ""natural disaster"". As we eventually learn, the plants are upset at us for what we have done to the planet and are releasing toxins which coerce us into taking our own lives. This prompts cities on the East Coast (which is the main area of ""attack"") to semi-calmly evacuate and through this we follow our main characters on their quest for safety and a deeper understanding of the events happening to them. <br/><br/>In general, the impending sense of dread in this film is at odds with the rushed feeling of the work as a whole. We are given the sense that in this world the exact nature of the threat is not quite known, and as Elliot tries to determine this (through his scientific methods) the constant lingering chase of death creates a dramatic tension. There is good use of slow cuts and close-up camera angles to enhance the impending sense of doom, but at times the plot gets in its own way. Characters are haphazardly introduced sometimes seemingly for the sole purpose of having them taken away dramatically. For instance, we are heavy-handedly endeared to the two children who accompany Elliot, Alma and Jess for a short while only to have them graphically and violently taken away minutes later seemingly for the sole purpose of keeping the sense of dread heavy and palpable. Their introduction and subsequent deaths are nothing more than contrived mechanisms to enhance tension. We are led to believe that people are being broken down by the terror all around them (even though it is mostly unseen) and reverting back to baser, more violent instincts to protect solely themselves and their property. I suppose this speaks to the moral at the core of the film and to the opinion of the writer, which seems to be that for a majority of the population (the unenlightened perhaps?) when the dark times come, we are all just beasts inside. I feel, however, that with a bit more time and effort, these characters could have either been given more seamlessly integrated roles, or could have been removed completely and the plot reworked to express their ideas more coherently through further development of the main leads.<br/><br/>Still, there are redeeming qualities from a cinematic standpoint that keep this film above water. An emphasis on sound is used to good effect – as we learn more about the threat the plants pose, we are increasingly aware of the wind in each scene. As the intensity ramps up, so does the blustering threat of death, to the point that seeing the trees begin to waver in the background makes everyone, including the viewer, quite nervous. I would like to say that this film at the end of its journey completes its quest to make the viewer more aware of environmental issues we face, but unfortunately I feel that most viewers would leave the film instead wondering more about the other threads of story seemingly jammed into place. Other films centered around this theme, such as the 2007 film I Am Legend more elegantly expose the main issue of man's inability to survive in concert with nature (though this time by means of a virus), but the message remains clear: if we do not correct our divergence from nature we are doomed to be overtaken by it. The Happening just happens to stumble on its way to deliver this message."

Speaking of confused M. Night Shyamalan must have shouted to Mark Wahlberg ""you do not look confused enough!"" every second of filming as that is literally the only thing close to emotion he ever shows and we know from an interview with Shyamalan Mark was told to not go to his default charter at all and to totally stray from it. Okay then why cast him? So the plot goes on and many figure out the ""antagonist"" very quickly as it is hinted out with no concern for restraint. It is a good antagonist? Well it was in quotes so no, in fact the antagonist is hardly even an antagonist. This paired with the constant confusion of just about every person in the film that come off as inept in every manner of speaking just make for a rather bad film.

"AMar_rom","Null","0","1","24 June 2013"," Started strong but did not go anywhere.
","Let me begin by saying that I am a fan of Night Shyamalan and quite several of his films are among my favorites. I loved the 'Unbreakable' and the 'Village'. I also thought 'Signs' was a very very interesting film despite some flaws. The 'Devil' (for which Shyamalan wrote the story) was also a noteworthy experiment.<br/><br/>The 'Happening', however, misses the mark (and quite badly so). It is a movie dealing with an unexplained epidemic spread in the northeastern United States pressumably caused by plants/trees. The epidemic forces the movie protagonists Elliot and Alma (the couple played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) to take the train from the Philadelphia central station and reach safety somewhere in the interior of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>I admit the movie started out strong and had a very eerie feeling. People started losing their minds and doing totally unexplained things including killing themselves. Initially authorities speak about terrorist attacks releasing chemical weapons but soon it becomes clear that hidden forces of nature are responsible and science cannot provide an answer.<br/><br/>About 30 minutes from the start I thought the film started to run into problems and it never recovered. Plotwise we expect (as audience) to understand and appreciate the danger and its origins (at least to some degree). Here, however, the story did not lead anywhere: the actors walked aimlessly in the countryside with nothing meaningful to say, with the (still) unexplained happenings not making much sense. Some of the dialogue was also becoming silly, e.g. when one of the characters attempted semi-seriously to speak to a plant failing to realize that it was plastic as if it mattered. It was a pity given the talented director and actors involved. A 6/10 from me."
"MaximumMadness","5","0","1","6 March 2012"," ""The Happening""- This is a great unintentional-comedy in the vein of Ed Wood, ""Troll 2"" and ""The Room"", but it fails as a serious film
","Whatever happened to M. Night Shyamalan? His first break-out hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", redefined the horror genre for its time, and it still holds up as one of the finest ghost stories to hit the screen arguably of all time. His next two films, the surreal and low-beat superhero fantasy ""Unbreakable"", and his emotional and contained alien-invasion neo-classic ""Signs"" were further examples of a brilliant director and a first-class writer. These three films remain, in my mind, modern classics, and I continue to watch them from time to time.<br/><br/>However, starting with his fourth film (""The Village""), each film he has made after has gotten progressively more convoluted, more messy and more pretentious. This all lead to his 2008 release, a nature-based 'thriller' entitled ""The Happening."" The film where M. Night's subtle visions and Hitchcock like twists and turns degenerate into a series of goofy jokes revolving around Mark Wahlberg making a fool of himself, and scenes where characters have to hold their breath to avoid breathing in poison wind that will make them go crazy and kill themselves. Uh huh. Sure.<br/><br/>Yes, unfortunately Shyamalan falls victim to the pretentious ""save the rain-forest"" genre, with a lame eco-based horror story about plants releasing a deadly toxin that drives people mad and makes them kill themselves, in order to lash back at people for hurting the Earth too much.<br/><br/>Wahlberg plays Elliot Moore, a teacher in New York City, whom has been having relationship trouble with his girlfriend. (Played by Zooey Deschanel, who I must say, has the most gorgeous eyes I have ever seen. But I digress) Moore is a sort-of optimist, goofy (even borderline ""imbecile""), nice guy who you will both love and hate at the same time. He's borderline stupid, which makes him a lot of fun to watch, as he is constantly in over his head. Wahlberg is either giving his best performance ever, or his worst, depending on your take. John Leguizamo plays a supporting character as Elliot's friend, whom actually gives the films best performance in my mind. Whereas Wahlberg is extremely goofy (he reminded me of a Muppet, to be perfectly honest) and Deschanel is under-used, Leguizamo plays his role seriously and with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>After people inexplicably start to murder themselves in heinous ways all around the city (from leaping off of buildings, to stabbing themselves in the neck with needles, this film does have quite a bit of blood), Moore and the rest of the school is sent home, as city officials fear the suicides are being caused by a terrorist chemical weapon that turns off the brain's natural survival instinct. Moore and his friends try to flee the city, but are stranded in the middle of nowhere with a group of survivors, and must fend for themselves when they realize that plants are the most likely candidate for what is causing these events.<br/><br/>From there on, the film is a bizarre cat-and-mouse game where Elliot, his girlfriend and a few other survivors try to figure out a way to survive nature, which is hell-bent on killing them. There is more than one hilariously over-the-top scene where they must outrun the wind (which is laced with the plant-made poison), and there are plenty of gory deaths to satisfy gore hounds.<br/><br/>This film had a good intention- to be a creepy fun movie that also taught a lesson about respecting the planet, but M. Night seems in over his head, accidentally transforming the film into what feels like a parody and satire of his earlier films. I'm convinced, if M. Night had marketed this movie as a comedy parody of his own films, it would have been hailed as genius, because it honestly feels like he's making fun of himself. All of his trademarks- from his style of camera-work, to his odd and awkward dialog, to his silly jokes, to his trademark twists and turns, and his great use of eerie music they are all here, but they're just so goody and over-the-top, and none of it works. This is a hilarious film, for all of the wrong reasons- it's funny because its so incompetent and at times poorly written and made. I haven't even mentioned the ""hot-dog guy"", the ""lemon drink"" lady or the ""cheese and crackers"" soldier, but they are so insanely written and ridiculously directed, they will leave you howling with laughter.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this movie is not a total loss. It's blatant ""bad-ness"" has turned it into a prime example of a ""so-bad, it's good"" film for its unintentional camp factor. And as an unintentional comedy in the same vein as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""The Room"", this works very well. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 for it's unintentional camp factor. See it, laugh, and forget it."

","I haven't watched many of Shyamalan's films but what I have realised from the ones I have is that they all have a certain style. This film was no different.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed the settings of the films, the basic concept, and the cinematography, there were a lot of flaws with this film.<br/><br/>1. The acting was of a very low standard. I think someone in the casting department needs to think of a job change. Mark Wahlbeg delivered a very poor performance in this film to the point where you wondered if the acting was supposed to be intentionally bad. I think he should just stick to his cop roles which he actually manages to pull off. He doesn't make a good teacher. Zooey Deschanel wasn't much better either and she's normally quite good at acting as from the other films i've seen her in.<br/><br/>2. The storyline. Although I enjoyed the basic concept of a neurotoxin poisoning people and making them commit suicide, they got to the answer of why it was happening a bit too quickly. The plants did it? seriously, someone in the writers department should probably think about a job change too. And what was with Wahlbergs character reciting how to carry out a scientific investigation like he knew exactly what was happening? He's a high school teacher, not exactly a CDC doctor or something.<br/><br/>3. The ending was a little rubbish if truth be told. I expected something a bit more dramatic then, 'the plants must've stopped killing people just as we were about to give up, lets go home, everything is alright now.' Although on the other hand I did like the small part after that, set in Paris or wherever it was.<br/><br/>It seems i've talked about a lot of bad things with this film yet i'm still giving it a six, because although its not up there with some of the great films, its still worth a watch, for the storyline and settings mainly. Its nicely directed and sticks to the theme of a Shyamalan themed movie. If just a few tweaks had been made to this film though, such as improved acting and a bit of a better explanation for the neurotoxin, then perhaps it could have been up there with some of the great movies."

The characters are pretty well-developed, but the acting...could have been better. The hype about its being his first R-rated movie is really just that -- hype. I have a feeling it just toed the line over into R-rated territory. The violence, granted, is there, but it could easily have been toned down for a PG-13 rating.

","What if trees and bushes got together to plot the downfall of humankind? This is the premise of M Night Shyamalan's The Happening. Now, that is what some people might rightly call a ""spoiler"", and as such is not the sort of thing with which one should begin a review. But on the other hand, it could be argued that Shyamalan did a good enough job of spoiling his own film â€“ and the small matter of giving the game away here can't make it any worse. In fact, it may even make it better. At least a forewarned audience won't go into this film expecting another masterpiece along the lines of Sixth Sense, or even a decent-quality offering such as Unbreakable or Signs. No, the director has set the bar extremely high with his excellent earlier movies, and sadly he's routinely failed in his attempts to replicate his success: since Signs, his quality has dropped exponentially. In 2004's The Village, the cracks started to show. By 2006's Lady In The Water, it was clear he had begun to believe his previous hype. Critics universally panned the film, citing a lack of substance and an overall air of self-indulgence on the part of Shyamalan. Now we have The Happening. It's a B-movie with an A-list cast who're somehow acting at a Z-list level. Even the usually reliable Mark Wahlberg looks wholly uncomfortable here, but given the material he has to work with, that's hardly surprising. The final scenes are in no way, shape or form reminiscent of any of the director's previous trademark rug-pulling climaxes, and they seem to leave the way open for a sequel in a laughably obvious fashion. The Happening 2: The Reoccurence, anyone? 1/5"
"bigblue123","Null","0","1","30 July 2011"," Good plot, well made, shame about Mark Wahlberg...
","I find this film a difficult one to review. It is not a bad movie but it is definitely not a great movie. The problem with M. Night Shyamalan is that he started off with one of the greatest psychological chillers ever (The Sixth Sense) and since then has not been able to produce anything quite on par with it. Signs and Devil were good and The Village had its moments but was ultimately disappointing. The problem lies in the fact that everything Shyamalan does now is compared to the Sixth Sense and, of course, nothing quite rivals that film. <br/><br/>The Happening revolves around a teacher and his partner who are witnessing mass suicides sweeping various states in America. They, along with others, are escaping from the affected areas and trying to find a safe haven. The cause of the devastating events are attributed to a neurotoxin released by plants that are threatened by the presence of humans. <br/><br/>I like the plot of the film and thought the suicide scenes were very well done and quite disturbing. The script and performances however are average. Mark Wahlberg (who I personally think is a terrible actor) is a weak lead and I find the actress who plays his wife a bit annoying. The reliable John Leguizamo delivers a good, but sadly short performance, as Wahlberg's friend. I feel Leguizamo would have made a far more competent lead. The best performance comes from the actress who portrays the creepy Ms. Jones, but yet again she has little screen time. <br/><br/>The ending is quite disappointing but overall the film does leave an impression."

","M.Night.Shynamalmamama has made one good film, ""The Sixth Sense"" and because of that success he now thinks he's God! He thinks that everything he makes is absolutely brilliant. He's notorious for his twist endings and so i kept on watching ""The Happening"" just to see what the ending would be. To see that I wasn't wasting my time, and wait for it to explain everything to me. There wasn't one.<br/><br/>So many things are wrong with ""The Happening"" and to be honest I was actually quite intrigued in the first 20 minutes or so, it was a nice introduction and it seemed as if it had some nice potential, but then I started to notice that not a lot was HAPPENING! (Pun is absolutely intended) It seemed to reflect a sort of zombie apocalypse film, without the zombies. Or the excitement. Or the suspense. Or the gore. Or the interesting characters. Or the... Yes I could go on and on and on. Truth is it was dull.<br/><br/>Another big problem is that it didn't know what it wanted to be! Was it trying to be a horror? Was it trying to be a drama? Was it trying to be a thriller? Instead of picking one of those genres and sticking to it, it decided to combine all three (and probably some others) making a loose story with a very dry execution. The story to me sounded like an eerie horror film, yet nothing much about it was horrific enough. M.Night.Shymanamamalam had some great opportunities to actually get some fantastic deaths (let's face it, that's all it had going for it) but instead all the gory deaths were off-screen, not giving us any chance of us seeing anything! ANNOYING! M.Night.Shylmanaman also thinks that he's some sort of Quentin Tarantino in the script department. He tries to mimic (unsuccessfully I might add) the great suspenseful dialogue which Quientin trademarks in his films, yet Mr.Shylanmanamama messes it all up by talking complete b***ocks all the time about plants talking to us and being in a large group effects the plants and all this nonsense. It's stupid an unnecessary. He also tried to be clever by blatantly making the characters say ""happening"" every minute, yeah, ha ha, here my genuine laughter.<br/><br/>Then there's the characters. Not one of them is likable and when ""The Happening"" rushes to its heart-felt tender finale (it's not by the way) instead of being on the edge-of-your-seat for them to live, we're egging them on to hurry up and die! (Well I was) the kids were really annoying as well. Although it doesn't help when the story actually doesn't go anywhere. Running away from the wind is something that isn't intense of frightening in the least. Then there's this stupid sub-plot with this stupid man going to find his wife which quickly goes down the pan! That was very unnecessary.<br/><br/>Probably the worst factory was the acting, I don't know why Mark Wharlberg is in so much stuff because he can't act for a toffee apple! The woman was really wooden as well (don't know her name) the love for each other didn't come across I'm afraid. That crazy granny was also actually unintentionally hilarious! When she was smashing her head through those windows it just looked insane, and completely daft.<br/><br/>So if you want a plot that goes nowhere, doesn't know what it wants to be and is as unstructured as this review, then get your glad rags on because you're in for the night of your life!"

","Before watching this, I remembered people saying that this was poor. So I kept that in mind before watching it. I then watched this with friends on DVD and what a waste of time it was.<br/><br/>The story had a very good start to it, but as the film went on, it just got ridicules and laughable. The virus spread through green life and the wind.There could have been a much better reason than that The filming and cinematography were great, I'll give you that.<br/><br/>The characters were utterly pathetic. That was the most annoying element to the film. I cant believe Mark Whalberg took the role. Because during moments in the film when times were stressful, for example, when the characters were trying to get a car from someone. The person tried to drive away while Whalberg was trying to get him to take him and his family with him. Whalberg was trying to convince with most pathetic tone of voice and calmed expression. This would not happen in real life at all.<br/><br/>Also, about the characters, when they find out how the virus spreads, where do they chose to stand? in a green field. Seriously, you must be joking.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty bad. Maby its just because of their characters were atrocious.<br/><br/>The only thing that gave me a bit of the shivers was the psychotic old woman living in the house by herself. I'm pretty sure that was used so many times in other movies.<br/><br/>I'm quite glad there was little use of special effects to make the film affective but you can't get over how bad the film gets.<br/><br/>I love M Night Shyamalan older films, The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable. Hated The Village but Lady in the Water was pretty good though. Haven't seen Last Airbender yet though.<br/><br/>This film really is his carer downfall, please don't bother wasting you're money on this. But I really recommend you his older films though."

"crobarm-42-281143","10","0","3","1 May 2011"," A brilliant comedy
","Mr. M Night does it again by delivering a staggeringly hilarious movie. The Happening is a clever and ironic title because nothing actually happens. Every scene is witty and comedic; a perfect example would be when our protagonists meet up with two young boys in one scene, and then in the scene directly after they are shot for no reason. The humour lies with the fact that this scene has no purpose other than to shoot children with a shotgun - brilliant! Of course M. Night includes one of his infamous twists partway through the film: What could be causing massive populations to commit suicide in horrendous ways? Trees! Yes, trees feel an environmental threat from humans so they release a deadly neurotoxin to kill people. I honestly never saw that one coming. No, the trees don't just release a chemical that kills people, it makes people kill themselves by jumping off buildings, running themselves over with lawnmowers and smashing their heads through glass. Hilarious stuff! I can tell you I was bent over laughing as soon as Zooey Deschanel said, ""It makes you kill yourself. Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented."" Indeed Zooey, I seldom consider the evils yet to be invented by trees.<br/><br/>There is one part that confused me though. Our heroes were on a train evacuating the area when it suddenly comes to a halt and everyone is forced to get off because the train conductors have, ""Lost contact with everyone."" It really is unfortunate that they lost contact with everyone whilst on a train track, thus are forced to get out of the train instead of continuing onward on a fast-moving, straight set of tracks that can only lead in one direction and does not pertain to contact with everyone. This is especially unfortunate because all of the passengers continue to text message each other and send each other videos of lions eating people. Those damn trees, mucking about with the communication technology of the train conductors! This was definitely one of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history, only because I was puking out of laughter.<br/><br/>Seriously though...what the f**k M. Night Shyamalan."

","I like to watch bad movies, its a hobby of mine. But bad horror movies will always hold a special place in my heart. The Happening though will take the crown as THE WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE. You have to understand that before you even attempt to watch this movie. Here are some reason why this movie is god awful. From the amount of money that went into making it. To the decent actors that were cast in it. But it was still awful. Mind blowingly awful. (these were to two that I felt were most important. There are still many many more reasons.) The whole plot of the movie is that nature has finally had enough and is now making all plants on earth let loose a toxin into the air that makes you commit suicide. Thats the plot twist for the movie FYI. The main characters are Elliot Moore (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Alma Moore (played by Zooey Deschanel) Elliot is a high school science teacher in Philadelphia who will constantly annoy you through out the rest of the film with his awful/awkward dialogue.

","Is M. Night Shyamalan, the director of this flop, the same M. Night Shyamalan who made THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE? You'd be forgiven for thinking that the director of the earlier, classy fare had been replaced by a talentless clone after watching this hugely embarrassing environmental-disaster thriller. It's a film which opens with a handful of breathtaking set-pieces involving mass human madness, before swiftly descending into the kind of silly schtick that even a Sci-Fi Channel producer would think twice before greenlighting.<br/><br/>The blame is clearly fixed on Shyamalan's shoulders; he didn't only direct this tripe, but wrote it too. That indicates that the production was a labour of love, but what a misguided one! The script is appallingly bad, full of the kind of unreal dialogue that could only exist in a bad B-movie, and the whole film has a tired, subdued, seen-it-all-before air to it. As for the cast...well, words fail me. Mark Wahlberg is wooden and hopelessly, helplessly, miscast as a science teacher, delivering his lines with a kind of disbelief that he's been caught up in this mess. Zooey Deschanel, who I previously saw in YES MAN (and to be fair she was quite appealing in that) is abhorrently awful, her wide-eyed style of acting more suited to a pantomime than a movie. The only one who gives a decent performance is the reliable John Leguizamo, and he doesn't get a great deal of screen time at all.<br/><br/>THE HAPPENING lurches from one minor set-piece to the next, always promising more than it delivers. The plotting is basic and obvious, never less than contrived. Some moments, like when the two boys start going crazy, are so over-the-top and badly done that they become hilarious to watch. So, in the end, that's what this becomes: a so-bad-it's-funny experience, a modern day variant on the likes of ROBOT MONSTER and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Maybe audiences fifty years down the line will feel the same way..."
"ShootingShark","6","0","1","28 March 2011"," Interesting And Original But Stilted And Confusing Eco-Disaster Thriller
","Elliot is a science teacher in New York who decides to go to rural Pennsylvania when an airborne toxin which seems to induce people to commit suicide hits the city. Can he figure out what this mystery threat is and how to avoid falling victim to it ?<br/><br/>This is a slight yet intriguing and intimate disaster movie, but it's unsatisfying because it doesn't answer any of the big questions. Perhaps that's the point - scary things happen for no reason and thwart all efforts to explain them - but the story is too interesting to leave all these details out. Why do people seem to freeze when an attack is coming, why is everyone affected in groups until Mrs Jones at the end, and how exactly do the plants synthesise this previously unidentified chemical ? With material like this it's better to either leave it unexplained (see The Birds) or have a go-for-broke answer (see Invasion Of The Body Snatchers), but Shyamalan treads an uneasy line between both which is ultimately frustrating. It's good fun though, with typically unconventional characters, an unusual bucolic atmosphere which contrasts with the menace, a strong cast, a highly original cello score by James Newton Howard and quality photography throughout by old pro Tak Fujimoto (Badlands, The Silence Of The Lambs). Wahlberg and Leguizamo both eschew their usual tough guy personas to play mild, bespectacled, white-collar Joes and Deschanel is consistently good, although the most interesting performance for me was the totally loopy one by Buckley (the nice gym teacher in Carrie thirty years earlier) as the crazy lady whose traumatic past is subtly alluded to. The movie is sort of a hotch-potch of sci-fi/ecological ideas from the novels of John Wyndham and also reminded me of an old Sidney Sheldon small-town-crazies Twilight Zone story called Need To Know. It's a bit thin for a whole film and doesn't come together but it's still affecting and atmospheric. Trivia - the director has a non-cameo as the creep who keeps calling Deschanel."

","From Razzie nominated director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), after making The Village and Lady in the Water, and before winning Worst Director for The Last Airbender, there came this disaster movie. Basically high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Razzie nominated Mark Wahlberg) is giving a class talking about the unexplained disappearance of bees, and then all of the sudden a bigger unexplained phenomenon is occurring worldwide. Beginning in Central Park and then spreading, people suddenly freeze in the middle of wherever they are, momentarily confused, and then they have the sudden urge to commit suicide in the most brutal way they can think of. Knowing that this mysterious event is popping up in places nearby, Elliot gets his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and takes Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), daughter of his friend Julian (John Leguizamo), to whatever safety they can find. One amateur theorist says that it is flowers and plant life grouping together to create some kind of climate contagion that turns people this way, but what is definite is that people in bigger groups are what cause it. In the end Elliot, Alma and Jess do survive the devastation and two months or so pass with the deadly phenomenon seemingly gone, but of course it happens again somewhere in the world, so it could start again. Also starring Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones, Spencer Breslin as Josh, Robert Bailey Jr. as Jared,Alan Ruck as Principal and Shyamalan as Joey. I will admit I was surprised by one or two of the bizarre suicide scenes, and I did giggle at how they occur, but this is unfortunately also one of the big reasons the film is so ridiculous, it isn't scary, thrilling or engaging, the acting is terrible, the script is stupid, it is all just a silly and not worth the effort science fiction thriller. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!"

","Disaster movie (in more ways than one).<br/><br/>People start committing suicide in New York, as if it were a plague. The authorities decide to evacuate the city... You only have to read those first two sentences to realise that you're heading into Turkey Land, into big-time garbage, into 'Is it the director and the writers and the producer and the actors who decided to blow their brains out, not the characters?' Wouldn't there be real chaos in your city or town if people suddenly decided to commit suicide for no reason whatsoever? I mean REAL CHAOS -crowds of people running for it, people getting drunk, people heading for church, looting, murders, blood, body parts... All you see in the mistitled HAPPENING is some people getting calmly into a train (there were even a few empty seats!) and - wait for it - heading off for Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Mark 'I, like the director, have lost my mind' Dahlberg is a science teacher. Well, OK, it's not exactly typecasting, but he COULD be a teacher, with those irritating frown marks of his. Could it be that people are committing suicide because of 'a terrorist attack'? A TERRORIST ATTACK!? That's right, the (fill in your least favourite terrorist group) have concocted some 'toxin' that drives people crazy. The first 'attack' is in New York, so people head west. Dahlberg suggests it might not be a terrorist attack at all, but the side effects of something in the air. A bio-weapon that's gone astray? ('The Andromeda Strain') Something in the water? ('The Crazies') A mad scientist who's stolen a bio-weapon? ('The Satan Bug') No, it could be just something that's borne in the air. Turns out it's in the wind. So whenever the wind gets up again, they all scarper. 'They' are the group with Dahlberg.<br/><br/>Dahlberg is pretty dim, even for a science teacher. His wife, though, is dimmer still and makes him look like Einstein. Even when he IS having a conversation with a plastic plant. This priceless scene isn't amusing, just embarrassing.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is a director who is prone to sickly sentimentalism - and there are great lumps of it here. The last third or so of the film looks like bits left over from another script altogether - the kindly old lady who turns out to be like Kathy Bates in 'Misery.' It doesn't make much sense when slotted (very uncomfortably) together with the rest of the film. But since the film itself makes no sense anyway, what difference does it make? The deadly spores or whatever they are disperse. The shots of a scientist being interviewed on TV are sheer comedy. They're looking at a graph of the spread of the spores - no flashy graphics or anything, just a crude chart that belongs to Seventies TV. For not the first time, I seriously wondered whether THE HAPPENING was supposed to be a spoof - or even an elaborate conspiracy by everyone else in the country to drive Mark Wahlberg crazy. The ending is dreadful, along with the rest of it. Oh dear."

","The first thing that i had in my mind when i saw this movie is CREEPY. They say keep your friends close enemies closer, but on this one, i bet you don't wanna be using that phrase anymore. how can you defend yourself when you don't even know whats there? i thought zombie's are creepy, when you got bitten you will turn into zombie yourself, but at least you get to run and survive most importantly you know your enemy.<br/><br/>The happening is just something, the plot is unique. I'ts funny in a way that the one's responsible for the attacks are plants. I don't know, but i have no idea if its true that plants can attack specific targets only, and in this case it is attacking non-other than us humans. The disease is airborne, and for us humans to live we need air. Now that's something to think about. But the biggest question is, what if this is possible? are we doomed?.<br/><br/>IMO this movie is somehow a wake-up call for us humans, i don't wanna sound like an environmentalist or what, but like one's said we should be somehow responsible and be sensitive when it comes to our environment, Mother Nature's wrath is not a myth it has been proved thousand times already, and the catastrophe that it caused is not something that should be ignored. Tsunami's, tornado's flash floods, earth quakes, thunder storm's and a lot more, this natural disaster's are just examples of what the earth is capable of, and to think that most of this events are unpredictable, which means it can happen anywhere in anytime. <br/><br/>The very thing that i like on this movie is indeed the plot, its very effective, but in the end you are looking for answers and IMO i don't like movies that don't have clear endings. The actings are great Mark wahlberg is a very versatile actor you can put him anywhere, to be honest I'm a whalberg fan myself, and this is one of the reason's why i decide to watch this movie. And of course Zooey Deschanel, always been a pretty face, i like her the first time i saw her in the movie yes man, great acting too.

And by ""joke"" I mean funny as hell. Suicide has never been so funny to me until this film came along. You've got to be crazy to take this film completely serious. And you have no funny-bone if you can keep a straight face while viewing it. <br/><br/>Billie Jean is not my lover (moonwalk), and then *BLAMMO*. <br/><br/>Apparently, defenseless Vegetation (of all things) has decided to (for whatever reason) join forces in a Jihad against all of mankind. A Daffodil and an Oak Tree had obviously flipped a coin and decided to launch their first attack in the upper New England states, which put my mind at ease since I'm a Southerner. ""The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind"". I mean, literally....it was blowin' in the wind. It appears that the wind is an ally in this terrorist attack. I mean, what better way for toxic ""plant-farts"" to travel from point-A to point-B? Once a human gets a whiff of this fragrance, they become tranced. They take four or five steps backwards, do the hokey-pokey, turn themselves around and look around for something deadly to end their lives.....that's what its all about!! <br/><br/>""Hey, lookie there....a John Deere lawnmower. Lemmi crank her up and crawl under it....see if the blades are sharp enough for the lawn"" or ""That thar hand grenade looks awful damn delicious."" or ""I hope you left a bullet in that chamber for me, hon."" <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg stars, and is intentionally unconvincing as a high-school science teacher, appearing to look only slightly older than the students he teaches. He lives a few states over from the ""plant-farts"", but not for long, as the winds-of-change are quickly headed his direction. John Leguizamo also stars, playing an even more intentionally unconvincing mathematics teacher, however he does improve his performance during emotional moments. He travels with his 8 year old daughter who (thankfully) barely spoke throughout most of the film. <br/><br/>This is not quite a review, just my observation with rambling included. I am confused. Is this actually what Shyamalan was aiming for? Or was this humor just unintentional? Whatever his intention, I didn't care, because I was too busy having fun watching it. The suicides are completely hilarious, which wasn't a bad thing since nearly each suicide died with a different method....well....except for the people who were gathered together. If someone in a group had a gun, they'd all share the gun....each biting a bullet until there were no more bullets left. If someone jumped off a building, everyone around would think it was an excellent idea. So, to answer your mothers old question: ""Sure mom, if Billy jumped off a bridge, I'd be close enough behind him to see his butt crack."" <br/><br/>The problems I had with this film were major, but the humor made up for it. Like how Wahlberg and company never got infected, but others around him were offing themselves in herds. And like how the wind always seemed to blow in someone else's face even though Wahlberg sometimes stood only a few yards away. <br/><br/>Every now and then, they'd happen across a TV where the news is on, and there'd be some guy talking about this Happening, or trying to figure out the origin of it.....which I saw as a direct rip-off of G.A Romero's Night Of The Living Dead.<br/><br/>But this is all just my observation and opinion. You don't have to buy it. Just buy the movie and see for yourself.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Upon its release, The Happening received many negative reviews and was nominated for four Razzie awards including worst film but having viewed the film for the first time, I discovered that while it was far from being a great film, it was certainly not as bad as people say. <br/><br/>Made with the intention of being like a B-Movie, the story focuses on a married couple who discover that America has gone under some sort of attack where people are killing themselves. While not perfectly executed, the story does sink the viewer into what is happening and the plot does move at a swift pace for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>What really hinders the film from being good is the dialogue given to actors who can do so much more. Like the remake of The Wickerman, The Happening has now become a comedy in many people's eyes and if you search on the Internet, you will find spoofs and reedits. Some of the scenes are so bad, that you wonder what was going through the director's head. I would usually say that they could have been taken out and left on the cutting room floor but with a running time of 1hour and 20 minutes, they needed all the footage they could find. <br/><br/>On a technical level the film is good; the photography is good but there are some bad reaction shots which when up-close on an actors face, feel strange and out of place. The music by James Newton-Howard is very good and there are a few gruesome moments that will make the audience cringe. However there are not enough scenes that really emphasise how much danger they are in. We get the impression that the threat is deadly but as the audience, we need to see more as there are no scenes where we really doubt if the lead characters are in danger. This is after all a horror film.<br/><br/>While there are a few laughable scenes due to the dialogue or the acting, The Happening is not a terrible film but it is certainly not perfect. As a viewer, I never became bored or lost interest in the story. A good idea that could have been so much more."

","I think I may actually be the biggest M. Night fan out there. I think he is brilliant! I love every one of his films and I am always amazing at his ideas. I, of course loved this idea as well. I was impressed by the mood, the idea, and how the idea was carried out. However, I was not impressed by the acting. The thing about this is that I am a huge John Leguizamo and Mark Wahlberg fan. Has anyone seen the Departed? He was brilliant in that movie! His acting was impeccable! I have not a clue what happened to these two in The Happening. The acting really did ruin the film. Everything in this movie was great besides the acting. Sadly, it brought it down terribly. I found myself laughing during serious, suspenseful parts just because the acting was so awful. I don't think this is the right genre for John or Mark. Maybe they will get it right the next time.Besides that, Keep 'em coming Shyamalan! I'll be waiting.<br/><br/>P.S: M. Night usually has a guest appearance in every one of his films. He didn't this timeor did I just miss it?"
"Kaat1220","9","0","2","27 August 2010"," A Character Study in Human Nature
","I am going to risk getting flamed and give this movie an EXCELLENT review. Why? Because what everyone hated about this film is exactly what I loved about it. We get so used to seeing larger than life heroes save the day and never break a sweat. We are used to seeing blood, guts, and entrails splattering our screens. People will forgive a weak plot (as many horror movies have) if you give them a big, bloody payoff. This film is not so much about ""the happening"" although that part is terrifying and exciting to watch; after all, how many of us are afraid of losing who we are or going insane? This film is about human nature. It is about how humans behave when everything normal is taken away. Yes, there are some awkward acting parts, but I think that this is done on purpose. I prefer to give Mr. Shyamalan the benefit of the doubt because I have said stupid stuff at the most inappropriate times. The fact is that humans are not perfect; humans do not always say the right thing, and humans can be selfish even when other people's lives are at stake. However, people usually do the right thing and come together. It's an excellent character study in human nature."
"Mcjansen84","8","0","2","21 July 2010"," The Happening, it happened for me!
","Two years ago M.Night Shyamalan brought his awkward cousin; The Happening to the world. Of course this movie was promoted as the horror movie of the year for marketing purposes which came out on the typical day of Friday the 13th of July, if i remember correctly. After his latest movie; Lady in the Water which came out four years ago, it was obvious that Shyamalan chooses for the non-typical Hollywood-movie approach. After his successful movies like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, it became clear that with The Village and LitW Shyamalan wasn't making movie pictures for the 'crowd'.<br/><br/>With ""The Happening"" on it's way I was very excited. I'd assembled allot of friends that time to actually watch ""The Happening"" during premiere night in a dutch cinema nearby. My friends got excited by me and after seeing material from the trailer. It looked very promising and 'non shyamalanish' which could turner either both ways. I'd didn't really mind as long as it would entertain and surprise me and my friends.<br/><br/>My friends and the rest of the audience just giggled and laughed out loud during the entire movie, including myself. At first I didn't get the story at all. What is the message of this movie and what is up with the awkward and strange acting and dialogue flow in this movie? Well people, after two years I totally understand the meaning of ""The Happening"" and my creditability in Shyamalan has rises once again. The movie itself is just fine and a beauty to watch and listen to thanks to Shyamalans main cinematographer; Tak Fujimoto and composer and friend; James Newton Howard who arranges as usually amazing tense and emotional music to bring his movies to a higher level. But the story and all the dialogues kept bothering me for years, until a few days ago. Let me explain. (Do only read when you've seen this movie once or twice!) The movie starts with strange 'events' happening. People notice that these events occur in three stages of the human body. First lack of speech, movement and the full control of the mind and body In this picture we get to see Elliot, a teacher played by Mark Walhberg who teaches biology. His wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) we get to meet later on struggles with herself and her relationship with Elliot.<br/><br/>The events that are happening, get spread worldwide by word and media. People assume at first that terrorist are at work by releasing toxic-gas, but later on other assumptions are being made, time after time. It's hard to explain but in this part of storytelling lies the 'twist' of this movie.<br/><br/>People just follow each other and show group behaviour, when they are in these kinds of unknown and strange situations. During there trip to avoid and try to unravel this 'happening' they get in contact with lots of other people who are on the same road as they are. A little girl who travels with them is one of these people who doesn't have a opinion yet, a innocent child that just experiences and observes all the theories and events they encounter. She stands in the middle of this chaotic chain of communications and interpretations of mankind.<br/><br/>Once Elliot thinks he knows what's actually happening, they enter a path which leads ultimately to a very mysterious and strange character named; Mrs. Jones. A old widow who lives isolated from the daily world. Once they meet each other strange things are happening once again.<br/><br/>The climax of this film looks incredible cliché and strange, but seen from the perspective of this characters it's obvious and understandable the way they react. The strenght of this movie lies as all the other Shyamalan movies in the human emotions and believes of each other. with one simple line i could spill the entire movie. But if u look further, deeper and with a non-standard movie scripting look, you will embrace this movie at a time. My advice is to start listening to the story by the very first lines and discover how magically this 'Happening' enrolls.<br/><br/>With this picture Shyamalan shows again what a brilliant storyteller and movie director he is. I am really looking to his upcoming trilogy of the anime series; Avatar and his other stories like ""Devil"" who will come out in 2011."

","M. Night was something of a whirlwind in the early Noughties with his innovative thriller The Sixth Sense. Unluckily it has turned into a downward spiral since then, with this film being yet another drawback to his floundering career.<br/><br/>While I like the idea of the human race committing suicide in ever more devious and violent ways. The whole thing was marred by some truly pitiful acting on the parts of most actors. Mark Wahlberg seemed to just whine his way through each line with this falsified look of shock and horror. The only emotion I was capable of during the viewing of this film was embarrassment."

","Apparently, according to sources here on IMDb and on some other motion picture review sites, I am in a minority.<br/><br/>I liked The Happening and for the life of me I cannot explain why.<br/><br/>The cinematography was superb, the pace just right and the acting sublime.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a very good film but it is not a truly great film so I gave it 7/10 stars.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg does not fail to impress once again. I'm just a little concerned that he may become typecast in this type of role, yet he is totally believable.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel emanates emotion as her life appears to fall apart around her. There are times when I genuinely feel for her character Alma. She is being overwhelmed by what is happening in the world she inhabits and she is already tied up in guilty little secrets she has kept from her husband.<br/><br/>As for the other characters... well, it's not really about them, is it? It's about Elliott and Alma.<br/><br/>And as for the plot? When the cause was first put forward, I felt a shiver down my back.<br/><br/>As much as many people are writing off this storyline as too far fetched, even for Sci-Fi, I find it totally plausible and therefore very, disturbing.<br/><br/>There is a lot of screaming in places, but there is a lot of calm as well. Just try not to read the calm as 'nothing happening'. It's a mass calm that could only really come about as the people realise the enormity of the situation and how impotent they are to stop it."
"kdnor2011","8","0","1","29 March 2010"," Not perfect, but no where near as bad as people make it out to be
","The Happening opened in June of 2008, and over the past three years, it has gotten harder and harder to find a positive review for it, in fact every time I do see a positive review on youtube or something I like it immediately. Under no circumstances is the movie perfect, but I feel that it succeeds in what it is trying to be, a B-Movie. The trailers never really showed this, but days before the film came out, Shyamalan was being interviewed, and said, ""We're making an excellent B movie, that's our goal."" I would classify this film as a horror film, that never takes itself to seriously, and that's why I like it. I hate when a movie takes itself too seriously, sometimes it can work, but usually the movie just ends up being dull. While the film has some really graphic scenes such as the hair clip through the neck, and being run over with the lawn mower, it also has some really funny moments, like talking to a plastic plant, or the crazy old lady who wonders if Elliot is eying her drink. Because it never takes itself seriously, it is a fun movie, you get the graphic deaths that disturb you, then you also get the funny, stupid scenes that will cheer you up so that you never are too depressed.<br/><br/>Now that I've discussed the misunderstanding people have with this film, lets move on to some of the other things I like. The film really does look amazing, I'll admit Shyamalan was never that good of a writer (exept with Signs, but even in the Sixth Sense, it didn't take a master story teller to hide the twist), but he is a really great director. He never just sets up the camera, he doesn't shake it to add realism, cough ""Hurt Locker"" cough, and he doesn't jump cut every five second, cough ""Wanted"" cough. But there are other things I did like.<br/><br/>For example the acting is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, seriously, on IMDb, a user called the acting cringe inducing. Now I will admit, Zooey Deschanel was HORRIBLE. She gave easily the worst performance, she was fine when she was silent, but when she talked, it was pretty terrible. However I think that Mark Walberg actually did a pretty good job, nothing outstanding, but he wasn't the completely wooden performance that people make him out to be. The rest of the cast is OK, even the little girl, she has only one line but she does so much with complete silence, maybe it's just because she so cute that I don't want anything to happen to her.<br/><br/>Which leads me to my next point, I like these characters, I don't want anything to happen to them. It's like Roland Emmerichs movies, everyone else says there nothing but eye Candy movies, but I actually do care about the characters. I can't say that I cared about Elliot and Alma's relationship problems that much, but I didn't want them to die, so something went right.<br/><br/>The film does have a few good jump scares, and it takes chances by killing people under 18, that actually look like their under 18.<br/><br/>Then theirs the ending, why do people have problems with it, what is so bad about the ending that pisses people off, is it the fact that it the fact that it shows the epidemic is happening somewhere else.<br/><br/>Under no circumstances is The Happening a perfect film, but it's a fun, creepy movie, with decent performances, cool death scenes, and likable characters, that I'm amazed that this film got so much hate, I mean, it got nominated for worst picture and Wanted didn't. Oh and one last thing, the film has probably one of the best tag lines of all time."

","""You know hot dogs got a bad rep? They got a cool shape, they got protein. You like hot dogs, right?"" <br/><br/>The Happening is like hot dogs. It got a lot of crap when it first came out, and indeed, I thought I tactfully avoided more Shyamalan kitsch after hating Lady In the Water (though I now want to revisit it), but when I caught this on TV the other night, I was pleasantly surprised and captivated by how clever and funny it was. Satire on sensationalist journalism disguised as an almost slasher-flick styled thriller about killer plants? Um, yes please.<br/><br/>Seriously, that's what I think the movie is about. The characters say the word ""terrorism"" so often that it cannot be ignored. Just what are terrorists, what is terrorism? Nothing you can physically comprehend. Perhaps the best example is Global Warming, given the ridiculous (though admittedly genius) marketing scheme that is the ""green"" movement and the (also genius) antagonists that are killer plants -- but this is really just a placeholder. Fill in the blank with any case of invisible evil deemed apocalyptic by experts.<br/><br/>More importantly is what these candidates have in common: the current mass media business market that unhealthily and unnecessarily uses scare tactics for nothing more than to increase ratings; to increase the audience. Who is most affected by the plants' deadly toxins? Large populations, naturally. I kept waiting for a character totally cut off from society and entirely lacking in any knowledge of the epidemic. I got more than I bargained for: not only is there such a character (living quietly and inconsequentially in the country, surrounded by plants and trees at that), but there is also a faceless hillbilly who blows away two kids (one in the face!) with his boomstick, mistakenly thinking they are infected. Fear the plants. Fear them."
"alerasoul","7","0","1","1 October 2009"," Not GREAT, but still not bad...
","Just finished watching it now, and it really makes a difference when you're watching something alone.<br/><br/>First off, I'll start with the bad. The bad was basically the underlying environmentalist world-view. Plants fight back! Well, I personally don't believe the plants are going to kill us all, and I resent the explanation given. It's downright ridiculous, and it insults the audience's intelligence.<br/><br/>Some of the lines could've been better, but I've seen every Shyamalan film to know that this is how he writes: like telling a story. Some of the reactions to certain events are quite unrealistic and could've been acted much better. For instance, someone falls off a building and the construction worker who sees this takes about 7 seconds to actually think about running over to the guy, not to mention the two other workers he's talking with. Various emotions given off are a bit strange for the situations... I resented the fact that the mean old lady who housed the protagonists at one point was subtly implicated as a hard-core Catholic...<br/><br/>But other than that I enjoyed the film. It's quite a thriller and will definitely have you jumping a few times. I now understand why it's rated R, for the fact that there are many, many instances of people killing themselves in various, horrible ways. But scratching the fact that this movie has an environmentalist lean on things, this was quite entertaining and I recommend it to hard-core M. Knight fans. Sure, it had many flaws, and the explanations were far from realistic, but by golly it was still entertaining! I've seen many others comment about the casting choices being ""terrible,"" but I really can't see how they did a bad job at their roles they were given. Actors are actors, and they work the best they can at what they're acting for. The script was very interesting, and when M. Knight wanted some comic relief, he gave it with perfect timing. Conversations between everyone about everyday life was heartwarming and real, and gave you the sense that these were, in a small way, actual people in a real situation.<br/><br/>Camera angles and lighting were superb, as always Mr. Shyamalan. So all in all, for the quality of the film as compared with every other film made in history, I'd give this a 5/10. For entertaining quality, I give it a 7/10. Movies are almost always meant to entertain its audiences, and this movie did the job it set out to do: entertain. At least, it did it for me."

I kind of liked it because I had a totally different experience: I picked up this movie at about 10 minutes on a hotel where I was staying the night just waiting for my connection flight the next day, and thought ""cool, a B movie in a post-catastrophe world. Soon zombies are going to pop"". I recognized Whalberg's face, but couldn't quite figure out where I had seen him before, so I just guessed it was from another low budget, specially because his acting was so laughable. <br/><br/>There were no commercials, so my illusion lasted till the final scene. I kept waiting for zombies, but settled for the crazy old lady with the pale face, and Whalberg yelling ""why can't you give me just a minute"" as if he had just entered acting school. <br/><br/>Campy, apocalyptic with half-baked environmental ideas.

I loved that Brian 'I'm not even supposed to be here today' O'Halloran had a bit part- look quick and you might catch him driving the jeep. Poor Dante, that guy just cannot catch a break.<br/><br/>I saw the Happening in the theaters mostly because of the creepiness of the commercials and found myself rolling my eyes through a lot of it. I just caught the last 3/4's of it on cable tonight and found myself laughing a lot, which I'm pretty sure they were not shooting for. Sure there were some scenes that were pretty gruesome like what happens with the two boys that they are traveling with, others were Monty Pythonesque, like the lion scene at the zoo. That one had me in stitches.<br/><br/>Not any of the actors best work, nor was it M.Night Shyamalan's best, but it does have about a 5 or 6 on the re-watchable scale if only to make sarcastic quips if you are watching it with friends. Or if you are playing a drinking game and have to drink whenever a character says a form of the word happening (like 'what's happening here?' or 'what just happened?') You'd be surprised at how frequently this will happen. There, it just happened there. And again!<br/><br/>Just kidding about the 'Crappening' thing, it wasn't as terrible as some of the other ratings on here suggest."

Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo are solid actors if not super stars. They always deliver solid performances (even in Collateral Damage with Arnold he did great work). Their acting in Happening was a bit better than a high school play; however, Night gave them very little substantive material to work with.<br/><br/>The premise of the film, that humans are considered by Nature to be a virus on the planet is just more Lefty lunacy (Yes the Left actually subscribes to the foolishness – solution: all the Left cut themselves shaving and go swimming at Stinson Beach, North Ca).

","I watched this a couple of times.The first time as a move and the second to look for clues. The first time I watched it I had the following thoughts. Wahlbergs acting seemed ""light"" and breathless. the whole character lacked any depth, The female character was a bit starey and weird. The ""Joey"" subplot was wafer thin and extraneous. The young girl was emotional baggage and the emotional link to her ""soon to be dead"" parents very poorly described. The army guy? Didn't get him at all.Very poorly written and acted. Overall the characterisation in this film is very poor. No character is described to depth where you really care about anyone. Tagged the obvious shots with the power station in the background. If the idea was they are somehow to blame for nature's rebellion.this was a ham-fisted reference. What was the ""Showhome sequence"" all about? Was this some reference to the fake towns built in Nevada for nuclear testing in the 50's or an implication of natures rebellion against human encroachment? This felt a very shallow film. You tend to look for more with this director but I ended up falling int the kings new clothes territory. If this was intended to be a B movie as other's has suggested then that seems an excuse rather than a reason. The only reason i thought this film intriguing is that I thought there might be more,hidden image and intelligence like Sixth Sense. Unfortunately I was wrong."

Not to give anything away but, considering how ""wooden"" Mark Wahlberg is in this film, no wonder he survives! The (mightly overrated) M Night S starts off by creating a bit of drama, intrigue and genuine suspense and then kills it off completely. After 30 minutes this could be any TV movie seen on the likes of those free movie channels you get on Sky.

"david-greene5","8","0","2","5 June 2009"," Surprisingly effective entry in a well-worn genre.
","First, I had to wonder if Shyamalan cut this rather short little film down from an intended earlier version that he had hoped would be more portentous, and deeper. I can see in this movie an idea for a deeper, more ""serious"" film, which he might have attempted without ultimately being satisfied with its effectiveness at the original longer running time.<br/><br/>Despite that impression, I would have to say that I join with those who felt that harsh treatment of this entry by the critics, along with weak box office returns was ill deserved. The very fresh feel, and unique magic, and whopping success of ""The Sixth Sense"", has apparently set this director up for such high expectations surrounding every new effort, that he has repeatedly been denied credit for his very substantial capabilities. The disappointing ticket sales for ""The Happening"" may result, in part, from the lack of major action sequences or dazzling special effects. Sadly, a lot of today's viewers seem addicted to all of that adrenaline-rush hyper-active film-making.<br/><br/>Objectifying this film quickly reveals that it is essentially a new offering in a very old genre. They were doing these creeping menace movies, wherein the threat emanates from some real danger that we have all been hearing about in the news in great numbers, back in the 1950s. Most were fairly mediocre. This one is so finely crafted, and so deftly laced with references to many sources of modern-day fear and paranoia, that it reminded me a bit of Francis Coppola's interspersing of history and fiction in The Godfather movies. For my money, Shyamalan played brilliantly on the embedded anxieties of this era to achieve a very creepy, chilling movie. <br/><br/>I've seen Wahlberg do better work. He is nonetheless, quite competent. In all, the cast, effectively comprised mostly of little known faces, did a fine job of bringing the story and its characters to life. Perhaps the characters could have been more complex and fully developed, but they served this little film very convincingly. To the director/writer's credit, this is a compact, scary thriller with a very serious message. I won't spell out the theme. It becomes fairly obvious when you view the film. It is hardly the first film to pitch this message; it won't be the last, but it struck me as a very well crafted, surprisingly powerful little horror show that ought to be widely seen, and widely discussed. If only a few holdouts among the partisans, who continue to deny that the threat at the heart of this story is real, might be moved to reconsider their folly, then Mr. Shyamalan's very engrossing show will be something for which we should all be grateful."

"Styrophoamicus","2","0","2","18 April 2009"," Not Happening
","Let me get this out of the way: I haven't seen a film by Shyalaman that I didn't like. I find it unfair that everyone compares all his films to The Sixth Sense. Whenever I read a review of one of his films, there's always a reference somewhere to how it ""wasn't as good as The Sixth Sense"" or something like that, so I prefer to judge his films on their own merit. Unbreakable was probably the closest one I came to not liking, but it still kept me captivated. Signs I thoroughly enjoyed, partly due to the great performances (it was one of Mel Gibson's last films before he went crazy). I really liked The Village, even if the 'twist' was kinda dumb, but there was more to that film other than the surprise ending. Yes, I even liked Lady in the Water (especially the score by James Newton Howard). But The Happening? Not only is this the worst film by Shyamalan to come out, its one of the very few films where i came close to getting up and turning off the DVD player. I rented it knowing that people hated it, but people also hated most of the other Shyamalan films I liked. However I was very disappointed by The Happening. Everything about it felt lazy: the script, the acting, the story, the 'twist', the score (I almost felt like James Newton Howard was just as bored by the film, especially compared to his other excellent scores). Every actor and actress, not matter how good they are, end up being vastly under-utilized. Mark Wahlberg looks confused and barely able to hide his 'I can't believe I'm doing this' expression. Zooey Deschanel is just sort of 'there', but hardly. Only John Leguizamo manages to pull off a performance that elicits any emotional response, though it is very short lived. The way I see it, The Happening is a good idea gone wrong. It had the potential to be a great disaster film, but its hampered by silly ideas (Run away from the wind!) and characters you couldn't give a toss about. The biggest tragedy is that it doesn't feel like a Shyamalan film. The great cinematography is missing, as is the emotional score. The characters are one dimensional, most existing as a foil for another character. Even the 'shocking' death scenes are few and far between, and some border on either mundane (People hanging from trees; seen it before too many times) or downright silly (the guy feeding himself to the lions felt too unrealistic; it was a great idea, but lions would be more prone to jumping on you and tearing off your jugular rather than gingerly tearing off your arm). Hopefully Shyamalan can bring back some of the magic for The Last Airbender."

","When I saw the trailer for this film, I was reluctant to watch, but for the sake of supporting Mark Wahlberg's career and to avoid an argument with my girlfriend, I agreed to watch it. I figured, ""Well, it can't get much worse than Signs, right?"" Wrong. It got much worse.<br/><br/>Everything from the acting to the lighting was horrible in this movie. This movie has done to modern film-making and cinema what the Holocaust did to the Jewish. It was not only pointless to watch this movie, but torturous as well. Just to save some time, I'll narrow down the mind-numbing errors in this movie:<br/><br/>Errors: 1. M. Night Shyamalan had something to do with it. 'Nough said. 2. Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and Zooey Deschanel (all of whom I enjoyed watching before this film)delivered absolutely dreadful performances. 3. If the premise would have been human, it would've had an extra chromosome. 4. None of the characters, situations, plots or events were believable. 5. M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.<br/><br/>Honestly, after watching this, I considered breaking up with my girlfriend of two years for making me watch it. Not only that, but for making me PAY to see it. I could watch this movie for free and feel ripped off. I'd watch something more interesting, like watching the hair on my legs grow.<br/><br/>There you go, another unbiased warning by a frustrated and selfless human being. Don't watch it.

At least I was smart enough not to waste my money at the theater for this goofy film.<br/><br/>This reminds me of an old Irish story about the priest asking for someone to say something nice about the deceased in his coffin before burial. A long silence followed before someone said ""his brother was worse"".<br/><br/>That's about the best I can say for the happening.

","The Sixth Sense was a decent enough movie. Unbreakable is probably the only M. Night film I ever really got into. Beyond that I think this guy is a terrible, terrible filmmaker. And the worse his movies get, the louder his fans seem to think they need to be in their support of him. And for some, it's not enough that they like his movies. They also have to point out that the anyone that doesn't is WRONG.<br/><br/>Well, you know what? It finally feels like a decent chunk of his audience is figuring out what I've known for a long time... this guy is totally overrated. Go ahead. Defend The Happening. You're only embarrassing yourself. Because no true student of cinema or fan of film could ever possibly believe this isn't an unintentionally hilarious disaster of unimaginable proportions.<br/><br/>It's impossible to throw the blame onto one thing in particular but the ""acting"" is most certainly a large contribution to this sinking ship. Say what you want about Mark Wahlberg but the guy is perfectly capable of giving a great performance. But this is a train wreck. The scene where he asks the house plant if it's okay to use the bathroom is so unspeakably bad you'll swear it's a joke. The skit on SNL where he talks to animals carries more credibility.<br/><br/>And Zooey Deschanel. WHAT HAPPENED???? She's a genuinely talented actress. But it's like she's not even trying. Which simultaneously makes her the worst actor in the film and the smartest person in the cast. John Leguizamo is the only one who manages not to look like a complete fool. The bottom line is all of the performers have been fantastic in other films. I blame the direction. It's always felt like M. Night's striving for something minimalistic or restrained with his actors' performances. Yet somehow it always nosedives into melodrama instead.<br/><br/>The script is ludicrous. A lot of people feel the premise is a strong one. I disagree. But I do feel another filmmaker could have taken the same basic story and done something much stronger and more resonant with it. Plot points aside, the dialouge is flat out horrendous. The very definition of cringe-inducing. Anytime the characters try to slip in exposition it feels clunky and awkward. And the rest of the time they simply tell us exactly what they're thinking or feeling instead of showing us.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches here and there. The model home billboard with the slogan ""You Deserve This!"" immediately comes to mind. And the scene at the construction site early in the film is pretty grotesque. But the rest of it fails to be remotely frightening, suspenseful, engaging, or insightful. I'm not sure what the goal here was but this is completely disposable work.<br/><br/>Sometimes movies are so bad they're fun. In this case it's just plain bad."

","I just saw this film, one that should, at first glimpse, come with high recommendations. Instead, I was highly disappointed for numerous reasons.<br/><br/>At first I think the ideas that mold the plot were smart and original. Not only have I not seen something similar but it was a nice method to also pass some messages to the audience. However, although the idea was good, it was developed to an almost childishly plain and ridiculous scenario. The characters were shallow, predictable, too much of a ""wiseguy"" and abnormally trusting to science. What I mean with my latter remark is that when a normal person finds oneself in such a disturbing and dangerous situation, one cannot think and act in a logic manner. Even more, he or she doesn't try to explain ""the happening"" scientifically. People panic when in danger. So, seeing people act that way was very silly. Also, the scenario was ""leaking"" because too many things came conveniently, at the right place, at the right moment.<br/><br/>So, in general, it was a nice idea that submerged in a very poor and uninspired implementation and thus resulted in a not really enjoyable film."

I was stimulated to put my own brief comments down after seeing The Crappening, and even registered with the IMDb solely for that purpose. I think I need some kind of purging. <br/><br/>Not too terribly long ago I decided Lady In the Water had to be the worst movie I'd ever seen. Lady In the Water was a masterpiece compared to the moronic The Happening. Of course, we all know there are far worse films, but Shyamalan's bad movies are unique in their affect. One responds to them in a very peculiar way - what is it? Probably his blend of ballooning pretension with a directly inverse diminishment in his capabilities. <br/><br/>I went to the DVD Special Features for some kind of explanation of the goings-on, and found the Making-Of feature. Expecting everybody involved to demonstrate awareness of the film's idiocy, I was shocked to find everybody in complete earnestness, especially Shyamalan. But there were cracks in the edifice - in some takes of a scene in which Wahlberg grabs a shotgun barrel to force it away from the teenager who in fact gets blown away (which was blessed), you finally see that he knows this film is terrible, but it's too late to cut loose. <br/><br/>Only if Shymalan is satirizing himself are his films redeemable.

Night is no genius - though he evidently thinks he is. The story is a hot mess - the people don't act like people - for instance, the ""happening"" is supposed to be a plague of suicides driven by some kind of neurotoxins emitted by plants yet at the end of the movie there is an epilogue that takes place 3 months after the epidemic of suicides - and nothing has changed.

There's not a single, well-performed moment from any of the talent in this movie.

I even enjoyed The Village...these last two works of his though...ugh!<br/><br/>It is not often when I'll honestly think to myself, ""There's 2 hours I'll never get back"".

","Okay, firstly I would like to say how much this film attempts to be Frank Darabonts 'The Mist', a strange event is occurring on the east coast of the U.S. (once again, America gets it first) and is causing thousands to commit suicide, and a man and his family are attempting to save themselves from the terror.<br/><br/>Unlike The Mist, the idea of plants releasing a deadly toxin is both likely and almost a reality. The bad news is the toxin would most likely kill you than rather make you kill yourself.<br/><br/>It is where the gas causes people to kill themselves that I began to lose interest in the film, despite it having a great actor (Walhberg) and director. Sadly, Walhberg does not only fail to save this film, he strangely makes it worse. His acting skill varies in this film, on some occasions Wahlberg fits the role perfectly as the scientist trying to figure the event out, however, when the time comes for Wahlberg to save the day and try to help people, the scenes get messy. As a matter of fact almost all the actors in this film did quite an unnecessarily overdone and extreme job save for John Leguizamo (who did a great and almost moving job) and Betty Buckly as the insane and lonely old spinster. But a majority of the times, acting is messy.<br/><br/>What I found that also varied were the deaths scenes. On one occasion we had a vary well done scene in which a zoo keeper allows himself to be mauled by his lions, on the other, in the opening scene with hundreds of people are jumping off the buildings and the girl needling herself in the head.<br/><br/>As for directing I would give it say an average job, nothing too special, most likely something an unknown director would make. There was one occasion where 'shaky camera' technique was used and I found that quite irritating.<br/><br/>All in all a totally average film which I personally would fit into the rating scale of between 6 and 7."

Mark Wahlberg is fine as science teacher (yes, somehow that's not as inane as it sounds) who, along with most of the northeastern US is trying to cope with some sort of plague that's forcing people to kill themselves. It's a promising premise that Shyamalan simply doesn't exploit to its fullest. The film is so slowly paced, it's difficult not to wonder if this shouldn't have had several additional rewrites before being filmed. It's like a short story stretched into novel length. Quirky actors like Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo, and Betty Buckley are in it too, with Deschanel just a bit too ""out there"" to be believable as the wife of straight-laced Wahlberg. Buckley has a particularly odd role as a stranger Wahlberg and Deschanel encounter.

","What the Hell??? Was this a joke being pulled on the moviegoers of 2008? You can say what you want about the underlying meaning of the message of this movie...etc. etc..but I've been watching movies since the 1950's and I'm telling you... this is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through in years.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan ever since The 6th Sense. I've seen every single movie he has come out with. Most of them (with the exception of the monster in Signs, and Lady in the Water) I have enjoyed very much. NOT THIS ONE!!!! This one is like watching a sci-fi thriller from the 1950's or early 60's. The dialog is so bad it's actually laughable. The acting is even worse! I cannot believe how bad Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo were in this film. These two guys are usually brilliant in anything they play. NOT THIS TIME!!!!! <br/><br/>As far as Zooey Deschanel goes... she's a lost cause. If it wasn't for her good looks she would have NO PLACE IN SHOWBIZ whatsoever. I understand she has a pretty good singing voice, perhaps she should pursue that instead of acting. I have not seen ONE SINGLE PERFORMANCE from her that is even worth watching. She always has the exact same expression on her face, that of a deer in the headlights and she talks with a monotone voice. SHE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF ACTING!!!!! Why not replace her with her sister, Emily Deschanel. She is just as good looking and she can actually act (ever watch BONES?) <br/><br/>This movie would have been better if it was filmed in black and white. If you're going to put a B rated, 1950's schlock type sci-fi movie in the theaters, at least make it look like a B rated, 1950's schlock type sci-fi movie instead of trying to pass it off as a main stream 2008 thriller.<br/><br/>I hope M. Night Shyamalan reads these comments and takes head. If his next film is as bad as the last two, he will lose his audience and will become a joke in Hollywood."

","Shyamalan has talent, but it's undeveloped. He tells a story as though he were a father telling his son a bed time story... in his case always about the boogie man. He sets it up brilliantly, creates tension masterfully and then, like a father who just wants to get the story over and leave the room, he fumbles badly. We are not children and our eyes are still open when he exits, no satisfactory plot conclusion or denouement in hand. He starts out the story wonderfully, immediately creating tension with the people in Central Park stopping and then going crazy. Then the falling bodies from a building. Then the panic. And then...not much. I won't bother analyzing the dialogue which seems sophomoric, often or the clear plot errors. But no matter what else plants might do, including releasing deadly toxins, they don't make wind storms. They just don't, unless we're in the Lord of the Rings and the Ents are present. Trees don't sway their limbs at will and grasses don't wave in their own wind... etc. No only that, although some plants do know when they are being eaten and emit toxins to ward of predators, they don't sit down at a round table and talk to each other, the Elms to the crab grass to the foxglove to the mustard to the Willow and decide, with malefaction, to exterminate anything, let alone mankind. They might, a specie at a time, evolve to give off toxins in the air, but they wouldn't just turn them on and off like pesticide blowers, unless they are all controlled by some Hindu Hayagriva. And if there were some deadly toxin released and blown around magically, it certainly wouldn't have any trouble getting into a 150 year old house or shed.... windows open or shut. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's clear that Mr. Shyamalan needs a lot of help. He should come up with the ideas and maybe even direct. But he needs someone to write a screenplay that will make sense. Three years ago I complained about this man's lack of talent in writing the 6th Sense. The plot made no sense. Yes, it was a good mood piece, but it was designed to fool us, at all times and when you knew the ending, you knew that the plot made no sense. It's wasn't the 6th Sense... it was No Sense. But now others have seen that behind the curtain, there is no ""Ansiktet."""
"paul51","3","0","2","11 October 2008"," Finest example of a very small genre.
","...and that genre is ""bland eschatology"".<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense actually caught me somewhat off-guard, but that's the last time M. Night did so. Signs and the ""swing away"" thing was somewhat impossible to completely predict, but that just made it harder to buy into, and therefore cost it most of its dramatic effect.<br/><br/>I hadn't heard anything *at all* about The Happening before I gave it a watch on pay-per-view and I have to say this one didn't deliver any kind of twist. I knew what was going to cause whatever bad thing that was going to (sigh) happen the instant the first scene began. When it quickly became apparent it was causing people to arbitrarily act odd and then kill themselves in all sorts of ways, I laughed.<br/><br/>Why? It's not that I'd find such a device in a movie necessarily laughable, it's that the vapid characters and largely unengaging acting made it quickly apparent that the movie was akin to a disaster flick where the disaster itself carries the movie and doesn't have to heavily rely on the individual characters to complete itself.<br/><br/>The problem is, the film doesn't succeed. The causal factor for ""The Happening"" is implausible, even for someone who doesn't know a monochot from a dichot or a pistil from a stamen. That the film spends the lion's share of itself depicting all the different ways people choose to commit suicide just develops it into a higher-budget ""Faces of Death"" with worse acting.<br/><br/>A properly written story would have involved people just arbitrarily dropping dead...or, if you wanted something more fitting (and suitably gory), arbitrarily collapsing and writhing around while spontaneously and instantly decomposing into fertilizer. Of course, this would have meant the entire film would require better acting and much better characterization.<br/><br/>TLDR version: Thinly veiled environmentalist admonishment that is poorly written and unbelievably hokey with extremely sub-par acting. Barely worth a rental."

I'll give it a chance."" What a mistake that was. I just finished watching it and I am completely disappointed and mad that I wasted my time and money on this DVD rental. I thought that some of the acting was really bad, and the story made no sense. Yes I understand in Hollywood you can be as creative as you want to be. I do have to give Mr, Shyamalan props for taking this risk, I wish I had more guts to do so. However, this movie didn't have a point. It felt like a film that was promoting global warming for some strange reason. I mean really, trees? That is plain ridiculous, I honestly liked ""Don't Mess With A Zohan"" better than this movie.

"rynlarson","4","0","2","11 October 2008"," Uninspired film that could have been much more!
","Films with an underlying political message are 50-50 when it comes to accomplishing what it sets out to do. First they must deliver an entertaining movie. Second they must cleverly insert the underlying theme throughout the film so the viewer appreciated both aspects. ""The Happening"" accomplishes neither. Interesting premise offered the writer & director Shamalyan the opportunity his first hit film since ""Signs"". Unfortunately, unlike ""The Day After Tomorrow"", he fails at grabbing a hold of his audience and dragging them in. His directing style stays consistent here, although its not the type of genre to support the style he prefers. What made Hitchcock great (which you can tell is the inspiration for a lot of the directors style) was no matter what type of film he was doing, his nuances were present but he could adapt to the genre he was doing. It seemed as if this film was thrown together without the same attention to detail as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". I am also one of the few that truly enjoyed the emotional journey of ""The Lady in the Water"". I thought that film had a lot of passion and creativity. ""The Happening"" is a one note film. One cannot fault Mark Wahlberg as he does his best with the script he can. However, a lot of things go unexplained in this film which if this were a good film, one would spend time trying to come up with their own conclusions. This film finishes, and you don't care as to the reasons why at the end."

","Let me preface this review by saying that I've enjoyed some of M. Night Shyamalan's films. Unbreakable was under-rated and I didn't think The Village deserved as negative as a reaction as it did.<br/><br/>However, I don't worship The Sixth Sense like some people, I've never seen Signs, and I can barely sit through 5 minutes of Lady in the Water.<br/><br/>If you do watch this movie, don't go in expecting a serious, thrilling commentary of the modern day world. If you're expecting anything like that from Night in his post-Village phase, you will be severely disappointed.<br/><br/>That's not saying this isn't a decent movie. At only 90 minutes, it's not too long at all. The movie hits the ground running and picks up speed from there. Sure, not everything makes sense, but using the ""unknown"" as a story basis gives Night freedom to do this. It's quite remarkable that if you were to actually remove the overly serious/dramatic scenes, you'd have a nice example of a brisk moving action movie.<br/><br/>Yes, despite all the death (sometimes more implied than visual) and the R rating, it definitely gave off more of an action movie vibe than horror to me, though the ""outrunning the enemy"" and ""broken romance"" threads seem to try and keep it conventionally tied into the horror genre. All the scenes with people going suicidal are more energetic than scary, and sometimes are (dare I say it) awkward-turtle-entertaining.<br/><br/>Mark Whalberg, Zooey Deschanel, and John Leguizamo do a decent job as the lead trio and based on their track records in film, you know if you like them or not.<br/><br/>Overall: You already know if it's your cup of tea or not. It's a matter of giving it a chance. I almost didn't bother with it, decided to give it a shot, and was thoroughly entertained. Some of it might of been pure dumb entertainment, but there are many worse ways to kill an hour and a half than this one. Judge it yourself. 6/10"

","THE HAPPENING, the newest offering from writer/director M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN, starring MARK WAHLBERG and ZOOEY DESCHANEL, was a disappointment to me mainly for the acting which is downright horrendous. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>MARK WAHLBERG, who stars as Elliot Moore, turns in a childish act that really ruins a lot of the movie. He portrays a Science teacher in this movie but you're constantly thinking to yourself that he should of been one of his students. Come on Mark, you can do better and you have. Films such as BOOGIE NIGHTS and THE DEPARTED proved that. How am I suppose to take you seriously as a Science teacher and as a person trying to lead others to safety when your demeanor is so childlike? I think I'd rather take help from a blind man than you. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>ZOOEY DESCHANEL portrays MARK's wife Alma Moore and she seems so wide-eyed and dumbfounded in this movie that her performance is just plain dumb. She look's like she's lost in her own little world, not aware of the other actors/actresses around her. If I was the little girl (Jess)(portrayed by ASHLYN SANCHEZ) in this movie, I wouldn't of been sticking by her side. The first time she turned her back to me, I'd be taking off and running away from her as fast as I could. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>This movie could of been something, I think anyway, that could of been better if the acting wasn't so shoddy. BETTY BUCKLEY is nice as Mrs. Jones and JOHN LEGUIZAMO is okay as Julian but that is about it. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN seems to be in a slump lately. Who knows? Maybe someday he will actually do another movie on par with THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS but this isn't it. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>The movie has a nice, creepy premise but I won't get into details here. Wouldn't want to ruin it for those who plan on watching it. Besides, you can easily read the full synopsis on THE HAPPENING IMDb title page. Thank you very much. <br/><br/>Creepy premise aside, and a nice opening, the movie goes down hill with the introduction of MARK WAHLBERG and even further down hill when ZOOEY DASCHANEL's lovely mug hits the screen.

If you watched that movie and gave it a good rating you are everything that is wrong with America. The reason I ended up watching ""The Happening"" is because I was tricked usually movies by Mr. M. Night Shalamahisapatma is accompanied by much fanfare that he is the director. I didn't know that he directed this until it was too late and I was already well into the first half of the movie and spellbound by Marky Marky's superb Oscar winning performance.<--- (For those of you who don't know what sarcasm is please refer to the previous sentence.)Zooey Deschanel was only cast in this because of her large blue eyes and the fact that they look like they are bugging out of her head every five seconds. She couldn't believe what was happening! I also could not believe what was happening on the screen before my very own eyes. Some of the worst acting I have seen since ""Point Break"". Keanu has nothing on Mark Wahlberg! Can somebody explain why he is talking like he has a little too much sugar in his tank. That breathy whisper really turned my stomach but I digress. The plants are giving off toxic air and making people commit suicide. Let me tell you while watching this movie I was wishing that I was one of those trees blowing my poison in the air because everyone of those people deserved to die a horrible death. The only entertaining parts of this movie were all the creative ways these people found to kill themselves. That really tickled my funny bone! Also the portrayal of the American soldier as a hick well ""Cheese and Crackers"" that was spot on as most of them are. If only some of those trees could grow near my job and breath their beautiful life stealing toxin in the air so my idiot co-workers could do away with themselves but again I digress.

","OK, I hate to pile on, however this is the only movie I've seen that I would rate a 1. There are several factors that figure into this rating. One: the commercials ahead of time showed every good part of the movie. (The dudes flopping off the top of the building..etc) Also, just when Mark Walburg was becoming a trusted actor (Shooter, Invincible) he agrees to be in this piece of garb. The quirky science teacher with a marital problem?? Not only can you not buy him as a teacher, there is no....I repeat....NO connection as a married couple. Two: grass??? It's the GRASS????? I don't know if anyone remembers the ""The More You Know"" commercials that came on after GI Joe on Saturday mornings, but this is an hour and however long protest against....well...kind of everything. Where the GI Joe commercials trump this film is that there was an answer at the end. This film simply tells you not to hang around other people or else the crab grass will make you kill yourself. MNS was on thin ice with Lady in the Water. That was a thin pic, everyone who loved Sixth Sense and The Village were waiting at the door of the theater to see this one...opening night for most...and left disappointed and kind of upset. M. Night has over stepped his boundary. We gave a pass on Lady in the water....every movie since 6th Sense has been worse by degree (wich is expected b/c 6th Sense was amazing) Signs was pretty good, the Village was OK, Lady in the water was too much....and the Happening was Butt Awful.

","This movie was surprisingly a drag, and after that shock opener it is really a sad fact. They have a couple of good scenes thrown in there, but it was all accompanied by absolutely terrible dialogue. The propaganda was way off the charts, and it became blatantly obvious where the movie was headed.<br/><br/>What is up with the so-called scientists in this movie? They put the main character as a high school science teacher, but teaches his class that nature cannot be explained or understood? The whole point of science is to try to understand nature by research and observation. And when a large portion of the US is wiped out by a neurochemical, the only ""scientist"" they can find for TV can't come up with anything better than ""the plants have taken revenge""? I'm not even a biologist, and I could postulate more likely scenarios. Like, it may have been isolated by particular new variants in species, and the species only had enough time to spread so far. Hell, they have even found vastly different chemicals produced in remains of the exact same species. Where is my peer review?<br/><br/>What bothered me the most were the choices of death scenes. For a person who has thought a lot about death in his life, the characters (though amusing) were really choosing some unusual ways to end their pitiful existences. Passing up a perfectly good shard of glass in favor of bashing their head against the wall... Choosing to activate a tractor to mow yourself over rather than just rip the blade out by hand... Waiting for the last person to finish with the gun before using it... Hell, these outlandishly creative solutions take a functional mind just to come up with. If I suddenly had the urge to do myself in, I would scramble for the first thing I saw and make the best use out of it I could. I wouldn't get nearly that creative until long after my first attempts fail.<br/><br/>Honestly, I do have to give major props to Shyamalan for originality, I don't think anyone's ever tried to make an antagonist out of a gentle breeze before, let alone pull it off. But he could have at least left some of it up to the imagination, thrown out at least a dozen theories and let the viewers decide... I always feel so cheated when the writers spell out what is going on, as if I were too dumb to figure it out or come up with my own conclusion.<br/><br/>Do better next time!

"Jacques98","2","0","3","3 September 2008"," M. Night, stay with PG-13 movies.
","I decently liked M. Night in the past, but I'm far from a fan-boy, so no matter what he did I can't be too disappointed with it because of hype or respect I have for the man himself. The reason so many reviews are so bad is because the viewer either hates or loves M. Night and they're opinions of him take or add to their opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>For what it was, I disagree with people who say that it needed a killer or suspense or whatever. The story itself held up just fine, and only bordered on silly slightly (though I could see how some would think it's ludicrous). Also, all the fan-boys who claim the movie was ""original"" and ""deep"" are insane. The basic ideamass suicide with unknown causehas been done in countless Stephen King novels: The Stand and Cell are the two on the top of my head. *Spoilers* The idea of trees causing this has been done in countless old sci-fi movies like The Forbidden Planet and such. Even the maniac old in the end reminded me of a dumbed-down version of Hoit in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. *End spoilers* I can't name an original idea in the entire plot. As for people who defend Night by saying: ""People hate this movie because it is too deep, and they want more popcorn-flick thrillers!"" are, once again, very wrong. The Happening takes on the same old global warming banter you've heard for years. Deep? Hardly. Even the whole ""faith vs. fear"" meaning Night implies in his interviews has been done so many times it's almost a clichénot that the movie showed that meaning very strongly in the first place, if at all.<br/><br/>It is also falsely advertised as being a violent/gory film. The head shot suicides are cut-off scenes, and any more unpractical suicide scenes are not shown. The most graphic scene shows a severed arm, but it is only on screen for a second. How it earned an R-rating I'll never understand, especially when Cloverfield showed just about as much blood and got a PG-13 rating. Also, any hope of being disturbed by the images, even though they're relatively gore-less, is minimal. There was a ditzy 12-year-old girl sitting next to me and she was laughing as some of the ""disturbing"" scenes took place.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the acting was terrible as much as the characters just looked and acted stupid. You can defend that by saying it was how they were meant to be, but it simply was not pleasant to watch people being so silly in a movie that isn't meant to be black comedy.<br/><br/>But in the end I think that's how it's taken. Black comedy. The opening 20 minutes had me and the younger (and more desensitized) audience unintentionally laughing at the cut-off scenes and the cheesy reactions to deaths. The end is very well done . . . until the last five minutes when it uses an unrealistic TV broadcast to give us the information that should have been shown.<br/><br/>Now my biased opinion: I'm glad this movie didn't stoop to the wholehearted clichés that critically acclaimed horror movies like The Decent, The Orphanage, and The Mist did. But the lack of advertised gore and the poor storytelling just ruined it for me. Worth my $5? I think I got more satisfaction for my money's worth writing this review than I got out of the movie.<br/><br/>It won't rock your world, but it's better than wallowing in boredom.

"sitenoise","3","0","1","2 September 2008"," It's obscene. I can't turn away
","Confession: I watched this movie and thought it was unrelentingly, embarrassingly bad. It looked pretty good, it had that Shyamalan style, but so much of the dialog felt bullied onto the characters. I couldn't believe how unnatural it sounded, how forced and amateurish it felt for the purpose of filling in plot. And it's a message flick""we've abused the planet so don't be surprised if it fights back some day""and message flicks, in my experience, are the worst offenders in the bad movie department because the message, and trying to make the point, often get in the way of making a good film.<br/><br/>Then I read a brief comment from a reviewer at the MRQE: ""Shyamalan doesn't conform to the needs of modern movie goer zombies. It doesn't mean he sucks. It means you don't get it. At least someone still takes risks in the ART of cinema. It's not unintentionally hilarious. It's a blatantly comedic satire."" Whoa! That changes everything. Satire gives Shyamalan a free pass from ridiculous straight through to funny; except I'm not sure what he is satirizing. Himself? Message movies? Horror movies? Science? What? Doesn't satire involve an obvious subject in order for the satire to be got? I'm not going to hold the MRQE reviewer to his literal words because if The Happening is ""blatantly comedic"" I have lost my sense of humor completely. There is the part with the greenhouse guruwho pretty much solves the mystery of the Event by declaring that plants, because they can't run around and throw punches, develop neurotoxins to fight off threats to their existenceand his ironic enthusiasm for bringing hot dogs along on the getaway trip. That was funny. When he asks Mark Wahlberg and then Zooey Deschanel if they like hot dogs, they both respond negatively, but not so much as in ""No, they give me the creeps"", but more like ""Not really, but more importantly your enthusiasm for them is giving me the willies."" Satire can also bring forgiveness to plot wonders and plot holes. One of the more uncomfortable moments in the film for me is when John Leguizamo decides to turn back and go into the dead zone to look for his wife. He is about to entrust his daughter's safety to Mark and Zooey but when Zooey reaches out to take his daughter's hand John barks at her: ""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it."" On paper the line is in character, perhaps, but in performance it's way out of line. Are we supposed to laugh at the pain in Zooey's eyes as she reacts to this idiotic ungratefulness? I dunno. I don't get it. Shyamalan could very well be forging a new path, creating his own rules for satire, or deconstructing it and tossing aside certain aspects, like humor, for the sake of his art.<br/><br/>There's the famous bit of dialog from the movie trailer where Wahlberg confronts the getaway train conductor (or whatever he is) about why they can't get back on the train and keep going. The conductor says, ""We've lost contact."" Wahlberg asks, ""With who?"" and the conductor replies ""Everyone."" That seems pretty final until a few scenes later where a woman is talking on her cell phone to her daughter who's back in the infected zone. Mark walks up like Jack from the TV show Lost and offers instructions to pass along to the daughter of the hysterical woman who puts the call on speaker-phone so we can all hear her daughter die. Cut. There's the scene where someone whips out an iPhone and plays a high quality video that was just sent to them from someone in the infected zone. I'm not going to tell what the video shows, suffice to say it's blatantly comedic. As is the notion of running away from the wind but I'm not bringing that up.<br/><br/>I have an extremely high tolerance for the gravity of plot as it weighs on a story. I'm not deducting points for inconsistency; I'm deducting points because so many of the scenes are written so badly. And the story is stupid. Yes, playing the satire card shines a new light on everything but I'm not sure it makes anything more attractive. I'm reminded of a Seinfeld episode where an elderly couple are admiring a giant portrait of Kramer and the guy says something to the effect of ""It's obscene. I can't turn away."" Honestly, that's how I feel about The Happening. It's so bad it has to be brilliant. But blatantly comedic? I'm not sure. Your mileage may vary."
"Siamois","3","0","2","1 September 2008"," Shyamalan's downward spiral continues....
","When The Sixth Sense was released, almost a decade ago, it was impossible not to take notice of M. Night Shyamalan and his strong directorial style. It contrasted heavily with other ""occult"" and ""scary"" offerings. And this was predominantly due to a style of direction that is both poignant yet sober. M. Night Shyamalan has since then continued to use that formula, basing each of his new movies on an intriguing idea and plot twists. At the heart of M. Night Shyamalan's undeniable influences are Stephen King and Alfred Hitchcock and this explains why his fascinating premises and the stylistic imprint have struck a chord with a large audience. Some trademarks:<br/><br/>-Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance in his movies <br/><br/>-stories are slow paced and there is an air of mystery and supernatural.<br/><br/>-There are scares but the movies avoid cheap stunts like swear words, buckets of bloods and naked bimbos instead relying on primal fears, imagination to galvanize the audience. What horror there is, is handled in a classy manner.<br/><br/>-Protagonists are usually ordinary people put in extraordinary situations.<br/><br/>-Direction is a sort of modern, Hollywoodian ""cinéma d'auteur"" style in some ways.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what should have been a winning combination has proved more and more tedious with each subsequent movies our director has released. <br/><br/>Consider the slow fall: Sixth Sense: Top notch acting, pacing, photography. Amazing story. A superb twist ending that is elegant. We sense Shyamalan's direction in some plot elements but it doesn't clash with the viewer, nor does it prevent immersion.<br/><br/>Unbreakable: Solid acting, pacing and general direction. Premise is amazing but treatment leads to a less compelling story than Sixth Sense. Twist ending falls flat, like Shyamalan was trying to repeat Sixth Sense. Tried too hard.<br/><br/>Signs: Both Unbreakable and the Sixth Sense were emotionally charged and succeeded in that respect. We deeply care about the characters, their personal struggles and their journey. Here, what should be emotionally charged is just sappy and cheap. Joaquin Phoenix's talent is wasted with a crappy character. Overtones of spirituality are heavy handed. There's still great direction here and the premise is fascinating. As the story progresses, it only disappoints.<br/><br/>The Village: Shyamalan corrects the overly sappy nature of his previous offering a little. But the whole buildup seems to revolve around the twist ending. One of Shyamalan's strongest premise but plot development is forced. Bryce Dallas Howard, much like Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense, is perfect and a revelation as a new star. We roll our eyes as Shyamalan makes his artificial cameo appearance. Movie's ending is flat. There's still the overall impression the direction is above average but it just doesn't give results.<br/><br/>Lady in the Water: An awkward and silly mix of fantasy, horror and mystery. Some of the characters, like the ""bodybuilder"" are just downright stupid. Shyamalan's role in this one is a bit more important but he very much deserves the Razzie award for it. The ""plot twist"" in this one again shows the desperation of Shyamalan to repeat the Sixth Sense's success. Paul Giamatti, one of the great actors of his generation, does well, but some of the cast members surrounding him are just atrocious. Again, Shyamalan, as a director, intervenes in the plot, auteur-style, with a critic character but it is heavy-handed. By the end, you're just glad the movie is over as the weird mix between a horror movie and a Neverending Story knockoff is just painful to watch.<br/><br/>Which brings us to The Happening. Again, the Shyamalan trademarks are there. Slow pace like the Sixth Sense, but not to good effect. In Mark Walhberg's first scene, we immediately notice he is miscast and on top of that, delivers an awful performance. At times, it's like nails on a chalkboard. Zooey Deschanels, an amazing indie actress who has been hit and miss in Hollywood movies, delivers one of her worst performances ever. I'm not even sure she tried, to be honest. And I certainly doubt Shyamalan provided much guidance. All the characters are flat. Most actors, including Leguizamo, are miscast. The story? Again, the premise is interesting but this must be the worse development of a story by Shyamalan so far. Plot holes and incoherencies abound. There's a vast list on the message board but as a glowing example, we see a woman talking to a relative on her cell... and she actually puts her on speaker phone for us, the audience, to hear the horror. It's so inelegant and so unlike anything you would expect from the guy who directed The Sixth Sense. The Happening reminds us of Hitchcock's The Birds but without any value in it.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has reached the lowest of lows. It's very obvious by now that he continually tries to replicate the success of The Sixth Sense and it is no coincidence that each subsequent movie since has had a lower and lower ratings, much like sequels to a great movie will receive lower and lower ratings as the formula is milked and abused. And this where Shyamalan and Hitchcock differs. Where there are underlying links and similarities in themes, there's also a willingness by Hitchcock not to repeat himself overly. To break new grounds. And there's a perpetual attention to details. In Shyamalan's case, all I get is the impression of someone who keeps viewing The Sixth Sense and wonders how to recreate that hit. I had never seen a Shyamalan directorial effort that was actually crappy until this. I had seen sappy, manipulative and pointless stories but this is the first time the pacing and acting is actually that off. <br/><br/>It's worth noting that in the Sixth Sense, Donnie Walhberg, a b-movie actor, had a small role that he pulled off brilliantly with the help of Shyamalan where his high profile brother Mark totally fails here."

"shpadoinkle-2","8","0","3","16 August 2008"," What's wrong with you? This is great movie!
","I sort of grew up with Shyamalan's movies, and this is one of his best. For this one, MNS takes all sorts of inspirations from movies like Hitchcock's The Birds and Romero's Night Of The Living Dead and gives it his own spin. The result is a tense, gripping tale about an invisible danger that might mean the end of humanity. The movie starts off great, keeps you entertained throughout and features some memorable scenes and characters. The scene with the construction workers dropping off the building at the very beginning grasped me by heart and balls and I remained curious and shocked through the whole experience. Mark Wahlberg and beautiful Zooey Deschnanel work as typical Shyamalan characters and do so wonderfully. Maybe there just isn't enough heart pounding melodrama in the script for all you haters out there, but I like this realistic, laid back approach to dialogue and acting. Just don't expect over-the-top blockbuster action or typical Hollywood logic here and you will be presented with one the finest and most subtle horror movies of the decade."

","Over the past several years, there have been an influx of movies geared toward making our public more aware (and sometimes, scared) of our misuse of the environment (like ""Armageddon,"" ""Day After Tomorrow""). Now, M. Night Schyamalan has joined the ranks of the ridiculous treehuggers and wrote and directed his own scare-tactic movie about the environment entitled ""The Happening"", starring Mark Wahlberg. <br/><br/>Look, people, I have no problem doing things to protect and preserve our environment, like recycling at work (yeah, my condominium complex, along with so many of D/FW's apartment complexes don't have recycling facilities!), but PLEASE, don't use scare tactics like ""The Happening"" (where plant life releases toxins in the air, causing homo-sapiens to begin committing suicide!) to scare me into submission. I would much more prefer to follow God's provision in Genesis 1:26-30 (ESV):<br/><br/>""Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.' So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.' And God said, 'Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And 'to every beats of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.'

"moviemaker5-1","6","0","2","14 August 2008"," Jesus and M. Night Shyamalan
","This last movie may have been the last time I ever get excited at the advertisement of a new M. Night Shyamalan picture. (Unless reviews of future films are stellar.)<br/><br/>Other people have enjoyed Shyamalan's output even less than me. I very much enjoyed his THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, and, to a lesser extent, SIGNS.<br/><br/>Most people I've talked with hated THE VILLAGE and the LADY IN THE WATER--or whatever it was called. Awful movie.<br/><br/>To make a comparison, like the music of the group Counting Crows, the films of Shyamalan have gone steadily downhill--each one worse than the last.... but still watchable and somewhat enjoyable.<br/><br/>If Shyamalan doesn't reinvent and improve his screen writing skills quickly, his movies will soon dip under the box office waterline to become exclusively direct-to-video releases.<br/><br/>Certainly we now know that Shyamalan is not the cinematic modern-day equivalent of Hitchcock that he was touted to be just a few short years ago.<br/><br/>Another reason that he may soon be no longer a fixture at the Cineplex is that he has shown himself to be an adherent of the new extremist religion: the anti-Christian pro-Environment ""Green"" cult.<br/><br/>""THE HAPPENING"" is a terrible title for a movie, I was thinking, as I paid for my ticket to the Christie Digital Presentation at the Carmike Cinema box office. (Powers and Pulsar Drive.) <br/><br/>I went out to the movies alone last Monday afternoon, and I was the only one in the theater until, a couple minutes before the show started, three women, maybe in their thirties, walked in.<br/><br/>If you've read the book ""Hollywood Worldviews,"" by Brian Godawa, then you know where I'm coming from as I analyze this film.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is as insulting to humans in general, as it is transparent: the Environment, (specifically trees and vegetation), takes its revenge on a mostly non-Environmentally friendly humanity by exuding a deadly virus into the air that causes people to commit suicide in spectacular ways. (Our ""heroes,"" the Environmentalists, are granted immunity by their ""God,"" The Environment, of course.)<br/><br/>Yes, I find this an aggressive and offensive and politicized premise, indeed.<br/><br/>I have just described the entire film, whose main source of suspense and fear is wind blowing in the tall green grass. Very ineffective. (But very pleasing, I am sure, to the studio execs counting the cost to make this film.) <br/><br/>To add to the offensiveness that something like a TWISTER never had, Shyamalan makes the only really creepy, mean and villainous character in the movie a Christian woman who has a wall in her house covered in Christian crosses and paintings of biblical scenes. After Shyamalan shows a wall full of her Christian art, this evil creepy Christian woman smashes her head into the windows of the house repeatedly, killing herself. To me, this was the very image of Shyamalan's contempt for Christianity.<br/><br/>Yes, believe it or not, I find that offensive.<br/><br/>(In the fairly recent film, SUNSHINE, the villain aboard the spaceship is also a fanatical man who believes in God.)<br/><br/>The strong believers in God are almost always the bad guys in films nowadays.<br/><br/>Certainly in the Christian world, there are crazies and hypocrites and televangelists (no wait, I repeat myself), but, mostly, religion and faith, looked at socially, are positive elements in people's lives.<br/><br/>The is no real suspense, drama, or other deep meaning in THE HAPPENING.<br/><br/>I'd avoid it like you would avoid a flesh-eating virus...<br/><br/>Unless, of course, you enjoy that sort of thing."

"mjhalta","8","0","4","7 August 2008"," Not for Neanderthals, but for Homo Sapiens!!!
","Once again the average Neanderthal that writes these reviews has slammed a good movie. Not enough blood and gore and the monster didn't show up. They want a monster that shows up immediately and starts killing, or else it's no good. This movie had plenty of tension, mystery and good acting. The plot was logical and made total sense, and really made you think about man kind and his existence on this planet and just how tenuous it is. The premise of this movie is that mankind has not been a good caretaker of the planet and has gotten a warning from nature. That's pretty straightforward and should be easy for even the Neanderthals to comprehend. Too bad their so easily confused. Listen up those of you who have split off from the Homo Sapien branch, in future don't bother going to see anything by this director as he is far too deep for you, stay home and watch reruns of Mr. Bean. A lot of the critics of this film make an argument that this could never happen, and they point out all sorts of scientific reasons why not. The point that is being made by this movie is that when mankind's doom comes and it may never come, it will be from something that we least expected and weren't prepared for. Look at the black death that has killed millions over the centuries and the influenza outbreak at the start of the twentieth century, both of these mankind could do little about at the time. Also there is a lot of criticism of the acting, which if you reflect was pretty much how all of us would react in this situation. This wasn't a Bruce Willis movie where everything he does is spot on and he saves the day because he is so all knowing and brave and Johnny on the spot. No this was a movie about ordinary people coping with extraordinary times, and not doing a very good job of it. The encyclopedia says that the Neanderthal is extinct, by the reviews this movie is getting I think not."
"nickkarner","3","0","2","6 August 2008"," Is this the end of Shyamalan...a-ding-dong?
","Well, with the upcoming Avatar, I suppose not, but I can honestly say it might as well be. If Lady in the Water was the death knell, than The Happening was the death rattle. I was stunned at the awfulness of this film. By no means is it as ridiculous or incomprehensibly bizarre as Lady in the Water(although I think Lady was at least a good lesson for Mr. Shyabooballuh considering the little hint-hint he got from his double win as Worst Director AND Worst Supporting Actor at the Razzies. Notice how he cast himself as Joey, and then cut himself out? Hmmm...), it was still just as inept in its execution and oblivious to the machinations and traits of human beings. <br/><br/>It all boils down to this. Shamoomalan is GREAT visual stylist. He knows when to use innovative camera techniques and when to just leave it alone and let the actors go. But someone needs to come up, slap him in the face, and say you should never be allowed to write again! A retarted monkey could write better dialogue! It's just uniformly bad. I'm one of the 3 or 4 people who thought the Village was great. Didn't even notice bad dialogue. But you know what, after sitting through Unbreakable, Lady, and Happening, it dawned on me that Nighty Night found a loophole in Village. The dialogue was SUPPOSED to be stilted and weird. He couldn't do wrong. He must've had a ball writing it. Hmmm...this line sucks. Alright, yay for me! Are there any more muffins?<br/><br/>He needs to take a tip from the visual directors who think up the concept and maybe a basic story, then hand it over to more experienced and skilled writers. Take a clue from Sam Raimi and Alex Proyas! Hello! Alex Proyas thought of the story for Dark City, but instead of trying to pound it out by himself, he snagged two other writers(one of which was a writer on Batman!). Same for Raimi. He thought of Darkman, but there are FOUR OTHER WRITERS on that film! These are great films, period. But Knnnn-Night needs to realize that he simply doesn't know how to write realistic dialogue.<br/><br/>We all know the story. Hell, that's the best thing about the movie. Wind blows, plants release something in the air, everybody kills themselves. Marky-Mark is trying to figure out why, the clown from Spawn is trying to find his wife, Will Ferrell's ho from Elf is cheating on her husband(sort of), Cameron has finally become Mr. Rooney, and the chick from Cats is living in isolation and smashing her head through windows. Got it? Good. <br/><br/>I'm not going to sully this review with excerpts from the awful screenplay. I shall only describe SOME of the unbelievably bad scenes. Know what? They might not have been bad scenes if they were written better. But, que cera...<br/><br/>Dirk Diggler talking to his students like NO TEACHER has ever spoken to a class before. Is this Special Ed? Why is he sneaking around the class like a pervert on the run from the neighborhood watch? The idiot train attendants. The stupid woman who just randomly shows footage of the man being torn apart by lions. Thanks for that, ma'am. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to hurl on your Marc Jacobs boots. It's just so inappropriate and weird the way she shows it to him. Could've been written SO much better. Leguizamo(one of the only bright spots in this movie) appears to not be wearing a seatbelt in a crowded car. Not only that, but he's near the front. And yet when the car crashes, he's the only one who emerges to cut his wrists. How the hell did he survive and people were BEHIND HIM?! The soldier. That's it. Just the soldier. I certainly hope they're not shipping him off to Iraq anytime soon. Tiramisu?! I sincerely hope that's a new sex practice that I've just been totally oblivious of. What the hell, man?! There's no conflict! There's nothing to their relationship! Who cares if she ate dessert with him? Who cares if Sgt. Dignam checked out some floozy at a pharmacy? So do I! My wife works at one, and she's HOT!! Duurr!! The two kids they meet. Can you even believe the insults they try to spout off to those people boarded up in that house? ""Open up, you bitches!"" Are you freakin' kidding me? Just awful. The gym teacher from Carrie has gone cuckoo, and even though she was suitably creepy, her final scene became so ridiculous that it just became laughable. And speaking of laughable, the worst scene you ask? The scene that broke me? The plant talking scene. Hands down. I've been sitting there, in a theatre, patiently giving this ridiculous movie a chance, and then this. It needs to be seen to be believed. I started cackling, literally. It was horrifying. <br/><br/>The good? Anything visual, duh! The death scenes, obviously. Score wasn't bad, not Howard's best, but fine. And the basic concept was really great. But I beg of you, if you see McNight around, and I'm sure you will, just check any restaurant that accepts American Express and you'll see him in the corner imagining people's faces are melting. Tell him that unless he's using that pen to sign his check, he needs to put it down immediately!"

The plot is totally different from anything that Shyamalan has done. It's a film about global disaster, but a different type of disaster. I thought it was a nice idea, but sadly missed. I heard some studio (which I do not know!) rejected the script of The Happening because of it's mistakes, and Shyamalan he also refused to repair the errors in the script and moved to another studio! He made a mistake.<br/><br/>About the actors: Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo were good, but it was not the best of their performances. Ashlyn Sanchez was lovely, she probably saved the movie, and Zooey Deschanel... she was terrible, terrible in the emotions and dialogs, specially in the scene where she doesn't know if she pick up or if she don't pick up the phone! Honestly, I am so much better than her! <br/><br/>About the violence: the violence was not what I hoped for a film that was rated R.

","The first opinion on this movie was given to me by my friend and he didn't like it, so I didn't expect too much of it. And I liked it. What I liked about the film was the idea it was based upon. I wouldn't characterize it as a horror or a suspense movie, so one shouldn't expect the standard effects in it, although there are some. The movie should be seen more as a awareness story. So, if you think of it in that sense it is not a bad movie, and since there are no terrorists, no aliens, no nuclear apocalypse or crime plot, that fact makes it original in a way. It's not a ""deep thought"" movie, it is a ""what if"" movie and I think some of the questions it asks are good questions. As of the human reaction in these kinds of stress situations, I don't think anyone can be certain what would be typical, generally people who survive concentrate on surviving and everybody reacts it his/her own way, so I disagree with the previous viewer's comment about the characters' behavior being a mistake in the script. The actors were good, maybe not a perfect cast, but I have no problem with Wahlberg, he was not the one I'd change. I liked the effort for characters looking like everyday people, not too pretty and physically outstanding, yet interesting enough."

","This movie is to my opinion just another movie in the line of those that base their horror on the events of 9/11 and other terrorist attacks, just like ""Cloverfield"" (for example). M. Night Shyamalan did his share of good-ideas-gone-bad, and yet this one seems to be not so bad after all. If you could just ignore the dumb characters, the horrible script and the entire point of view this film is taken from, you might just end up watching an excellent thriller where you're scared even before something terrifying really happened. Also, the suicide scenes are done in my opinion in a very professional way. One can always turn this movie into a gore movie with a click, and yet Shyamalan decided to not use his R rating to that point, making this movie not about ""OMG THIS IS SO %#$%#$^$ING GROUSE!"". <br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this movie is actually a really descent one: only with the right expectations."
"leplatypus","4","0","1","30 July 2008"," The Review (Screen)
","This is only my first Shyamalan movie after a lot of acclaimed movies.<br/><br/>The plot of this one is interesting and recalls the 70's fantasy & political thematic. The nature strikes back against human kind and it can be deadly: personally, i find the natural twist a bit rude and disturbing for a young audience. When you see only the poster, you don't think to this violence. Maybe the trailer is more explicit? <br/><br/>As a horror movie, be sure to find the isolation feeling. As usual, the heroes first live in a crowded city and find progressively themselves alone. You can draw a parallel with ""the War of the World"", especially the Spielberg movie. From New-York to the country filled with lunatic people, the plot is the same. It allows a good comparison between the two talents (for me, Spielberg is better).<br/><br/>The crazy credits consist in a final sequence in a park in Paris. Living there, I suppose this last warning is maybe adjusted for all the worldwide megalopolis."

","I had such high expectations for this movie. I mean, The Village, the 6th sense...and then the happening. Boring! I was constantly waiting for something to happen, for some twist like I am used to get with this director. I just didn't happen...<br/><br/>It s to bad because the subject is a good subject for a movie. And Mark Walhberg was the lead so that should be OK. Although I figured it out after 15 minutes the movie started it would have been an great movie if there WAS a twist like we are used to get.<br/><br/>Even lady in the water was more exiting then this one, and that was a kind of fairytale!"
"siderite","6","0","4","28 July 2008"," Signs meets War of the Worlds, but no match
","It was an interesting idea and interpretation, but it was a too long a movie to present a single idea. At least Day of the Trifids has had some action.<br/><br/>Short plot line: the plants are upset and are starting to kill people off. They panic, run, talk nonsense and scream a lot. Then they kill themselves. I really like Mark Wahlberg, but I think his performance was mediocre, something I would say about most other actors as well. What happened to John Leguizamo to get such a marginal role?<br/><br/>Bottom line: if Mel Brooks would have entrusted his daughter to Tom Cruise, while aliens would have chemically bombed the US as punishment from God for desecrating planet Earth, it would have been The Happening with a slightly larger budget, but without Tom Cruise's excellent acting from War of the Worlds."

","M Night Shyamalan is back, thank god! The Happening, starring Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel, is an atmospheric, deeply disturbing thriller about a catastrophe which causes its victims to commit suicide.<br/><br/>Now after the disappointment of Lady In The Water, sadly unsaved even by the talents of Paul Giamatti, I thought Shyamalan had lost it. Then I saw The Village, which was a profound disappointment, more-so for it's effective set-up and laughable 'twist' ending, which for Shyamalan is becoming a calling card. Fortunately there is no such twist here. Instead you get an incredibly creepy, moody film that manages to engage.<br/><br/>First off, the performances by Whalberg and Deschanel are great. They bring believability to their roles as ambivalent newlyweds forced to rely on each other under horrible circumstances.<br/><br/>The writing is good because despite the sometimes slow pace things are always moving forward. Even the slowness works here, because it seems necessary to make the bizarre plausible. We get some breathing room in between the scares, of which there are a few good ones. Very few scenes don't work, with the noticeable exception of the Zoo scene. Don't look for it, it's a blip on the radar, but a blip that made me role my eyes. You'll notice it, don't worry.<br/><br/>That aside, when the credits rolled I was staring at the screen bathing in the (here's that word again) creepiness of it.<br/><br/>I think it wouldn't be too far off to compare this some of the better zombie films, like the recent 28 Days Later. Something is affecting people and killing them, but in this case they stay dead. I also couldn't help thinking more than once about Radiohead's video for their single Just. I wouldn't be surprised to learn Shyamalan's opening sequences were inspired by the video.<br/><br/>I've really been in love with Gus Van Sant's Death Trilogy; Gerry, Elephant, and Last Days, because of the director's spare, minimalist style. Shyamalan has a touch of that same sorta vibe here, in that he allows the story to unfold instead of ramming it down our throats. That said, The Happening isn't as meditative as the aforementioned, but it does allow for some thoughtfulness on the viewers end.<br/><br/>I found The Happening hypnotic and engrossing, with some good scares and shocking deaths. Unfortunately most critics didn't agree, with rottentomatoes.com offering a surprising 13%. However two critics whom I respect gave it their trademarked ""thumbs up""; Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert.<br/><br/>I think the problem most critics prolly had was an especially high level of expectation, given the disasters of Shyamalan's two previous films.<br/><br/>I hope this signals a return to form for Shyamalan, a director with an obvious sixth sense for atmospheric horror. (pun intended. sorry.) Final thought: see this film if you want to get totally weirded out."
"Tee_Sigma","8","0","4","27 July 2008"," Well made horror that did it again
","Looking at this movie I experience perfection and continuity, great directing, great music. Acting is fine, the story is there, camera too.<br/><br/>Given that shock we receive after a few seconds, and then every other few seconds people are asking why did he had to do it? Was it really necessary to make a real horror movie? Given that this is the obstacle in the game, the movie provides real excitement with rush, enigma all that.<br/><br/>As for the spoiler, I suppose that its all about getting to the twist in the Happening by following a tough road that contains nothing less bad than emotions. All the negative criticism is however wrong. There were screams in the movie theater, but they liked it."
"ForCenturies","7","0","3","27 July 2008"," It isn't without its flaws, but it is in no way a terrible film.
","I have loved M Night Shyamalan's last few movies. I love The Village because it's a love story and it's about strength to do something you're afraid of but keeping the person you love in your mind to get through the pain. The Lady In The Water is about purpose, and it is especially helpful when you're feeling pooped or bogged down.<br/><br/>The Happening is again a love story. But instead of bizarre-looking creatures roaming around the two lovebirds, suicide happens all around the couple in this film.<br/><br/>The scene that made it for me was when the wind was blowing and Elliot and Alma walk out and hold each others' hands and they don't die. However, everyone else that commits suicide didn't want to - do you see the irony there? Even though all of Night's films are different genres, he is a very talented storyteller, but I think his best films are about love, and as corny as it sounds, love conquers all.<br/><br/>The score is absolutely fantastic, one of the best I've ever heard. Go, JNH! Look, I enjoyed this a lot, I'm not saying you will or won't. Just watch it. All of Night's films are character studies. If you like observing human behaviour in bizarre circumstances (ghosts, monsters, aliens, evil wind), then this is for you. I genuinely cannot wait to buy this on Blu-Ray. It's no groundbreaking film, but it certainly has its place. It's great to see Zooey Deschanel in such a different role as well. She was talented and beautiful as always.<br/><br/>I give it 3.5/5 (7/10). It isn't without its flaws, but it is in no way a terrible film."
"ShimmySnail","8","0","4","26 July 2008"," a good thriller and a good story
","This is a message film, a bit like The Village in its moral tone but on a different subject. I can't say a lot without giving away the trademark Shyamalan plot twist, but this film is different from his earlier works in that it is shorter, and within the first half hour he pretty much gives you all the explanation you're going to get, and the rest is just playing out the situation to its conclusion. Wahlberg, Deschanel, and Leguizamo do a good job, and the child actors as well.<br/><br/>It is similar to War of the Worlds, the H.G. Wells book (not the recent special effects filled film), in that the world is falling apart and nobody can find out how to fight or hide from what is happening, but in this case the enemy is far less conventional than invading Martians, and that is one of the things I like about Shyamalan's films. They are very original. For one person to write and direct six halfway original films in a row is, in itself, fairly amazing. Each is a good story, well told, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>There's a certain percentage of moviegoers that just hate the type of movies Shyamalan does, although they continue to see them and complain about them, but there was nothing wrong with this movie. Some people don't like it when they can't figure out the twist, when the bad guys aren't easily recognized and impaled at the end, or worse yet, when there are no traditional character villains at all, such as in a couple of his earlier films.<br/><br/>They are frightening, and this film has a horror movie feel to it most of the time, albeit a PG-13 treatment of one. If you like interesting plots and being scared and surprised, check this film out."

","I saw this movie today and read some of the comments. Most of the comments seem to be on the negative side..(his career suicide). I wondered whether most of the people are made of wooden hearts or what.<br/><br/>The story is about an unknown phenomenon happening in north east part of USAmerica. It affects the whole population of people and a family is running away from it. If I say a single sentence more then it would become a spoiler. But the story line is very thin and that is one of the reasons lot people criticizing about.<br/><br/>Assume you are watching this as Shyamalan's first movie then I bet everybody would enjoy it 100%. Being his 7th(or more) film audience get a better hint of Shyamaln's style. That takes off some % of interest built up in this movie.<br/><br/>In spite of all of these still the movie could scare you; if it is well-written and well-made. But here Shyamalan kept the standard in perfection but the script and dialogs are not impressive enough. The theme about nature producing toxins is a good notion and kind of making people to think about nature. But it did not threaten them enough.. Watching people committing suicide just before you is not scary for the audience who grew out of blood curling murders and ghosts all over these Hollywood years. I could see the audience don't even feel for the dying too.<br/><br/>I did not expect Shyamlan to scare me when I started watching the film. And hence I enjoyed it 90% because it is full of events make you involved till the end. <br/><br/>If dialogs and depth-of-scenes would have been concentrated then this movie would have made a great difference. otherwise acting, photography, editing and music all are fitting. I could remember a dialog in Signs till now (""Is it possible that there are no coincidences?""). Such a depth in dialogs and scenes would make a film memorable.<br/><br/>Otherwise it is one among the Shyamalan's entertaining movies. About the critics I feel that similar to Shyamalan these critics have been blocked by a critic-wall that make them to not enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>Watch it once. Don't expect a sixth sense feel. Just go for the simple mystery of the story. You might like it."

","we obviously need a little bit of explanation after seeing this movie about what does every single moment stands for and why it is there in the movie but still this movie delivered the fear and paranoia that was prepared for us. i think the main reason most of the people don't like the movie is because it doesn't offer a well known Hollywood story and storytelling and most of the people are not used to see anything different than that. i just watched this movie and i was driven by it 100%, never knowing what will happen next and feeling the fear in every step of the story which is great.<br/><br/>at the beginning of the movie when one of the characters left hoping to come back i said to myself: if he comes back alive i won't like this movie no matter what. that's why i didn't like war of the worlds with tom cruise, for example. (see how i voted for the movie and sue me for spoilers).<br/><br/>objectively, i wouldn't give this movie more than 7 out of 10, but i respect the director a lot for daring to make such a movie that not many will like, but many will see it. and it is a rare opportunity to see something different from spectacular blockbusters where the most important thing is to keep the main character a hero and add some new visuals to his adventures (see the latest Indiana Jones) on a big screen.<br/><br/>i believe this movie has his reasons and it makes you wonder. doesn't give us all the answers but whats more important, it gives us questions. well done Shyamalan. hopefully, viewers of this movie will be open-minded and accept it as one of the movie worth seeing (and there are not so many of such kind lately, except if you prefer Love Guru and Iron Man)"

","I heard bad reviews and went anyway. My experience is if it draws a violent reaction either way, it's usually worth seeing so that you have an educated opinion.<br/><br/>I am not a huge Shy fan, but I will say that of most of his movies that I've seen (Sixth Sense aside) this is probably the best so far. I'd heard in an interview that he did intend to make a ""B"" movie and it's obvious - at times bearing the same tone and atmosphere of a Romero zombie flick. It has the same tension and underlying fear, occasionally trumped by some graphic and overt violence. There is over-acting - by talented actors who know the difference, so much so that it is obviously intentional - and the acts of violence are at times amusing because they are either a)completely unrealistic (Lions would not behave that way, I've seen enough Discovery Channel to know it) or b) so shocking so you don't know how else to respond - a reaction I have often when watching particular films.<br/><br/>My husband was adamant about not seeing this movie and, though he remained convinced afterward that it was without a plot and ridiculous, could not say it was the worst movie he'd ever seen (That honor is still held by ""Battlefield Earth""). I would say that if you are a 'classic' horror fan, particularly Hitchcock and Tales from the Crypt, can look beyond the message that tree-huggers will glom onto (sorry, lefties, but there was terror of plant life before the environment became a popular topic), possess a bit of a sadistic sense of humor, and can suspend your disbelief for a little while - this movie will, at the very least, entertain you."

Besides a couple of unnecessary thrills, that kept me stimulated, this movie sucked really badly. I loved all of his previous movies though, so I just don't get it. The 6th Sense, Signs, The Village (except for the ending) and Unbreakable were all some of the better movies I've seen, but this one just lacked in a huge way.

All I'm saying here is that if you have something to say that is thought provoking,original, and useful...throw it out there. We all love spirited debate.

"dunmore_ego","6","0","3","25 June 2008"," Nothing Happening
","M. Night Shyamalan is a film-making genius.<br/><br/>Okay  that's outa the way, now to THE HAPPENING. Or - ""wha' happuhned?"" In M. Night Shyamalan's latest producer-writer-director effort, people of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard suddenly start offing themselves in an epidemic eventually diagnosed as a neurotoxin spread by plants via the wind. Film follows a young couple (Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) on the run inland from the airborne toxin, wrenching intrigue and tension from every wind-tossed field and creaking tree bough they encounter. Underneath the eerie set pieces is a larger portent of a planet grown weary of its most destructive species, bringing about that species' extinction on a grand scale.<br/><br/>Grandiose concept + morbidly inept cast = mediocre film.<br/><br/>There are reviews aplenty on this clunker from M. Night, trying to identify the source of all the nothing; profound epistles exploring everything from M's misanthropy to the film's philosophical anomalies  but this film's missteps are in full view of we the abused viewers Misstep Number One: Mr. Night, no matter how introspective Mark Wahlberg might have seemed playing an underdog footballer (INVINCIBLE, 2006), or how hard he slammed into his detective role in THE DEPARTED (2006), he was, in essence, just playing to type  a dumb jock and a mean dick. He has never actually been asked to ""act"" before. And though I'm sure you asked him to, no one has coached him past ""concerned face"" on page 7 of the Acting For Dummies Handbook.<br/><br/>Misstep Number Two: Mr. Night, Zooey Deschanel's emotional palette runs from bland all the way to paint drying, her primo roles being ELF (2003) and THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005)  need I elaborate?; whereas your movie needed a lead actress who could juxtapose pathos, terror, empathy and devotion. That's four emotions too many for zoophyte Zooey. And those constant bug eyes didn't help, nor that miscast hairdo almost as bad as Gene Simmons.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo is sorely underused; he delivers one very powerful, tear-jerking line, ""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!"" when he must choose to forsake her in search of his wife Oh, that's right, he didn't really forsake his daughter, but entrusted her to the care of Marky and Zooey  kinda same result though Two character actors, Betty Buckley and Frank Collison, act eccentric circles around the lead dishrags, Buckley's screen time as an old recluse coot, genuinely eerie  anything involving life-sized dolls sleeping in your bed as if they were real  I feel the hairs rising on my scary bits as I write this M. Night's storytelling is still inimitable, his film-making talents still exceptional, but his leads simply haven't the nuance required for a world-girdling, life-altering Happening. Throughout the movie, we are in constant vacillation on whether we are watching ""bad acting"" or whether we are just unaware of how people would realistically react in such mind-numbing situations. The irony is: an inexpressive person like Mark Wahlberg probably WOULD react so woodenly in situations where people were taking their lives all around him.<br/><br/>Some of the extras haven't even reached page 7, and attain lofty heights of distracted apathy and leaden aloofness. Speaking of distracted, the movie opens with Marky as a science teacher. Our first thought: ""Not buying it!"" Despite that, the cred levels out by showing us a quote attributed to Einstein: ""If the bee disappears, man would have four years left."" Then the movie goes in a completely different direction. Wha-? Who-? Is this M. Night Shyamalan or Ed Wood Jr.? It doesn't help that the ""villain"" of the film is a microbe transported on an invisible breeze Whereas Night's movies have come to signify never wasting a frame on superfluity, ideas coalescing into a fist of compelling tale-telling, in THE HAPPENING, it comes as quite an irony that ...nothing happens. Here, ""no frame wasted"" means stooping to that *Gilligan's Island* staple of turning on a radio or TV and having it play exactly what is relevant to you at that moment: click on! ""The virus is affecting the northern part of the state-"" click off! His foreshadowing and otherwise spectacular eye for detail comes to no fruition in this banal and obvious film. Not that I am one of those screechy Night detractors puling for ""The Twist"" in every movie he cooks up, no  I look for Night's ingenuity in the weaving of his tales. Here, his film-making ingenuity is egregiously stultified by lack of actors.<br/><br/>Night also over-reached with his self-referential slogan: ""We've Sensed It. We've Seen the Signs. NowIt's Happening."" (They've just replaced tacky in the dictionary with this tagline.) One marvelous device is the ABSENCE of sound during scenes of monstrous violence  two boys get shot point-blank and the audio is totally removed for just those murderous seconds. There is gore galore, as if Night threw up his hands and figured that if they were gonna hate my movie after all this effort, I might as well show a guy's arms torn off by lions and skyscraper workers in deadfall onto concrete.<br/><br/>The tepid love story was inserted sideways into the plot to please some Screen writing 101 exec who wanted character arc for the sole purpose of adhering to Movie Rule Character Arc. Marky's and Zooey's estrangement and subsequent reconciliation serves no purpose whatsoever, except to make us cringe every time Zooey bugs her eyes at Marky, and Marky blandly flaps his mouth at Zooey. A mood ring on his finger inexplicably keeps changing colors, even though Marky only displays one emotion throughout the film (see page 7).<br/><br/>One of the movie's many catch-phrases ""There are forces at work beyond our understanding,"" describes how Marky's and Zooey's casting agencies got past Night's defenses."

It is creepy and some of the death scenes were good. However, the movie seemed anti-climatic to me. It took the story which could have made a great suspense film and went nowhere with it.<br/><br/>The acting held some problems too. No one seemed committed to the part. It felt like the whole cast had taken sleeping pills. Everyone just seemed too calm for the situation that the film presented. and the last 14 minutes just did not seem right. Also this is the second time that Zooey has played a character that shows no emotion and keeps the same dazed blank look on her face.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was not bad, but it was not really good. It just was a good idea with way too many flaws to make it"

","The Happening tells the tale of a phenomenon sweeping the country, in which people are killing themselves for no reason at all. At first people believe it to be a terrorist attack and they flee to the country side in hopes for safety. Unfortunately it's not terrorists, but something worse, something that cannot be explained, or escaped.<br/><br/>Every time M. Night comes out with a new film, I get a little interested. Not full blown, I don't go opening night waiting to see a masterpiece, but I do respect the guy because he knows what he's doing. I think he's had the unfortunate task of being pegged as 'one of those film makers'. If you go see a Kevin Smith movie, you know you're in for dick and fart jokes, you go see a Tarantino film, you know you're getting into something violent. With M. Night, everyone expects a twist. When the film doesn't end with one, people groan, and if it does, it doesn't match his previous effort. It seems he can't get a break. Well, The Happening isn't going to help his case either.<br/><br/>First problem is the script. While the idea is great and could potentially work, it has to many problems that throw the main interest aside. First, the characters, which coincidentally ties in with the acting. Mark Wahlberg I have no problems with usually. He always seems to have a soft spoken voice in every role, sometimes it works (Boogie Nights) sometimes it doesn't (The Big Hit). Here it goes totally wrong. He just doesn't come off as believable. Not once did he ever seem like he was really scared, not once did I ever take him for a teacher, and not once did I ever believe he was with Deschanel. These two characters never really engage the audience into their lives, I found myself not caring if they made it out alive or not. The random subplot with the guy calling her on the phone never flourishes into anything for the two, never causes and real drama or problems and ends up being a distraction and waste of time. The most interesting character in the film cuts his own wrists early in the movie.<br/><br/>Second, the script never offers us any real scares. This ties in with the way M. Night directed this feature. Most of his films deal with tension, he builds it up and takes the audience on a ride. Here he misses the mark completely. The most 'tense' moment is laughable, the try to outrun the wind. There is no real threat here. Had this event made people kill others, then we would have some tension on our hands, but the entire premise if that people kill themselves. I think M. Night tried to scare his audience with the fact that they could not see the enemy, this is a failure.<br/><br/>The film was marketed as M. Night's first R rated film. One gets the impression that it could be pretty gruesome. Yet it is held back. A lawnmower scene that should send shivers down peoples spines is ruined by fake CG blood spray. In that same shot a sign is the background that reads 'You Deserve It"" and I can't help but get the feeling that M. Night was never trying to scare us in the first place, but teach us a life lesson. Be kind to plants? This shot was too on the nose to be a simple wink in that direction. Maybe this is why the film doesn't work, M. Night isn't trying to scare us at all, well congratulations for suckering an audience into seeing something that turned out to be something completely different. It's the village all over again.<br/><br/>The Happening is an unfortunate mess. M. Night had some decent ideas and great shots (I still love the workers falling off the building shot) but nothing to tie everything together. The film suffers from a lazy script that can't bring the good ideas to the surface and mismatched casting. It's looks like M. Night is even now, 3/6 in terms of his films in quality. It's a shame that those 3 that aren't good are his latest ones. It's hard to tell is he will get out his this hole he has dug himself. If he will continue a career a become an actual film maker worthy of discussion years from now, or one of those one hit wonders who burned all their gas too quickly. If The Happening is a sign of where things are going....then there are dark times ahead."
"sspecter","5","0","3","25 June 2008"," An average catastrophe movie...
","First let me tell you the resume of the film: As it was exhaustively told here, the movie is about a strange event which is causing people from a large area of the United States to kill themselves. First is though to be an terrorist attack, then the possibility is discarded as the deaths escalates. Meanwhile an average science teacher and his wife try to survive in the middle of the event.<br/><br/>Although the premise is interesting, and a weird and horrific beginning get your full attention, the movie quickly crash and burn since Mark Wahlberg start acting on the screen. And move hill down until the end, due to Mark Wahlberg's awful and childish acting and Night Shyamalan's very bad directing and speech lines.<br/><br/>BUT people saying here this film is the worst ever is clearly lying, perhaps to disappointment due to high expectations of the movie or by comparing it with Shyamalan's master piece: 6th Sense. I can quickly think of dozens of movies clearly worse than this one.<br/><br/>The movie isn't all bad: The story is somewhat original, and it properly place a dreadful feeling that any protagonist can die at any moment. The tension is all there. The score is wonderful, and properly sets the tense mood among with the properly gruesome deaths the movie depicts.<br/><br/>To resume, here are the Bads and Goods of the movie: <br/><br/>## Bads: <br/><br/><ul><li>Marky Mark's acting. I mean... seriously!!! How can someone think this moronic acting is a good thing? I don't mean he can't act, he just can't act a non-action, non-cold-or-aggressive character. Elliot Moore was supposed to be a tender and frightened average guy, thing Mark Wahlberg failed miserably to do. This show us Mark Wahlberg is just a one-role actor, and Shyamalan is a very bad producer for casting him for this role. It is worth notice many lesser actors in the movie acted infinitely better than him, like the construction guy at the beginning, and even the frightened soldier, showing us it IS possible to do act despise Shyamalan's bad direction. But Mark Wahlberg fail that and show us some of the worst acting an Oscar-nominated ever did in the whole movies history. It is worth notice the same bad acting can be seen with all movies where Mark Wahlberg is supposed to play a nice guy, like the movie good-assassin-guy The Big Hit.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Zooey Deschanel's disturbing acting. Watching her I just wondered what was wrong with Alma, and wondered the whole movie if she was under the influence of the toxin or some other drug. It turned out she wasn't, and her odd behavior was just there because of Zooey Deschanel's bad acting, bad speech lines, and Shyamalan awful production and direction.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crazy characters! I mean, they are all crazy! And I am not saying about the toxin-demented characters. Few act as a normal person in a catastrophic event. The creepy man talking with his flowers, the creepy Alma emotionlessly looking at her phone vibrating, the crazy Elliot crying like a retarded baby for time instead of freaking out and running away from the other group, and of course, the creepy old woman that is just there for the sake of being creepy. It show us how horrible is character development and speech lines in Shyamalan's script.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lousy science. plants communicating with themselves? Toxins quickly devised to eradicate mankind? Plants able to sense crowds of people? I usually don't have much problem with suspension-of-reality, but too many lousy science is a bit over-the-top.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>DEUS-EX-MACHINA ending. The protagonist goes to the wind and suddenly all is all right.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No climate built in. Shyamalan throw all the movie plot still in the beginning, when some horticulturist's crazy and silly theory turn out to be right. the plot is just spit at the audience. And so is the confirmation, and the imbecile explanations from the TV at the end of the movie. Too bad Shyamalan lost his touch to build tension, like he did in 6th sense, the Vile or Signals.</li></ul><br/><br/>## Now the good parts: <br/><br/><ul><li>Great and original premise. Shyamalan's works have a unique touch of wonder we rarely see in movies today (even in fantasy movies), and it is too refreshing. It is as wonderful as terrifying. Besides Shyamalan, few works accomplish this, like Del Toro's Faun's Labyrinth.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great story - Properly gore deaths, required to build the dreadful tension of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great cinematography.</li></ul><br/><br/>## Conclusion<br/><br/>The movie had potential. But Shyamalan's incompetence to direct and develop normal characters (in a non-crazy way), amongside Mark Wahlberg's poor and childish acting, blew the film. However, many elements of the story where good enough to barely hold it altogether. In the end, The Happening is a fun-to-watch average film.<br/><br/>## side note<br/><br/>If you want a really good catastrophic sci-fi-horror movie, I suggest watching Stephen King's The Mist instead. It is creepier, better directed, and better acted."
"barrys82","6","0","3","25 June 2008"," Not what I was expecting
","The Happening is M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie. A film that pretends to make conscience that we must take care of our planet, without achieving it. It is supposed to be a suspense movie but frankly I didn't feel it. The story about a family on the run from a natural crisis that presents a large-scale threat to humanity seems to be very interesting and original but very bad developed, what I mean is that the movie begins directly from the conflict, there's never an introduction and there's no closure or conclusion either, it ends exactly the way it begins. The cast is very good but their performances lack of intensity. Mark Wahlberg I a good actor but in this movie wasn't good at all, he tries to be funny in some scenes but he just can't do it. Zooey Deschanel, she is pretty but I feel her acting just plain and empty and John Leguizamo well maybe he was the best one. Maybe the only good thing in the movie was the music, it just makes you feel a little bit of tension and mystery In conclusion, I feel a little disappointed and if you want to watch it, you better wait for the DVD."
"jimmiehack","5","0","3","25 June 2008"," Disappointing
","I usually love Shyamalan's movies and I was looking forward to this one. He usually has such great plot twists that they're hard to figure out. This was a simple straightforward movie with every moment being predictable. Wahlberg was stone-faced and unemotional the whole time while people around him were dying. So much of this film was unbelievable people started laughing in the theater. Seriously, if people in Manhattan really thought they were being attacked by terrorists, there would be mass hysteria and people running like crazy through the streets. Everyone was slowly walking and didn't seem urgent about anything at all. Hope he does better next time."
"JimmyZappa","6","0","4","22 June 2008"," An M. Night Shyamalan Retrospective
","To start off, i've seen every movie of his in theaters starting with the Sixth Sense. And I liked it. It was suspenseful, it was clever, it was unique. It brought the tough as nails Bruce Willis in a new light and introduced us to Haley Joel Osment, who had a short lived career with A.I., Pay It Forward, and Kingdom Hearts shortly after this film. Plus, to me anyway, the twist was unexpected and made an impact with my developing mind. Unbreakable was the next effort. With Bruce returning and Sam Jackson in the cast, coupled with an intriguing story, it was another hit. I was put off at first and didn't like the style of directing for this movie, but over time it grew on me. Eventually I would grow to appreciate Shyamalan's style no matter what movie it was.<br/><br/>Signs was the first mixed reaction. Though I liked it, it wasn't as enjoyable as the first two efforts. The twist was ridiculous and most of the movie gave me a headache thanks to the unusual camera work. Despite the shortcomings, I enjoyed myself. The Village sunk in a deeper hole. I wasn't impressed with the ending and I felt cheated when the main attraction...well, it just didn't do it for me. The writing and character development was starting to fail, I was tilting my head in confusion.<br/><br/>Then Lady in the Water came in. While it did have its moments, I finally felt cheated. That movie went nowhere, many promising moments were butchered or not realized. I wanted to like it, since it was a Shyamalan movie, but it didn't happen. I ended up making fun of it with my friends, with many of the audience laughing along since they were obviously bored with the film. If Shyamalan was there in the same theater with us, he'd probably hang in head in embarrassment and shame, maybe even tear up. I would've if I was in his position.<br/><br/>Now it's time to talk about the Happening. Like Village and Lady in the Water, it doesn't help revitalize Shyamalan's reputation. The characters, some of the dialogue, the pacing, the main threat, the ending...very poor. The very concept and the trailers promoting the movie made this look like the next big disaster movie, I was expecting it to be filled with some intense gore and strong suspense elements. As you might expect, especially if you read other reviews, it didn't deliver. In fact it probably was damaged by customs, lost in the mail, or ""returned to sender"".<br/><br/>However, most of the reviews i've read were just that: only negative. If you also noticed I gave this film 6/10 stars. How so, if I think some of the elements I mentioned were so poor? Simply put, Shyamalan still knows how to play with the element of suspense. No other modern director I can think of can make me feel nervous during seemingly normal scenes and jump during others. While I was told the film starts to fail around 30 minutes into it, I found it got better. The main silly plot device was actually starting to scare and startle me. That aspect of his directing is as masterful as ever, he didn't lose that ability at all. The fault has mostly to do with the writing. There are some funny moments and clever bits, but most of the script was pretty awful. Lines like ""This is a small town. Nothing bad happens in small towns."" really wreck the film. I think it's about time Shyamalan allowed another writer to assist him writing his scripts from now on, if his own ego doesn't get in the way that is. And the people in charge in producing really NEED to act on their role some more. It's proved the talent is still there, but since the Sixth Sense he's been full of himself and started thinking he can handle every movie single handedly. Sadly, this delusion has to diminish.<br/><br/>Some scenes, especially in the beginning, were poorly directed as well. It's possible Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo were miscast, with Zooey Daschanel giving a pretty unenthusiastic performance to boot. Not much effort was put into the acting, and I blame the director for that. The actors (and actress) I just named are exceptional in other movies, but they just didn't show it in this movie. While it did get better as the movie went on, I couldn't help but think that more parts could've been added or altered to help make the movie surpass greatness. The gore factor really disappointed me, as it was advertised as the first ""R"" rated film from the director. I'll go ahead and admit I like Hostel, Saw, and even the knockoff Turistas for what they were. I'm impressed how the gore in the first two movies mentioned raised the bar for horror/suspense films. That said, Happening should've been right up with them. The scenes in question should've been more violent and shocking, in my opinion. I couldn't help but notice how fake and ""ho-hum"" certain scenes were, the most suspenseful scenes didn't involve gore at all. Maybe that's a good thing for some, but I would've preferred to have seen the horrors taken place among all individuals (men, women, and children alike). The impact would've been great if it did. Maybe i'm just a gore junkie, but I know you'll be disappointed by the scenes i'm talking about unless you're one of the extremely queasy types.<br/><br/>In short, if the film's script and story was severely tweaked some more, the directing (this includes acting) was more refined in certain parts, and the ""selling point"" was more shocking and frequent, it would've been the best effort by Shyamalan since Unbreakable. Unfortunately, it's nothing more than a half-done outline of a potentially promising film. A promising film we will never get to see."

","The Sixth Sense was a fabulous film, but disappointingly, M. Night Shyamalan appears to be a one-hit wonder. Unbreakable should have been entitled Unwatchable and Signs was a true indication that M. Night has had his day. It was one of only two films where I actually walked out of the theatre (the other was What Lies Beneath, which I have attempted, without success, to try and watch on DVD). His post Sixth Sense movies are, well, stupid and poorly written. I do admire him, though, for being able to pull a snow job on Hollywood in the midst of all this summer heat.

It had all the suspense and mystery of a pure fairytale and i never spent my time breaking everything down and analysing it piece by piece. Stop overthinking your movies or you'll never be satisfied.

The Sixth Sense was one of my all time favorite films and I liked Unbreakable, greatly liked Signs, The Village was good and the Lady in the Water was watchable but I have to say that The Happening was ruined by my seeing all the previews put out ahead of it. Too much of the film is given away. I like Mark Whalberg in tough guy roles but not cast in this movie. A sensitive family guy type would have been a better choice. Zooey cast as his wife was also wrong for me because I think of her in upbeat comedy and/or romance and not the sorrowful, bewildered wife character that this movie called for. The ""Happening"" is explained and believable but I think because we are expecting something much more complex... simple gives rise to the other reviewers saying they stopped taking the film seriously.<br/><br/>Next time I'd say get the right actors to portray the right mood and keep the highlights from all the advertising."

In a matter of minutes, episodes of strange, chilling deaths that defy reason and boggle the mind in their shocking destructiveness, erupt in major American cities. What is causing this sudden, total breakdown of human behavior? Is it some kind of new terrorist attack, an experiment gone wrong, a diabolical toxic weapon, an out-of-control virus? Is it being transmitted by air, by water.. how? For Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) what matters most is finding a way to escape the mysterious and deadly phenomenon. Though he and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) are in the midst of a marital crisis, they hit the road, first by train, then by car, with Elliot's math teacher friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and his 8 year-old daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), heading for the Pennsylvania farmlands where they hope they'll be out of reach of the grisly, ever-growing attacks. Yet it soon becomes clear that no oneand nowhereis safe. This terrifying, invisible killer cannot be outrun. It is only when Elliot begins to discover the true nature of what is lurking out thereand just what has unleashed this force that threatens the future of humanitythat he discovers a sliver of hope that his fragile family might be able to escape what is happening. A very unstable movie that keeps on not promising excitement.The Happening 5/10"

Okay, that doesn't sound so hot. But there's always Zooey Deschanel, pale and gorgeous, like a really pretty ghost. I first noticed her in ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", thoroughly enjoyed her performance as Sarah Jessica Parker's quirky sidekick in ""Failure to Launch"", and totally adored her in ""The Go-Getter"". This time round, it's the short scene in which she takes the pregnancy that makes the movie. And this is when you think the credits are about to roll. If I were her, I'd put it on my show reel.

I never go to a movie with high expectations anyways.I will admit this movie didn't have the greatest script but it did have some nice visuals and some disturbing and creepy scenes.One scene that creep ed me out was when the one group of people trying to escape came across a bunch of dead bodies hanging off telephone pulls or trees or something like that.It was so startling because it seemed so real,and the loud sudden eerie background music made you jump. I didn't like the b-rated sounding score in the first part of the film,it was horrible.The acting by most was OK but not great. Zooey Deschanel who played Alma Moore was awful! She was very stale and showed no emotion or reaction to anything and was very uninteresting.She is the reason I can't give this movie a higher rating.She had no chemistry with any of the other actors,and at times seemed like she couldn't deliver her lines.Just because she was born into a show biz family doesn't mean she has any talent,it just means she has an advantage.Mark Wahlberg who played her husband Elliot and Ashlyn Sanchez who played the little girl Jess were great, and they worked well together.The scene with Betty Buckley as the crazy old woman was a little strange but added excitement.And her demise was very unexpected.As for the plot, there were some that thought the Government was involved in what happened to the North East section of the U.S. in the movie while others thought the villain was an angry Mother Nature who decides to wreak havoc on large groups of humans by spreading a deadly plant toxin that makes people commit suicide whenever the wind shifts.The story may be a bit over the top and not very believable, but it was a fun movie for me to watch.It reminded me of a long episode of the Twilight Zone."

","I should probably start off by saying that I'm not particularly an M. Night Shyamalan fan. I've seen every movie of his but ""Unbreakable"". But I do enjoy his movies, if that makes any sense. In fact, ""Lady In the Water"" is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Here's my review of ""The Happening"":<br/><br/>I think it might have been an exceptional film if it weren't for the acting. The acting totally killed it, and a lot of the dialogue was really ridiculous as well. I read a review of this the other day that made a comment I agree with completely: M. Night Shyamalan should stop directing his own scripts. <br/><br/>The story line... I found it to be interesting. It's an interesting thought. Sort of a tired topic, as of late (Humans reaping what we've sown as far as how we've treated the environment), but it was still such a bizarre spin that I was able to forgive it. Whether or not it's plausible, it made sense. (Can I just say that my favorite thing in this movie was the subdivision billboard with the sideboard that said ""You Deserve This"". Thanks a heap, Night. ;-])<br/><br/>I would urge you to wait until this is on video or on television to watch this. With acting this bad, and gas prices so high, it's really not even worth driving to the theater.

","The underlying premise is the reason you should appreciate this film. Reminiscent of 50's sci-fi kitsch (with a trace of zombie horror), character driven and not burdened with visual effects, The Happening is a story of nature gone horribly awry, raising the question of human survival. Yes, discriminating viewers will question acting and direction (maybe even wishing for a different cast), but in spite of an apparently rushed creation, the film does have a genuine and vital subtext. Though some will not believe it prescient or even agreeable, many will find strong resonance and familiar touchstones: Exponential growth is something that people do not innately grasp. Reproductive freedom is taken for granted. That nature will continue unchanged and is here for our benefit, has been assumed. What if everyone were engaged in self annihilating behaviors without comprehending? When I attended, a portion of the audience applauded after.

","It is at once strangely poetic and ironic that one of our perceived ""master filmmakers"" would commit career suicide with a movie that so prominently features character suicide. Never have we witnessed such a glorious swan dive into the cold concrete of director jail from a modern filmmaker. Like the construction workers leaping off the building to their deaths in the opening minutes of 'The Happening', Shyamalan's fall from grace has been as equally swift and as oddly captivating. <br/><br/>'The Happening' is an absolute mess: A thriller that is neither scary nor thrilling. It is a drama that contains more (unintentional) laughs than most summer comedies. The acting is some of the worst ever witnessed in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Zooey Deschanel was particularly offensive in a role as Mark Wahlberg's estranged wife, in a performance that I can only describe as career ending. Cringe worthy dialogue pollutes the air in every single scene, making one wonder if it was indeed the plants releasing deadly toxins, or merely the characters dying from their own inane vocalizations. The film lost steam in the early minutes, and to no ones surprise, DID NOT gain it back with the thrilling ""outrun the wind"" chase sequence. One feels kind of silly writing that sarcastically - how did it make it into an actual film? One answer: M. Night Shyamalan has officially lost touch. He has gone the way of so many powerful and influential artists before him  he has risen to a place where his peers are afraid to tell him ""no, actually that doesn't make sense"" or ""this story needs work"" or ""are you out of your mind?!"" It is both painful and pleasurable to witness the clearly talented, if not horrifically insecure 'master of suspense' hit rock bottom.

"ecwaenigma","4","0","3","16 June 2008"," Great director, terrible film.
","I refuse to write a synopsis of the film in my comments as, if you are reading about this film, already know what it is about.<br/><br/>First off, I like M. Night. ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", and ""Lady in the Water"" are all excellent movies that are the work of a truly unique voice in American film-making. I've never seen ""The Sixth Sense"", as the ending was ruined for me the day after the film came out and I realized there is no sense in seeing a film that, knowing a huge spoiler like that, would have me watching the movie the whole time thinking ""Of course he's dead, it's obvious."" ""Unbreakable"" is an amazing piece of film-making that is the best comic book movie not based on a comic book (of course, ""Hancock"" isn't out yet...). It's a great story about human beings and the father/son relationship in the movie reminds me of me and my father - he'll always be a superhero to me. ""Signs"" is the best sci-fi - very low tech and character driven. ""The Village"" was entertaining, but I saw the ending a mile away. ""Lady in the Water"" is probably one of the most under-appreciated films in modern cinema. It's going to be like ""Blade Runner"", 10 years from now, people will call it a masterpiece. It's an adult fairy-tale. What's wrong with that?<br/><br/>After seeing the trailers and the R-rating for ""The Happening"", I was excited. Mark Wahlberg is a good young actor, as are Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo. It looked like the apocalyptic thriller I always felt that M. Night had in him. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The first half hour or so of the film are excellent. M. Night knows how to build tension better than most directors out there. He's a great director and this film is directed extremely well. The direction is not the problem here. Wahlberg is terribly miscast. Leguizamo's role could have been played by anyone. The plague is mysterious, but the reason behind it is given about a third of the way into the film and that reason is ludicrous. It seems like Wahlberg's character is talking himself and everyone else in to that theory for the rest of the film. When it is finally revealed at the end of the film that that theory is the actual reason for the plague, my jaw dropped. Where's the twist? Where's the dark tone that an idea like this requires for a coda? The epilogue in Paris is just plain silly.<br/><br/>I did learn a few things from this movie, though. First, I'll never look at a tree the same way again - I'll just point and laugh. Two, maybe living in the desert isn't such a bad idea after all. Or Alaska. And lastly, a great director and a bad script do not make a good match. I love ambiguous films where crazy things happen for no good reason. Nature run amok films especially. Check out ""The Long Weekend"" or ""Who Can Kill a Child?"" instead. Those are horrifying films with similar, and more effective, results. But don't blame poor M. Night. He's just a regular guy who can't hit home runs every time. Maybe he should take his own advice and ""Swing away."" He'll hit another one out of the park eventually. Unfortunately, ""The Happening"" is like grounding out right to the pitcher."

","Interesting story that lacks a sense of real terror.<br/><br/>On the surface this is basic Sci-fi entertainment: some unexplained force wrecks havoc on the masses, and as the characters struggle to survive they also struggle to understand the cause to better enable them to survive. The story, acting, dialogue and filming are all competent.<br/><br/>The way the characters piece together the cause and how the larger groups break down into smaller and smaller factions to survive are interesting to watch.<br/><br/>However, the film never really has the sense of mass panic and chaos that one would expect under such circumstances; WAR OF THE WORLDS provided a better sense of this. In the train station, on the train, at the diner and at the crossroads the characters' actions seem quite restrained, almost subdued. Yet, these are the times when apprehension should peak because once people start dying others in close proximity are beyond saving.<br/><br/>The film just never seems to go far enough like when the characters flee from the diner, they leave but not with the frenzied, reckless sense of urgency that one would expect under such circumstances. As such, the film lacks the sense of realism ."

","OK, This must be a joke and we will see the real movie in a few days. We all will receive a phone call from the places where we went to see this movie to invite us to a free premier of the real movie and this one was only the bad parts of the film.<br/><br/>I am totally disappointed with this. I didn't get it, I was expecting a BIG, HUGE, AWESOME movie and I got this. I was about to LEAVE the place, but the friend I INVITED asked me to stay until it ends. And guess what? When the movie ended EVERYBODY said loudly YEEEEES!! and there were applauses... Maybe because I was the only one who felt betrayed by this movie. I hope you guys get it. Everybody deserves to see it and evaluate their own feelings when it ends, but be ready, buy an energy drink to stay awake and also get ready to be surprised on ""How to throw away a couple millions"", which was in my opinion the real name of the movie. This is my first posting here, if they don't ban me, this won't be the last."

","This movie has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The plot was stupid, the actors...wow, terrible. I'm a fan of Mark Wahlburg's so I definitely don't know what happened in this movie. It's as if the ""toxins"" affected his acting! It was seriously terrible.<br/><br/>I went in to see this movie expecting to be scared. Instead, I was confused, and sleepy. The movie was boring, and never exactly had a ""climax point"". It was predictable and stupid.<br/><br/>Oh and.**SPOILERSSSS**...what a crappy plot! Killer plants??? The plants are mad at the east coast so they kill them off in the craziest of ways?!?!? Wow.<br/><br/>Seriously, I would NOT waste my money seeing this. (Oh wait, I already did.)"

OK, it could do, perhaps...with a smarter script to back it up...but the entire thing just fell a bit flat.<br/><br/>if u want clever, DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (even though it was super old), provided a better plot."
"rob-haworth","5","0","3","15 June 2008"," Very stupid or very clever
","I read a lot of reviews of this film before I went to see it - some good, most bad - but being a Shyamalan fan I prayed that I would enjoy it. When it started, I felt myself agreeing with all the negative reviews. Zooey Deschanel's wide eyes staring at her vibrating phone made me want to hide behind the seat in front of me, it was just so awful.<br/><br/>However, as the film went on, I felt myself drawn into a style of film making that came across as cheesy (I think B movie has been used to describe The Happening), but at the same time strangely engrossing - weird characters, visible boom mikes et all. Before I knew it, the 90 minutes was up, which would suggest a good film as I'm terrible for clock watching in the cinema if the film is bad. You'd think Mark Wahlberg talking to a plastic pot plant could not be defined as good cinema, but for some reason it really sticks in my head as a clever scene. I don't know, perhaps they were releasing plant neurotoxins into the cinema, because I have this desire to see the film again - perhaps only to confirm that the film was indeed awful and I was just imagining things.<br/><br/>There are some very good shocks, and I liked the subtlety behind the many suicides - nothing overly gory, but shot in a way that suitably disturbed. On the other hand, why take a plausible scenario such as plants releasing neurotoxins, and spoil it by suggesting the completely implausible scenario that the plants can also create wind.<br/><br/>My 5 out of 10 rating is simply because I cannot decide if it was very awful or very clever. I would suggest that those of you haven't seen it wait for the DVD release, as I suspect a lot of you will begrudge the cost of your cinema ticket once you have seen The Happening. Myself, I'm going to watch Unbreakable again, if only to confirm that Shyamalan can make a good movie."
"the_jesus_2000","4","0","4","15 June 2008"," Not a disappointing film if you had no expectations like me and a lot of others.
","M. Night Shyamalan makes films that are visually and emotionally interesting.But his films have progressively become less intellectual and increasingly more moronic.""The Happening"" is no different. This film has MANY blaring inconsistencies. One moment you will be genuinely shocked by what you are seeing, perhapses even touched. Then another you will be laughing at the weirdness of the people you meet, the goofy dialog, and the implausible situations that either aren't funny in the way that the filmmakers intended, or are funny unintentionally.<br/><br/>For instance: <br/><br/>-Why does the happening start in parks and stay only in the Northeast? This is never explained. At least well.<br/><br/><ul><li>There is a close up of a chalkboard in Elliot Moor's classroom with a quote from Einstein. ""If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth, man would have no more than four years to live."" This is true, but he never said this. Even ""The Great Debaters"" is guilty of this with the quoting of the erroneous Willy Lynch Speech hoax, but here it just does nothing but waste screen time. What a lack of integrity.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Jillian gives Elliot the statistic that there is a 66.7 % chance his wife is still alive. Where did he come up with that? I don't care if he's a math teacher, its ludicrous; and to leave his child with Alma, a women he clearly doesn't trust, to go off and surely die which intern is depriving her of her father is inexcusable.<br/><br/>-When Elliot comes up with the idea that group size effects the pathogen in the air, we already know that this isn't necessarily the case. The first on screen death, a women stabbing herself in the neck with a hairpin, takes place in a group of two. Also this is stupid because it effects her and not here friend siting right next to her while it is effecting EVERYONE in the park at the same time. Elliot is in a group of 5 when he makes this conclusion. When Julian sub-comes to the happening, he is in a group of five also making the point moot. <br/><br/>-The characters at one point run from wind.<br/><br/>-Elliot latter talks to a plant in a room as if it were alive. He's a science teacher. He's alone. What were they thinking?<br/><br/>-Here is the biggest one of all. Why would a person who's cognitive functions such as memory and reasoning which are being eliminated have the intelligence to think of creative ways to kill themselves like :Untying a knot and pulling out a metal hair pin, getting into a lion cage, unholstering a pistol, slamming your head through a window, and especially turning on a lawnmower and knowing enough to lie down under it so it can kill you, aren't things I can imagine somebody doing who can even think a coherent thought, speak, and occasionally walking backwards for no reason then moving normally. Better yet, why not have the plants produce a gas that just flat out kills everyone. Why? Well, let me answer my own question. Because then it wouldn't be rated R and there would be no way to sell this film which I imagine originally was devoid of gore before the studios told M. Night the thing what boring so he needed blood to grab the audience. How cheap.I can clearly tell that this film's story could have easily done without most of these death scenes, including the opening.By the time you see a man lie down under a driving lawnmower this movie is stooping to slasher movie cliché. Considering Shyamalan professes this film to be some great statement on our effects on our planet and human nature, it surprised me.<br/><br/>I watched this film with a friend on opening day and I could tell the whole audience where treating the film as a B-movie such as I was. We would laugh at all the same inane dialog, the strange behavior of the wife, far-fetched plot, and bizarre character interactions near the end of the film. Also it was so predictable because we have seen so many films like it before. This is such an unoriginal film from the man who is known for making original films. I haven't read or herd this, but my friend told me M. Night Shyamalan was TRYING to make a B-movie with ""The Happening"". I told him that it made perfect sense when you think about it like that. This movie certainly is on the level of a Twilight Zone episode or some 50's end of the world movie. Now, do you think the movie going public WANTS TO SEE a B-movie? If that strategy is going to work, it would have to be something like ""Grindhouse"" or ""Mars Attack"" which makes fun of the genre its in. This film takes itself more seriously then it should have and thats its biggest failure, much like the movie ""Hulk"" which had a similar problem.<br/><br/>I give this movie 4 stars out of 10 because overall I was entertained and enjoyed picking this movie apart, kind of like a MST3K experience. Also, even though the Whole is less then the sum of its parts, it had its moments where It kind of worked for me and made me think about the things I was supposed to think about. If you are an M. Night Shyamalan fan you might like this, but I suspect his original fan base is dwindling so if you stuck with him after ""Lady in the Water"" why not this film? If you want to see a good movie with a similar theme, rent ""The Mist"" on DVD. I've read negative reviews for that said film, but I liked it and openly praise its tone and characters. Also keep in mind, I hate ""The Ring"" because I can't stand its inconsistencies. I can imagine somebody who liked that film likening this one."
"altruist_m","5","0","3","14 June 2008"," When did it 'happen' and when it got over?
","As it happens with most of the movies that promise to deliver and come out short, ""The Happening"" starts out with a great assurance of an intense thriller but when you walk out of the theater you wonder what really ""Happened"" ?<br/><br/>The positives - It gets you right into the plot Without wasting much time and the plot isn't contrived. Although it may seem far-fetched but then there is no denying it may happen or happening even now. It's difficult to keep inventing new ideas of mass killing. There is a minimal amount of blood and gore, the only occasional scene to keep reminding what's happening (Oh that word). That's what was expected, that it wouldn't be like those slasher flicks with gallons of blood and gross-out scenes. It spooks you through silence, through strange acts by normal people without hideous faces. It has a fair amount of shock-treatment. To certain extent, it draws you into the plot. It's thrilling, evocative and original, yes. <br/><br/>Hmm now what's lacking - An occasional jolt of humor is fine, but there is a touch overdose of induced humor, which i didn't expect from Shyamalan. It lets you relax. It lets you cool off. May be he wanted to appeal to greater audience. MNS hasn't let the actors get inside their roles. May be he didn't want to divert from the plot, fair enough. But it doesn't get in depth in the plot too. Although he's captured the usual cliché's of the last dialogs when people sense they are going to die, i didn't find the people terrified enough. Where is the desperation to survive, the urge to hang in there till you are finally dead, the struggle of survival. People are surprisingly calm ! True that it looked like the 'happening' is beyond our grasp, but if you are evacuating a city, wouldn't people scream, crowd at stations, fight to be first ones out, even bribe. Where is the human emotion? Another one was getting the plot to some sort of conclusion, and i won't divulge, but it could have been better. <br/><br/>I can come up with a new idea of mass-murder flick, let's say the planets in our galaxy have formed a unique position and that's caused some electromagnetic flux along with strange gravitational pull that's causing people to die or go insane, animals are acting weird, crops have stopped growing. And it's a nice plot believe me, may be i can sell it to someone. But when i show it on the big screen, i need to make sure i take it to a logical conclusion on how we humans beat this. You got me ? And for God's sake i didn't realize why it was 'Rated R'. <br/><br/>Overall, it isn't a bad movie, it builds up the story, thrills you just enough, gets you into it and suddenly forgets there is an audience still waiting and brings down the curtain."
"kjef","5","0","3","14 June 2008"," Brilliantly mediocre, as only Shyamalan can do it...
","M. Knight Shyamalan takes himself too seriously.<br/><br/>Apparently, M. Knight has come to the understanding that it really doesn't matter what his film is about. As long as his name is on the movie trailer, people will come & see it... all in the hopes of experiencing that sense of awe we all felt when we realized Bruce Willis was actually dead; or that Samuel L. Jackson was actually the comic-book nemesis who caused all those tragedies; or that Ron Howard's blind daughter was actually living in modern day...<br/><br/>Of course, with that hope comes the disappointment that there IS no mind-bending twist... that the aliens attacking the world look just like every other alien movie FX, or that the weird girl in the water is about as interesting as the drain-hair in the bottom of that pool.<br/><br/>Well, to quote one reviewer, The Happening should be titled The Crap-pening. Because it just lays there, stinking, floating-- waiting for someone to flush. But no one ever does.<br/><br/>Lets be honest. It was Shyamalan, so I was tense. The eery pace and ominous music built the perfect mood for a terror-ific payoff that never happened. Instead, The Happening was all about realism-- how would real people respond to such a 'happening'? There was no rioting in the streets. There was no grand battle to determine the victorious species. There was only the helpless hope of a man, as he faced uncertain death... at a less-than-frantic pace.<br/><br/>(***Spoiler Alert***) And while the cinematography was beautiful, and some of Shyamalans storytelling was effective, the story itself was just, plain stupid. The 'parable' (as some have called it) of this movie was that the plants were upset with humans, and were fighting back... SERIOUSLY?!? A global warming/save the planet message?? Give me an Al-Gore break!! And what about all the sub-plots that give a good movie nuance & depth? Oh, that's right. There were none! Instead, we are saddled with cheesy, suicide Special FX (yes, your ficus wants you to kill yourself), and a singular, unwavering story-line that was about as exciting as a Marky Mark & the Funky Bunch reunion tour.<br/><br/>One aspect of this flick that I have enjoyed, however, are the inevitable number of reviewers who explain to the rest of the world that we don't ""get"" M. Knight Shyamalan, because we're not filmmakers or we're too jaded by Hollywood. That may be. But I have yet to read a positive review that can effectively give me any poignant, redeeming quality of this film. Instead, they offer only condescension or rhetoric.<br/><br/>Still, I cannot say that I totally hated this film. Although I left disappointed, I sat through the entire film in eager anticipation and hope, searching frantically for the twist that would pull it all together (""Could it be the mood ring??? The honey bees? Maybe the hot dogs??""). There really was a lot of suspense.<br/><br/>At the very end though, my greatest joy in this film was the realization that, I got punked! I expected twists and turns, but was saddled with pretense and anti-climactic melodrama. And in the face of a public crying out to M. Knight for another ""Sixth Sense"", I can imagine ""anti-climactic"" was what he was going for, in an attempt to prove that he doesn't have to bow to public opinion or demands. He's M. Knight Shyamalan, for crying-out-loud. He can fart on film-stock and people will come to see it.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what ""Happened""..."
"bdinte1","Null","0","4","14 June 2008"," eh...
","While more entertaining than The Village, this may be Shyamalan's worst film so far (perhaps I should mention that I am generally a fan of Mr. Shyamalan's films). There are some mildly startling moments, but mostly, the film is relatively predictable. It's not hard to figure out what's going on before any of the characters mention it, and well before the main characters grasp it. Not to mention, Shyamalan seems to have forgotten how to startle his viewers--you can see most of the shocks coming, and Shyamalan relies heavily on extreme violence to make an impression on the viewer. The acting is often not very believable--and there seems to be something weird going on with Zooey Deschanel's pupils. Plus, a shot is included late in the film in which a boom mic dips very obviously into the shot. Shyamalan also fails to provide any truly substantial explanation for the timing of the end of the 'event'--timing which seems pretty convenient for him as a writer. There's not much of a climax, it just kind of falls off. Finally, while some of Shyamalan's past films certainly seem to have a central message, even a message that is critical of some societal ill, he has now jumped on the bandwagon and taken up the ever-popular and almost cliché environmentalist's mantel."
