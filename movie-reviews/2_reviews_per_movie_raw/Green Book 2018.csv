","A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!"

","This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well."
"taylor_king-890-815491","10","632","746","25 November 2018"," ""Green Book"" is Gold
","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"
"Hitchcoc","10","390","465","19 January 2019"," I Was Captivated
","I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film."
"Lotus-3","9","426","523","18 September 2018"," Greatful to have seen this
","I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. 
 Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. 
 Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken.
Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. 
I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives.
I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward."
"ColoDrz","10","302","391","26 December 2018"," Simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity
","Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley.
Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses.
This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect."
"Art Snob","9","293","385","22 September 2018"," Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner
","Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.<br/><br/>But I couldn't help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it's based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There's definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who's streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That's not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.<br/><br/>The two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen's ""b.s. artist"" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen's performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what's called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he's Danish.<br/><br/>I'm allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I'd say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.<br/><br/>The music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there's always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn't get any better than it gets here - Ali's piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie's ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he's filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali's hands, which should clinch it.)<br/><br/>Top everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.<br/><br/>So congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can't deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does."

"AlsExGal","7","281","414","23 February 2019"," Not to say it isn't a decent movie...
","... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.<br/><br/>Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.<br/><br/>The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??<br/><br/>So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also
shows how simplistic it really is."

It was also great to see comedian Sebastian Maniscalco in this film as well.<br/><br/>Writer, director and producer Peter Farrelly nailed every aspect of this biography.<br/><br/>The score, cinematography, sets and visuals were all on point.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of slow paced long films, but this was was close to an exception.

"MarteParte","9","118","168","15 January 2019"," Respect demands respect
","A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people.
The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious.
While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.<br/><br/>The story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.<br/><br/>While the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded.
The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important."
"BassLightyear","7","58","79","26 February 2019"," A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.
","I understad why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).<br/><br/>There are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn't a target of it. But that's obviously a big no-no according to these critics.<br/><br/>To me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he'd been condition to abide to his whole life."
"mhope-91601","10","144","210","24 November 2018"," Best example of the power of cinema
","Who could've ever greenlit ""Green Book""? A (mostly) true story of two men of completely different backgrounds overcoming their own prejudices and the stifling racism of the Deep South of the early 1960s. We'll hire a Danish guy to play an Italian guy, and a guy best known for playing a political fixer and a dope dealer (in ""House of Cards"" and ""Moonlight"", respectively) to play a Jamaican-American musical genius. And we'll have one of the Farrelly brothers direct it. How could that possibly become a great movie? Well, it does- primarily through the great performances of Viggo Jorgensen and Mahershala Ali, and the nuanced directing of Peter Farrelly. It confronts the racism prevalent at the time without becoming preachy, and shows its main characters growing through contact with each other, without a complete reversal of their characters (which would've seemed phony). Oh, and the movie looks great, too- the period cars, sets, and costumes really take you back to that time period. A film festival favorite, ""Green Book"" will hopefully be appreciated by Oscar voters, too."

It is nuanced and impressive.<br/><br/>Watching these two characters interact and change each other is fascinating. This isn't just another road-trip buddy movie.

","Right off the bat I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.the cinematography was beautiful with such rich color pallets. The score was wonderful and set the tone very well. Lastly the acting was incredible. Viggo and Ali shined in their roles and did a great job at portraying their characters.<br/><br/>That said, in my mind the movie was nothing special. It was all very predictable and had a very similar feel to many other civil rights movies in which a black man and a white man start off the movie with a reluctant relationship and slowly warm up to each other as they begin to appreciate their similarities and eachothers troubles and eventually defy all social norms and become good friends. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have become friends because you can't rewrite history and this movie was based on a true story. I just wish that story telling was a bit more ambitious and delved into some of the ideas deeper rather thank making a well made but otherwise mediocre civil rights movie."

","If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.<br/><br/>It's a movie about how two mismatched people, (a chain-smoking, rough speaking Italian-American and an African-American you might even call 'uppity'), who, on a long road trip in the Deep South in the early sixties, bestow on each other the gifts of friendship and humanity. Even if you knew nothing of the 'true' story of the musician Don Shirley and his driver you can predict the outcome from the get-go. Of course, it also helps that it's also very funny despite the seriousness of the material and that leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are so damn good, (Ali's second Oscar in three years looks like it's already in the bag). It is, then, something of a treat and might even convince you to seek out the music of Don Shirley."

"OtherShipwrecks","4","260","528","30 January 2019"," The Pinnacle of Respectability Politics, Reactionary Myths, and Bourgeois Humanism
","There is nothing new in Green Book. The same story has been told many times by the Hollywood propaganda machine - improbable interracial friendships where the black man has to do all the emotional heavylifting in order to make our white protagonist slightly less racist. This ""friendship"" is ultimately portrayed as a mutual exchange of perspectives, where both sides manage to find common grounds with each other and come to understand their shared humanity.<br/><br/>This is the archetype of the liberal humanist narrative, where power structures are conveniently ignored, and where political oppression and economic exploitation is reframed as nothing more than differences in culture and perspectives. As a result, according to this ideological narrative, the purpose of (liberal democratic) politics is reconciliation and compromise, as opposed to struggling for emancipation. The problems of structural violence and economic exploitation is reframed as individual prejudice and actions, which can be changed by respectability politics (""they go low, we go high"") and this bland humanist appeal to the oppressor's conscience.<br/><br/>This is the deeply ideological narrative of Green Book and countless other stories, from Driving Miss Daisy (1989) to The Green Mile (1999) to Gran Torino (2008) to The Help (2011), where the real problem - the irreducibly structural problem - is always erased in favor of a feel-good humanist drama that appeals primarily to middle-class white guilt. Year after year, middle-class white audience can walk out of these Hollywood films with a smug face, complacently declaring that they're glad that ""racism is finally over.""<br/><br/>Many people defend this film by saying that there's nothing inherently wrong with a comedic and light-hearted approach to serious social and historical problems. What they're saying is not wrong. In fact, some of the greatest works of cinema (and art in general) is about people finding humor and spirit in extreme positions of subjugation and poverty. Yet these artworks depict poverty and oppression with acute social awareness and compassion, instead of flattening them into bland archetypes or straight-up ignoring them, which is what Green Book is guilty of.<br/><br/>Here we have two characters - an educated upper-class black man who is completely isolated from the culture and social conditions of his people, and a racist working-class white man who is portrayed as a misguided good-hearted person. The class dimension is never explicitly challenged or fully confronted, especially Don's bourgeois sensibility. Instead, the film focuses on how the two can learn from each other and become better persons - Don becoming more down-to-earth and in touch with black popular music, and Tony becoming less racist. Yet the film never backs down from its pedagogy of respectability politics and never challenges its narrative of black exceptionalism. What does the film ultimately show about Don and Tony's friendship? It shows that only an exceptional, upper-class, respectable, talented black man can change the racist attitude of a white working-class man, and the film invites the audience to participate in its complacency, its classism, and its outrageous reductionism.<br/><br/>The problem is not the humorous approach, but the absolutely reactionary myths about racism and racists that are perpetuated in this film, and the bourgeois complacency that this film engenders, which does nothing but reinforce the continued whitewashing and cooptation of the civil rights strategy, and the perpetuation of assimilationism, respectability politics, and reconciliationism."
"finebeanies","3","153","305","23 January 2019"," Predictable, full of clichés and overly simplistic
","I had high expectations based on the positive reviews but was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>The story had a good potential to explore a relationship between a sophisticated black pianist who employs a white working class driver as they travel through the US south in the sixties. They have seemingly nothing in common, from the way they were brought up, the way they speak and eat, their family backgrounds and financial situations, their way of treating other people. As they spend time together on the road trip, they start to appreciate each other and learn from each other.<br/><br/>What bothered me was that the characters ended up being caricatures instead of being believable. The film tries to depict their differences to the point that it did not make sense. For example, we are supposed to believe that a black musical genius pianist never heard of Aretha Franklin or Little Richard? Or that he never tried fried chicken? I also thought that Viggo Mortensen was slightly over-acting.... The racial problems were not depicted in an authentic way.<br/><br/>The movie just received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, likely because of the social commentary and not because of great film-making."

","It's frightening to think how far we came (past tense) and how far we've regressed when it comes to something like social equality. Many people would agree that Western, perhaps even Global culture has been regressing when it comes to acceptance and racial relations.<br/><br/>To say that Green Book, a story about racial relations and acceptance (or lack thereof) is strangely topical, is also an oversimplification. What might be more strange however, isn't the timing of the film's release, or the fact that a story taking place in early 1960's America is contemporary, is the fact that the latest cinematic voice, the newest artist to reintroduce concepts like love and acceptance (concepts Mortensen said are ""lost track of a lot these days"" in the Q & A session after my TIFF screening of the film) ...is Peter Farrelly. Yes, that Peter Farrelly; the one who countless times teamed up with his brother to bring us trendy comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber, Me Myself & Irene, and There's Something About Mary.<br/><br/>Green Book follows the story of a working class Italian-American, Tony Lip (Viggo Moretensen) who, after losing work as a bouncer, finds himself working for Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American classical pianist on tour through the deep South of 1960's America. The two are the archetypal odd-couple, with Dr. Shirley being scholarly, fastidious and composed and Tony being what would seem to be an Italian-American cinematic stereotype; tough, loud, and brash.<br/><br/>While we may not associate either of the Farrelly brothers with drama, audiences lately haven't associated them with comedy either. Recent releases such as Dumb & Dumber To, The Three Stooges, Hall Pass, even as far back as Fever Pitch had neither audiences nor critics waiting for the next Farrelly project. That changed for me personally when I discovered Green Book, and discovered that not only is Peter turning to more dramatic subject matter, but that his brother isn't a part of the project at all. <br/><br/>""My answer was always 'when it happens'. I never planned what was going to be next, it was just a thing the universe brought you, dropped in your lap, it would be like planning when you're going to fall in love, you never know when it's going to happen"" Farrelly told the audience at TIFF that he didn't actively seek out this project, it came up very organically, and that when he heard co-writer Brian Hayes Currie talk about the film, he knew it was a 'home-run' idea.<br/><br/>He might be right. About everything. The fact that this idea came his way and just felt, the timing, his background; this film would not be the same without Farrelly's approach. That may seem self-explanatory, but what I'm addressing is the fact that this film needed the touch of a comedic filmmaker, or at least this specific comedic filmmaker. Within he and his brothers' specific niche of comedy, there was something that was always enjoyable about it, even if the comedy itself, was not. They knew about human connection. <br/><br/>The Farrelly brothers always, without fail, had a shmaltzy moment of love, one way or another. Even when dealing with Lloyd and Harry in Dumb & Dumber, when dealing with caricatures of human beings, there is a bond there, there is a love. So imagine if suddenly Peter Farrelly starting taking things seriously? When a filmmaker understands sentiment and human connection, then it's not such a stretch to make the jump to drama.<br/><br/>Farrelly's influence on the mood of the film is fairly obvious. He's never been a subtle filmmaker, and the film does lack significant drama. After my viewing of the film I wouldn't even categorize it as a drama, because, while there may be hurdles the characters have to overcome, it seems to be a very light-hearted story. Arguably, the most lighthearted version of an extremely heavy subject matter. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop, dramatically speaking, but nothing too heavy ever came. Every time there is something even remotely dramatic, the two characters get out of it with relative ease. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but some might see this as too lighthearted, and not truly dealing with the reality of racial segregation and prejudice. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, as it's the tone of the film all three writers and Farrelly were going for, but considering the subject matter, this may actually anger audience members. The title Green Book refers to a 'travel guide' of sorts for African-Americans of that time. Realistically though, it was more of a 'survival-guide', as it informed those families where it was safe to travel, what restaurants they were permitted to eat in, and the 'colored only' locations to lodge. For many families, the Green Book has significant personal meaning.<br/><br/>What I am suggesting, is that is merely subtext, despite what they chose to be the title. The story is really about our shared humanity despite differences, and while these characters do reinforce some stereotypes, it shatters others. Mahershala and Mortensen create characters that are part caricature, part inspiration, but regardless of how you view them, it works. The two are so well-balanced, it's difficult to say if either of them is truly the lead. That's of the utmost importance, as this unlikely friendship is what inspired the film and drives the story.<br/><br/>I never feel like I am watching Mahershala Ali acting, as... to be honest... I don't really know who Mahershala Ali is. (That is a testament to his acting, not a comment on the fact he and I don't hang out in the same social circles). However, his role as Dr. Shirley is drastically different than anything I've seen him do before. His sense of who the character is, his mannerisms, his diction, even his inner thought process become clear through Ali's performance. Since this is a more comedic film in tone, I have to also compliment Ali's sense of timing. The character is reserved for the majority of the film, and being a straight man in a comedic duo is not easy, but Ali finds a brilliant balance of drama and comedy. It's another performance, that while perhaps not award worthy, he will assuredly be remembered for. <br/><br/>Green Book will also be remembered. The balance it finds within small sub-genres of cinema is carefully crafted; part road-trip buddy movie, part period piece, part social commentary, but all enjoyable. It may not spark serious conversation between audience members. It certainly won't solve the social inequality and hatred that plagues many parts of the world still to this day. It does, however, serve as a reminder of the core concepts it successfully portrays. Mortensen when addressing the crowd put it best: ""There's something very profound there that we lose track of. These days, we lose track of it a lot. And that is anybody has the right to understand or appreciate other people... you can respect each other ...you can listen to each other.""<br/><br/>So if you'll indulge Mortensen's teachings, listen to me... go see Green Book."

","The premise of Green Book certainly sounds intriguing, but this film adaptation is bland as can be. The acting is good overall, but the direction is perfunctory at best - Peter Farrelly's approach seems both heavy-handed and simplistic. It doesn't help that the story favors the less interesting of the two lead characters - it would really have been nice to learn more about Don Shirley. And more about the actual Green Book, which gets barely a mention in the screenplay despite the impression the film's title gives that it's an important element of the plot.<br/><br/>The overall result feels like a by-the-numbers exercise, designed to make a potentially thorny subject palatable for the mainstream. It's mildly thought-provoking in a few spots and mildly entertaining in a few others, but it contains virtually no surprises of any kind, and it ultimately doesn't illuminate much. I didn't hate Green Book, but I am frankly mystified by the number of awards and accolades it has received. I found it to be a thoroughly unremarkable movie."
"Fella_shibby","10","40","73","30 December 2018"," The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar.
","This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal."

","The film, from which at first did not expect delight. The film, behind the ease of irony which hides a deep meaning. A film that you watch without stopping, although this is far from a blockbuster that you have been waiting for for years. It's all about Peter Farinelli's Green Book.<br/><br/>The plot tells of a journey through the southern states of a talented black pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his bouncer driver, hired solely for this tour (Viggo Mortenessen). Minor at first sight and a little bydlovaty hero Mortensen during this uncomplicated journey becomes for an esthete pianist a true friend, support and even a treasure of useful knowledge about life and society, and he draws from the boss useful skills in aesthetics, love of art and good parenting.<br/><br/>
The plot is very simple, the film looks incredibly easy. Dialogues are written ironically, absolutely not boring, but at the same time they remain filled with meaning for the viewer. The relationship between the characters is the main motive of the film. And how could so different people in all respects be able to become each other friends for life in a few weeks?<br/><br/>It should be noted that the leitmotif of 'racism', which at that time was still extremely common in America, especially in the south, was incredibly subtly written. All these hotels are for 'colored', individual cafes, pools and even latrines .. the nuances of that time in the film are shown perfectly, and so that you yourself feel ashamed that this existed. I literally wanted to stand up and give the characters in the face in several scenes.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the director Peter Farinelli had previously shot mostly comedies (and mostly with his brother), and this is his first film in the comedy drama genre. From my point of view, he handled it perfectly and I would love to see what else he would film later, although I can't say before that I set him apart as an interesting director. Perhaps it was the fact that the film was made only by Peter Farenelli very strongly contributed to the 'nobility' of the picture in terms of humor.<br/><br/>The funny fact is that one of the screenwriters of the film is Nick Vallelonga, his father was the prototype of the main character Frank (Tony Chatterun) Vallelonga. The script was written on the basis of dictation records made by Nick Vallelonga. Later on these records, Viggo Mortensen learns to speak Italian, because his hero is Italian.<br/><br/>The film was shot in the spirit of the 60s, beautiful cars of that time are very well shown, the art of the costume, the receptions in the large houses of the rich public (some 'Gone with the Wind' is immediately remembered)<br/><br/>This film is simple, kind, sincere. Without any strain, without life horrors, you know, where someone dies, someone is killed or someone is in prison. The atmosphere of the film is ""soft"" and light. You literally find yourself in this time, with terrific cars of all colors of the rainbow, men in flawless day costumes of all colors, gentlemen with whiskey at the bar in hotels listening to the brilliant pianist.<br/><br/>The Green Book is not a picture of slavery, racism and humiliation, although it touches on these topics. The Green Book is a film about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual support between people. The film is about the fact that it is very difficult to change the ingrained thinking of society alone, even if you are brilliant and famous.<br/><br/>By viewing required."

","Most of the reviewers here state how important the message of the movie is. I will play the advocatus diaboli here: I don't care about the message of a movie without entertainment - in the first place by watching a movie I want to be entertained and not educated.<br/><br/>Green Book is that kind of movie that you make in our times if you want the applause of today's Hollywood's p.c. crowd (remember Shape of the Water!?), add some known actors and you can grap easy some prices here and there. 2nd choice: make something about saving nature. Creativity!? Daring!? Uniqueness!? None.<br/><br/>Anyway, the message of course is one already told many times before (e.g. The Intouchables, Driving Miss Daisy to name some obvious ones), but I admit the actors work well.<br/><br/>Well, today's Hollywood crowd seems to be rather some bunch of social workers and educationalists than artists - by the way, I find it really somehow rather comical that those rich guys and gals try to tell me how to live to save nature, considering how many different estates/big houses and other stuff like cars and planes those people got. Just imagine for a moment in what kind of state the Earth would be if all 8 billion people on Earth would live that kind of life-style of those true lovers and preachers of Mother Earth...<br/><br/>Back to Green Book: a rather mediocre and rather powerless movie (just compare it with a masterpiece like In the Heat of the Night) with some funny moments and solid acting, but with a story obviously fishing for compliments and applause - and some Oscars."
"brianjohnson-20043","10","41","78","29 November 2018"," I give it 👍👍. The negative reviews are full of it
","I honestly don't understand why so many critics don't like this film as much as the audience. Green Book has a great artistic story, a good script, great acting, it has some great humor, some great drama and poigniance. It's well directed. It has both characters learn from one another and need one another despite often not being able to stand one another. It doesn't show such developments in a preachy kind of way. It doesn't seem to present any silly inconceivable blunders. I felt it was well worth spending 2 hours watching in a theater, and I found it one of the best films I've seen this year. If not the very best.<br/><br/>The rest of my review is for the purpose of responding to stupid reviews of people who find a way to hate this movie because of what it isn't as opposed to what it is.<br/><br/>Does Green Book have everything perfectly documented about life as a black person in Ali's character, or life as a white person for Mortenseon's character? No. Does it perfectly encapsulate every person's time and experience traveling and living in the south or the north of America at that time and in those places? No. Does it property portray all friendships of white and black people? No. Does the film perfectly show how the police treat people in every instance in the north and in the south? No. Does it feature sad people living their sad lives and learning nothing to effectively encapsulate how terrible and hopelessly serious some issues can be? No. Does the movie strike me as having a groundbreaking quality that puts it as the first or definitively best at doing whatever new ambitious thing it's trying to do? No<br/><br/>From my standpoint, these kinds of shortcoming could be said about every single good movie. Even if a movie is groundbreaking, it isn't an excellent film because it was groundbreaking or record shattering. Green Book's purpose is to show the experience of two specific characters along with their friends and family as the main two characters get to know each other. The story as it is told is believable, entertaining, interesting and likeable. And that is exactly what it was trying to be and, in my opinion, that angel serves the film very well. I don't know how perfectly the film was at showing exactly what really happened. But If anyone expects to be able to take a film based on true events as the perfect infallible account, they are the with the issue as opposed to the film.<br/><br/>As for what the film didn't cover: If you want all the facts or potential ramifications or heartbreaks of other people in this time going about their lives, you're better off reading some books, looking up some facts, or watching some documentaries about the topics. Nothing can tell every avenue of every conceivable story with perfect detail and accuracy. And a 2 hour movie is far from the ideal way of even try such a task.<br/><br/>Movies like Green Book are meant to exist as entertaining peices of art. And that is exactly what I thought Green Book was, and what made it good. I highly recommend this film is that's the sort of thing you like."
"bobbsaunders","3","123","259","31 January 2019"," Trite, cliched, shallow
","How did this film even get considered for an Oscar? This is low grade pap, unchallenging, unbeleivable, dull and so cliched its difficult to believe a fine actor like Mortensen would get involved. And why cast a Scandinavian as a Bronx Italian? Mahershala Ali has done himself no favours either creating a cartoonish 'sophisticate', though the hand doubling during his piano playing was impressive. This is heavy handed populism, shallow and self-righteously preaching, reducing a complex social struggle to simple stereotypes. The cinema landscape of 2018 must be very lacking for this to be lauded as it is. But then in reality it is not, with Masterpieces like Roma on display, its just that the Oscars is not really as important as it would like to be."

","Am I the only one to think the writing was awful? Everything in this movie is a stereotype and it follows an annoyingly predictable plot. It's so obvious Doc was going to spend Christmas at home with his driver, it was obvious the second policeman was going to help, it was obvious that he was not going to play the last concert.<br/><br/>Are we also to believe that a hugely popular musician taking a pay cut with a purpose in mind would agree to some strange clause in the contract that if he doesn't play every single one of the venues, they don't get paid at all? I think he needs a new agent...<br/><br/>This is just one of the many things in this movie that I just did not find believable at all. The exposition, as a result, feels heavy-handed and forced.<br/><br/>Everything about it was such a cliché, from beginning to end. I wanted to like it but I found it utterly ridiculous, aside from a few light and enjoyable moments.
The acting was perhaps the only redeemable aspect, and I can only say that for Viggo and Mahershala as many of the extras were horrendous."
"paul-allaer","5","78","160","26 November 2018"," Safe and predictable from start to finish
","""Green Book"" (2018 release; 130 min.) is ""inspired by true events"" we are reminded. As the movie opens, it is ""New York City 1962"" and Tony works as a bouncer in the Copacabana club. When club closes for renovations, he needs another job. One day he gets a call: a doctor needs a driver. The given address turns out to be Carnegie Hall, and the ""doctor"" is in fact acclaimed pianist Dr. Don Shirley. After some back and forth, Shirley hires Tony, and off they go... At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you will just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie directed by Peter Farrelly, who along with his brother, has brought us ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", among many others. Here he goes a very different direction, namely on the one hand another take on ""The Odd Couple"", and on the other hand the racial tensions in the deep south in the early 60s. As to the odd couple Tony and Shirley, it provides for some comic relief (much of the theater crowd roared approvingly). As to the racial tensions, they are as predictable as they are mind blowing that this went on just 60 years ago. But truth be told, if you want to see a movie about those issues, there are far better movies than this one. Viggo Mortensen tries way too hard to be a convincing Italian-American from the Bronx, and that is true as well of the family gatherings early in the movie, you can practically hear the director yelling ""..and ACTION"". Mahershala Ali (as Shirley) fares somewhat better. Kudos for the production sets (I never tire of the cars from that era).<br/><br/>""Green Book"" expanded wide this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was, much to my surprise, packed to the rafters (mostly seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"", I readily suggest that you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"Quinoa1984","5","65","132","8 December 2018"," Just okay when all is said and done
","So, let me get up on the soap box here for just a second ::steps up, clears throat::<br/><br/>It may be because I have inhaled as much of the non-fiction of James Baldwin the past two years, or that I have simply paid halfway attention to whats going on in this part of this decade, or that I live in the general area that Tony Lips did (the tri-state area in the North-East), but I think Green Book underestimates the racism of the North at the time. It's often been a misconception, usually by white people (and maybe at one time when I was much younger), but just because you live in the North and around liberal areas doesn't mean that things are less racist.<br/><br/>Indeed, it's that more subdued racism (what MLK dubbed those ""white moderates"") that make a lot of trouble. From socio-economic segregation of a sort - notice that in the Bronx neighborhood Tony's family and friends live there are no black people, and the ""No Coloreds"" signs are not up but they're just... Not there, and not allowed. Not really, anyway.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, it does touch on the fact that there is this racism that is there with working-class Italians (not that it's any great revelation in American cinema - Do the Right Thing was made decades ago and dealt with Italian caricatures, literally making pizza, being face to face with African American people with much more insight and drama/comedy etc); there is one telling beat where Tony comes home as two black handymen are working on the Lips' family kitchen, and they're given some lemonade in two glasses. When they leave, Lips puts the two glasses in the trash (and later, Linda Cardellini's wife takes them back out). This is good visual storytelling that makes the point clear: once Lips gets tasked with the plot of Green Book, which is to drive the good Doctor (Mahershala Ali) across the mid-west and deep South, there will be problems but not just with those they come across.... But then it's kinda-sorta dropped for a ""feel-good"" movie about race relations.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but in 2018, living in just everything that's going on now (in daily news, a campus in Mississippi got vandalized with numerous nooses hung about for tomorrows Senate vote for example), I'm not sure if that's what we (white people, even more than blacks or other minorities) need to see. All this said, the movie does a good job, at least for the first two thirds, of getting an entertaining buddy story between these two Characters, with a capital ""C.""<br/><br/>And to the actors' credit, Ali and Mortensen tap into the cliches of a, well, bouncer at the Coppacabana and classically trained PHD pianist (fluent in multiple languages, which does pay off at a key point by the way, nice writing), and whenever they are on screen I believed the actors in what they had to emote or tried to do. It's even got funny scenes and beats and lines, and while I can count the number of laughs (at least five, at most six), they are genuine laughs. Farrelly knows how to get two guys working together on screen - he's known since Dumb & Dumber - so that part is fine.<br/><br/>But then there's that last third in particular when it hunkers down into hammering its message about race relations (if you've seen the trailer, that scene in the rain with ""if I'm not black enough and Im not white enough"" etc is a cringe-tastic as it seems) and the simple attitude that after two months Tony Lips is now way cooler and, more crucially at the end, all the rest of his friends and family there for Christmas Eve are magically okay now with the ::insert Italian slang word for racist epithet here:: coming to dinner. But this is all without any real work outside of a few goopy scenes where the good Doctor helps Tony write letters to Mrs. Lips (sorry I forget his real last name right now) so he must be awesome outside of the brilliant piano playing.<br/><br/>The movie does go a ways to make Ali's character flawed too in some basic ways - as a musician on the road he's become a loner, estranged from a brother and divorced - and in one way that I don't think is meant to be seen as a flaw, but comes up as a ""huh"" bit where Tony has to get Doc out of a bind when he is... Caught in a gay moment with another man at the YMCA(?!) Okie dokie! So that also don't be a big deal since hes just Tony's boss and no judgment and we'll just leave his sexuality as something that doesn't get any more screen-time because RACISM needs to get the top shelf over homophobia and that entire grenade which... What was that??<br/><br/>As far as the sort of if not feel good then *don't feel bad* kind of movie released by a big studio, it's not as tone deaf and potentially harmful as a Crash; it has more of the feel of a better(ish) thing that Stanley Kramer would have made (down to, if Poitier was around he would be ideal for this part): it doesn't shy from the issues, and on the contrary it tries to show what everybody (even the racists) know, which is segregation-by-law can't be sustainable.<br/><br/>But when it comes to depicting more essential details about character, about really digging into Lips past his love for his wife and not being *that* bad because, hey, he turns down offers by the local mobsters for work even when he's down, right(?) it doesn't hold as much water. Should I wholly believe Lips wont throw out again glasses that happened to touch mouths of black working class workers, despite himself being working class, because he got Lessons in Life (and visa-versa he gives the Doctor some ""Street Life"" lessons)? Not sure that I do.<br/><br/>Why the six star rating then? When it means to be simply well-acted and more character-driven entertainment, it works - not to mention the greatest product placement for KFC in cinema history - and I enjoyed seeing these two do the absolute best they could with what they had. It's a mild recommendation. But compared to what else you can see from this year - Blindspotting, Blackkklansman, Sorry to Bother You, to an extent The Hate U Give - it's weak tea.<br/><br/>Thank you. ::steps off::"
"domtaylor","6","19","33","10 February 2019"," Mortensen and Ali make it an entertaining watch, but the whole thing feels very outdated.
","There's some enjoyment to be had while watching 'Green Book', but everything from the story to the cinematography feels very early 2000s, and it's ultimately quite shallow in its messages. It focuses more on the core friendship than anything else, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and Mortensen and Ali have great chemistry which really gives the film its entertainment value. Unfortunately, though, it takes a long while for the main conceit to really get going and this first portion of the flick is almost devoid of any real entertainment value. Luckily though, once things get on the road it becomes a fairly entertaining time and moves along briskly - although the skit-based comedy that makes up for most it (which, again, feels outdated in a picture like this) becomes quite tiresome. Overall, it's sufficiently entertaining throughout - thanks largely to Mortensen and Ali - and moves briskly enough. It's let down by its outdated filmmaking and narrative conceit, though, and by its lack of depth, too. 6/10"

Really? He went from irate racist to civil rights advocate in a few minutes after turning down a gig for the Italian guys, because after showing total contempt for black people, he would just turn down working with his own group of people. Turning down gigs while selling his property to stay alive. Then his mingling with other black drivers and having fun, totally ignoring the original set up of him a staunch racist. Really? On top of being a staunch racist, he constantly listened to black music and knew all about it. Really?<br/><br/>Sorry, no genuine racist would drive for a black guy in the south. Not buying that part of it. And no black guy that was that ""proper"" and insisting on classy behavior would ever hire a low-class guy like. None of it rang true.<br/><br/>It was written like it all took place today using language like ""traveling while black."" Really?<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali is just an overrated actor.

","Ernest but flat. Inter-racial friendships have been a topic in American films for over 50 years. The emotions between the two main characters here came across as forced and inauthentic. Why choose the Danish-American Viggo Mortensen to play an Italian-American from the Bronx? His portrait was an amateurish embarrassment. Almost grotesque, but supposed to get laughs. And Ali's character, Don Shirley, does things down South that would most likely get him killed---I doubt the incidents in the movie truthfully matched the real-life happenings. It looked like a movie about Americans that was made by Canadians. Full of false notes, with no real flavor.
This movie wasn't even a crowd-pleaser where I saw it (NYC). Don't expect Tony to beat-up every racist we see, Buford Pusser style. Just lame confrontations that didn't satisfy or really address the racial problems in a believable way. So here's one lone knock on a movie that got a mystifying amount of good reviews."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Living in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!<br/><br/>With the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.<br/><br/>However, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.<br/><br/>Ali doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.<br/><br/>Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.<br/><br/>Technically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.<br/><br/>Finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.<br/><br/>Green Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ..."

"Cineanalyst","4","8","12","23 March 2019"," Driving Miss Daisy 2: In Reverse
","After ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990), ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Crash"" (2004) and, now, ""Green Book,"" I guess Hollywood is just going to continue patting themselves on the back for not being racists because they honor pictures where stupid white protagonists are taught to respect racial others as human beings. As opposed to the infamous failure to nominate a racially more challenging and sophisticated picture such as ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) for Best Picture the year ""Driving Miss Daisy"" won it, this time, they gave Spike Lee an Oscar, too, for ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), a film that I think has its own faults, but, at least, it's not simply a message picture of ""racism is bad, but look how far we've come"" for the dumb and dumber. And, at least, there's some cinematic flair to Lee's film, as opposed to this modest improvement upon a filmed play such as ""Driving Miss Daisy.""<br/><br/>In quite a few ways, ""Green Book"" is a modest improvement upon ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in that it largely tells a similar story in a similar way without itself coming off as quite hypocritically racist. It's about the least one should expect after 30 years of cinematic and social changes--or lack thereof. In it, another white person who also faces some prejudices against them (in this case, for being an Italian American; in Miss Daisy's case, for being Jewish), and again from that white person's perspective, travels by car with an African American through the Jim Crow South. (Both movies even privilege their ""home"" turf, as it were, as not as racist as other places. In ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" Atlanta somehow came off as not nearly as segregated as Alabama, and in ""Green Book,"" the two are welcomed home to New York by a friendly police officer in contrast with the backwater cops they meet on the way to Birmingham.) They bond, and through their experiences with their black friend, the white protagonists stop being racist. But, this time, the white person is driving, and the black man sits in the backseat!<br/><br/>To be fair, Mahershala Ali's Don Shirley is not entirely, or at least not atrociously as much so, the Magical Negro trope that Morgan Freeman's Hoke is in ""Driving Miss Daisy."" The historically-based character of Shirley has a life outside of helping the white protagonist with their character arc, which the movie addresses, if only almost entirely through the lens of the white protagonist and ultimately how it affects him. In a way, it's a traditional sidelong-glance biopic, where the life of the more interesting figure (Shirley) is seen through the point of view of a more common folk (Viggo Mortensen's Tony), as a surrogate for the spectator, for one assumes because that's how the storytellers see us spectators. Additionally, Shirley is not the white writer's fantasy of a subservient African American that is Hoke. Moreover, Miss Daisy's conversion is rather unconvincing, but ""Green Book"" leaves little doubt that Tony has transformed. Ali and Mortensen are good actors, too, which helps. Clearly, they were dedicated to their characters (most conspicuously by Mortensen gaining 45 pounds for the role).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a movie that's written and directed by and mostly made by white people, through the perspective of a white character, as a surrogate for an intended white audience, to feel good that they, too, have overcome historical racism doesn't really cut it as authentically anti-racist. This comforting, hand-holding seminar from a narrow view of a vast and historical problem, another whitewashed picture about prejudices against racial others won't transform anyone."

","It's 1962 New York City. ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.<br/><br/>There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it."

"rockman182","8","27","55","18 November 2018"," Green Book (2018)
","Well its hard to ignore that this looked like Driving Miss Daisy with the races of the characters reversed. It was also hard to ignore that Peter Farrelly along with his brother, is normally known for bringing often crude comedy films. While Green Book does have a ton of humor it was definitely a step in a different direction and a true story to adapt at that. I'm amazed at how much I liked this film. Every minute of this film is thoroughly enjoyable and it touches on every emotion.<br/><br/>The film is about a loud mouth Italian American named Tony Lip who gets a job driving and being protection for a jazz pianist named Don Shirley. Initially, it is seen that the two come from different worlds and are at odds with each other but as time goes on and the two realize how different race relations are in the south, they begin to bond and become closer than they expected they would. Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in the title roles.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of laugh out loud moments. Especially through the eccentric nature of both leads. Whether its Tony's hard headed but uncultured nature or Don's particularities , the chemistry between the two is really off the charts. The film touches on many important concepts that still reverberate today, mainly in race relations and acceptance of sexuality. Farrelly and the real life son of Tony Lip do such a fine job writing a film that knows when to be funny and when to be serious.<br/><br/>I think the performances from both leads is also fantastic. We are about done with the year and I don't really care what other people say this should be getting nominations is a few categories at the Academy Awards. Was really surprised at how good this film was, as the trailers don't really show off the true excellence that this film was capable of.

"gortx","Null","16","30","29 November 2018"," An entertaining if too lite Goombah Driving Miss Daisy
","GREEN BOOK. In General Release<br/><br/>The trailers promise a sort of Goombah Driving Miss Daisy. For once, the previews aren't lying. With the races reversed, Peter Farrelly's movie, based on a true tale, tells the story of an Italian restaurant bouncer Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who gets a gig driving black Piano Virtuoso Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour of the deep south. In 1962. A time and place where a little tough guy bouncing may come in handy. Shirley leads a musical trio, with two other (white) musicians.<br/><br/>GREEN BOOK is genial enough, and, broadly, entertaining. There are a number of feel-good moments and a few that lead to cheers. But, for every successful bit, there are an equal number of groaners - and Kris Bowers' backing score is one long groaner, with every single emotional highlight signaled, underlined and highlighted in musical yellow markers. Fortunately, most of the music we hear is of Dr. Shirley's trio and Tony's fave car tunes including Little Richard, Chubby Checker, Aretha Franklin etc. (incredulously, Dr. Shirley claims to have never heard them prior!).<br/><br/>Mortensen and Ali are fine actors, but, aren't given a shot at much beyond sit-com style hokum. Mortensen comes off at times like he's auditioning for an off-off-Broadway production of Goodfellas. Ali is a bit more effective, but, the script and Farrelly's lite Direction limit him. GREEN BOOK is so genial and it's heart in the right place that it's a difficult movie to outright dislike (although one really does regret that the movie doesn't take the time to fully explain the meaning of the title). Still, it's a movie that would have fit alongside DRIVING MISS DAISY in 1989, but, haven't we moved past it by now?"

"zkonedog","10","17","33","10 December 2018"," A Little Bit Of Everything
","One of my favorite cinematic experiences is when a film comes absolutely out of nowhere and ends up being incredible. That is pretty much the story of ""Green Book"", a movie that came into the 2018 holiday season with little hype but, when all is said and done, might be the frontrunner for ""best film of the year"" on many personal lists. It sure is on mine, I can tell you that!<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Green Book"" tells the real-life 1962 story of Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a renowned piano player embarking on a tour of the Deep South. His race--African American--might pose some issues, so he hires cocky tough-guy Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) from the Bronx to be his driver. As the two set out on their journey, it at first seems like an Odd Couple type of relationship. But as they experience more of each other's company--as well as the racial injustices of the territory--they come to both rely on and perhaps learn something from the other.<br/><br/>This is a movie that really ""sneaks up on you"", so to speak. It starts off relatively straightforward and one could be forgiven for thinking it's maybe even a little slow. But that character development pays off in an enormous way, as by the end you'll be holding back tears (or failing to) after witnessing the bond these men form out on the road and in face of adversity.<br/><br/>For a movie like ""Green Book"" to work, the acting has to be spot-on, and it surely is here. You'd never guess this was the same Mortensen that was once the sword-wielding Aragorn in the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. He went all-in for this role, shaping both his voice and body to fit the part. Ali has slowly built up a fantastic career for himself, and there's nothing to stop that process here. The arc of his character provides most of the emotion of the film, and his scenes range from heartbreaking to hilarious.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""hilarious"", also consider that this film was directed by Peter Farrelly...yes, he of ""Dumb & Dumber"" fame! While seemingly an odd choice to helm such an emotional project, it proves to be EXACTLY the right decision, as the humor in the film goes a long way towards establishing rapport between the two leads. As deep as the ""emotional stuff"" goes (and it goes deep, to be sure), the comedy is easily just as well-done.<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack yet, which is another integral ""role"" in the film. Whether it be Shirley himself or just the ""on the road"" type tunes, the ""Green Book"" soundtrack is one of the best I've experienced in quite some time. A great mix of jazz, piano, and orchestral sections.<br/><br/>As you can see, I think that perhaps the biggest reason why ""Green Book"" gets the full 10-star treatment from me is because it does a little bit of everything, and somewhat remarkably nails all those little areas to produce a masterpiece. The final compliment? The overall message of the film is a great one: that sometimes all it takes for two people to better understand each other (in this case it is black and white, but really it could be anything) is proximity. Had not fate drawn Dr. Shirley and Tony together, they would have spent the rest of their days likely stuck in their own little boxes. As it turned out, however, it took a road trip to cross those bridges and each man to learn a little from the other.<br/><br/>Great story, acting, direction, humor, music, and emotion. What more can a movie-goer ask for?"

The production design and music are both outstanding in this film.<br/><br/>Here's what is disappointing: it seems that the Director and writers did not do due dilligence to make sure it would be a fairly accurate representation of Don Shirley. Recently, there have been complaints issued by several members of Shirley's family. They were not contacted for their contribution or their approval. Because Shirley was a private man, there are certain unknowns about his relationships. To go further, there seems to be strikingly different views on the relationship between Don Shirley and Tony ""Lip"" --- was their bond of friendship genuine, as the film presents? Or did this film take measures to pump-up-the-volume, to serve it's own interests? Others viewers might ask: why would a director or writer proceed with a project without making sincere efforts to communicate with surviving members of Shirley's family?<br/><br/>Lovely cast, although Mortensen (an outstanding actor) gave a over-the-top (sometimes cartoonish) delivery of a Bronx tough-guy with a soft heart. Mahershala (another very apt actor) was fully committed, but after seeing an online video of the ""REAL Don Shirley"", I have to wonder if Ali researched the persona of Shirley. The actor recently offered an apology to Shirley's family members, but if this project had been vetted out, some of these mishaps could have been avoided."

Mahershala Ali is brilliant as piano prodigy Don Shirley, who needs someone to drive him on a tour through the deep South. Enter jamoke Tony Lipp. A newly unemployed bouncer whose brawn is worst than his bite played by Viggo Mortensen. Let's be honest, NOTHING is unexpected her if you've watched brotherly love movies from the past 30 years, or road movies for that matter like say...""Rain Man"" the resolution is exactly what you think. But...so what? It's beautiful and touching and gets you in the right spot. And I love director Peter Farrelly for it. The problem with today's movies is that it believes being mean and criticizing ALL bigots means they have to be bumbling morons. Whilst true, there are also bigots with families who have good hearts or similar ignorance. That is the dynamics of depth. Obviously, the stakes aren't necessarily Civil Rights. It touches on it, but never pushes you into eye roll territory. Though presently criticized as softening the racism with humor, what is telling is that they paint Shirley's character as the world intelligent educated gifted Black man with talent and Viggo as coming to terms with others who are MUCH more bigoted as he. This illustrates the divide of class as much as race.
The tone is of joy and friendship and understanding. And though I think it's too simple to say it's begging for peace in a tumultuous era in America (it really isn't) it still is a fun road movie. More laughs than anything. Well crafted story of grown men finding ways to grow up."
"evanston_dad","3","16","32","10 April 2019"," Patronizing
","Just.....no.<br/><br/>""Green Book"" is the kind of movie my mom likes, and trust me, that's not a compliment. It's for people who are willing to watch a movie about racism as long as the black character who's the victim of it is whiter than any of the white characters. It's for people who want to pat themselves on the back for being open to a ""serious"" movie that doesn't challenge a single belief or make them the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's for people who like music cues that tell them exactly what they're supposed to be feeling at every single moment. It's for people who think the answer to racial problems is for whites and blacks to compromise and find some middle ground where they can agree to overcome their differences, as if black people have any responsibility in the fact that they have been marginalized ever since the very first one set foot on American soil. No one who is the slightest bit tuned in to racial problems in contemporary America could possibly stomach this movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I found it to be patronizing and damn near insulting. It consists of scene after scene of our black protagonist getting himself in trouble, only to be saved from the situation by the white guy. By the end, the white guy has taught him how to be more black and embrace his own culture, which in this movie is defined by liking fried chicken, listening to Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, and playing some funky piano. Oh but wait, defenders will say. The white guy learns something too, like how to be less racist and how to write really good love letters to his wife. In fact, the entire guys' racist family learns to not be racist by the end and welcomes the black guy to their Christmas dinner. They're just casually racist, you see, but not racist in ways that really matter. Barf.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is the Sesame Street version of racism. In a year that gave us ""BlackkKlansman,"" ""Blindspotting,"" ""The Hate U Give,"" and ""Sorry to Bother You,"" all movies made by minorities about the black experience in America, it's pretty telling of where we are as culture right now that the race movie mainstream America glommed on to was this piece of feel-good hoo-hah. Mainstream America doesn't want to have its beliefs challenged, and it certainly doesn't want to be told it's part of the problem. Instead, it wants a hallmark movie that makes it feel good about itself.<br/><br/>One thing saves ""Green Book"" from being an utter waste of time, and that is the performance of Viggo Mortensen.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

","Martin Luther King's message that people should be judged not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character came one year too late to reach the folks encountered by black Jamaican jazz pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali, ""Hidden Figures""), in his 1962 concert tour of the segregated Deep South. In Peter Farrelly's (""Dumb and Dumber To"") warm and human comedy/drama Green Book, Shirley undertakes the journey together with Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Moretnsen, ""Captain Fantastic""), a night club bouncer who is known to his Italian mob pals in the Bronx as Tony ""Lip."" While Tony was hired to do the driving, his main job, unacknowledged though it may be, was to provide physical protection for Shirley from any unwanted encounters with the locals south of the Mason-Dixon Line.<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story (isn't everything?) and co-written by Nick Vallelonga, the film's title refers to the ""Negro Motorist Green Book,"" a guide used for many years by black travelers looking for hotels and restaurants in the Deep South where they could feel safe from discrimination and physical harm. Needless to say, neither the hotels nor the restaurants have many stars in the latest Michelin guide. We are first introduced to Tony who is working at the legendary Copacabana, a mob-connected New York nightclub known for its ability to attract name entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr. When the Copa closes for renovations, Tony is open to an offer to become a driver for Doctor Shirley whose ostentatious living quarters above Carnegie Hall, to quote former U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, ""staggers the imagination and converts vanity to prayer.""<br/><br/>Racism is not foreign to Tony's outlook on life as shown when he throws the glasses used to serve water to black workmen in the garbage. Even though the tour will take him away from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini, ""A Simple Favor"") and his two small children for eight weeks, Tony promises to write often but will need some assistance from his cultured employer. As two Cadillac's make their way along the highway, one containing The Don Shirley Trio's cellist Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov, ""A Picture with Yuki"") and bassist George (Mike Hatton, ""Vigilante Diaries""), and the other the reserved and tightly-wound Shirley in the back seat and the chatty, uninhibited driver in the front.<br/><br/>Though the two have little in common, their witty interplay on the road expands Don's horizons as Tony provides samples of Little Richard, Chubby Checker and Aretha Franklin and, after much resistance, introduces him to the gourmet pleasures of Kentucky Fried Chicken (heaving their bones out of the window). Meanwhile, Don offers Tony some assistance with his grammar and teaches him about Orpheus and his demons, neither of which he needs to know to do his job. When they leave Pennsylvania and Ohio and head for Raleigh, Macon, Memphis, Little Rock, Baton Rouge, and Birmingham, however, things are no longer a laughing matter.<br/><br/>The pair get their first dose of reality when they hit their first Green Book"" stop, the run-down Carver Courts Motel to which Tony offers the relevant comment that ""it looks like my ass."" While Don maintains his haughty above-the-battle demeanor, it soon becomes obvious that much of his persona hides a gnawing loneliness that becomes more evident as the two make progress on their journey. Encounters with the police and a confrontation with unfriendlies in a bar are just the tip of the iceberg and Don is forced to rely on Tony's considerable skills as a Bronx tough to get him through some physically threatening moments.<br/><br/>The irony for Shirley is that he is a much sought-after artist who performs for wealthy white audiences but is prohibited from eating in the same restaurants, using the same bathrooms, or sleeping in the same hotel with those who pay good money to hear him play. Though the film suggests that these abominations are things of the past, we know better. During the performances, however, there is no black and white, no rich and poor, no coons or queers, only the exquisite power of the music which transcends hate and, at least for those few moments, reminds us of our common humanity and the fields of gold we all play in together. They are moments that can help us, as American poet Langston Hughes puts it, ""to shatter this darkness, to smash this night, to break this shadow into a thousand lights of sun, into a thousand whirling dreams of sun!"""

"emailtombuchanan","9","17","37","10 November 2018"," A wonderful Film Guarenteed to Build Empathy
","I just enjoyed a preview screening of ""Green Book,"" a heartwarming family film scheduled to release over the Thanksgiving holiday. Green Book is based on a true story about a black concert pianist (played by Mahershala Ali) who tours the American Deep South in the early 1960's, and takes along a rough-and-tumble Italian bar bouncer as his driver/fixer (played by Viggo Mortensen). The driver begins the tour as a northern racist who takes the eight week assignment because he needs quick cash, while the pianist starts the tour as a lonely and pompous prick unable to fully navigate the white world where his music is highly valued, and equally uncomfortable in black-America. Through the film we see the two characters find each other and themselves as they subtly bond, and we feel the connection as a real friendship blossoms. The title of the film comes from a once essential tour book that listed hotels and other businesses willing to serve black customers, in an era when American blacks were legally equal to whites but discrimination remained grossly overt. I was fortunate to see Green Book at Dartmouth College in a packed 237 seat theater with an audience that responded well to the drama and humor, and to the empathy developing on-screen. Green Book is a well-crafted PG-13 film that pulled excellent reviews in festival showings, and tells an important story in a touching way. The film shines a light on an ugly part of American history, and offers hope that by connecting with diverse characters and lives we can overcome our divisions. It's a wonderful story that perfectly fits our present times, and it needs to be shared."

He became an ordinary working class Italian-American guy, I felt he is a member of the Sopranos' family... Mahershala Ali has a mighty presence, as always.

It wasn't my favourite, but hey ho.<br/><br/>Green Book tells the unlikely friendship that is built between Tony Lip and Dr Don Shirley. Tony is a bouncer looking for temporary work. Dr Shirley is a black concert pianist about to go on a early 60's tour of the deep south and therefore in need of protection. The movie reminded me very much of Planes, Trains and Automobiles with one key difference. Somehow PTA seemed much more realistic at showing the tensions and empathy between the leads. Personally I didn't find Green Book that realistic at showing the friction and joy between Tony and Don.

","Based on the lives Don Shirley (A Pianist) and and Tony Vallelonga (A Bouncer), 'Green Book' is a surprisingly pleasant effort by Writer-Director Peter Farrelly, who delivers his most sensitive film to date. Farrelly known for madcap comedies, takes a different route this time, and delivers a road-film, that explores friendship and racism, with heart.<br/><br/>'Green Book' Synopsis: A working-class Italian-American bouncer (Viggo Mortensen in a showy performance) becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist (Mahershala Ali, mastering in subtlety) on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South.<br/><br/>'Green Book' works because this is a truly heartening story of diversely different people who formed a bond, despite their differences. And Farrelly, along-with Co-Writers Nick Vallelonga (Tony Vallelonga's real-life son) and Brian Hayes Currie, makes sure the ride is memorable. Though the film does get monotonous at times and also feels about 15-minutes longer than should've been, 'Green Book' is a charming road-film, that is, in equal measure, humorous and serious.<br/><br/>Tony and Don's relationship is nicely captured, as it begins from awkwardness to true friendship as the story progresses. The entire ark of its characters is well-done, like Tony's racial attitude towards Don initially and how their friendship forms, to Don realizing the power of being himself, deserves credit. Even the entire backdrop of Racism subjected toward Don, offers some hair-rising moments, that definitely leave you angered. The Writing, though imperfect, is well-aware of the times the story is set in (1960's) and presents a story that appears authentic, rather than frothy and artificial.<br/><br/>Farrelly's Direction is competent. It's good to see the otherwise zany director, explore his subtler side here. Sean Porter's Cinematography is excellent. Patrick J. Don Vito's Editing is decent, but could've been crisper.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are in fine form, yet again. Viggo, nailing the Italian accent and gulping down food like a true foodie, has a blast playing Tony, and it shows in every frame. Ali, on the other-hand, portrays the subdued Don, with grace and restraint. And the on-screen camaraderie between the two, is infectious. Of the supporting cast, Linda Cardellini as Tony's Wife, is extraordinary.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Green Book' charms. Make time for it."
"jackgdemoss","9","8","15","12 January 2019"," No rising and falling action. Just captivative excellence all the way thorugh.
","I haven't seen a film like Green Book in quite some time. A film that doesn't have long-winded exposition followed by a dramatic resolution, but that is still satisfying the entire way through. I liken it to Forrest Gump in the sense that the captivation does not come from a place of waiting to see what comes next, but rather, it comes from being in that moment with the characters. Viggo Mortensen's performance was astonishing as a firmly rooted New Yorker. It certainly helped that Director Peter Farrelly pulled me into the 60s about thirty seconds into the opening scene. Green Book is a character driven film in which the characters are complex enough to remove certain aspects of predictability that we expect from most films. This was one of the best I have seen from 2018 and I recommend anyone give it a try."

No, this is an uplifting and hopeful tale of two men, getting closer together and evolve beyond the beliefs they have been brought up with or the semi-hardcoded (mis)conceptions of things that simply are a certain way for them, mostly because of groupthink and indirect group pressure to behave a certain way.<br/><br/>The acting is strong and I especially liked Viggo Mortensen's portayal of Tony Lip, even if he came across as a bit of a caricature at times. The same issue I had with a couple of supporting characters.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali gives an equally strong performance, even though his character has some small flaws when it comes to believability.<br/><br/>I found myself being able to easily ignore any flaws because I just really liked the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The story is easy to digest and despite the topic, not very deep, but that is fine. We know what it is about, and that is more than enough in this case. It also knows when it's a tearjerker and it's not ashamed of it.<br/><br/>You can top it all off with beautiful classical and sixties era music.<br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining and loveable movie. 9/10, well deserved."
"ThePeruvianPostOfficial","8","4","6","12 February 2020"," The Peruvian Post - Green Book - Film Review
","""Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one.""<br/><br/>The year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact.<br/><br/>Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.<br/><br/>The contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!<br/><br/>On the whole, the film ""Green Book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.<br/><br/>(88/100)"

","Occasionally a film comes along where the acting is so extraordinary that I can overlook its flaws. Much like Malek's brilliant portrayal of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody -which I'd say is an average film overall- Mortensen and Ali are transcendent as Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley. I'm admittedly a fan of both actors' work, but Green Book is in my opinion their crowning achievement and they both deserve Oscars."
"Turfseer","8","9","18","19 December 2018"," Guilty white liberal critics can't stomach this true feel-good race relations story set in the early 60s Civil Rights era
","A fair number of film critics have argued that Peter Farrelly's Green Book, his new dramedy set in the early civil rights era of the 60s, is designed to make its chiefly white audience, ""feel better about racism."" Such a specious argument has it that the film promulgates the false notion that the racial tensions of today can be ignored (or even denied) primarily by white liberals by watching this optimistic tale of bonding between a gay black musician and Italian salt of the earth bouncer.<br/><br/>
Some of these critics go further when they insist that the deck is stacked in favor of the protagonist Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), the gruff driver whom Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) hires to ensure that his concert tour of the deep South goes smoothly. Tony does so much more for Dr. Shirley, that some critics maintain that primary screenwriter Nick Vallelonga (Tony's real-life son) has turned his father into a ""white savior.""<br/><br/>
Nothing actually can be further from the truth. Tony benefits from Dr. Shirley's influence just as much as Dr. Shirley from his. Their relationship is symbiotic. Both represent a fish out of water-Tony is exposed to Dr. Shirley's rarefied, world of culture while the sophisticated musician is forced by Tony to become more spontaneous, dealing with all the attendant street characters that challenge his ordered vision of the world.<br/><br/>
What rankles many of these critics is that Dr. Shirley doesn't conform to their stereotyped image of what a black man should be. He's the opposite of ""street culture,"" having grown up in a white world and trained as a classical musician. What's more he's gay and looks down on other blacks whom he regards as uncultured and uncouth. Indeed his decision to travel through the deep south as a goodwill ambassador marks this unusual man as courageous as he's forced to endure constant humiliation by a coterie of racists at every turn.<br/><br/>
It's Dr. Shirley who forces Tony to re-evaluate his deep-set beliefs about race. When we first meet Tony, he looks down on black people so much that he places two drinking glasses in the garbage after he spies the two African-American plumbers at his house, drinking out of them. Tony eventually comes to realize that his employer doesn't fit his stereotyped view of blacks; how can it be that Dr. Shirley never eats fried chicken?<br/><br/>
The comic scene where Tony persuades Dr. Shirley to eat the chicken is the beginning of Tony's reevaluation of his racism. Meanwhile, Dr. Shirley must effect an attitude re-adjustment of his own, eating the chicken with his fingers, manners which he initially regards as beneath him.<br/><br/>
Other critics also feel that the screenwriters are much harder on Dr. Shirley than Tony. Where Dr. Shirley plays Cyrano, teaching Tony better manners on how to write proper love letters to his wife, Dr. Shirley is depicted with much more self-destructive traits-he has one too many drinks and finds himself surrounded by racists at a bar, finally rescued by Tony in the nick of time.<br/><br/>
Both Tony and Dr. Shirley are social outcasts however; both have trouble controlling their temper and in this respect they're very similar. Tony ends up punching a police officer in the face over an ethnic insult and Dr. Shirley has to be stopped by Tony from attacking the maÃ®tre d who won't allow him to eat dinner with whites.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the greatest scene in the film is when Tony and Dr. Shirley stop their car on the way to North Carolina and spy a group of black sharecroppers toiling away in the fields. This is where they both realize they have much more in common than the sharecroppers, who live a life of virtual indentured servitude.<br/><br/>
At that moment Tony and Dr. Shirley can appreciate their freedom. It's a moment of epiphany for all characters concerned-the expression of wonderment on the faces of the sharecroppers whom have never seen an independent, ""free"" black man before; Dr. Shirley's realization of the true nature of the oppression of his people and Tony's appreciation of Dr. Shirley's sensitivity toward other blacks, whom perhaps in the past he would never have payed attention to.<br/><br/>
The liberation of both Tony and Dr. Shirley is illustrated in the denouement. Dr. Shirley is able to ""let loose,"" playing blues music at an African-American bar and Tony admonishes his relatives for speaking poorly of black people at the dinner table.<br/><br/>
Ali shows his versatility as Dr. Shirley, playing the upper crust musician (in contrast to his street tough role in Moonlight) and Viggo Mortensen (gaining about 40 lbs. for the role), shows off his acting chops as the gruff Italian. Kudos also to director Peter Farrelly, usually known for low light comedies, but in this case venturing forward into much more rewarding territory.<br/><br/>
Green Book is nothing more than a feel-good story about race relations based on a true story. For those who can't stomach such a note of optimism in the face of a disappointing historical legacy, shame on them!"

"RforFilm","10","10","21","3 December 2018"," The Green Book is more then a guy version of Driving Miss Daisy. It's an engaging car ride of class difference and friendship
","Remember the Farrelly brothers? Yeah, that's a name I haven't heard in a little while. They were previously remembered to making a lot of farce comedies like Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and The Three Stooges. That makes it even more fascinating that one of them, Peter Farrelly is now directing a ""dramedy"" about race relations and friendship. The jarring shift in tone relates to the fact that the pair had been having trouble finding that same comedic fire from before. Movies like Hall Pass, The Three Stooges and Dumb and Dumber To were not hit movies with critics or at the box office. It makes sense that at least one of them would want to try something different.<br/><br/>The good news is that even with a different kind of movie, it's still possible for a filmmaker to follow similar themes. In the case of Peter Farrelly, the main character is still a blue-collar man who goes on a journey. I think that's why he and his brother's movies before used to appeal to a mainstream audience; it was easier to relate to someone who was on a similar class level. So let's see what happens in Green Book, again a Farrelly production.<br/><br/>In the early sixties, rough bouncer Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (played by Viggo Mortensen) is out of work when the nightclub he works at is closed for renovations. His experience leads him to be interviewed by a ""Doctor Don Shirley"". What Tony discovers is that Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali) is a musician who needs a driver to escort him for a concert tour in the Deep South. Though there is clear difference in class and race, Tony is hired based on his recommendation and that he would be a needed help within the segregated area.<br/><br/>During the car ride, it's made clear that the two come from different worlds. Tony is unrefined, a slob and is proud of his rough Italian heritage while Don is classy, well educated and is proud of his classical training. Over time, Tony is impressed with Don's piano playing comparing him to Liberace and Don see's the humanity within Tony. The further they go south, the more Tony understands the unfair nature of segregation and Don is forced to see just how different his world is compared to African-Americans in the poorer areas. Though the two become friends, Tony is not only concerned he won't be home for his family on Christmas Eve, but that perhaps he'd been unfair in the past.<br/><br/>I guess it shouldn't matter where Green Book came from; it may be one of my favorite movies of 2018. A lot of people might see it as that because it's addressing this issue. Truth to be told, that's not what this movies does well in. In fact, I see this movie as a class separation story that works thanks to its script and actors. The best movie I can connect this to is Driving Miss Daisy. That movie also addressed race relations in the Deep South, but was a story about friendship first. Green Book is also like that.<br/><br/>The biggest difference is that along with two men, the plot has to two stuck in the car as they go to each town. Thankfully, the script allows for fun moments without seemingly too comedic. It's likely how the dialogue would have gone down with me if I was thrown into this situation. It's more natural then a lot of stories that probably would have skipped to the race relations' stuff.<br/><br/>The winning combination is the two leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They both had challenging roles as they could have fallen into the stereotype trap. But thanks to a good script, both actors embrace their personas and make each of their characters more human by making them both susceptible to each others suggestions. This isn't a story where everything is changed, but that's also the idea. Its about tolerance rather then acceptance. Both are clear about each others differences, but still find ways to become friends. It's never boring and even leads into jokes that I found funnier then a lot of regular comedies. It's just a nice film overall.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten pianos out of ten. I still have more award movies to watch, but I can see this playing over well during the holiday season. This is a kind of movie that isn't made too often, but need more of. Just movies that feel like pleasant conversations you'd have with any friend. This is a definite recommendation."

","This is one of the blandest and most simplistic depictions of racism I've ever seen in a movie since 2006's trash film Crash.<br/><br/>The only part of this movie that passes as okay is some of the acting. But even then I never bought Viggo Mortensen or Mashallah Ali's characters. They tried with what they had, but they had poor direction.<br/><br/>There's a distinct lack of grit and cursing in this film about traveling through the south with a black man and that really bugged me.<br/><br/>Also for some reason this film is shot like a comedy while tackling a very serious subject, it's a very odd clash... oh my god the worst thing about this movie (besides the simplified story/cartoonishly simplistic view of racism) is the ""comedy"". I never laughed once at any of the jokes, but I did laugh at Viggo's hilariously stereotypical Italian accent, It's like watching Mario audition for Glory.<br/><br/>Also the musical score.for the film is pretty bad and bland, it's mostly violin music played to ""enhance emotion"" moments. It all feels so manipulative.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, I feel old white people will like this movie, but younger audiences will see through this phoney film and be mostly bored."

"CinemaClown","Null","6","11","5 January 2019"," Undeniably Flawed Yet Sufficiently Entertaining
","Another example in the long list of films that provide an overly simplistic view of race relations in America, Green Book is a sincerely crafted & aptly narrated cross-country ride that's steered by some fresh bantering between its two leads but it is also outdated in its approach, and brings nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>Set in the American South during the 1960s, the story follows an Italian-American bouncer who takes the job of driving & bodyguarding an African-American pianist on a musical tour through Southern states. The title refers to the travel guide that was in circulation for safe travel through the country's racial segregation.<br/><br/>Directed by Peter Farrelly, the execution is pretty straightforward and though the film adds nothing to the race discussions, the friendship angle is treated with care & compassion and is allowed to develop gradually. The story is told through Tony Lip's viewpoint and is about the change the journey brings in his personality.<br/><br/>Both Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali play their roles convincingly, especially the latter whose suave & sophisticated rendering of Don Shirley turns out to be one definite highlight of this film. But it's their clashing attitudes to life & ideals that gives this film its finest moments while their quips retain its playful quality throughout.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Green Book doesn't delve deep into the still prevalent racial situation in America but as a tale of friendship, growth & understanding, it does what it set out to do. A mostly lighthearted story that's driven home by splendid performances from Mortensen & Ali, Green Book is undeniably flawed but most viewers will still come out entertained & satisfied with what it has to offer."

","I forgot when was the last time I went out of the cinema and didn't feel even a bit disappointed. This movie is a living classic and I'm sure I will rewatch it many many times.
Green book is a simple yet touching story of two different people who have to work together, for different reasons as well: one needs the money, the other needs the services only the first can provide almost flawlessly. Eventually the need to help each other becomes a habit and from there on in transforms into something much more valuable than both people could have expected: a friendship.
Viggo Mortensen is the heart of this movie, he made me laugh, he made me think of myself lots of times too. Mahershala Ali's performance was solid and thought-out; both characters are well-written and you can feel their chemistry from the very first scene of their meeting. I would also like to single out the amazing soundtrack of this masterpiece and wonderful screenplay.
We have a lot of prejudices in our lives about all kinds of people, some we learned from experience, some were rooted deep inside us since day one but all of them can fade in a moment when you learn the person next to you is not a walking and talking stereotype you painted him to be - he is more complex than that; all the people are, we are just too lazy to think out of the box once in a while. ""Green book"" is just about the perfect reason to do it more frequently."
"jaymcguinness","9","7","14","20 January 2019"," The Oscars frontrunner that is equally funny and heartwarming. An outstanding biographical drama
","Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and is an Oscar contender for sure. That sentence is one that is still hard to fathom. That is because Peter Farrelly's previous credits as writer and director are for Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me,Myself & Irene, Shallow Hal and the awful Three Stooges and Dumb & Dumber sequel. He's a comedy writer. He has some great movies in that genre no doubt but this is such a huge leap in a biographical drama that is a commercial and critical success that it is a career turn that nobody seen coming. Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments in this movie and Farrelly will have been able to engineer those scenes to be as funny as they were. Nevertheless, this is still a huge achievement for the producer, director and writer and I hope he is acknowledged on the ultimate stage.<br/><br/>It is hard to speak of the plot to this film in such a brief description. That is because throughout the entire movie you really get the feel that everything played out on screen did actually happen. There are several reasons for this but mainly it is because of the involvement of Nick Vallelonga as co-writer, the son of the real life Tony Vallelonga in the movie. You get the sense that his involvement really added an authenticity to the story and he was able to project his vision and history of his late father onto screen.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both excellent in this movie. The characters themselves are very entertaining but Mortensen in particular really brings the Italian-American bouncer to life and he adds a charm and humour to the movie. It is amazing how well he pulls off Tony Lip when you compare it to his other roles in The Lord of the Rings, The Road and his 2 previous Oscar nominations Captain Fantastic and Eastern Promises. It really is a brilliant performance and it's a shame that once again he is likely to fall just short this year in the Leading Actor category. Mahershala Ali just goes from strength to strength. With his Oscar win last year for Moonlight still in the rear view mirror he adds another string to his bow here and I am looking forward to his turn in True Detective Series 3 this year. The pair of them have great on screen chemistry together and you really connect with the journey that they go on as a viewer.<br/><br/>I can't speak highly enough of this movie. It is a heartwarming tale of companionship and friendship at a time when circumstances prevented it culturally, socially and professionally. I would highly recommend this film and I think it has a real chance of winning Best Picture at the Oscars 2019. 9/10"

"ReadingFilm","1","8","17","30 March 2019"," Clashing in art as a proxy for living
","My thoughts: the film battles in art. The art is Tony's life is living out in the open through hedonism, competition, family, violence; a work of art actual 'performance' (many see a meta-performance and I do as well), all amount to the inverse of Don; who lives in the abstraction of piano where humanity is safely within symbol. So all of those ways Tony lives, Don lives in hiding; in performance, in sexual repression, in self protection. Then the cross in approaches contrasts the two opposing spectrum to comedic effect; Dumb and Smarter. The key for me is the magic stone, the great symbol allowing him proximity to his discomfort, that abandons his distraction in eating for genuine social connection through art. The ending feels wrong in the natural escalation of its presentation of symbols would reveal Tony being in the closet. Cronenberg ought to have made it...<br/><br/>Basically, Tony does all the learning while Don's ending does not seem very happy at all, destined only to continue reinforcing his internal fortification within this sole window to the outside world. Not sure how feel good it actually is but for how intent it is on being so damned on the nose, I can't make heads or tails of what they thought they were doing. Director Farrely having a big moment is fun though as those 90's comedies deserved best picture in some sense."

Viggo Mortensen proves once again that he's one of the best with foreign languages and accents. It's inspiring to see him constantly take these risks as an actor with new voices and mannerisms. I recommend watching Moonlight (2016) and this one, back to back, to fully appreciate Mahershala Ali's performance. He's truly versatile and has fully established himself as one of the best actors of this generation. Just compare his performance in Moonlight (2016) with this one and you'll see what I mean. The movie has lots of funny moments but also moments where you are moved. All around a great film that touches your heart, stimulates your brain and inspires you.

"haldunarmagan","10","8","17","14 January 2019"," Great Film, Goes beyond its period by alluding on continued discrimination around the world
","A very strong contender for the Oscars, Green Book is a touching and eye-opening story about two men's unlikely friendship at the very unlikely time. On the surface it may be seen as remarkable struggle by an African-American pianist against racism in the deep South in 1962 as well as his friendship with a working-class white man. Thanks to tour de force performances by the two leads, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, director Farrelly avoids cliches on discrimination and instead provokes some universal hints on polarization, alienation and discrimination under the disguise of tolerance in modern times. As Don Shirley beautifully yet sadly talks about sense of belonging, Green Book makes me think about new versions of green book approach (i.e. adapted forms of discrimination) remains in the minds of people -- the US or elsewhere. By the same token, the world cannot be a better place until we all learn the value of coexistence and understanding as opposed to othering and polarizing. I really hope Ali and Mortensen get Oscar this year."

","My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.<br/><br/>'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.<br/><br/>It could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.<br/><br/>Credit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.<br/><br/>The script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.<br/><br/>Summing up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10"

Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) is a mouthy nightclub bounce from the Bronx. He is out of a job as the nightclub is going through renovations.<br/><br/>Tony has been recommended to be a driver and bodyguard to erudite black piano player Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali.)<br/><br/>Dr Don is going on a pre Christmas tour of the deep south, Tony will drive him to the venues with the help of the Green Book, a guide book for black travellers.

"BlackCinemaNow","8","7","15","6 December 2018"," Great Movie!
","So despite my reservations about watching another racially driven movie, I checked out green book. First, let me say that the Italian rhetoric made the film genuinely enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. The 1960s based film is about Tony Lip who is a rough around the edges back streets Italian who is hired to drive slightly eccentric Dr. Don Shirley who is a classically trained black pianist on tour with his trio through the Deep South. Despite being socially accepted in the north, Dr. Shirley takes on this tour where he knows he will encounter issues along the way. Without spoiling the movie, the film explores an unfamiliar narrative of a white person hired to do a job of somewhat servitude for a black person, which I don't remember seeing on this caliber since the body guard. What's interesting to note are two things, the development of the relationship between the two characters from the time they first met to the end of the film and why Dr. Shirley even made the decision to perform in the south which I will leave you to figure out. Both Mahershala ali Viggo Mortensen put on a great performance and the movie definitely has a well-developed storyline."

It has all the exact beats: two people from different backgrounds bonding with each over the course of a few months as they learn to mutually change each other's perspective for the better. However, the filmmakers were able to add several other touches to make it stand out as its own unique thing.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1960s America, still a bit rife with racial tensions. However, the film intends primarily to entertain and delight the audience, so while they do touch upon very significantly on the plight of minorities , the message is conveyed in a way so as to not shock the viewers but rather as a gentle reminder of our torrid history. So overall, this movie is pretty safe to watch and enjoy for any demographic and age. Every member of the family will have a hearty time in the theater."

It released in India a week later then the American release but I know like me many could've missed it. I'm Glad, finally I got the time to see it and I want to write about it. So, this movie is inspired by the true story about friendship between Donald Shirley (Ali), an erudite African-American pianist and his white chauffer Tony (Viggo). First of all, I didn't know what ""GREEN BOOK"" is before I saw the movie. It is a book which is ""to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable"" because African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from their town. So, it is a journey between them and how they're able to accept each other throughout. It is a ""MUST SEE"" movie even though you were not sure about what it is like to have an African American in 1960s. I enjoyed many scenes specially when they enter Kentucky and enjoyed KFC though Don was reluctant at first because of hygiene. I can't reveal much and I don't want to because the movie shows the essence of humanity which is above color and discrimination. There're many heart wrenching scenes too and humor top notch.

"regina_m_ryan","2","9","21","12 March 2019"," A Whole Lot of Caricatures
","What is perhaps the most telling exchange in this ode to some mystical, post-racial looking back, boy to man story is that of the Kentucky fried chicken dialogue. When Tony consternates that he is ""more black"" than Don Shirley simply because he eats fried chicken and listens to Aretha Franklin, one can only pause at the absurdity of such an utterance from a presumed first generation Italian American to a African American man presumedly steeped in the 1950s Black Liberation movement. One would have expected Mr. Shirley to take a bat to the back of Tony's head with such a disparaged and, most certainly, historically inaccurate, depiction of American society pre-Civil Rights legislation, Pre-Voting Rights legislation, and at the cusp of a radical consciousness of Black identity still forming its sensibilities for the late-20th C. Placed in the context of American Southern apartheid, with a heap of hand waving by their Northern white countrymen, to suggest a white man of any ethnicity would gladly identify as more black than a African American man in the midst of one of the violent and consequential turning points in American history is not only ludicrous but offensive. The very script contradicts itself when later Tony assaults a police man in Alabama who assailed him with an epithet that for Mr. Shirley was par for the course. If this film is allegory of where we were a half century ago and all we have to look forward to now that we have freed ourselves from America's original sin, one can only contemplate how poorly we understand our own history and our inability to reckon with the utter failure of spirit that is American racism."

","The best work of Peter Farrelly's career as a solo project after 24 years of sharing the director chair with his brother. And a reminder that Viggo Mortensen has never won an Oscar.
I mean... how on earth you people say that Green Book is a feel-good movie?! This is so dark and infuriating!<br/><br/>Seriously though, despite its heavy themes, this movie is, surprisingly, supremely delightful to watch. Partly, thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, whose equally phenomenal performances prove that they are two of the most talented actors working today. But largely, thanks to Peter Farrelly's nifty direction. Not only has he shown maturity as a director, but Farrelly also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a dramatic movie, and hence more earnest tone and more serious subject matter, way more serious! If he sticks with this refreshing style of filmmaking, and collaborate with excellent screenwriters, such as the writers of the screenplay of this movie, I bet that he will be one of the most popular directors in the coming years. The way he handles his performers, or shots a comedic scene here were really out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>The relatively deliberate pace couldn't have been more challenging for Peter Farrelly to stick with a particular tone, and find balance for this movie, but besides his palpable capability of doing so, the script, which he also co-wrote, offered sincere and genuine smart dialogues, and extremely likable reasonably fleshed-out characters, made this task way much more easier. Let alone the astonishing performances from the entire cast.<br/><br/>The screenplay is what to blame, however, for these two points I took away from my rating for this movie.<br/><br/>First, there is an action Mortensen's character, Tony Lip, take at the beginning of the movie that didn't add anything to the movie. This action also had some consequences that took some time. Adding insult to injury, this action, along with its consequences, was nothing but a cheap trick to make the viewers make a wrong judgment about the character.<br/><br/>Secondly, there was an abrupt change of mind made by the same character that, however understandable it might be, I still found it hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and most importantly, the illogically symmetric pattern of the storytelling; the plot keeps moving forward in a very unrealistic by making every phase in the movie seemingly predictable. It's safe to say that a movie with a fairly familiar themes like this one can easily suffer from such problem.<br/><br/>That said, Green Book is undoubtedly one of the most 2018 movies that I've enjoyed watching. Peter Farrelly miraculously managed to make a movie that tackles such sore themes, a breezy crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","""He's sick. He got poison in his system,"" the black man explains to his Machiavellian host, as being the reason for the white man's anemic condition. Cullen(Sidney Poitier) and ""Joker""(Tony Curtis), once warring fugitives on the run, to both men's surprise, are still chained to each other, even after the woman, an unconditional racist(Cara Williams), unshackles their wrists. It matters to both of them, if the other one lives or dies. John's concern for Cullen is beyond the woman's comprehension.""What did I do wrong? the single mother asks, when John finds out that the directions she gave Cullen is a death trap. Nothing but bogs and quicksand; nothing to be concerned about, because a black man is nothing. ""Why do you get so excited about that 'Negro' for?"" she screams. It's the late-fifties. The incident involving those three civil rights workers who went missing in Neshoba County was still a little ways off. For now, it's Mississippi simmering. But what was the audience thinking; these average everyday people from an era who internalized institutional racism like breathing? This mutual respect, this male bonding of disparates, welded together by altruistic materials, to a large degree, must have estranged them. Even to the most progressive-minded moviegoer, down deep inside, there existed a latent feeling of repulsion, a self-awareness they would never own up to having. These proto-liberals may have loved jazz, Jackie Robinson, and the idea of civil rights, but when put to the test, in life, or being a voyeur in the dark observing an imitation of life, they recoiled at the idea of a white man choosing friendship(WITH A ""NEGRO""!) over romance(WITH A WOMAN!). Before the sea change in 1964, the year that gave black people the right to vote, the spectacle of a black man in a white woman's house, chained, and then, shockingly unchained, was new to film language. The grandparents sitting in these movie palaces, lest not we forget, saw D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" as small children. They remember Gus pursuing Flora on the mountain. Gus was up to no good; he had only one thing on his mind. It was rhetoric. It was propaganda. It worked. They remember Flora jumping off the mountain. They blamed Gus for the suicide. Cullen, in their estimation, should sleep outside, not on the couch. But they know, however, that mother and son have no choice; they don't begrudge the woman's need to compromise. The small family is counting on ""Joker"" to get them out of this one-horse town. The boy's mother listens to Cullen. John needs a bed. It must be something he ate. Their last meal, frog, roasted over an open fire, is the likely culprit for his indisposed condition. Made in 1958, Stanley Kramer's ""The Defiant Ones"" should be one for the time capsule. But, alas, ""time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', into the future.""<br/><br/>The white chauffeur just bought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He presumes that all black folks love the sizzling and popping sounds a broiler makes in an oil vat. On a nondescript Kentucky two-lane road, in ""Green Book"", Tony Vallelonga(Viggo Mortensen) passes a drumstick over the car seat headrest to his employer, the classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley(Mahershala Ali). He practically waves the drumstick in Don's face. Stop. Rewind. Mull over this for a second. Who is the boss here: the Copacabana ball-busting bouncer with the hair-trigger temper, or the refined musician adored by the cognoscenti who live in the rarefied world of ""haute couture"" circles. Tony should ask first. After all, the two just met. It wasn't so long ago that the Italian-American working stiff, a husband and father of small boys, removed two empty glasses from their kitchen sink because the lips of black men, plumbers who fixed their leaky pipes, drank his wife's freshly squeezed lemonade. He places them gently in the rubbish can. This illiberal action is the predictable repercussions from living in an insular world. Tony's extended family, under the pretense of watching a baseball game, keeps a watchful eye over Dolores(Linda Cardellini) and her unwanted guests. The audience can infer that if Tony was the person of the house, the help would have found themselves drinking from a water hose. Tony, at this juncture, is an honest-to-goodness, unrepentant bigot. But ""Green Book"" treats his antipathetic views toward the ""other"" with a light touch. Played for laughs, Tony refuses to put Don's luggage into the trunk. There is a standoff between this Italian chauffeur and an Indian manservant. Finally, Amit(Iqbal Theba), flabbergasted at such hubris, in a gracious display of humility, relents and does the job. Ha-ha, right? Later, on wheels, Tony needs a roadside bathroom break, somewhere, in woods. The hired man leaves, but then on second thought, returns and grabs his wallet off the dashboard. Don should be outraged and offended, and yet, he gives his driver a bewildered look, when a look of anger and resentment would have been the right emotional visage.<br/><br/>Somewhere along that long drive through the deeply segregated south, ""Green Book"" needed a scene in which Tony opens up about his issues with people of color, a man-to-man talk. The bouncer and the musician, of course, would become lifelong pals, but the film portrays the bond as a foregone conclusion, and skips the growing pains that led up to their mutual respect for each other. ""I've never had fried chicken in my life,"" Don says with dignity barely intact. He should be aghast now, not later on at the plantation house, by this racially-charged slight, but because ""Green Book"" is calibrated to be a feel-good movie, the pianist reacts in a genteel manner, which would seem at odds with an employer being taunted by his paid employee, a subordinate. The car should be ordered to stop, but the car keeps moving, because the filmmaker keeps moving without breaks, without looking at the rear-view mirror. When Don asks for ""plates and utensils"", then complains about how this tactile approach to eating fried chicken will sully his hands and stain the blanket on his lap with grease, the musician's persnickety mannerisms has the accidental effect of being an alternative minstrel show. Don Shirley dons whiteface. Later, the ugly stereotype gets reintroduced, in which the honored guest at a formal dinner, is served the aforementioned bird by his host, a patron of the arts. Needless to say, the music lovers who join Don at the fancy table, coos in approval. Finally, here is racism, without the kid gloves, without training wheels.But it's too little, too late. The intended shock that we're supposed to feel never registers in full. The horror of the moment has been destigmatized, because such categorical pigeonholing that dictates the preferences and abhorrences of lower men as deemed by the gatekeepers, played as comedy the first time around. When all the brown flesh is torn away from the drumstick, Don asks, ""What do we do about the bones?"" The presumptuous chauffeur takes his skeleton breast and flings it out the car window. The piano virtuoso does so, likewise. He can learn so much from Tony.<br/><br/>""BlacKkKlansman"" ends with an epilogue, a blowtorch of a coda that sets fire to the William Shakespeare quote: ""What's past is prologue."" Unlike ""Green Book"", Spike Lee knows the story of love and hate isn't over. It's the story of Kermit and Pepe. Two sides, watching ""The Defiant Ones"" for the first time, sees the frog that best suits their ideology. Will one side notice that John is the one that gets sick? ""Green Book"" means well. It's not a bad film; it's just the wrong film for our times.<br/><br/>The road trip isn't over."

In these Hollywood period pieces, you normally get the 'prejudice is everywhere even in ourselves' cliche. I think this movie could have used more originality in this subject matter.

","Directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardinelli, Joe Cortese, Dimiter D. Marinov, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tom Virtue, Brian Stepanek, Iqbal Theba, P.J. Byrne, Maggie Nixon. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen), loving husband and father, wise-guy-adjacent tough guy, and casual racist, is selected to drive acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) on an eight-week road trip through the Deep South; no need for the audience to bring the rose-colored shades since all cameras used to shoot this picture apparently had that filter on preset. Old-fashioned to the point of insult, the majority of the running time is spent in the company of both men, who ""learn"" from each other and ""bond"" as a result (at least they both know how to eat fried chicken by the end), although their camaraderie rarely exceeds the level of a second-rate buddy movie. It's a trial to watch good actors like Mortensen and Ali try to breathe life into one of the hokiest and most obvious screenplays for a major motion picture in several years; granted, it doesn't help that Mortensen chooses to play it too broad (the crass Italian-American stereotyping feels pulled less from reality than from sketch comedy). Ali fares a little better, but his tightly-wound but injured stoicism does not profit from the producers' decision to rarely let Shirley be onscreen without Vallelonga, depriving us of critical reactions and emotions that aren't surface-deep and observed through another character's eyes. (There's even a brief episode where it's revealed that Shirley is gay, but Vallelonga barely seems interested and the movie never brings it up again.) Focusing almost entirely on the white character wouldn't have been so problematic if Vallelonga actually showed growth and regret and changed for the better, but he's pretty much the same person he was at the beginning, just willing to accept this specific black man as slightly-more-friend-than-employer. Designed and packaged as crowd-pleasing fare, and the con seemed to work when it nabbed a Best Picture Oscar, but this is little more than a clumsy reversal of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" another inexplicable populist victor that feels a little embarrassing in retrospect.<br/><br/>32/100"

","With the noise it made recently, I could say I was bit disappointed. Overall it was a decent movie but not worthy of the names it grabbed. I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" with much focus on the recent changes.
Times were simpler back in 1989 when ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades' focus became less and less towards the story and more on ""How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?"".
Movie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.
As far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we'd expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for ""Eastern Promises"".
The Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow."

","'Green Book (2018)' is supposed to be this heart-warming, 'feel-good' type of film but it doesn't really come across that way. You can tell that's its intention, though, and, indeed, it's perhaps the only angle from which the piece is at least somewhat successful. There's an undeniable chemistry between its two leads and their banter provides intermittent entertainment, but I wouldn't say it comes close to being emotionally impactful. Their friendship isn't all that convincing mainly because it develops rather quickly and because neither of them are fully rounded characters. It has some deeper issues, too. Not only is its message incredibly simple, and arguably somewhat retrograde, but it's also impeached in a number of scenes. During these, the flick makes decisions that are questionable at best and incompetent at worst. Of course, there is a rather genuine debate surrounding the validity of crowd-pleasing, consumer-friendly work that tackles serious themes. This piece, however, feels basic in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it goes about doing it. I wouldn't even say it's all that successful at it. Even on face-value, the film feels old-fashioned and oddly paced. Still, I won't disregard its occasional enjoyable moments. It's not awful, by any means. It's just that when you compare it to thematically-similar - and awards-competing - work like 'BlacKkKlansman (2018)', you start to see where it falls short. To be honest, it's not really what we need right now. 5/10"

While I'm not one that likes to see politics in movies much less talk about politics, however, this film approached the topic of race in a respectful and less obnoxious way. Many have said this remark before about the film, so I will continue it by saying it was well acted, well written, well told, overall great movie! Performances from both Viggo and Mahershala were profoundly enjoyable, envisioning real people that you almost wish you were able to meet in real life. The screenplay or writing for it was told once again with a lot of heart, but also found itself being a good personal, conversational script where you as an audience member can find yourself feeling like you could have a similar conversation with someone you know. One of the biggest aspects of this film that I found impactful was the key ethnic demographic as being an Italian-American myself, this all felt very familiar to me. On one side of my family, they experienced much of the same situations as portrayed in the film being an Italian-American family living in the 50's and 60's America where people were divided. Understanding that we are all the same, which are people trying to live their lives to the fullest regardless of the color of their skin.

","While I enjoyed this film. It was just a reminder how primitive backwards US was just 50 years ago and still an ongoing progression. From ignorance to racism and bad people. I'm surprised it didn't turn out to be a nightmare when people who lived the harshness in life can break a person. I felt mad at some points but the movie was rather entertaining. It was more of a feel good movie and friendship when reality is different than what people endured."
"cem-arican","8","4","8","3 January 2019"," GREEN BOOK
","Green Book is a road story, telling the relationship between a racist Italian-American bodyguard and his boss who is a famous black piano player.
Viggo Mortensen who is playing Tony Lip, the Italian bodyguard, shines as a leading actor. Tony Lip is an uneducated but a practical person. He can even eat 26 hot dogs for money or steal the gangster's precious hat and sell back to the gangster again. We see his racism in the scene he puts the glasses which black workers drank lemonade, to the garbage. He became unemployed when Copa, the nightclub he works, closed for renovation.
At that time the famous piano player Dr. Shirley (played by Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) was looking for a driver for his tour to the southern cities of USA. He needed not only a driver, but a practical man getting things done in the tour program. He was well educated, can speak at least 3 languages, but his social skills is not well developed. He hires Tony Lip and the the tour begins.
We know the director Peter Farrelly and his brother from absurd comedies like The Dumb and The Dumber or There's Something About Mary. Even though there are many scenes that we have laughed in Green Book, we cannot say that is a comedy. Peter Farrelly made a good job with blending comedy, dram, road movie and even romance.
As a summary Green Book is a very good film with solid performances. You will enjoy every minute of this 130 minutes film. One more note, the film was based on a true story. After watching the film, find some Don Shirley music from Spotify or whatever, and listen him and his trio with a glass of whiskey."
"JohnRayPeterson","10","4","8","31 December 2018"," As road trip movies go, it's a gem, and my new fav Christmas movie to watch again next year.
","First, how could you possibly go wrong with the co-stars Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali; the latter, star of the 2017 Oscars best movie, Monlight, a tv series and tv movie star in his own right, the former also twice nominated for best actor, Oscars, the same year Moonlight won the best picture and again for his leading role in the 2007 movie 'Eastern Promises'. Well... I don't think you can.<br/><br/>Now as you may have read, the film is based on a true story. What you probably didn't know is whose story; it's that of Tony Vallelonga, father of the movie's writer Nick Vallelonga. You'll learn more about that in the final credits, and don't miss the photos, the ones I'm sure Nick treasures. If you watch it at home, pause to read the explanations below the photos. By the way, Nick Vallelonga has 50 movie credits, so it's not as if he just came out of the woodwork to tell his dad's story.<br/><br/>For a biography/comedy/DRAMA, and right before Christmas, this was perfect timing. Not only does the movie end with a family Christmas dinner, the mention of making it back on time for that day is a big part of the road trip movie. The ending, though, somewhat predictable, felt great; if you can pull off a no big surprise ending with this much feel good effect, there has to be something special about it. There is.<br/><br/>Many little details all along the movie are both a sign that all parties involved cared to do a good job and a mark of good writing (Brian Hayes Currie and director Peter Farrelli collaborated on, for Nick Vallelonga's script); they did and it was. Viggo and Mahershala delivered excellent performances, and as it's the job of good actors, they made their characters believable. Their scenes together were akin to the chemistry we experienced with Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1990 Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Actor in a leading role, to mention just a few of the Oscars won). Since I've already crossed the spoiler line earlier, I'll just add the very last words spoken in 'Green Book', by the lovable and good looking Linda Cardellini, as a 'tell' of just how perfect the movie was: ""Thank you for helping' him with the letters."" If you haven't seen the movie, it will mean little to you, granted; however, if you have seen it, you know what I mean by perfect.<br/><br/>It's a road trip movie but not the comedy road trip movie you'd expect. It's one of those character development motion picture, the kind us movie lovers crave. And, another spoiler, it promotes moral values, like courage, yes courage, to name one. Oh how thrilled Viggo and Mahershala must have been when they were sent the script for their respective parts and read it for the first time.<br/><br/>Do I recommend you see it? Don't go by my word, check out IMDb, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes ratings and take it for granted they can't all be wrong."

","Green Book is based upon a true story, and one that's important for most people to view. It's regarding race relations the history of discrimination purely based upon a person's color, and not their contributions to their own community, but to society as a whole. This film was beautifully written, directed, and acted. And while I was able to laugh in parts, I found it more drama than comedy. I strongly encourage more people to view this to fully comprehend what our past has allowed white people to do to those who aren't the same race or ethnicity."

Viggo and Mahershala provide them in this wonderful movie based on the true life of Tony Vallelonga and Dr. Don Shirley. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about, but I gave it a try and I was absolutely mesmerized by both characters and the way they interacted. Both play off each other brilliantly and again I laughed out loud several times. Viggo should win the Oscar, but wouldn't you know it Mr. Bale is standing in his way. The movie hums along at a nice pace and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. Director Farrelly does it again, this time with two of the most brilliant actors of our time. Green Book is a winner in my book."

"leonbastalicprivate","10","5","11","8 January 2019"," The Finest Movie This Year
","In 2018, the year filled with barely average crowdpleasers and blockbusters, it is hard to find a truly moving movie experience, one that doesn't make you seek the picture's redeeming qualities, instead offering a clean experience based on simplicity and great character arcs and performances.<br/><br/>Without paying much attention to the filmmakers' prior work, I was surprised by Green Book and charmed by its simplistic but masterfully crafted story and tone. It is hard for moviegoers not to get fed up with overly simplified and dumbed down narratives; however, Green Book proves that a complex story isn't a prerequisite for a well-made movie. The narrative is very well structured, the main story arc is the journey, the tour across the Deep South and the bonding of two apparently very different people with very different worldviews. Each scene is meaningful as it introduces a new element to the narrative, or gives a satisfying and positive conclusion to a previously presented problem. The movie is well-paced and each scene is perfectly self-contained, but it adds to the main arc of the characters' journey. It never focuses on one particular encounter for too long, but it never feels rushed.<br/><br/>The two main characters are extraordinary. Tony (Mortensen) is easily understood and it doesn't take much screen time for him to sink in. We meet the man through his habits and the way that he talks, thinks and interacts with the world. The best kind of characterisation isn't done by putting the characters in dramatic situations and offering them difficult choices; it is better to let the viewers observe them in everyday situations. Ali's character Don is far more complex at first, which makes sense in the narrative as he is the exact opposite of Tony. Even though he observes the world from above, he rarely seems cruel or egocentric. His goal is to change the world's view of his people by the courageous act of doing the tour in a part of America where coloured people aren't as welcome. Even though his behaviour is highly sophisticated, he learns the joy of letting go of his routines and narrowminded beliefs. The discovery of newfound freedom brings him positivity and eventually the cure to his self-inflicted loneliness. Being different or deeming oneself better than others isn't a permanent solution to one's social position. The problem is deepened even further by racial stereotypes, as he proves that coloured people shouldn't have been treated as those of lesser value. He both stands up to segregation and develops understanding for the people he considers his own. After the two-hour long journey, Tony accepts Don as no different than his own people and resolves his inner conflict of racial acceptance showing that he's also grown as a person.<br/><br/>Recently/In the intervening years, racial discrimination has become a progressively more present subject. Most movies tend to show the most brutal sides of racism and hardships of the lives of coloured people. Green Book doesn't force us to feel sorry for them; it helps us understand the pain and disgrace discrimination inflicts on an outstanding individual as well as on the entirety of people. It isn't brutal, but humiliating and unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable. The important theme is present in a lighthearted manner, but it still sinks in deep and provokes thought.<br/><br/>Green Book is visually fantastic as it maintains a simple aesthetic and the visuals of the 60s without becoming overly stylized or too raw and bland. The score is fitting, and the piano pieces are as unique as they are described in the story. Overall it's some of the best movie experiences if not the best of 2018, and I would recommend it to both quality movie lovers and people seeking a simple smart comedy with a heartwarming tone and message."
"phiko73-744-69913","9","5","11","8 January 2019"," Simply delightful
","Literally just finished watching this movie and could not be happier.<br/><br/>It is an incredible story about how two men from different backgrounds subtly and not-so-subtly effect each other and the men they are.<br/><br/>Mortensen is at his best again. He is a phenomenal actor whose body of work is based on strong dramatic performances. This was one of the few times we have had the opportunity to witness him in a truly ""character"" role. His ability to perform captivates and entrances, and you often forget that it is Viggo. While he has steep competition against Malek for the Oscar, I think that Mortensen has the best chance to take it this year among possible nominees, aside from Malek.<br/><br/>Ali's performance is nothing short of outstanding. He is an absolutely fantastic actor with an ever-increasing background of fine films. While he is being billed as ""supporting"" for this film, without his presence in the role, this film would have not been what it is. I cannot picture anyone else speaking the lines in this movie. It was made for him, and this year's Oscar will be too.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, prepare yourself for a fantastic journey, and watch this film as soon as you can. You won't be disappointed."

","Peter Farrelly's Green Book is the most pleasurable piece of cinema - which is both majestically crafted (Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen kill it) and socially relevant (it's about racism in the US of 1960s) - that I have seen (since the 2011 French drama The Intouchables) so far of everything that came out in 2018 that I have already decided to dedicate the whole of 2019 to singing its praises to every other person I meet who is interested in films.

My first impression is that it will be a shame if Viggo Mortensen does not win an award for his performance. He was absolutely incredible--every single line the entire movie. He nailed it.<br/><br/>
I gave this a 9/10 instead of 10/10 only because it had the slightest ""Disney"" feel to it. NOT a big deal, but I'm the kind of reviewer that reserves a 10/10 for just a very few movies.<br/><br/>

","Green Book has a lot going for it. A story so incredible, it would be hard to believe if it weren't based on real life. Two fantastic actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali giving best performances I've seen from them. (Not that I've seen that much, but I thought the latter was 10 times better here than in Moonlight that got him an Oscar). And Peter Farelli's precise, no frills direction, which I felt was perfect for the story. Parts of it were unavoidably predictable - a black man goes to the deep south in 1962 to perform to all white audiences - bad things are bound to happen. But nearly every predictable episode had a quite unpredictable resolution. And I loved how Tony wasn't just transformed by the extreme racism he witnessed - towards someone he knew and have come to respect, he was also kind of cultured by his overeducated boss. And the fact that Tony was the one who in turn introduced Dr. Shirley, sometimes rather forcefully, to African American music and food was a nice touch."
"cardsrock","9","5","11","22 December 2018"," A must-see film that confronts real issues
","Green Book isn't terribly subtle in its message, but boy is it effective. Two strong leading performances anchor the central relationship that makes this film so compelling. This film is all about understanding the situations and circumstances that others deal with. One can never truly understand another's experiences and Green Book acknowledges that, but you can try and ultimately you can have respect for each other. Watching the journey of both characters learning this is why this film is such a crowd-pleaser and one of the best films of the year."

","I went into the cinema for 10 minutes and saw a lot of people leaving. I thought the movie was definitely not good, but to my surprise, the film was not bad. Maybe the film was opened for more than 10 minutes. Character has been laying the ground for too long.
The Green Book is a distinctive road movie. I never imagined that a black people affirmative film would be conceived from the perspective of road movies. The road movies have a strong characteristic as narrating a story.
The emotional relationship between characters becomes strong with the increase of mileage, and the personality of the characters is clearly revealed with the increase of mileage. Dr.Don Shirley and Tony Lip are gradually becoming friends on their road of tour.
Some people think that road movies are very simple, because the clues are clear and the narrative is simple. Just make clear what is happening on the road. In fact, road movies are the easiest to become a self-speaking film without any focus. In fact, this movie has not completely escaped this threat. It is true that there is a constant episode in the film on the road, showing the relationship between the two, and then Tony understands Don's practice for him to come forward. But after all, there is no major outbreak, and the whole story lacks a core chapter. Several equally important chapters have made the film without any major ups and downs."

In an initial scene, Tony puts a couple of glasses in the bin because his wife has let two black workmen drink out of them. But the level of fanatical racism this implies pretty much vanishes when Tony meets Don. So their road trip to self-discovery begins, and we hold our breath for when the white boy racists inevitably show up, or for when Shirley wishes to use the white bathroom at those grand places where he has been booked to play.

","I'm not intentionally watching films that show America in a bad light I promise. Sure it starts all fun and games, with gangsters, punch-ups and nightclubs, give it a few minutes though and we cut to the chase, racism. There's much more going on here than just black and white. Throw in cultural differences, class clashes, homophobia, it's a melting pot of issues. Sometimes played for laughs with the racism matter of fact, sometimes not, with blood drawn. Prejudices take many forms. The balm that eases tensions, teaches respect... music. As Viggo Mortensen's character says ""It's a complicated world"", but watching him and Mahershala Ali, learn from each other as they travel the deep south really is pretty wonderful. As the (true) story progresses, you could be forgiven for thinking it's getting a little softer, twee, less edgy, but really it's just hopeful. In a country that still has race issues, it needs all the hope it can get."

We didn't really get to see him change his perspective and his thoughts about Doc.

It's got some humor like when Tony introduces Shirley to fried chicken. The final when Shirley stands up for himself at the restaurant and won't back down was very good. A really good message behind it. And then he goes to the bar and plays the blues with some other musicians. The acting by both leads was top notch. I see why both were nominated and why Ali won. And considering most films now days are not that good, I think this was a good pick for best picture.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Great story , definitely check it out."

It feel to me more like a movie to help make non people of colour feel good about the ""progress we've made"" as a society. It's still a black man's story through the lens of a white man. It still has the black man giving in and coming back to the white man at the end. It certainly illustrates overcoming prejudice but, I don't feel like this portrayal goes much further than that."

No. I'm predicting now that this film will forever be labeled as one of the weird upsets that inevitably happen in the Academy's history. Was this the worst outcome for Best Picture this year? No, they could've given it to ""Black Panther""."

","That's what this movie perfectly showcases. It's about a highly respectable and highly regarded African American pianist who dares venture into the highly discriminatory and apartheid realm of the Southern United States in 1962. He's treated with acclaim at the beginning of his tour, but slowly, as his chauffeur/ bodyguard & assistant (wonderfully played by Viggo Mortenson) drive further South , the more inhuman and disturbing the situation becomes.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali is absolutely terrific as the highly cultured and professional pianist, Dr. Shirley, who demands respect and appreciation for his musical talents, but later realizes just how much ""race"" and treatment depended on who he was.<br/><br/>His dignity is highly apparent at the beginning, but as the tour gradually moved further South, you could could he had trouble ""keeping it together"" and trying to deal with just how truly demeaning and disrespected a man in his situation could be in at that time.<br/><br/>He even admitted to Tony his ""alienation"" from who he was and how he couldn't relate to either black or white. Tony, an apparent racist at first, does gradually come to his senses about the annoying obstacles of racism, but gradually learns to deal with it in a ""less violent way"". That's the major potency of this film.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful movie and tugs on the heart strings in a lot of ways. It can really make you think and question the status a person can be in no matter where they are. We'd all like to think we'll be treated like equals no matter what part of Earth we might venture in, but sometimes it's not that way. This film terrifically addresses that issue. I highly recommend it."

Before they have spent time with you, people will judge each other based on skin color, weight, clothing style, etc, before they have even heard you speak.

","I was skeptical when my wife raved about Green Book , but I do like Viggo Mortensen and Linda Cardellini. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was astonished at the no frills, matter of fact style of a story that it told about a courageous black musician and a rough around the edges sweetheart of a guy from Brooklyn. The way the two characters evolve and the friendship that stems from the experience of touring in the deep south is truly a pleasure to watch."
"neobateman","8","2","3","23 April 2019"," Funny fluffy comedy about a oppressive time in American history.
","Green Book certainly stirred up controversy when it unexpectedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. I personally didn't care as I lost interest in the Oscars completely (these are the people that nominated Black Panther for Best Picture). Certainly is the film in my Top 5 favorites of 2018, not really. That doesn't mean however that Green Book isn't an endearing, enjoyable and above all funny film about friendship and acceptance. The themes of this film have been highlighted around a zillion times in other films such as The Help. However that doesn't mean that the formula is broken. I for one appreciated this films humor, performances and story. A tough Italian brute (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for a new job. He is hired by an African American musician (Mahershala Ali) to drive him through the Southern States in the early 1960s for a tour. The film wisely goes for humor over melodrama which is what sets it apart from all the other films about this topic. Not that the film doesn't have dramatic moments, in fact these are all the more effective because the two main characters were so likeable and funny. Mortensen gave such a heartwarming performance. His character is a brute, he doesn't mind getting physical when someone pisses him off. But his character also expressed such an aura of warmth were the audience simply gravitated towards him. He doesn't understand the racism, he doesn't get the absolute treacherous and human rights violating laws of Jim Crow under which African Americans suffered. However the film wisely never preaches about the privileged white man not knowing the truth, it just shows it, plain and simple. Ali too gave a terrific performance, his character had a sense of sophistication and coolness even in intense situations. It is incredibly heart wrenching to see such a professional guy who lives his passion pushed to his breaking point by his societies' racist rules. Overall there is not much else to say about Green Book. The themes are obvious and the film doesn't attempt to hide it. Mortensen and Ali are terrific and share great chemistry. A heartwarming family film that allows children to have a more sanitized look into America's darkest points of history. No 12 Years A Slave but still a good time."

"arungeorge13","8","2","3","4 March 2019"," Works largely because of the solid screenplay and the stellar performances of the leads! [+82%]
","'Green Book' definitely plays to the strengths of its two magnificent leads Viggo Mortensen, who plays Tony Lip (a chauffeur who loves his family), and Mahershala Ali, who plays iconic pianist Don Shirley. The film is told majorly from the perspective of Tony, who at the beginning of the film is going through a troubled time after the club he works for, is closed under unforeseen circumstances. This is when he ends up taking a chauffeur-cum-bodyguard job for Shirley who's taking a tour of the South. The pianist makes his entry a good 15-20 minutes in, and by then, we already have an idea what kind of a person Tony is, and what his stand against people from other backgrounds is.<br/><br/>The film builds the relationship between Shirley and Tony one scene at a time, and it does so, at an unhurried pace. Tony realizes how big of a talent Shirley really is, yet he observes Shirley subjecting himself to a tonne of atrocities coming his way by his contractors simply because he is a Jamaican-American. That being said, the film does make us ha-ha a fair bit as well when it's not busy trying to create a 'moment'. The scene where Tony introduces Shirley to Kentucky Fried Chicken is a laugh-riot!<br/><br/>Shirley is safe in the hands of Mahershala Ali whose realistic shades make the character truly magnetic. Mortensen seems to have had a blast playing Tony and it shows. For a movie that has a legendary pianist at its core, the music (by Kris Bowers, additionally a recording by Shirley himself was used; Robert Plant also played a key role in recommending the kind of upbeat music that keeps the film musically rich) is pretty convincing. Ali does his bit to make us feel the effort put in by Shirley during each of his contractual performances.<br/><br/>Linda Cardellini (who plays Tony's wife Dolores) and the rest of the cast provide ample support. Even if one feels that it employs the 'white savior' trope to an extent, the film, on a larger scale, is about how the Tony and Shirley play off each other during their casual conversations and the wonderfully brewing friendship between the two. The title, a reference to the motoring guide for the colored in the Southern part of the States from those trying times, is a subtle shade in itself. The motel-halts made by Tony and Shirley during their journey act as the playground for pivotal incidents that lead to strengthening the bond and levels of compassion between the trash-talking driver and the want-no-trouble pianist.<br/><br/>Green Book makes you guffaw, shed a tear, and feel good at the end of it all - certainly worth the viewing! It will surely win you over with its earnest storytelling, outstanding performances, and the unconventional chemistry between its leads. Knowing when to be funny and serious, the film touches upon a number of concepts that require open discussion in the modern era. Peter Farrelly, known so far as the co-creator of several slapstick comedies (with his brother Bobby), strikes gold in his first solo directorial."

","I watched this movie on the back of its Oscar success. And it did not disappoint.. The story is of two opposite characters finding alignment in a troubled time.

","I get all the nominations for this movie, it's a good movie with class acting from both major characters, Mahershala Ali as Doctor Don Shirley and Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip. Since it's inspired from a real story it's even better as you feel the mood from the movie even more, that Southern racism that as been indoctrinated since the early age, it's something you'll never get used to, knowing it's not that a long time ago that there were different rules and rights for black and white people. It's disgusting and makes me mad, but this movie is also about dignity, ignorant speculation, dealing with problems in a different way, friendship and much more.

The music of this movie was also very good specially the final performance by Dr.Shirley.

There was real chemistry between the characters despite their obvious differences, interests and upbringings.

"martimusross","10","2","3","13 February 2019"," A Really Great Movie
","Wow, this movie had just about everything you could want, incredible story, brilliant acting, amazing cinematography and authentic sets dragging us back to the post war years.<br/><br/>The story ran at two levels, the first being the clash of two worlds and the coming together in mutual respect, and dare I say it love, and enduring friendship. The second was allegorical, with Tony Lip representing the American consciousness of the time, fixed, opinionated, racist, white and masculine. Don Shirley represented a whole collection of threats to these societal attitudes and by undertaking a concert tour in the ""deep south"", consciously anticipated trouble. It was clear that Don in his own quiet way was doing his bit for the civil rights movement.<br/><br/>Both leads were breathtaking in their attention to their craft, Mr Mortensen depth of characterisation was masterful, we all new Tony, we had all met a Tony and we all respected Tony who new his place and inadequacies but was not frightened of facing his demons. Mr Ali used micro gestures and method to convey a talented, fragile loner who we all just wanted to hug.<br/><br/>If I had two Oscars to hand out I would give one to Mr Mortensen and one to Mr Ali.<br/><br/>I would draw attention to one scene that was so powerful we writhed in our seats and some weak souls cried openly, not me! When Don Shirley said ""I'm not white enough, I'm not black enough, I'm not man enough, who am I!<br/><br/>This is a must see, I can see why the movie was called Green Book, but really Mr Shirley's Driver would have been better."

Don't be misled however, this film is in no shortage of comic moments to be found in the partnership between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali; which goes from strength to strength. It must be said that both fully are deserving their respective Oscar nominations. Furthermore, the issue of race is dealt with in a notably tasteful manor; underpinning the story plot by vividly portraying the struggles of a black man in Southern America. Nonetheless, the film succeeds in almost having a 'feel-good' theme with respect to the relationship between Dr Don Shirley and Tony Lip, which blossoms as their journey goes on, overcoming both their own respective prejudices and the prejudices of the people around them."

","I already said in one of my previous reviews that this was fixing up to be a great year for cinema lovers. And so far, it has lived up to expectations. Not only has the output of movies been great, but it also seems that the Academy heads this year have made a sensible selection; this movie having been included in the category for best film of the year. Academy accolades aside, this a truly remarkable film, especially coming from a director, Peter Farelly, who, so far, has specialised in the comedy genre.
This is a huge departure from his previous body of work and it shows that, given the right script and the right assemble of actors, he can be a huge game changer when it comes to telling heartwarming stories about flawed, but ultimately, good-hearted characters. Beautifully shot ( the production design is especially remarkable) , written and acted ( Viggo Mortensen surprises once again in one of his most nuanced performances to date and Marhershala Ali delivers another strong performance, in what it's turning out to be an outstanding acting career), this is truly one of the best movies l've seen this year, and unlike so many others Oscar winning movies, one that is destined to live long in the memory of its audience.

I really hated Viggo's character Tony at first but he redeemed himself by the end, and what a positive message to send: fight hate and prejudice with love and loyalty. Tony became loyal to this man because of experiences he never realized could affect him. His face when he hears Doc play for the first time... priceless. He decides to respect his friend's humanity first and foremost because we ALL have a choice to be decent human beings. It's a really wonderful change for anyone to make.

We've seen it so many times before that we know what is going to happen when we see the movie poster. In that sense, it is nothing new and nothing special. What I think puts this film a step above the rest is the acting. Specifically, Viggo Mortensen. I think he does a very nice job of playing the cliche endearing scumbag. He's funny but competent and that does a lot for the movie. Mahershala Ali also does a decent job but I don't think it's anything special. He does well with the limited range that the script allows. Since the film is centered almost entirely around them, it is entertaining and able to keep your attention. However, not all of the acting was good. The more the Italian family was in the film, the worse it got. It's just so uncomfortable watching such a cliche loud Italian family. Other transgressions that I think the film commits include Mortensen's character having contradictory views on race and the frequent contrived teaching points. These types of things are expected in this kind of movie but that doesn't make them any less diminishing. Overall, it is a decent film that almost overcomes it's genre."

","Being an obsessed music nerd (especially for THE VERY BEST music ever made from the early 1900's towards the 70's, such as american/british jazz, blues and rocknroll) this movie got my attention and impressed me by default. But then the script, storytelling, actors and the 60's atmosphere were easily added to my overall opinion that this may be one of the most interesting (and important) flicks made in a long long while. The segregation sensmorale was wellmade in the movie, with excellent acting by Viggo and Mahershala. A memorable drama with a heavy splash of timeless music but also some well timed tunes of comic relief."

","This is a hugely enjoyable movie that shows how far race relations in America has come and perhaps also how far it still has to go, told with a good storyline, simple plot device (the road trip) but most of all with really sympathetic lead characters. Two opposites in NY life, Tony Lip, the working class Italian nightclub bouncer from the Bronx ( Viggo Mortensen) and the world class African American pianist Dr Don Shirley ( Mahershala Ali) who lived in a flat above Carnegie Hall, team up for a tour down South. Based on a true story, the road trip shows us that opposite characters can learn humanity and civil understanding of another's world viewpoint from each other in an entertaining and humourous way, and survive the dangers, prejudices and stark reality of life in the Deep South in 1962. Go see it with an open heart and mind and you will be entertained and educated as you enjoy this tale of two men's journey towards mutual understanding."

","Green Book<br/><br/>Rating: A-<br/><br/>Green Book is a rare style of film these days in Hollywood. It's a drama, without being unrealistic and drawn out. A comedy, with a sincere, very relevant message.<br/><br/>Set back in 1962, we meet Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), an impulsive, profanity using, Italian-American bouncer living in New York. After he loses his job, he gains an interview with Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an enigmatic, African-American pianist, who offers Tony the task of driving him around from gig to gig. The problem being that Dr. Shirley was to be playing down south, where people were not as accepting of his race. Tony agrees, even though the job will require him to be absent from his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and his two young sons.<br/><br/>Tony and Dr. Shirley seem opposites in many ways, however they are both outcasts, and use their differences from the normal folk to connect with each other. Through the movie, Tony becomes more accepting of people that may have seen worlds apart to him before, and he becomes protective of Dr. Shirley, and strives to become more in touch with his emotions. Whereas Dr. Shirley realizes just how different he is from most African-Americans at that time, him being a rich pianist with no wife or children to take care of. With Tony's influence, Dr. Shirley also becomes less uptight and willing to let loose every now and then.<br/><br/>Green Book has something for everyone and deserves all the awards attention it has been getting. Don't miss this wonderful movie!"

","American goofball comedy purveyors, one half of the Farrelly brothers goes solo, Peter Farrelly's GREEN BOOK is this year's Oscar hopeful, and could, very possibly pull a DRIVING MISS DAISY win against more high-brow heavyweights, Alfonso Cuarón's ROMA and Yorgos Lanthimos'' THE FAVOURITE, both lead 10 nominations.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it is a pertinent reversal of Bruce Beresford's surprising Oscar champ (both are snubbed for nominations for its directors), inspired by the true events in the 60s, NYC bouncer, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Mortensen), an Italian family man, is hired by black pianist ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Ali) as his chauffeur to accompany him an eight-week concert tour in the Deep South, during which, the pair has to inure deep-seated racism and commences a heartfelt bonding process that is riddled with laughter and compassion, all to flog the obvious ideology to death (and introducing the obsolete concept of what is a ""green book"") with an unpopular white savior designation.<br/><br/>That said, the film itself will hearteningly cruise any skeptical viewer to its finish line, and most of the credit goes to the two leaders, Mortensen, vanishingly disappears from his lean physique and balloons into a typical foodie with a daddy bod, whose tucking-in scenes are so achingly funny, and Farrelly surely splurges on them, with fried chicken being put into great use into elucidating Don's awkward position as a fish out of water among either white or black folks, for his skin color or erudite miens. Mortensen's physical transmogrification welds eloquently with Tony's philistine, rough-diamond characteristics that in spite of being a total cliché, the whole package of Tony Lip resoundingly connects with audience, preponderantly because of Mortensen's brio and commitment.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mahershala Ali has an inherent advantage that lies in Doc's unique otherness, which visually, is pointed up by Farrelly's unsubtle arrangement (that collect gaze from black farmers working in the field just betrays Farrelly's lack of imagination and flourish as a director), but Ali, has become the undivided cynosure ever since Don's grand entrance, and gradually, stories of Don's background emerge and his distinct make-up rounds out through many unsavory encounters with local racists and convos with Tony (who unfortunately shifts more into an onlooker or fixer as their journey continues). Never distracted from being charismatic, Ali affectionately impersonates Don's contradicted feelings, his anal-retentive, prissy inclination and most of all, a beautifully rendered vulnerability, which makes his ambidexterity of piano woodshedding more like the icing on the cake. One might surmise Oscar voters are collectively rueing the day that they have given Ali his Oscar far too soon for MOONLIGHT (2016), yes Oscar No. 2 is his, albeit it is an unequivocal leading role.<br/><br/>GREEN BOOK's script makes good with minutiae such as a (presumably stolen) jade stone, Tony's letters to his homebound wife Dolores (Cardellini, shoehorned in the ideal wife part), who is given the most gratifying line to utter when she finally meets Don in the end, and the well-mined twist of whether Tony brings a gun or not.<br/><br/>Last but definitely not the least, the movie doesn't shy from implicating Don's closeted identity (at the risk of offending Don's real-life family, though), a telling sign that homosexuality has finally earned a tiny toehold in mainstream production that no longer needs a full feature fixated on it for special treatment, just put it there, as it is in life.<br/><br/>Although congenitally mired in the backlash of its inception from Tony's heirs, co-producer-cum-co-writer Nick Vallelonga is Tony's son, but as a film per se, GREEN BOOK is categorically a massive-appealing, cracker-barrel, feel-good gas bestowed with two tours-de-force and slightly burdened by a less luminous journeyman behind the wheel."

Tony Lip is an Italian American who sticks to his own people but he needs this job. The job is to drive Don around on a road tour down to the deep south for concerts. It is set in 1962 based on a true story where race relations was it its height. The characters at first don't get on very well they have tackle the racial issues in the south. But they really grow a relationship with each other to try and get over prejudices. Ali is a magnificent actor he proved it when he won the Oscar for Moonlight in 2016 and he proves it again here. Viggo is also brilliant and his perfectly cast for this role. The film was written by Tony Lip's son and you can see the affection the screenplay has for these two real life characters.

"chi_town_fed","8","1","1","6 July 2019"," Well written. Great casting. Extremely well performed. A slight liberal bias (but that's okay).
","Really enjoyed this film. Unfortunately it portrays everyone in the south as mouth-breathing racists and most people in the north as accepting and willing to grow, which is a lie but that is okay. I am from Chicago. I guarantee that I experienced racism in my city. However, I did experience racism more overtly in the deep south to the point of a coward spitting tobacco on my car when I was in a store. I was in the military at the time protecting this country, which speaks volumes.<br/><br/>In my view, this film also fails to portray how the average African American would have likely viewed the lead with more disdain as an ""Uncle Tom."" They touch on this aspect very briefly during a scene involving a game of horseshoes. Other than that it appears that he is embraced and admired by other African Americans versus shunned for his mannerism and success. That said, no film will ever satisfy everyone 100 percent. Overall, I give the writers, actors, and directors a huge ""thumbs up"" for this film. Bravo! However, considering the character of the driver and his associates, I sometimes wonder if Italians get tired of seeing themselves portrayed as mobsters and hustlers.<br/><br/>I applaud this film. It is a fresh, must needed reminder of reality. Too many people today seem to think this centuries old issue doesn't impact our lives anymore.<br/><br/>I personally hold no grudge against anyone simply because of their ethnicity. I don't care what ""color"" you are. If your heart is in the right place that is all that matters. Although there are still many cowardly racists in this country, there are far more people of all ethnicities who oppose their ignorance.<br/><br/>This film struck a good balance in broaching a very serious and emotional issue without being divisive. It shows the growth of some of the characters along the way.<br/><br/>Last thought. This film included a scene for the sake of pushing a lifestyle agenda that I could have done without. I am simply tired of Hollywood injecting their personal views in virtually every film today. Even so-called news networks are nothing more than political propaganda machines. It would be nice if the industry would keep their personal viewpoints out of their business just like I do when I go to work each day."

"patriciogl10","8","1","1","13 May 2019"," Beautiful depiction of human bond.
","When I first found out about this film I was hyped, mainly because of the pairing of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. I mean, they are both such fantastic actors and come from very different filmic backgrounds so I was definitely interested. Also what caught my attention was Peter Farrelly's shift towards a drama picture. The fact that it involved a character being a classical pianist was a plus. It seemed like a recipe for a perfect film, yet it lacked some ingredients. I actually liked the fact that the racism came from a different place, it had different shades to it. Most of Dr. Don Shirley's audience were of upper class, people with refined tastes such as opera, art and classical music. So naturally, they highly respected him but nevertheless discriminated him because of the colour of his skin. That subtle treatment was done to a great extent in my opinion, rather than
showing merciless violence. Because it reminds us that racism can come in different, more fine-drawn ways that are still quite offensive because of its subtlety, and sometimes non-direct fashion. A lot of people feel that racism was treated quite lightly, to which I believe it was necessary to succesfully capture different nuances of the situation I stated earlier, regarding Dr. Shirley's profession and his target audience.<br/><br/>Viggo and Mahershala give exceptional performances for two very different characters; they depicted Tony and Don's relationship quite well, it was a joy watching pure talent in the screen. Does it have a feel-good tone to it? Yes, this is a story about how two characters were able to look Don Shirley for what he truly is, a wonderful, gifted, highly intelligent human being; no matter the colour of his skin or his sexual orientation; let's not forget this happened in America's darkest decade, that is why their relationship takes a higher meaning.<br/><br/>I deeply enjoyed this film, it was greatly written, beautifully acted and well directed. It's enough for me."
"kuarinofu","7","1","1","6 April 2019"," Tries to pull off a safe approach to a complicated issue (spoiler-free)
","This was a good film and on an EMOTIONAL LEVEL I did enjoy it. The performances were amazing yet I loved Mortensen's one better (hard to believe he's Danish).<br/><br/>The big problem about it though is that it tries to be too safe and kid-friendly. At times it really feels like it was written as a cristmas miracle story for kids to enjoy.<br/><br/>It kind of wants be a serious story about the morale and the people of the time, but everyone besides the main duo are too cartoonish to be beliveable. It kind of brings up the issues of racial segregation but it's afraid to show real racist white people and the negatives from the other side. It shows hard working African Americans on the field to give contrast to the Doc (and to show later that he doesn't feel like he belongs to anyone, even his own people) but it falls into some sort of social justice commentary, when the whole point of capitalism was to give equal opportunities, so if the Doc was educated, worked hard and was paid well it doesn't mean he has to feel guilty before those hardworking farmers. The YMCA reveal scene was kind of made to show why Frank is called ""Tonly Lip"" but the set up was so unnecessary forced I can't really tell why they went for it in the first place. The ending was cartoonish and family friendly, which is ok, but it really goes on big stretches with some stuff, like the Doc wishing a Merry Christmas to his butler Amit, who's clearly far from being a christian, I mean... You see? It's clearly trying to hard not to offend anyone.<br/><br/>I loved that movie, mostly for the duo, the dialogue and overall chemistry between them, great stuff. But the social commentary, the simplification, the idea behind making this a ""based on a true story"" movie... If they were real people - show us what they were, if not - make this a separate story ""inspired"" by real events.<br/><br/>I just wish it was so much more grounded, I'd enjoy it much more."

","Preface to this review before I get to the art itself: This movie is problematic in more ways than one. Not only does it act as though it solves racism by the end (by simply suggesting that people not be racist), it also uses the concept of the white savior (an ideal that everyone should research), which is definitely a move that should be disposed of. If you're willing to ignore that idealism (although you shouldn't), there's more than a few redeeming qualities to this movie.<br/><br/>Writing/Direction: Who would've thought that the guy who brought the world Dumb and Dumber could deliver such a deft touch? Peter Farrely (Farelly?) gives us a mushy feeling throughout the whole picture and lets us know he's got it under control. Given the fact that the two leads are in a car the whole time, I'm impressed. The writing, while claimed inaccurate by Don Shirley's family, is definitely impressive in that it uses humor in a well-timed way. I will admit that at the end, I did have a warm feeling inside.<br/><br/>Performances: Mahershala Ali has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with so few performances; his performance as Don Shirley truly is the heart of the movie and succeeds as such. Viggo Mortensen is the lead actor and can hold his own as well, from eating an entire pizza uncut to going through an impressive body transformation to showing off his ability to once again master an accent. Viggo and Mahershala's chemistry just makes everything better, so thank you for that. Everyone else in the cast was just fine, they clearly knew the callibur of actors they were working alongside and let them do their thing.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a relatively basic movie. Yeah, there's some fancy music and some period-accurate production design, but it's just nothing special. That combined with the issues it has socially makes this an alright piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Opinion: This did not deserve best picture.<br/><br/>Green book is not revolutionary, nor is it entirely bad, but it certainly is funny through and through.

","This movie was superbly written. Now it's easier to see why it won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar at this year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Green Book was powerfully and yet smoothly executed.

","The sort of movie you can settle into and really enjoy. Was glad when I heard it won best picture.
A few things pushed the boundaries of believability e.g. the way the driver does such an about turn in his racist views when he through away glasses black men had drunk from at the start to throwing open his home to him at the end. Also it was not believable that the classical pianist immediately and spontaneously became a jazz bar/ popular music player in the bar. Also how he suddenly gets a life long passion for fried chicken after not even wanting to touch it at first.
But you can overlook all that and just enjoy. Vigor was unrecognisable to me all through the film even though I'd earlier read that he was in it - a real body transformation!"

","I went to the theater thinking this was fiction. Wrong. It's a darn good film with superb acting by Viggo Mortenson (Tony Lip) and Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley). The interplay between the obnxious Italian bouncer (Tony Lip) and the stuffy black vitruoso brought chuckles, was thought provoking, and didn't just demonize the white guy. It showed both men's humanity and obvious flaws, and if it didn't make racism/segregation seem horrid, it didn't make it look nice. After playing to standing ovations, the good doctor still had to use the outhouse and drive to the colored cafe to eat.<br/><br/>This movie has been lambasted by the PC crowd as too soft on racism (debatable) and too much from the Italian's viewpoint - true, but why is that a crime?. I suspect their real gripe is that Whitey made this film. Well, they can gripe, but most like the movie, and rightfully so."

","GREEN BOOK follows a Viggo Mortenson a man who has a simple life and a loving wife.
One day, he gets a job to drive a pianoist, Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) (Moonlight, True Detective)
They both form a special bond and deeply connect, even though they at times fight with each other.
The movie deals with racism in the south in a very interesting way.
Dr. Shirley is racially profiled and treated harshly by others, due to the color of his skin, what is beautiful is that Viggo accepts him for who he is, and does not judge him.
The movie isn't sad, heartbreaking, it's beautiful, most movies about subject matters such as racism tend to be sad and hard to watch, however, Green Book avoids that.

"CineMuseFilms","8","1","1","18 February 2019"," a witty comedy drama of 1960s US race relations
","One of the most cliché-filled movies of 2018 is also one of the most endearing. Loaded with road film tropes and framed as a 'journey of two unmatched souls', Green Book (2018)is a male-centric essay on 1960s American racism that resonates today.<br/><br/>Rough-neck Italian bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work at the same time that Black-American virtuoso pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) wants to hire a driver for a deep South tour. Tony's reputation precedes him, and Dr Shirley knows that the trip will encounter the sort of problems that a man like Tony can handle. Their first meeting is a parody of cultural difference: the haughty high-brow coloured man in a flowing African robe seated on a throne, meets an uncouth, uneducated, and racist Italian whose belligerence promises safety.<br/><br/>On-screen text provides city and state milestones for the trip, and the deeper south they drive, the more racial hostility they find. Along the way, Tony's lack of culture slowly responds to the sensitive aesthetic of the acclaimed pianist, while Dr Shirley's arrogance is softened by Tony's connection with what matters to ordinary people (like fried chicken and the music of Little Richard). The Green Book in the film's title actually existed and listed safe accommodation for Black American travellers. They are modest rooms compared with those the Carnegie Hall performer wants, but they are sanctuaries from racial vilification. At other times, the predictable scenarios of humiliation include being honoured for his playing while not being allowed to eat with white people or use their toilets.
The narrative arc is tied to the tour and remains low on dramatic tension or plot twists. This is not an action-rich film, rather it's a two-hander character study that unfolds incrementally through the insightful banter between polar opposite personalities. Tony's regular letters to his wife become a recurring motif of mutual support; they start out with monosyllabic banalities and progress into lyrical prose, coached by the literate musician. They begin to care for each other and, when the tour is over, both are unsurprisingly better people for the experience.<br/><br/>The entire weight of this film rests on an intelligently humorous script and sensitive delivery by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. With authenticity and emotional nuance, they have synergy that is rare between males from opposites worlds. The meta-message in Green Booklies in the sad necessity that films like this still need to be made to highlight America's tensions with coloured and culturally different people. The echoes are deafening, with films like BlacKkKlansman(2018)and If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) joining the chorus. Green Booksays more about today than the era it depicts."

Of course Mahershala Ali does not disappoint either, but I see some traits there from his role in House of Cards<br/><br/>In any case a great movie with an engaging plot, heat-warming and still very emotionally charged and with lots to be shocked about in regards to a black man's statue in the 1960s (which continues to be absolutely mindboggling when you realize this was 50+ years ago only)."

The story of two people coming from very opposite background and with many prejudices against each other connects immediately with me. Although the film is set in 1962, many issues shown in the film are still relevant and true.<br/><br/>Still the world is divided on the lines of colour, country, caste, religion, community etc. Most of the problems in world have popped because of these divisions. That is why despite this film being based on a true story, it can be adapted in every country.

","This movie details the relationship between pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and a bouncer named Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who is hired to drive him through the Deep South in 1962 for a two month concert tour. He is to make sure he reaches all the concert destinations and to keep him safe if any trouble should arise, and plenty does. The acting is wonderful, especially by Viggo Mortensen, who portrays an Italian from New York who is a bit rough around the edges compared to the dignified Shirley. Plenty of humor is interspersed within the poignant relationship that develops between the two men. This movie is based on a true story when segregation was the ""norm"", and the Green Book was a travel guide for African Americans that listed hotels that were available for them to stay in, which were often subpar if best. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this movie might not be for you, but if you like movies that show a piece of history and true to life heart-warming stories, then this one is for you!"

"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","1","6 February 2019"," Green Book drives along a smooth road with minimal narrative bumps.
","I'm going to start my review a little differently, addressing many criticisms about the racial issues that are ""glossed over"". Not every film has to be a harrowing depiction of segregation where characters are brutally harmed. Much like in Farrelly's case here, a lighter approach can still produce the same intentions and profound awareness without detracting from the main story itself. That is why I believe Green Book is a resounding success. The racial discrimination is an environmental factor that brings these two opposing personalities closer together, focusing on a story about friendship. Inspired by the true story of Don Shirley, an ingeniously talented pianist, hiring an Italian-American bouncer to be his driver and bodyguard as they tour the deep south. They use ""The Negro Motorist Green Book"" to find hospitality establishments that would accommodate African-American travellers.<br/><br/>The beauty of this straight-forward plot is these two differing characters coming together during a heightened discriminatory phase within society. A white tough-talking brash bouncer who was born and raised in the family orientated Bronx borough, who's narrow point of view makes him a casual racist much like the rest of white Americans at the time, journeys with a black wealthy uptight lonely pianist for a couple of months. It is as formulaic as one would expect, and you know exactly how the film will conclude. Yet, the earnest friendship that blossoms between these two individuals, is something that unexpectedly enveloped me in pure joy. Shirley's acute diction and dignifying mannerisms allows Vallelonga to adopt these traits and make him a better human being. He starts to show compassion and understanding for Shirley, not just as a black employer but as a friend. Conversely Vallelonga provides company for Shirley who often succumbs to loneliness, and soon finds that he has found someone who understands him. Vallelonga's innocent naivety is the key that unlocks Shirley's door of solitude. It is a near-perfect depiction of professional companionship, a friendship I never knew I wanted until now.<br/><br/>What enables these characters to bloom in the Louisiana sun is a surprisingly well-written screenplay that boasts humour and character development. The barrage of witty humour makes up for the lack of dramatic scenes, and actually allows us to connect with these typically closed individuals. Through their banter we instantly start to identify specific characteristics that make them tick, for example Vallelonga has one heck of an appetite and does not stop talking. Meanwhile Shirley's uptight persona means he often lectures Vallelonga on morally correct life choices and attempting to improve his lexicon. The scene where they share a bucket of Kentucky fried chicken is a perfect illustration of two characters breaking each other down and forming a bond. The added attention to Vallelonga's hearty family (wait, was that Velma from 'Scooby-Doo'!?) makes that last scene even more palpable, leaving a profound emotion of pure happiness. However, none of the above could come to fruition if it wasn't for Mortensen and Ali's performances. They were outstanding. Ali in particular gave so much to his character without resorting to melodrama. Subtle touches, like sitting cross legged, asserted Shirley's mannerisms. Mortensen really came into his own here also, and felt a real natural chemistry between himself and Ali. Farrelly's direction, although nothing outstanding, was decent at ensuring the light-hearted tone was consistent throughout.<br/><br/>Many have remarked that this is essentially 'Driving Miss Daisy' but with the races switched for its characters, which is a fair comment and a valid reason as to why it is a formulaic story. And sure some additional drama could've been included to, not necessarily enhance the awareness of racial issues, but the initial conflict between these two opposing characters. Still, it's a delicate film about understanding. Two individuals from opposite backgrounds (both in wealth and race) forming a beautiful friendship on the basis of mutual respect for one another. Plenty of smiles, laughs and general entertainment to be had. So sit back, relax and enjoy the long comfortable drive."

It's not exactly a headline-making story, but it's one ripe for telling to warm the cockles.<br/><br/>Half buddy comedy, half racial drama, the meat of the film is watching these two character interact as they travel from city to city. As far as narrative pacing goes, this is probably where my only criticism lies. It's two hours of traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - dramatic interaction over race - traveling montage - and so on and so forth. While each interaction is different, and each character is fleshed out more as their kinship develops, it still somehow comes off as a little repetitive once you reach the end of the second act. Thankfully the interactions are so good, either from the drama they invoke, or from the subtle comedy, that it chugs along quite pleasantly regardless.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali plays Shirley with a delicate finesse that instantly places him beyond the realms of racial stereotypes. As he later shouts through tears later on in the film - in possibly one of the film's most powerful moments - he's not black enough to be black, but not white enough to be white. He lives a life simultaneously praised and downtrodden on by white people. They want him to come and entertain them, but won't let him use their toilets, or eat in their restaurant. On the stage he earns every ounce of praise, shedding his skin colour entirely, but once he comes off he's just another black man. But not even the black community will accept him. In the most poignant of scenes that displays this, the car overheats and Tony gets out to cool it off and top up the water. Shirley gets out in front of a field being plowed by a group of black people - staged somewhat reminiscent of slavery - dressed to the nines in his expensive suit. The looks he gets rightly makes him feel uncomfortable. Ultimately his unwelcomed existence leads to heaps of loneliness.<br/><br/>But for me the film was all on Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga (or Tony Lip as he's affectionately called). While Shirley finds a friend at the end, and a sense of belonging, Tony finds more as his previous worldview is almost entirely shattered by spending real time with a black man for the first time in his life. At the beginning, he bins two glasses used by black plumbers, while the rest of his family sit there minding the place suspiciously, giving off a racist atmosphere. In truth, Tony starts out as a not particularly likeable guy, and yet you can't help but get behind his charm. He's manipulative, brash, violent, and lacks manners, but he's also entertaining, charming, and loving to his wife and family. As the film goes on, as the friendship develops between him and Shirley, and as he becomes a little less racist as the runtime goes on, he becomes an altogether softer character who's learned lessons of dignity along the way.<br/><br/>Of course from some perspectives one intrinsic problem with the film is how Tony is hailed as a white saviour, and on that point I can't really disagree. Shirley would've been useless without Tony standing up for him (apart from in one instance where this gets them both locked up in jail, and Shirley has to get them out with a particularly important phonecall). Yet at the same time I can't help but feel this is more down to the nature of the two character's personalities rather than their skin colour. Tony is hired as a driver and bodyguard because he's a big guy who can take a punch, and displays a rare loyalty to his charge. Of course he's going to be the saviour, that's what he was employed to do. Shirley on the other hand is a softer pedigree of person. He values personal hygiene far higher than most, he's pampered by his butler, he lives a secluded life by himself without any real knowledge of how the world around him works. He's the type of character, black or not, that needs someone to stand up for him in difficult situations.<br/><br/>Finally on the note of historical accuracy; who cares? This isn't a documentary. I swear I see this about every true story adaptation, but it's a movie for entertainment, that bends the truth in order to get it's point across, and create moments of drama or humour that will enthral it's audience. It's not a blow-by-blow account of Shirley and Tony's roadtrip during those two months. It may not even be entirely truthful to the characters of the real men, but as a movie it just works. It makes you happy, it makes you sad, and ties it's characters and themes together creating one cohesive story.<br/><br/>Green Book was definitely a very enjoyable movie. It was far funnier than I ever expected, and that was something pleasantly surprising. Every interaction between Shirley and Tony feels natural, and the chemistry shared between Mortensen and Ali is fantastic to watch. Whether they're butting heads ideologically or comedically, or coming around to the other's viewpoints, you can't help but root for both of them and the budding friendship. I give Green Book a solid 8/10. I certainly wouldn't be disappointed if it won Best Picture."

Many times throughout the film I was waiting for an over the top, unrealistic display of the characters morals. I am very glad that this never happened, great credit to the Director for allowing the smaller moments to carry the film. In doing so you are given time to think about all these moments and what they mean to you and the characters. These characters evolve through the film as they both learn about themselves and each other. Again not shown with grand gestures but with small changes, just how the main theme of Racism needed to be changed and still does even to this day.
The modesty of the film sets itself apart from other films of its type. It doesn't feel the need to shove its important themes down in your face but hope you have the openness to acknowledge them.
Both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are well worth the watch and both deserving of award nominations as well as the Director Peter Farrelly.
A lovely film that has it all."
"isaacj02","7","1","1","3 February 2019"," Mortensen and Ali shine in charming ride through the Deep South
","Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.
Green Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.
There is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There's a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America.
It seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.
That being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.
In the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances."

","The movie is really fantastic with Viggo and Mahershala giving a very simple excellent performance with me loving Viggo more. The story is superb along with the screenplay of the characters which was very terrific with some awesome quotes that can go on forever.
The best thing I like about the story that it didn't have to be R rated to show racism and give us much violence to describe it. It only showed this with absolutely no loud voice or profanity or anything more than
looks and very simple situation, for me the whole movie is excellent in it's impossible simple way of telling the story with the simple performances that lacked the presence of better music that would have made the scenes a lot more better. Also the whole Green Book matter in the film wasn't clear for me even when it was opened and couldn't understand it's presence that much more than that it's because it's the movie's title!. Also hopped that it didn't get to the sexuality and that kinda stuff which sometimes is not necessary in the movies especially this one and only to attract some audiences which I am totally against. Viggo's character will be me favorite for a long while and for me he was even better than Rami's performance at Bohemian Rhapsody. Mahershala deserve the Oscar that he will win for that strong expressions and emotions although he and Viggo had some entertaining master acting scenes comedy and drama.
In the end, one of all time favorite films and don't miss a chance to see that film 8.5/10"

The pre-desegregationist Deep South might be unfamiliar to many viewers, but the film dealt with the realities of being a Black Person in that awful area with sensitivity and understanding; we admired the scriptwriter's ability to do so.

","In this biography, comedy, drama film directed by Peter Farrelly (There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber) and written by Nick Vallelonga (Vigilante Diaries, I Am Wrath), Brian Hayes Currie (Armageddon, Con Air) and Peter Farrelly, Viggo Mortenson (The Lord of the Rings, A History of Violence) and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, Hidden Figures) star as Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley, a musical virtuoso.<br/><br/>On an enforced leave of absence from his normal job as a tough bouncer at the Copacabana Club, Tony Lip needs to find gameful employment and, after some reservations which includes leaving his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini: Brokeback Mountain, TVs ER), agrees to accompany the American classical pianist on his concert tour of the Deep South states using The Negro Motorist Green Book for places to stay due to racial segregation.<br/><br/>The erudite but snobbish Dr. Shirley clashes with the crude yet practical Tony, their ideals and attitudes to life are at odds but as they travel they come to see the value in and respect for each others' talents.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, this is a powerful story about friendship that transcends barriers and shows us what it means to be truly human. Teaching us to put aside what others tell you, what you are told to believe and really see a person through their actions, words and thoughts. Difference should not be an issue and in this world that is more divided than ever (e.g. Brexit), we can all learn a lot through the honest friendship of these two men. The world should not have needed a green book, but I am hopeful that this film can teach us to not need anything like it again.<br/><br/>The acting was superb and solid scriptwriting, the film has so many layers I feel like I could watch it again and again.<br/><br/>You can tell that the film is based on a real friendship as it never feels contrived and the viewer goes on their journey with them. It truly shows you that friendship should transcend who or what you think or others think you are and the nuanced and poignant performances given by Ali and Mortenson show us that despite social complications, every human wants and needs the same thing, love and acceptance.<br/><br/>The cinema was almost full and at the end of the film, some of the audience broke out into spontaneous clapping. I have never understood that as the writer, director or actors are not there, but I get that people wanted to show their appreciation for how good they thought the film was in some tangible way.<br/><br/>I have been to see The Favourite, Stan and Ollie and Bohemian Rhapsody as well as Green Book this year and I think Green Book is the best movie in this group and deserves to win an Oscar the most."

"alvesmarceloalves-73751","8","1","1","25 January 2019"," A great film
","It is possible to analyze ""Green Book"" from some points of view. It's a film about racism. But it's also a road movie that talks about an unimaginable friendship. It is also a film that shakes the prejudice of deep America, especially the South of the United States. It is still a film about a character who is not in any environment because he is in the rare position of the privileged black and feels a deep loneliness for it. None of this is original. None of this is something that other movies have not talked about in movie history. But how delightful, bothersome and interesting is to follow the journey of pianist Don Shirley (a brilliant Mahershala Ali) and his driver and captain Tony Vallelonga (equally wonderful).<br/><br/>Particularly, ""Green Book"" has more interesting in two of the points above. The first is such an improbable relationship between Tony, this brassy, simple-minded Italian who sees the world so bluntly and directly, separating people into tribes with their own ingrained and unmixed customs, and Shirley, a black man of erudite education, who lives as an isolated king at the top of Carnegie Hall. And it's amazing that even in such ignorance he made Shirley see how far he was from himself.<br/><br/>The story of Peter Farrelly's film is real. In fact in the 1960s, Shirley was a very popular pianist who decided to tour the most racist chants in America. Your objective is touching people's hearts.<br/><br/>But how difficult it is to break historic and archaic barriers. Shirley has to go through some ridiculous situations. At night, he is a brilliant pianist applauded by all white and wealthy audiences. But during the day it's just another black man who can not eat at the same restaurant in his audience or use the same bathroom.<br/><br/>As much as the film does not portray the hell it was to be a black man in that region, and its name comes from a survival guide there, it's still cruel, almost disgusting to anyone who sees everything that Shirley has to go through to keep the idea of your tour alive. It is important, however, as the character himself states, ""maintain dignity"". Only by dignity is overcome the rabid prejudice.<br/><br/>But ""Green Book"" is not only about the pure denunciation of racism in a region of America. It is in the hassle and distance that Shirley himself feels among his peers that the film exposes his signs of greatness. It is by showing that he is not black enough to be among his own, neither white nor man enough to occupy other groups, that ""Green Book"" exposes the terrible loneliness of a man who finds himself in the middle of the path of a triangle over which he does not have the skills, or the supposed qualities, necessary to occupy no vertex.<br/><br/>In a fragmented society that needs labels Shirley is never to be found. It connects to nothing and feels isolated in all environments. His most faithful companion is a carafe of expensive alcohol, which keeps him away from everyone and plunged even more into solitude.<br/><br/>Who are your peers? It is not whites who hate him when he is off the stage and deny him the right to experience a suit in a shop. It is not the black people, with whom he does not connect precisely because he does not share the same rich but different culture from his classical piano education, and by wearing expensive, well-cut suits.<br/><br/>For him, approaching both sides requires an instrument of conciliation for music. Hence his tour trying to repeat something similar that Nat King Cole tried a decade earlier. Its purpose is to touch the hearts of the people and to approach the vertices so far apart appealing to the sense of humanity. To perhaps feel less alone. But also help change the society.<br/><br/>The work, however, is slow and gradual. And in the great friendship that Shirley builds with Tony, a man who shows himself to be racist at the beginning of the film, but whose friendship and partnership with Shirley grows throughout the tour, is that his success can make itself present.<br/><br/>""Green Book"" relies heavily on the excellent work of Ali and Mortensen. It's not by chance that both have received well-deserved Oscar nominations. The first one proves the excellent moment that is living two years after receiving the supporting statuette for ""Moonlight"" (2016). His work on the third season of ""True Detective"" also deserves praise. The second is an actor who is in his third Oscar nomination and almost always does good work.<br/><br/>But beyond that, it is a great story and so necessary to be told in times when racism and prejudice in general against various kinds of peoples, ethnicities, sexual orientations and religions are unfortunately so vivid. They are wounds that still bleed too much when one should work to build a more just and balanced society for all. If each sought to create bridges such as those that united Shirley and Tony, it might be a less lonely, richer and more interesting planet to live for all."

","Oh, this movie is a little gem!<br/><br/>Depicts--by all accounts--authentically this portion of life of Dr. Shirley, and the relationship that developed between Tony and Don Shirley.<br/><br/>The acting was spot-on, with Mortensen effectively conveying 1960's Italian family life in NY, as well as Mahershala Ali and his ""privileged aloofness."" The story could have gone more into detail regarding how Dr. Shirley went from hitting the road with his mother in the Florida Pan-Handle to the ""top of a castle,"" but maybe that would have been too much for the time constraints of the viewer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, and believe it was well-thought out.

","I kind of went into this thinking the issue of racism would dominate and there wold be a lot of those ""important"" messages. It doesn't. The film is about how friendship can transgress boundaries of race, colour, ethnicity. It reminds me a lot of the stories on how the British got Ian Paisley to talk to Martin McGuinness at the height of the troubles in Ireland and their animosity to one another. They made them share the same car. The Green Book is a similar journey and along the way says something important. That we are social beings and a lot of the differences we see between us are contrived and of lessor importance. Watch out for the scene where they argue about who is more black."

The'white' being the chauffeur of the 'black' and their very different characters and backgrounds are the base for both humorous and endearing moment. Through great acting both main characters are brought to life as real life sympatic persons. The story (kind of road movie) is depicted from an actual begin '60 experience. It's about a friendship built against the background of segregated US. Both the (mild) portayal of US segregation and how the respect and friendship evolve makes 'the green book' a strong advocate for respect. Go see and enjoy!"

","Green Book is a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by Peter Farrelly (Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, it is a delightful road movie with terrific performances from both of its actors.<br/><br/>In 1962, New York bouncer Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for extra money after the nightclub he works at closes for renovations. Thanks to one of his friends, Tony lands a job as a chauffeur for ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a talented African-American pianist embarking on a concert tour of the American Deep South. Due to the strong animosity against African-Americans in the Deep South, Tony is required to take on extra work along the way as he is also required to use his skills as a bouncer to protect Doc and ensure he has a safe journey with his band.<br/><br/>Heartfelt and funny, Green Book takes what could have been another generic road trip movie and turns it into one of the most interesting depictions of an otherwise unlikely friendship. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have superb chemistry with each other and the film's witty screenplay frequently had me looking forward to every moment of dialogue between both of them, especially during the driving scenes. The film also does a fantastic job of establishing the prejudiced atmosphere of the American Deep South in the 1960s without making its citizens seem too much like caricatures of typical white supremacists. Director Peter Farrelly near-flawlessly balances the film's comedy and drama, which is surprising as he is primarily known for his work only in the former genre. He has certainly shown he is more than capable of handling films like this and I am hopeful he can keep this up in any future projects he may end up involved in.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"

Mortensen, mob-tied Italian bodyguard named Tony Lip (they called him Tony ""Lip"" because he couldn't shut up), is hired to be Shirley's protection as he tours and performs in an area of the country notorious for racism and bigotry.
The contrast between Shirley and Tony is organically comical. It also naturally leads to endless possibilities for character depth and development, which Farrelly took full advantage of in his exceptional screenplay."

He was given the book right before they left NYC. The movie is perfect in every way. Definitely not a Driving Miss Daisy movie. Just a really good movie that touches on many ""untouchable"" topics and situations and how two very different people handle those situations. The racism in the South is very real. The racism in this country right now is very real. The high point of the movie was the argument between the two men regarding who was blacker. Many middle class white people feel this about affluent black people who have more materialstic things than they do. Money. And integrity. It is a very class and race set of circumstances in which one finds oneself; a state of affairs. But many black people feel they are in a situation where it can't change because of their skin color. It can. We are all people; no matter our ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs etc. This movie really brought that home for me. And it didn't preach or show all the uglies.

I'm not just talking about Ali's piano playing, I'm talking about even the subtle music when the freindship was expanding. It was a visually beautiful and wonderfully done film. I would give it a 10, but apparently there were inconsistencies to real life...but honestly, the message still rings true. No matter what color/sexual preference/ economic status you are, you can always learn something from the someone you weren't expecting. I loved the movie

"dankyfrank","6","1","1","11 January 2019"," Phenomenal tale of hope and empowerment
","Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are the heart and soul of this film. Along with the great cinematography and direction. Green Book confronts racism in a way that is relatable, people keeping there mouth shut instead of confronting what is going on the front of them. You know that this is a great film when you just want to punch that racist guy in the face but you know that that's not what the other character would want. In this film, it's not black and white. If a character makes a decision you take into account how the other people will be affected by it."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","1","9 January 2019"," An amazing feel-good cum Christmas movie and, best of all, a true story
","The ultimate beauty of a bio-pic is that it is a true story. Whether it is deeply touching, violently disturbing or hilariously amusing, the fact that this really happened makes all the difference. ""Green Book"" is one such.<br/><br/>The events took place in the era when the Kennedy Brothers tried to fully accomplish what Abraham Lincoln started. That was the time when, strange as it sounds, the use of the word ""black"" to denote an American with African ethnic origin was almost tabooed. The word ""colored"" was used, and not exactly in a complimentary way. ""Green book"" is a Negro travelling companion, detailing accommodations that a black traveler could safely check into, particularly in the deep south. It was, needless to say, useful when a black classical concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) embarked on a performance tour of his trio (with a cello and a double bass, both played by Caucasian musicians) that would take him deep down south. As chauffer and body guard de facto, he hired Italian New Yorker Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a bouncer temporarily unemployed when the club he worked for underwent a major renovation. The movie is essentially in the familiar genre of road movie featuring an ""odd-couple"".<br/><br/>Two establishing scenes introduce Tony on two fronts - throwing out trouble-makers from the club and enjoying a family life as a devoted husband and father. When it becomes apparent that winning $50 from a hog-dog eating head-to-head challenge would not be sufficient for the family budget during the four months during which he is unemployed, Tony answers to a reference for an interview.<br/><br/>There is an introduction scene to the odd-couple that is a joy to watch. In an elegant upscale waiting room, Tony meets his prospective employer who comes out ""dressed like an African king"", all cool and snobbish. Following up on his enquiries about Tony's resume, Dr. Don Shirley asks ""In what capacity?"" Seeing Tony's look of bewilderment, Don rephrases his question ""What do you do there?"" This deliciously sets the tone of the stereotype-revered odd couple. And, never forget, this is a true story.<br/><br/>The interview is not fruitful. Upon understanding that his job description includes being a ""butler"" (laundry handling, shoe shining etc) Tony turns down the offer, although they part civilly. Don, as well, is not prepared to meet the remuneration Tony seeks. However, reflecting on the high recommendation he received, and realizing that he really needs that caliber of a body guard for his tour, Don calls Tony's wonderful wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) to make the offer again. At the farewell scene, after a passionate kiss, Dolores says to her husband ""You better be home for Christmas or not come home at all"". A seasoned audience will right away recognize this leading to the planned closure.<br/><br/>A pleasure as it is to watch, this road movie does not have installed for you anything you would not expect. Nor does it have to. It is the natural narrative of the story that is so captivating. Tony and Don do not start with the right foot, so to speak. Every time Tony says something he does not like, Don snaps ""Eyes on the wheel, Tony"". They engage in a philosophical debate on the difference between ""bullxxxx"" and ""lie"". The first bonding comes when Tony is flabbergasted to learn that Don does not like music ""of your people"" (such as Chubby Checker). Such sentiments are only surpassed by learning Don's unbelievable ignorance of the joy of fried chicken. Against Don's vehement protest that he has no ""plate and utensils"" in the backseat, Tony finally succeeds in making the music genius discover the joy of fried chickens. In reciprocation, starting from a session on the park bench outside fast food chain, Dom starts coaching Tony in writing, more specifically, letters to Dolores.<br/><br/>On the real business of the trip, we are entertained by short scenes of the Don Shirley Trio's performance at various stops of the tour. While the program is essentially classical there are occasional de tours into popular tunes such as ""Happy Talk"" from the musical ""South Pacific"". The grand finale, insofar as music is concerned, is totally riveting. After walking away from the performance with an institution that reeks bigotry, Don and Tony go to a music bar where the latter is the only white patron. After some prompting, from locals and his pal alike, Don goes to the stage to join the jazz band, delivering a performance that immediately brings to mind ""Treme"", the marvelous TV series that is among the best I have watched.<br/><br/>The various unpleasant to outright dangerous experiences Dr. Shirley encounters throughout the tour are of course predictable. A little surprising is the way Tony handles these unpleasant situations. Yes, on some occasions he lets his fist do the talking, but not always. He can be resourceful and tactful as the need arises. This, matched by Don's impeccable dignity, makes the pair so exceptional. The movie ends with a heartwarming sequence, with the closure on the Christmas theme mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Golden Globe results are in: best supporting actor, best screenplay and best picture (comedy or musical) for ""Green Book"". Ali has a bit of an edge because his role, arguably, is closer to a co-lead than a support. But either way, his top-notch performance is beyond dispute. Mortensen could have won too but, cliché as it is, there is a strong field. I like to pay special tribute to Cardellini whose performance makes Dolores (oh no, entirely unlike the namesake in ""Westworld"") so endearing. For those who may not recognize her, she has the role of another endearing wife, Laura Barton in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""."

","I like to think the Oscar's are based on quality of content, but for many years I feel politics has influenced this award. Since the early 2000s african Americans among others have felt like they were under represented in the Oscars. So we have had years where gays won, african americans have won, all seeming to follow years where there was a big deal made by the acting community. Me I am a mindset of I don't care if you are black white purple gay or prefer the company of chickens. That being said I haven't seen all the films nominated for the Oscar's in 2019 but did see roma, Roma was an exceptional film made by a master filmmaker in the style of another master filmmaker. This was a made for tv movie made by the man who gave us dumb and dumber. Don't get me wrong kingpin and Mary are exceptional comedies. But this is not a great filmmaker making a great film. This is an ok director making an ok movie. Nothing special here, which appeals to the masses I guess, but to a film buff I simply am sick of movies getting awards because it's time for a color, gender, or sexual preference to get that award. They should always be based on merit anything else cheapens an award, and gets me to waste 2 hours watching a film that really was not worth watching."

"lumieretrain","8","4","9","25 February 2019"," Green Book by Peter Farrelly
","The stories about unexpected friendships are recognized for which are inspired by real events, to see the main characters would initially meet each other for the job. Until they would travel together in a journey, which a friendship between them would come out. Some of these stories would end that the main characters would remain connected by keeping seeing each other, others would end that the main characters would separate each of their roads but without forgetting what an incredible bond they have. The filmmaker Peter Farrelly was intrigued to release a movie about friendships, inspired by a real event but without his brother Bobby Farrelly's collaboration. In 2018 came out Green Book by Peter Farrelly, with Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The movie's plot: in 1960s, an Italian-American bouncer Tony Vallelonga or also known as Tony ""Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen), would get a job as driver and bodyguard for the talented jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). For the long venues tour through South America, since they would travel in this journey a friendship between them would come out. The movie is a comedy-drama which mixes both elements to be workable, by using the humor in a natural way without forcing it and the drama can be emotional to be touching. The movie's narration tells the story to catch the audience attention, as the screenplay was elaborated to maintain the rhythm without ruing it. Viggo Mortensen did an excellent performance as Tony Lip, who would act in a rude way when he would take some actions. But since he would travel in the venues tour, he would take care Don Shirley to make sure Don would not get in trouble. In the course of the story Tony would write love letters to his wife, until he would get helped by Don to express better Tony's emotions. Mahershala Ali was extraordinary as Don Shirley who even is a talented jazz pianist, he would be seen with bad eyes because of the racism at the time set on the movie. Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga would find out through the tour, they have many things in common to be then close to each other. They both would also help each other to find solutions, to be surprisingly smart as they would move forward on their journey. Green Book is one of the best 2018's movies, Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both surprisingly extraordinary in the movie."
"celtic451","10","4","9","25 February 2019"," Obviously 10 out of 10
","After I watched this the first thing I thought of was the Oscars. Both Viggo and Ali should win Oscars and then the movie itself should win and probably several other categories. I've been waiting for a Viggo performance like this ever since the Lord of the Rings. What makes this even more interesting is the fact that it is a true story. Viggo was so great that I forgot during the movie that it was Viggo. And Ali was so powerful that I hung on his every word. It's moving, touching, real life, and powerful. I found myself laughing so hard sometimes I was crying, not that it was funny like a comedy, but it was humor that can only come from real life and real moments. Amazing movie. Solid 10.

","It's a powerful movie to portray the reality of racism in our society. Even the story occurred in 1962 with the segregation, and I was amazed by the fact that injustice had slowly progressed over time. As a white man, it seemed to me that racism showed in an obvious way in the past. However, that still run in today's society in more of a discreet way. It's due to the social media where it becomes the world in a smaller place. The stubborn white people become smarter to avoid the obvious. Tony Lip is a perfect example of many naive white men who were being surrounded by blue collars. They're not bothered to learn about the society through a different lens because they see survival in simply way at finest as a priority. Many of them are soft-hearted, but they overlook that sense for the reason of survival.<br/><br/>Dr. Don Shirley is a perfect example of many people of color. They come from well-educated backgrounds that influence their struggles to find the identity. Both worlds are pushing them for different reasons. My family members and my close friends had to go through the phase of being depressed and used substances for escapism, especially in their 20s.<br/><br/>Tony Lip and Dr. Shirley had crossed down from entirely different journeys. Tony's style of approach was interesting and very common for white men. He spoke out of his mind, but Shirley was smart enough to read inside of him. At the same time, Tony pushed Shirley out of his comfort zone with his simple-minded perspective of society. And, Shirley pushed him to be engaged in his feeling and looked through a different lens. The friendship was raw, but they appreciated each other.<br/><br/>It demonstrated that nobody deserves to be quickly judged by others because everyone's journey is different like orange to apple. It had several funny moments that made me laugh, softhearted moments that made me smile, and the message was profound! Well-deserved to win the Best Picture award!"

","The good: this movie has got a charm about it that is undeniably very enjoyable and upbeat, which I quite enjoyed watching. It has a soft outlook on racism without any harsh images of violence, therefore it is suited to be watched by young children as well. Great acting performance by Viggo Mortenson, who really stole the show as an Italian-American bouncer, who first used to hate black people, but learns to like them pretty quickly, when his new boss is black and pays him extraordinary well.<br/><br/>The bad: I must admit I almost fell asleep midway this movie, because the story was purposely made to be so incredibly politically correct, that I got bored beyond belief. The african-american musician is constantly victorious and superior from the very start. The Italian bouncer is portrayed as being completely stupid and racist and ofcourse he will stay stupid, but he overcomes his racism, when his boss pays him extraoridinary well. Both very one dimensional portraits, which become quite boring after a while.<br/><br/>Certainly nothing worthy of a best picture oscar, nor of best supporting actor, but it ofcourse DID win both oscars anyway, because this movie offended nobody and was therefore the perfect example of politically correct thinking, which is what Hollywood really loves, because confirming what everybody else is thinking, (or ought to be thinking), is good for the box office and good for the public image, but it will never produce an intelligent, true to life story about racism. This is a white audiences movie about racism, made FOR white people and made BY white people. Very enjoyable and feelgood nonetheless, but a bit bland and sleep evoking at times."

The story is one that we might have heard again and again and may come across as cliche, but guess what, the vast majority of what happened actually happened.<br/><br/>I can see numerous reviews here attacking the writing with one user claiming that Shirley's apartment is ridiculous, however the real Don Shirley did have an apartment above Carnegie hall. Attacks on Mortensen playing a 'caricature' Italian american, Tony Lip was the definition. He actually was in the sopranos as well as the Godfather and Goodfellas, so it's no cliche and he did not over-act.

"brankovranjkovic","9","3","6","31 January 2019"," Green Book - An unlikely couple become true friends
","Road trip drama with some humour based on a 1960's true story.<br/><br/>Tony Lip is an Italian-American 'wise-guy', who's struggling to provide for his family. There's an important scene at the beginning which demonstrates his racism. He gets an interview to be a driver, but also a driver who could deal with any problems.<br/><br/>Dr. Don Shirley is a black very well educated, very well-mannered, world class classical musician. He's living in isolation on the top floor of Carnegie Hall, he needs driving safely to a series of scheduled concerts in the very prejudice Deep South.<br/><br/>During the numerous journeys they refer to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book,' also known as 'The Negro Traveller's Green Book.' This was a guide for African-American travellers, which listed lodging, restaurants, and other businesses that would serve them. They begin to bond over an incident involving two racist cops, a pub beating, a homosexual scene and even something simple like eating fried chicken in Kentucky.<br/><br/>Don is a brilliant pianist, admired by white audiences, although otherwise he's still just another black man who cannot eat in 'white' restaurants or use the same 'white' bathrooms or try on a suit.<br/><br/>They learn more about each-other and also some deeper things about themselves. Don shows Tony how to live with self-control and dignity, Tony teaching Don how to open up and relax.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a highly recommended instant classic about two unlikely people who find a connection and respect for each other."

The perfect mix of comedy and drama, but it feels so natural thanks to the amazing chemistry of Viggo and Ali. There is not one scene which feels unnecessary or even exaggerated. It is like stepping back in time to 1962 with emphasis on what is really important in life: family, dignity and being true to oneself. There are many movies which try to convey such messages, but none so seamlessly. As important as these messages are, this movie gets a 10/10 because the journey of the two lead characters can be appreciated even more, many thanks to the script, directing and of course the acting.

","Most of the favorable responses accurately capsule this film and don't justify repeating. But such care in producing a fine effort is always diminished when annoyingly full of historical error. Aretha Franklin (referenced) was not a well-known performer in 62. A black police officer on the Macon force in 62? Hummm. Maybe. Lawrence of Arabia (background marquee) not released until a year after the setting. And always, wrong vintage cars being used. And would someone fact check whether Bobby Kennedy convinced George Wallace in 62 to order a small-town police chief to spring both guys within hours after what was, technically, a righteous detention? Come on, two years later he couldn't get a black in 'Bama without Federal Marshalls. Millions spent on such productions are routinely skimped when it comes to due diligence."

Green Book has a simple storyline but a strong message to share: That despite differences and diversity, we are all humans. Farrelly tells it perfectly in the film. What I like in Green Book that I might not like in other films, it's that It goes straight to the point, to what It should tell first. Mahershala Ali's acting is stunning, that I think he's a true contender for a second Oscar; Mortensen's performance is breathtaking as well. Green Book is the proof that you don't have to bring tons of technics to have a good movie, or to be recognized at the Academy Awards for example.

"matt_herold","9","3","6","28 December 2018"," I loved this film
","This is my first review posted on IMDB however I feel compelled to write a review because I loved this film so much.
Warning to bigots: you may not enjoy this film. Thankfully we don't live in the 60's any more where the vast majority of people (mostly in the South) were staunch bigots, however unfortunately there are still enough bigots out there. That's why films like this are so important to make and watch. Granted, the bigots who should watch it the most won't, but the rest of us can enjoy our evolution as human beings.
My words may seem harsh, however the film confronts racism and bigotry in its ludicrous entirety. No need to get into the plot; that should be covered extensively by the plot synopsis. Suffice it to say the walls of race are broken down unexpectedly and the result is a beautiful display of humanity when things go right (that is to say when race is trumped by dignity).
The acting is superb. This film gets 9 out of 10 because I don't feel it's the best film I've ever seen, which I think should be reserved for a perfect 10, although it is damn close. There's a lot of great movies out there and this may not be the best of all time but is absolutely fantastic."

"bob-the-movie-man","10","3","6","23 December 2018"," Vacation without Aggravation
","The ""Green Book"" was a handbook (now, thankfully, out of print) for those of colour travelling in the southern states of the US , who want to stay in or dine at places they will be welcomed rather than abused. It is of course 1962 and Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General has racial equality strongly in his firing line.<br/><br/>The ever-flexible (and here, after piling a lot of weight on, almost unrecognisable) Viggo Mortensen plays Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga - a racist Italian-American living in The Bronx and working as a bouncer at ""The Copacabana"" club. Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali plays Dr Don Shirley - a black virtuoso pianist of high acclaim. How this odd couple meet and interact on a journey from Pitsburg to Birmingham is the heart of the film.<br/><br/>I'm actually loathe to say ANY more about the plot of this film. I saw this at a UK Cineworld ""Secret Screening"" and so went into the film completely blind about the content: which was just BRILLIANT! For this, for me, is as near a perfect road-movie as I am likely to see this or any other decade. To say it is a feelgood Christmas classic to approach ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is not - I think - putting it too strongly.<br/><br/>The film has apparently had Oscar buzz since winning the Toronto Film Festival's ""People's Choice"" award, and the chemistry that builds up between Ali and Mortensen is just fantastic. While I'm a fan of Mortensen (""Captain Fantastic"" was a minor classic), it is Ali's performance as the gentle and mannered Shirley which impresses most, and would be my pick for the Oscar nomination if I had to choose between them.<br/><br/>Also truly impressive is ER's Linda Cardllini as Tony's wife Dolores: her reactions to ""Tony's"" letters home are just exquisite. I wonder whether a Supporting Actress nomination might be deserved here also.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Brian Hayes Currie, Peter Farrelly and Nick Vallelonga (Tony's son.... yes, this is based on a true story), sizzles with fantastic one-liners and wordplay. It breathes life into the 1962 setting by not shying away from using what, today, are highly offensive racial slurs: these might offend some, but they are essential for a film that lampoons racist behaviour so wonderfully.<br/><br/>Above all, it's a film with genuine heart. A story that lifts the spirit and paints onto the screen in technicolour glory the struggle (albeit you feel a rather sanitised one) that lifted America out of the dark ages in terms of equality.<br/><br/>It is perhaps this degree of ""Oscar baitedness"" - (if that's not a word then it is now) - that might be its biggest weakness in garnering support among the voters at Oscar time. It is though perhaps worth bearing in mind that it was ""Driving Miss Daisy"" - an odd-couple inter-racial chauffeur-based movie - that won the Best Film Oscar for 1989!<br/><br/>This is a film of subtlety and nuance that makes it all the more surprising that the director is Peter Farrelly. Yes, he of the Farrelly brothers of such crass, unsubtle and hilarious films like ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" and such crass, unsubtle and totally awful films like ""Me, Myself and Irene"" and ""Dumb and Dumber To""! It's like asking Mr Bean to direct a performance of Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House! Yet, here it just plain works. The comedy injected into the film (and there are a number of times I laughed out loud) is perfectly balanced with the story.<br/><br/>What I wanted to say here was: ""Go see this film. No, REALLY. It will leave you with a warm Christmas glow in your heart to last you through the holidays. Well, it should - it did me."" However, although the States already had this for Thanksgiving, it looks as if the UK general release of this film is not set to happen until the 1st of February next year. Which is a great shame and a missed opportunity. (It's as if they made a Christmas film like ""Die Hard"" and then released it in July! #sarcasm #yesiknowtheydid).<br/><br/>Seldom have two hours flown by with such joy at the cinema. At this late stage in the year, my ""Films of the Year"" draft list is going to need another shake up!<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web and on Facebook. Thanks)."

","GREEN BOOK (2018) ***1/2 Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardellini, Sebastian Maniscalo, Dimiter D. Marinov, Mike Hatton. Well-produced and acted true-life account of an odd coupling friendship in the form of Bronx-born tough guy Tony Lip (Mortensen, employing the 'dese,dem & dose' school of acting to the nth degree) hired as a driver for cosmopolitan concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (stalwart and pristine Ali) circa 1962 thru an 8 month tour thru the Deep South with the as expected tell-tale signs of the times (racism and classism to boot). Unlikely director Peter Farrelly surprises all in a turn of displaying his dramatic goods (sprinkled with enough humor to keep things even-keeled) with ample help from his two leads parrying and giving good with one another. While the seemingly easy to pigeonhole 'sex-change/role reversal DRIVING MISS DAISY' easily could've been the pitch, the screenplay by Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and Brian Hayes Currie gives enough depth in both characters and a fine arc-piece in the process."

"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","6","14 December 2018"," More Than Just a Modern Driving Miss Daisy
","Green Book is a movie outside of its time: an adult, Christmas centric, character-driven drama with as much naturalist humor as compelling humanity. Yet despite the trailer's maudlin tone and the familiar racial themes, it's more than just a bad Driving Miss Daisy knockoff. Sure, it dabbles in some of the worst parts of ""let's-make-white-Americans-feel-okay-about-their-own-racist-past"" storytelling like the white savior and the magical black man clichÃ©s, but it just as often finds time to upend and reverse those very things. Instead of forced and frustrating sentimentality, it's a charming and lovely true story that doesn't sacrifice honest humanity for easy emotions.
The unlikely real friendship of roughneck Italian driver Tony Lip (Mortensen) and acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) is refreshingly rare, a biopic that isn't already widely known. It's an episodic roadtrip film that axles itself around the theme of love breaking down stereotypes. The two central performances are the best of what we expect from an Oscar-season tearjerker: big and hammy, but fully engaging and undeniably committed. Ali is solidly stoic, uniquely positioned (""Oh, so knowing who Little Richard is makes you more black than I am?!""), and highly impressive behind the piano; while Mortensen is phenomenally brash, insecure, and downright funny (""'Virtuoso'...it's Italian...means he's, uh...really good."") in a physically unrecognizable turn.
Now, I don't want to pretend this is some sort of big force of cinematic brilliance. The writing is often on-the-nose and the direction regularly pushes its messaging with a heavy hand. Still, it never hurts to be reminded of the stupidity of ignorance. Green Book does just that; perfectly moving, engagingly funny, and maybe the best Christmas movie since Elf."
"Leona_xx","9","3","6","14 December 2018"," So glad I went to see this!
","What a fantastic movie! Warm, heartfelt, moving and funny - Mortensen is almost unrecognisable and he absolutely nails the character... flaws and all, and Ali (who I only recall seeing in Luke Cage previously) gives us a stand out performance and I'm hoping to see him more in the future! The film balances a difficult subject with such warmth, sincerity and depth of characters, it made me believe the relationships and feel for the characters, it made me laugh (surprisingly frequently!) but also cry... go see it!"
"jonbower","9","3","6","14 December 2018"," Wonderful character piece based on real characters
","Loved this movie: the leads are true to their characters, good and bad. The story is both believable and unbelievable - who would tour the deep south in 1962 as a black classical/jazz musician? The way the world treats these two, it hurts and it raises them up. I'll probably go see it again before it leaves the theaters."
"scb_coldsteel","9","3","6","13 December 2018"," Incredibly well acted comedy/drama that touches on the complexity of institutional and cultural discrimination.
","So I saw Green Book at the theater. Of course I was excited to see the movie based upon the incredible cast. I'm always hesitant around Oscar season because it seems there is normally at least one film that gets far more praise than it deserves. I'm happy to say Green Book was certainly not that film. It all around was a great film that covers a wide variety of complex issues while providing a crowd-pleasing experience for all.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie follows the true story of the talented and stoic musician Doc Shirley and his talkative blue-collar driver/ bodyguard Tony Lip as they go on a music tour of the Deep South. Both men are presented to be polar opposites and hold false perceptions towards each other. Of course along the way the two men realize the perceived differences between them are not so wide and a budding friendship blooms. The film covers a wide variety of topics related to social class, cultural norms, segregation, racism, substance abuse, and sexuality. The film manages to fit all these topics nicely into a well rounded and entertaining buddy comedy drama that will leave you smiling.<br/><br/>Of course the film also acts as a backdrop to demonstrate the historical setting of the Jim Crow South and race relations as a whole from that era. There are number of times throughout the film where they illustrate the harsh realities of discrimination and prejudice faced against black individuals due to racism. Of course the film also takes it's social commentary a step further by looking at class differences that exist between individuals and just how those also create different life chances and cultural norms.<br/><br/>The film did capture a lot of the racial and ethnic tension felt from that era. Racism did not exist only in the south and the film illustrated that racial prejudice exists along many cultural avenues. The film asks questions about an individual's identity and just how much race plays into a person's concept of self. The film also demonstrates the harsh realities of stereotyping and just how all these cultural ideas are harmful particularly in regard to race.<br/><br/>Of course what makes this movie really special is its acting. Mahershala Ali sure knows how to pick a role. He brought such a complexity to the character. You really felt for his struggle and pain as he dealt with issues regarding racism and his own identity. His range as an actor allowed him to convincingly play the role of a complex and compelling character.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was outstanding as expected. He has a way of transforming himself directly into the character. Not only did he put on quite a bit of weight for the role but he perfectly captured the mannerisms and colloquial manners of speech aswell. A less-talented actor could not have played the role and transformed the character into a likeable protagonist. I would not be surprised at all if both get nominated for Oscars for their performance. The movie it is worth watching entirely for their performances alone.<br/><br/>Directing wise there was nothing wrong with the film. The film was very dialogue-driven, but again the performances by the actor's made the film quite entertaining. Despite its length I didn't see any issue with pacing and I really didn't have any issues with unnecessary plot points. The score of the film was also quite impressive.<br/><br/>Now as far as negatives of the film there were a few points that could have been improved upon. Viggo Mortensen's character starts the film off with a display of his racial bias, but it never really goes anywhere. The film wants us to like its main character a little bit too much so we don't see the darker side of his prejudice. The film also had an opportunity to make more of a statement regarding the Jim Crow South. While it did have a number of examples of institutional and cultural discrimination, it only really scratched the surface of the racial tension of that era. Ultimately the film wanted to play more into the light-hearted comedy drama angle than a serious commentary on racial prejudice.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Green Book. It was easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2018. The film had an interesting and compelling story that was grounded in incredible acting and solid directing. There are multiple moments throughout the film that will leave you laughing and cheering at the buddy morality tale about friendship and compassion. The film did lose a few points for playing it safe in regard to racial tensions, but that just wasn't the movie it was trying to make. It's hard to fault a film when it wasn't trying to make a gritty serious drama. A 9.25 out of 10."

The journey of a gifted concert pianist and a Bronx strong man delivers a snap shot in time of the South , just as Steinbeck did with his 60s book, Travels with Charlie. For both men, the trip is a journey of self-discovery. For the audience, it is a movie filled with the social past, but also filled with plenty of humor which will have you laughing right out loud.

"Jackthemovielover","9","3","6","9 December 2018"," A wonderful surprise
","This film starts with a modest story, adequately told in the trailer and plot summary. I went because it sounded interesting, but I wasn't excited about it. The film surpassed my expectations, and I left the theater feeling entertained, better informed about history, and with renewed faith in human nature. The film develops the friendship between the two men as it shows the society of the early 1960s in the North East, the Midwest, and the South. It also exposed me to some modern jazz I hadn't heard, and some traditional jazz from the South that I was familiar with. It reminded me of the richness of American music. The prejudice of their time was depicted in a realistic enough way to bring up anxiety over the fear that minorities faced. In their time racism was ubiquitous; today it is dormant, but the last two years have reminded us that it can rise again if we allow it to. The two men brought their own biases to their meeting and working together, but their humanity and basic good will allowed them to see each other as individuals, overcome their biases, and support one another more over the course of their tour. The issues they faced were at times deathly serious, but their ability to laugh at absurd situations kept the overall tone from becoming dark. In the end, the film seemed like a mixture of comedy, light tragedy, and road trip. I highly recommend the film."

","Green Book has two main and real characters. Movie successfully tells us characters' nature and evolution process. This couple has a great chemistry. Green Book promises you a friendship story, a journey film, 60s country mood, a musical, an intense main idea on racism, a backplan story about differences of a rich and a poor man, sincere and laughing dialogues, some sequences which is gonna make you smile and make you upset... Those are positive parts about movie. Of course I have something bad to say about it, even though it is short. Story repeats itself few times. We see similar sequences in a short while. Also I would prefer watch more about Dr. Don Shirley's family and his brother. That storyline mires down."

","The movie Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly (director of 2 of my favorite fun movies there's something about Mary & Dumb and Dumber) is excellent. Writer Nick Vallelonga wrote about his father Tony Lip acted by Virgo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic , Perfect Murder, History of Violence) and his African American pianist boss Dr Donald Shirley , acted by Mahershala Ali (from Moonlight). When Tony's wife Dolores acted by Linda Cardellini (a simple favor, Mad men) is told by Tony that his job offer is from a colored man, Dolores reacts very well in a manner only a wife who understands and knows her husband well does. Dolores enjoys all love letters written by Tony while he is away driving Doc from one southern state to another to keep up with concert schedule. The screenplay is terrific. Excellent acting. Love and respect among all characters is very touching. Tony and Doc , both very true to their basic nature, are awe inspiring. Great story. Excellent Direction. Superb editing. Definitely Oscar worthy. Virgo Mortensen is perfect . Linda Cardellini is great in supporting role. Great movie."

","I love a movie that restores my faith in films. Is it fun to see a movie with a zillion dollar budget and every special effect known to man? Sure. But can you take an issue, any issue, and break it down to two characters you care about and leave the theatre feeling you're better for it? Yes. And that's far more satisfying.<br/><br/>Isn't Peter Farrelly half the team that brought us ""Dumb & Dumber?"" And now he makes this? Amazing. Worth the wait. Viggo Mortensen is the new De Niro, some things may be predictable but are handled nicely, and the last seventy seconds or so are pretty much perfect. So far, the best movie I've seen in 2018. In an odd way, it reminded me Breaker Morant."
"joeydavos","10","3","6","6 December 2018"," Stunning story of friendship against he odds
","Saw an advance screening of Green Book at a cineworld secret screening. The theatre was almost full no doubt anticipating Mary Poppins and people actually got up left. To those people I say ""more fool you""
This will, I have no doubt become a classic. Two complete opposites thrown together in mutual disdain form a solid bond that lasts a lifetime.
Tears, laughter, mostly at the expense of Tony Lip and his brash, working class attitude to life. Superbly acted Vigo Mortenson was brilliantly believable while Marhershala Ali portrais himself as a self absorbed, holier than thou superior but actually turns out to be equally as flawed as Tony. The KFC scene was brilliantly played as was the scene involving the jade.
Absolutely loved it, as apparently did the rest of the audience who laughed out loud as one. A young guy sat at the side of me said "" I wouldn't normally go tho see this kind of film, but I'm glad I did"" and so was I"
"Eclectic-Boogaloo","8","3","6","5 December 2018"," A thoughtful feel-good movie
","If you like the John Hughes penned ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and/or similar movies, you'll like Green Book. It's a Holiday buddy movie with a strong social and racial undercurrent. It's held together by a great script by writers Brian Hayes Currie, Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, good direction by Peter Farrelly, and terrific performances from Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen (Linda Cardellini was also really good as, you guessed it, the wife). It's not the least bit saccharine or heavy handed. It's just a really enjoyable, and sometimes funny movie that you'll walk out of the theater feeling great about having seen. And yes, you can totally take the family.<br/><br/>And to address the main criticism of Green Book, that it focuses too much attention on Mortensen's character, well, that's unfair. It's a two-hander, a buddy road movie, so both guys get full character arcs and depth. Most importantly, Mahershala Ali's character isn't just a passenger in the story. He's the main protagonist. He has goals, needs, and makes decisions. And race is central to everything.<br/><br/>To repeat, Green Book is a lovely film and low-key the best Holiday movie of the year. I highly recommend it."

"jasongkgreen","8","3","6","4 December 2018"," Thought provoking, funny and warm.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","3","6","26 November 2018"," The Courage to Change People's Hearts
","In 1962, in the middle of the night, in the pouring rain, in the Deep South Mahershala Ali's concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley in tears tells his driver Tony, played by Viggo Mortensen, ""So if I'm not Black enough! If I'm not White enough! If I'm not Man enough! So tell me what am I?"" Tony listens in resound silence. That resonates even in 2018. This is the lyrical power of Writer and Director Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"".<br/><br/>The screenplay by Nick Vellelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Farrelly is based on the true story of the friendship of Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Vellelonga, who couldn't be more different or more unlikely. The wondrous screenplay authentically looks at the impact of prejudice with heart and a surprising sense of humor. On Tony and Don's road trip on their concert tour, Don delicately fingers his Kentucky Fried Chicken drumstick in the backseat, while Tony drives. Don has never eaten fried chicken before. Don admits it's actually quite good. I laughed so hard.<br/><br/>Tony agrees to chauffer and ""bodyguard"" Don on his concert tour in the Deep South for 8 weeks, returning home to his understanding wife Dolores, plays by kind beautiful Linda Cardellini, by Christmas. Viggo's Tony was the bouncer, ""public relations"" man at the Copacabana Club in New York City shutdown because of a mob ""misunderstanding"". Tony is blue collar Italian American with street smarts: way wiser than he occurs. The Father of two boys, he's all heart.
Tony also pays attention. Viggo's distinct humanity is in being so present.<br/><br/>Back in the 1960's the Green Book was the listing of all the approved Lodgings for Blacks. At times Tony and Don were not allowed to share the same hotels. On the one instance they do Tony looks out from his hotel room balcony. He spies solitary Don, alone sipping his glass of whiskey. There's more to Don's story than divorce and his estranged brother. Mahershala embodies a regal self-absorbed suffering in Don, who along with being the accomplished pianist holds two PhDs and a law degree. He is also very alone. Is his loneliness self-imposed or thwarted self-expression?<br/><br/>Here Director Peter unconceals eloquent acceptance in the narrative. Don gratefully thanks Tony for saving him from himself. Tony compassionately says, ""I know it's complicated."" Later Don asks to see the letters Tony writes home to Dolores. They're horrendous. Consequently, Don dictates to Tony what to write, ""Dear Dolores...""<br/><br/>Viggo and Mahershala amaze in their authentic love and soulful respect for each other. Mahershala is the brilliant straight man when comedy summons. He displays powerful awareness on the stark narrative turns. Viggo is masterful understatement. His Tony has his prejudice as we all do, yet through his eyes we see his compassion and deep regard for the man that Don is.<br/><br/>Viggo's visage as Tony acknowledges the miraculous talents of artist Don. Don and his musical trio play for White privileged folk, who seemingly feign tolerance. Soon Tony discerns the pretense as mere tokenism, cloaked racism. So why does Don hold his tongue, graciously thanking his hosts, who only see him as Negro?<br/><br/>Don's band mate Oleg, played by silently strong Dimiter D. Marinov, tells Tony, ""... Because it takes courage to change people's hearts."" Amen. Maybe we can't change what's in other people's hearts. What we can to do is have compassion in our own hearts. That's a place to start.<br/><br/>That's the profound brotherhood of Tony and Don's journey. ""Green Book"" may be the very best movie of the year. At least it's my very favorite."

I'm not sure what showing movies like this hopes to accomplish. I feel that everything is trying to get us to hate each other. I think it would be like showing the native Americans movies about the thing we did to them, the atrocities we committed. I know we need to keep from making mistakes again in the future, maybe that's what this is about. I would love to challenge Hollywood to make some movies that try to accomplish a sense of unity in this nation. I would love to see that. Somehow stop trying to divide us by race, religion or sexuality. Maybe stop us from focusing on what we don't have in common, and focus on what we do have in common. Just my thoughts.

","Just like how Crash (not Cronenberg's version) poignantly and blithely reminded us that being a racist can have unforeseen negative consequences with respect to our ever-intertwining lives, theoretically more so now that globalism is at a fever pace, so, too, does Green Book help us understand that despite our different backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and indeed even skin color, life is not fair and if we can change just one person's attitude, then also behavior, by ingesting two-hour flicks, it's almost certainly a win-win situation.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen eventually slides into his role as rough-tough-with-a-heart-of-gold, who inexplicably frowns down on olive pimento cheese sandwiches after eating a bucket of fried chicken, but let's not try to poke holes in the plot because it solves racism, homophobia, and class struggle by the finish, like a neatly wrapped Christmas gift, waiting for us to open it with gratitude and majesty.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali does his best to not invoke imagery of Miss Daisy, but I think we all know how that turned out (he won an Oscar for not invoking imagery of Miss Daisy (or Arthur, for what it's worth)). Yet in retrospect, one cannot help but imagine Sylvester Stallone in Mortensen's place, or even Ralph Macchio, neither of whom would have had to affect themselves with a New York Italian accent."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The titular ""Green Book"" (not the official book title) was a travel guide highlighting safe places for African Americans to stay, eat and visit from the 1930's through the mid 1960's. Yes, it was a real publication and yes, there was a real need for it during the Jim Crow era. The book makes for a nice movie title, but this sterling dramedy from director Peter Farrelly focuses more on the budding friendship of two men from vastly different worlds separated by a few city blocks.<br/><br/>Mr. Farrelly is one-half of the infamous Farrelly Brothers who have directed such raunchy comedy hits as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (1998) and DUMB AND DUMBER (1994). This is quite the change of pace for him, as it is for co-stars Mahershala Ali (Oscar winner last year for MOONLIGHT) and heavy drama stalwart Viggo Mortensen. We see a crisp blend of the era's harsh racism and the inherent comedy of a buddy road trip featuring a working class NYC Italian-American and an upper crust, well-educated, world class African-American pianist.<br/><br/>The film kicks off in 1962 at the Copacabana, a mob-controlled club where Frank Anthony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (a beefed up Mortensen) gives us an up-close look at his bouncer skills. He's quite good at his job. When the club closes for renovation, he takes a job as a chauffeur/bodyguard for Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), who is beginning an 8 week tour as the featured player in a jazz trio through the Midwest and Deep South. Tony Lip is a walking Italian clichÃ©, while Dr Shirley is a regal black man ... in fact, he might view himself as royalty - living alone in a swank apartment above Carnegie Hall. This is a good time to note that Tony Lip's son Nick Vallelonga co-wrote the script, is a producer on the film, and even makes an appearance as a State Trooper.<br/><br/>Inspired by the true story of this trip and the lifelong friendship that ensued, we get to know both men as they get to know each other. Tony Lip is a streetwise man who is comfortable with his lot in life, while Dr. Shirley plays his role in society while quietly stewing internally. He flashes his toothy grin to disarm the adoring white audiences, but then sucks down his Cutty Sark in the evening, as he is good enough to perform for them, but not good enough to dine with them (or even use their restroom). There are times the racism gets violent and that's where Tony Lip comes in.<br/><br/>Don helps Tony write romantic and intimate letters to his wife Dolores (played by Linda Cardellini), while Tony teaches Don about KFC and Little Richard ... proclaiming ""I'm blacker than you!"" in one of the film's funniest moments. It's an awkward buddy film that in real life developed into a decades-long friendship - one that only ended when both died in 2013. It could be described as a twisted DRIVING MISS DAISY with a dose of THE HELP. It's certainly a crowd-pleaser, even delivering a mushy ending not dissimilar to that of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. Of course we don't mind, because after spending a couple of hours with these two, we are fine with a feel-good ending. The film is showcase for two terrific actors, and for those that don't know, the real Tony Lip appeared in a few projects such as ""The Sopranos"" and DONNIE BRASCO. Expect to see these two actors get some love at Oscar time, and this is one of the few that can be recommended to just about every movie lover."

There are some good moments. And I have to praise Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali's performance. Unfortunately, this is all this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much the same 2 or 3 scenes repeated throughout the running time. The Green book itself is barely mentioned or used. The cinematography is competent, but boring. It tries nothing creative. Viggo Mortensen's character, while being fun to watch, doesn't go through any kind of arc. And the social commentary about racism and homophobia, stays on the surface, isn't subtle at all to compensate, and brings nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>Also, I don't speak italian well, but even I could tell those Italian accents were awful.<br/><br/>Overall a disappointing movie that could have been so much better and interesting. A shame this won the Oscar over Roma or The favourite which were both much superior movies."

Still it was a great effort<br/><br/>7 stars"
"kit_lok","9","2","4","8 November 2019"," Massively enjoyable
","Marhershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are simply amazing in this film. The acting was spot on, Mortensen's ""Tony the Lip"" was wonderfully comedic as the foil to the intelligence of Ali's Don Shirley or the Doc as they called him. The pair worked together wonderfully well together and on screen it did look like a convincing pairing. The story is simple enough to follow, the majority light hearted and funny but also it deals with issues such as the racial injustice of the deep south at the time. The character of Don Shirley is complicated which Ali shows his depth to bring this character to screen. My wife and I were thoroughly entertained throughout the film. I seem some reviews that what to politicalise the film, it's just a film about two guys who form a friendship through difficult times and just enjoy it and learn from it."
"handmadegiasena","10","2","4","6 November 2019"," Simply beautiful.
","This is a story of 2 men from different backgrounds who go on a journey together both literally and metaphorically.
Yes, there is a racial element to it which you would expect from a story set partly in the American deep south at that time but this isn't a story about racism.
The white man is not the eloquent, educated man. Tony is a rough diamond. He is the best artist who ducks and dives to make ends meet. He's a family man who adores his wife and he is a man who stands by his word.
Don is a talented, articulate man who is alone in the world. He has made music his life.
The men form an unlikely friendship that had me laughing, tearful, but mostly smiling.
This movie has heart.
Don could have easily been a white man or Tony a black man. I say this to emphasise that this isn't a movie about black and white. It's about friendship.
Why did Don choose to tour the deep south when he could command more money elsewhere?
Some might say that he wanted to connect with his roots. I don't.
When the black men and women who were working in the field all stopped to stare at the impeccably dressed black man being chauffeured by a white man was the key. For me, it was showing other people of colour that they can achieve anything they want. They are no longer slaves to the white man. That's my take away from it.
It is a simple story but told so well. If the aim was to make us feel warm and fuzzy then it did its job."

"Carrzinho","8","2","4","19 September 2019"," Buddy road movie has some extra sparkle
","An Italian-American bouncer takes up the job of driving an African-American pianist on a 2 month tour in the 1960's of America's South.
This is essentially a buddy road movie bringing to mind Midnight Run (1988) and Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987). Two opposites are placed together and we witness conflict and humour and two characters growing together. So the template is set and it largely follows true as you'd expect.
What make this different is the setting. No matter what is going on there is the palpable racial tension and real threat that could dissolve this affable caper into something altogether more heinous.
This makes it more worthy, in an actual sense and that of the Oscars. This would also be my main criticism of the movie. It feels too crowd pleasing when it could have laboured further on the fight for civil rights.
Viggo Morensen and Mahershala Ali are superb and entirely convincing. Their characters evolve and grow credibly. Linda Cardellini, who i feel is underrated provides an anchor to the story and is excellent.
It's beautifully shot, as a road movie in the south should be. The period element isn't laboured beyond the opening scenes of Tony Lip in his bouncer role but is quietly effective. The soundtrack is top drawer combining Aretha Franklin, Chubby Checker etc with the very interesting, classically influenced, jazz stylings of Dr. Donald Shirley's trio.
Tonally it's hard to argue with, shifting gear effortlessly and it really is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud nearly every time they went for the comedic schtick.
For me it hasn't got the heft of an Oscar winning movie or the uniqueness and magic of e.g. its predecessor The Shape of Water (2017) but it will be timeless, pleasing and important enough to be looked upon with fondness. EIGHT"

","Classical pianist Ali hires street wise tough guy Mortensen to drive him to all his concerts in the south of the USA where racism is rife and trouble somewhat inevitable.<br/><br/>Whilst the racist incidents are laid on thick and fast, there is no getting around the gentle pleasure of these 2 actors bouncing off and learning from each other as the road trip progresses. Both give great performances and there is much to laugh and cry about in this film. That all said the notion of it winning the best picture Oscar is absurd."
"danniegodfrey","10","2","4","15 September 2019"," A future classic.
","I watched it last night after coming across it on the ""new movie"" list and without knowing anything about it or expecting much... and it turned out to be the best film I have seen in over a decade.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is perfect. It has an important message about prejudice, racism, the need for tolerance and kindness in humanity and the crimes of the human race against its own kind, but this is delivered in a way which achieves less of an acrimonious, sickening and shameful history lesson but through a heart-wrenching beautiful relationship we can all relate to through relationships of our own, and therefore it stays with you and makes you assess much better your own shortfalls, powerfully enough to inspire change in its audience.
The developing relationship between the two lead roles is nothing short of magical on screen and both play their parts with complete authenticity in into a way that you come to love their respective characters.
There are simple scenes of acts of friendship and kindness between them so beautiful they tug at your emotions and can make you laugh or cry.
The film perfectly blends it's serious message with consistantly brilliant humour and Vigo Mortensen playing ""Tony Lip"" is hilarious throughout.
The sentiment of the humour in the relationship between them over everyday things we can all relate to is just heart warming.
The film ends in such a beautiful (and maybe ""Hollywood Happy"" ...but we all need a happy ending now and then, and in this case it is both based on a true story, which is divine, and drives the underlying message of broadening narrow minds with love and understanding to those around us, home much better) way, this could make Christmas-time cinematic history to be replayed every year.
I always say ""they never make films the way they used to anymore, the ones that can last forever that you repeat again and again""...but this film has really achieved that.
A real future classic."

","I've heard that many were unhappy with the fact that this film won the Oscars. On the contrary, I truly believe that this film deserve the Oscars. It was wonderfully made, from the script, the directing, and most of all, the acting.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, I felt like there's nothing much going on in the film. However, as the film progressed, it kept getting better and better. This film is about mistreatments, friendship and learning to understand others from different point of view.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film, we have two protagonists with nothing in common, Tony Lip, the crude driver and Dr. Donald Shirley, the African-American pianist, played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, respectively. These two are what moved the film. The two actors played their characters really well, and the chemistry between them is just simply fantastic to watch. I have heard many praises regarding Mahershala Ali's performance, and I was wondering what the fuss is all about. Watching him in this film, I finally understood why people love him. He was truly talented. Every subtle emotions he portrayed in the film are well conveyed, and I somehow felt related to him.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this film.

","In the bonus track of the DVD of ""Green Book,"" the producers identified the movie's themes of ""friendship, love, and acceptance."" Those abstractions were complemented by a detailed and insightful portrayal of the Jim Crow laws portrayed in the America of late 1962.<br/><br/>To navigate one's way through Jim Crow laws, African-Americans relied on a guide called the Green Book. The author of the book was Victor Hugo Green, who compiled a survival manuel for blacks traveling through the Deep South and seeking lodging and restaurants that would not exclude them from service. The book was carefully crafted as a comprehensive and invaluable resource entitled ""The Negro Motorist Green Book.""<br/><br/>As a film, ""Green Book"" hits all the right notes in the situations, character developments, and well-scripted dialogue. So many films fail it attempts to blend comedy and serious drama. This film is a model of unfolding a dramatic narrative with genuine moments of humor that evolve organically from realistically driven characters and situations. One of the most delightful moments was a discussion about music between Dr. Donald Shirley and Tony Lip. The conversation focuses on classical versus contemporary music, and Tony mispronounces the name Chopin as ""Joe Pan."" Dr. Shirley takes it in stride with a priceless, nonchalant reaction.<br/><br/>In the bonus track of the DVD, the film was described as the story of ""two people from two very different worlds."" It was made all the more remarkable that the two principal characters bonded almost as brothers. This was made dynamic by the extraordinary performances of Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. As writer-producer Brian Currie observed in the bonus track, ""it all comes down to the good acting.""<br/><br/>The final strength of the film was the music with the inimitable piano style of Dr. Shirley. In the bonus track of the DVD, Dr. Shirley was characterized as ""Liberace meets Beethoven,"" which is a good description of the unique musical style. There was subtlety in all facets of this film, and the word ""virtuoso,"" as used to describe Dr. Shirley is appropriate praise for everything about ""Green Book."""

Mortensen is incredibly funny and witty while Ali showcases extreme depth as a lonely, sophisticated piano player.<br/><br/>The film is respectful to the time period, not shying away from the racism of its time, and yet still manages to maintain a certain level of comfort.

Dr. Donald Shirley was portrayed as a stuck up, arrogant douche with contempt for ordinary people. I couldn't find neither one of these characters interesting or likeable. They should have worked a little bit harder developing Dr. Shirley's character without the aloof attitude. Dolores was the only likeable character played by the lovely Linda Cardellini. I wish she had more screen time. The terribly italian pronounced spoken lines made me cringe.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","2","4","8 March 2019"," An instant classic that everyone should see at least once.
","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that has the right balance of themes and execution to make it into an instant classic. When I first saw trailers for Green Book (2018), I initially thought it was just going to be an inverse of Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Instead, what I got was so much more than that. Green Book tackles the difficult task of presenting a harsh mirror on our past, with a knowing wink that some of these challenges are still present today. It is more subtle than BlacKkKlansman (2018), but the message still gets across in a heartwarming and wholesome way.<br/><br/>What makes Green Book so engaging is the simplicity that it approaches such a nuanced and complex approach to the topic of racism. The irony that rich white people in the south would hold Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in such high regard as a musician but treat him as less-than-human the second he is not performing for them is stunning and appalling. The strength of the story certainly comes with the repartee between Shirley and his Italian driver, Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), in a way that shows all people can change for the better, even if it's in small steps.<br/><br/>I have to commend the excellent music in this film, merely as a side-note to the fantastic screenplay. So many moments were laugh-out-loud funny or tears-to-your-eyes touching due to their ability to tie together moments that appeared earlier in the movie. Sure, some may call this film predictable or clichÃ©, but it works in a way that's so engaging that you can't help but lose yourself in its narrative. It also doesn't hurt that the cinematography that brings the story to life is top notch as well-utilizing shallow depth of field to masterful effect.<br/><br/>An instant classic that everyone should see at least once, I give Green Book 5.0 stars out of 5."

","Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and tells the true story of Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen, an Italian-American bouncer who becomes a driver and bodyguard for Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, which was set in 1962.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen played a lot of roles in the past and has become one of the most well known actors in the film industry. At this point of his career, it's a pleasure to see him in a role that his character was written. Tony Vallelonga was part charismatic, part vulgar, and part funny. His character becomes very well rounded as his relationship with Don Shirley grows deeper as the film progresses, while giving his best performance yet.<br/><br/>As for Mahershala Ali, who has been great in Moonlight, has shown to be greater in this film. He plays Don Shirley, a renowned pianist who is very conflicted and incomplete. He encounters different forms of discrimination against him and his fellow race during their whole trip with Tony. He tries to belong to be accepted by the ""civilized"" society he struggles to interact with. A society where he is only respected when on stage and becoming demoralized as he steps off, leaving him sympathetic and compelling to the audience, along with Ali's very powerful performance.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two characters are no doubt the heart of the film, almost becoming a buddy film in a good way. The screenplay throughout balances the humor and the heavy moments perfectly, making scene between scene flow better with no dragging nor pacing issues. It's mainstream approach also makes it more accessible to the public, paired with amusing dialogue between each characters from Tony to Shirley, to his wife, and others. They also incorporate very well written characters as audiences will know about their inner struggles, especially with Shirley.<br/><br/>The underlying themes may be obvious, but to the extent of having heavy subject matter and making it digestable for all audiences with the use of humor, some light and some dark. The events accurately depicts the intention of the message of the film and still be relevant to today's times, considering it's set in the 1960's.<br/><br/>This film has great performances, great writing, and great chemistry between the two main characters. It is one of those films where you forget you're watching one and it becomes an experience. It's Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay win at the 91st Academy Awards is well deserved by everyone who worked on this masterpiece.

","Finally saw the Green Book and I understand why there are some dissenting opinions about its merits. My take is it is a solidly good picture, but it also doesn't quite hit the brilliant mark for me as well. Still, what tips the scale beyond being just solidly good is not on the artistry of the making but in the new angle of looking at racial inequality. It seems to suggest for some people, their prejudices based on skin color are more innately grounded and thus, creating almost absurd contradictions in social acceptancy. In short, a person is not quite the totality of his sum, but a collection of fragmented personas which are then treated differently and accordingly depending on the context of what he should be. This is what makes the film so uniquely interesting, this point of view. Viggo Mortensen whom I hardly recognized as the same actor who did Lord of the Rings, or The Road, or Captain Fantastic did a fantastic and transformative job with his character. As for Mahershala Ali, well, he was at least a class or two above in his abilities as an actor in True Detective. Based on this, I must hand it to the director of this show, Peter Farrelly. He is only solidly good, but not quite brilliant yet."

The book, of course, is present in the film and plays an important role (this is a collection of hotels and restaurants names where African-American travelers could stop), but the story revolves around two characters - a talented African-American pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American bouncer driver (Viggo Mortenesen), who travel together around the states where one main character is supposed to give concerts and the second one monitors the safety of his boss.
I really liked the atmosphere of the 60s, clothes, cars, music, characters in the film. The dialogues are written ironically and at the same time filled with meaning for the viewer.
The film that you watch without stopping, although it is far from a blockbuster; the film, where behind a light comedy lies a deep meaning.

The story is powerful, and talks about a very tough issue (similar to BlacKkKlansman, but in a ""subtle"" way), but it's done with such careful, and in a gradative pace.<br/><br/>The way their relationship is build throughout the movie is great. I love the way they kind of make a parallel between the characters, and how Viggo's is ""blacker"" than Ali's (explicit saying that at one point). Talking about that scene in specific, this might be my favorite scene in a movie all year. The build up for it is perfect, and man, Ali's performance is phenomenal, he truly delivered it. You feel for the character, you realize that he has no one in his life, he is curse to never be 100% a part of any social group he might find on society, and outcast. What a scene.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with the movie, is just about one plot point. In the beginning we see a scene where Tony throws to cups in the trash can, because to black man drank water on it. So you think ""ok, the dude is pretty racist"", but this is not exactly an issue throughout the movie. Actually, 20 minutes after, he is playing games with some black guys outside the first club Don performed on. The only scene when this kind of gets between them, is briefly in the scene when he comes back to the car to get his wallet and goes to pee. But overall, he's pretty ok with Don since the beginning. Anyways, doesn't exactly makes the movie bad, and it something you forgot halfway throughout it, but still, it something I believe is a inconsistency into the script.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved Green Book, is a strong and incredibly well made movie, who deserves his Oscar nomination.

","Not only was the acting in Green Book phenomenal, especially when it came to the lead two actors, but the small roles of Tony's family and friends, police and those that were met along the journey really pulled together the overall effect of the film. If a film can transport me to another era in time, another situation in life, I absolutely love it. It was clear that the casting of this film was done to the best ability, and no actors or actresses were un-believable or out of place. The story arc of the characters could be considered stereotypical of similar films, however it nicely fits the story- of which I personally haven't read into the real names or happenings of. The narrative carried the actors and the actors carried the narrative, not too complicated to follow nor too shallow. Nonetheless, it was a fantastic piece of cinema comparable to cinema like Moonlight. A solid story filled with excellent performances from all actors."

","Brilliant! Absolutely fantastic. I will tell you why you should NOT miss this brilliant movie.
I haven't laughed as much in years. Actually I cried and laughed at the same time through the whole movie. .
I would compare this movie to great films on my top list like ""The Green Mile"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Forest Gump"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Schindler's List"", ""The Color Purple"" (and just between you and me ""Sound of Music"" - I know you won't tell anybody that I like that film it is my little/BIG secret).
Viggo Mortensen is the ***STAR ***of this movie and the performance of Mahershala Ali is also excellent.
The simple uneducated, street-smart, rough but honest and kind-hearted character of Tony Lip is so brilliantly made alive by Viggo Mortensen that it is probably one of the best performance in the history of movies.
If Viggo Mortensen won't get the Oscar for his performance it will bee a scandal.

"Lewis_Heather787","9","2","4","1 January 2019"," Turns Ignorance into Awareness!
","This film blew me completely away, this doesn't happen often but this film was a true joy to watch from start to finish. To be honest I had not heard of this film, I hadn't even seen a trailer for it before I saw it, so went in completely unaware of the story. Wow wow wow almost a perfect film, its just spectacular.<br/><br/>Firstly lets start with the story as the first positive, there are many positives in this film. The story is of Mahershala Ali's character ""Don Shirley"", who is a pianist, going on a road trip through America with Viggo Mortensen's character of ""Tony Lip"" as his driver. So the premise itself is pretty straight forward, however this film is set in 1960's America and the two of them are travelling towards the deep south. This brings a number of huge challenges or problems that could arise due to the obvious fact that one man is black and the other is white.
Now this film could definitely have been an extremely dark and depressing film showing the racism in America at that time all throughout its run time. In a way it does that but its achieved in the simplest of ways either through a simple conversation or action. The hints can be subtle at times and front-centre at other times. The reason that dark subject matter works in this film is because it is balanced with some great humour that runs throughout the film. Neither one aspect of the film overshadows the other, the film is not to dark nor its it too lighthearted about sed subject matter. Just perfect screenplay for this film.<br/><br/>There some tense scenes in the film whether that be not allowing ""Don Shirley"" to use the inside toilet but an outside one or when they try to buy a suit , he is not allowed. There just a couple of examples but the film definitely can take a serious stance when it needs to and it handles extremely well.<br/><br/>I don't think I've laughed more in a film in 2018 because the humour is clever and some small little jokes can go on for long time. Majority of it is between the two main characters and predominately ""Tony Lips"" ignorance to black people and to America at that time. One line he says is that he wouldn't be offended if someone said all Italian's are the same.......or something on those lines. Due to that his ignorance means he doesn't see why claiming all black people are the same is any different. However he does get offended when he is compared to some of the ""Southern white men"" in the film. Some of the best humour has to be when it either involves ""Tony Lip"" writing letters to his wife, who knows the truth about them, or the gun and rock he either does or doesn't have on him. Just brilliant dialogue for this actors to read.<br/><br/>Best part about the story and film for me is the fact that both men learn from one another and try to be better people. Most of it is Ali's character trying to help Mortensen's character understand the ignorance of his ways. It is achieved in a brilliant way, through friendship.<br/><br/>Now onto the last two positives, they are Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. Both of those men bring there A-game to this film. I'd have to say that I think Viggo is slightly better that Ali but thats probably due to the fact that his character has more to do and his a likeable idiot. Therefore most of the humour is due to Mortensen's character but that doesn't take away from ALi' performance in anyway, both of them elevate each other. Mortensen , Best Acting Oscar????<br/><br/>Overall this film is 90% out of 100 or 9 out of 10, just go and see this film trust me you will not be disappointed, this is such a joyful film to watch in a strange way because of its subject matter. However that is exactly what the film does, it turns darkness into joy and ignorance into awareness.<br/><br/>PS: The fact this was based on real events is all the better, the film has really good ending!"
"hubcap-83293","8","2","4","1 January 2019"," Surprising substance
","This film takes place in the 1960's. It examines the controversy of Black discrimination in a very unique way. Vigo Mortensen plays ""Tonylip"". A tough and rough bouncer at the Copa in New York city. He takes a temporary job as a bodyguard / driver for an up and coming concert pianist as he embarks on a tour of the deep south. Needless to say these two individuals could not be more different having come from two contrasting worlds. Thrown together they learn to appreciate one another and the life lessons each brings to eachother. There re more than a few laughs and many moments to ponder and reflect. All in all I highly recommend this film as something of substance. Excellently written and cast, a very good watch . PS the very last line of the movie made me laugh at myself. Tony's wife thanks Dr. Shirley for helping Tony with the ""Lettuce "" ( cash income). It took a few seconds to dawn on me she was saying "" Letters"" with a bronx accent ."
"derk144","Null","2","4","31 December 2018"," The dichotomy of the American South in the 1960s.
","About equal parts comedy & drama that shows the budding friendship of a white man & a black man by seeing the Jim Crow South first hand. It deals with racism & prejudice by exploring a man's attempt to make it in the world when he isn't fully accepted by either community, asking how someone can be black but not ""black enough."" It shows how these two people from vastly different walks of life come to understand & care about the other while highlighting the dichotomy of the American South in the 1960s, where a black man could perform for a group of white people but couldn't eat in the same restaurant with them. The performances are phenomenal here with both Mahershala Ali & Viggo Mortensen completely selling the changing relationship in this situation. Linda Cardellini gives a much more subtle but just as spellbinding performance as Dolores Vallelonga. Shot well & with an amazing soundtrack, this film is as important as it is entertaining, like Driving Miss Daisy (1989) in reverse."

"CubsandCulture","10","2","4","31 December 2018"," Great Odd Couple Comedy (or Dramedy)
","Let me state up front that this film's treatment of race, unfortunately, conforms to some of the more harmful cultural myths. There is the white savoir trope present, abet softened both by Tony being changed by Doc and Doc getting 100% of the credit for the resolution of a subplot. There is humor derived from stereotypes and caricatures. I imagine several scenes might be more grating than funny depending on your view point. In particular a certain scene with fried chicken is going to act like a Rorschach test for the audience. The troublesome nature of the material is important to acknowledge. Ultimately, through, given the light touch of the direction, the screenplay's nuance I think this story is about as un-troublesome as a film with this plot can be. These myths are harmful because they are so common. There is no reason to single out a single token of them, especially when the material is handled so deftly.<br/><br/>A lot of this is because of the large choices in the screenplay and direction. This is an odd couple comedy that is touches upon race. It is not a movie about race that has an odd couple in it. The script and direction know that and are structured with that in mind. Tony and Doc are polar opposites in several ways-race, class, education level, tastes etc.-and there is a ton of very touching and funny interaction that are mined because of that. Yes one can quibble here and there about the social import but the film is deeply entertaining deeply charming. There is something very earnest here that works. You accept the warts related to social structures because of that.<br/><br/>Ali and Mortenson make this film. They are perfectly matched and both given great performances, filled with humor, humanity, and nuance. Ali is saddled with a very difficult character and the Doc's struggles are really felt. Mortensen gives his best performance ever here and Tony is a great comedic character. He is basically unrecognizable in the role and I still can't believe Strider and Tony are played by the same guy. Just masterful acting.<br/><br/>This is a good film. Don't hold cinemas' sins against it."

","A very good feel good film that tackles a familiar territory. But its a good film about friendship, a very unlikely friendship and the way this friendship is developing. The magic lies in the performances and especially the chemistry between the two leads.
Viggo Mortensen is fantastic. There is no other word to describe his performance. I know he got a lot of backlash lately, mostly due to some comments he did. Anyway, his performance is undoubtedly fantastic. I mean look how versatile that actor is... this was Aragon! A very unlikely character he marvelously brought to life and delivered one of the absolute top performances of the year. Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali also did some magic with his role. Especially in the scenes when ""Doc"" lost his facade and showed his true emotions and struggle. Excellent work as well. The rest of the cast is servable but nothing too outstanding. The screenplay is surely very good. Peter Farrelly's direction better than with most of his comedic gigs. The film is entertaining and has an important story to tell. I am not sure if it is 100% accurate or not but as a film it entertained, moved and emotionally challenged me."

"mshackletonchavez","8","2","4","21 December 2018"," One Of The Years Best.
","One of the years best, truly beautifully acted and directed, along with a heartwarming and simply fun story.<br/><br/>This feature is a great achievement, it was funny and engaging and very much worth the wait to finally see. In partiuclar the performances are the first pieces which pop out, the brilliant chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali's at the core of the feature, placed in conjunction with the screenplay, gives the film great heart and emotion and an inspirational human story.<br/><br/>While Peter Farrelly's direction is not particularly special, it works extremely well. Most notably I suspect that the feature was shot on film, which brought out very poignant colours and sold the 1962 setting extremely well. As well as the classical look of film, further feeding the atmosphere. It has an extremely charming feeling, that delivers the change in seasons, the different locations of both poverty and wealth to a stark but consistent contrast. The direction does not feel forced, not at all, it flows magnificently thanks to Peter Farrelly. Nothing feels out of place, the editing is clever. The features aspect ratio of 2.00:1, which is uncommon for many films, gives a more unique frame and look to other cinematic endeavour, especially since I saw it in a cinema. It gives the look more character and personality.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip (Vallelonga) was perfectly cast, although he has never delivered a performance of this type or ethnicity, he truly delivers the part like a natural. Some may call it a little over the top, but so was the real Tony Lip, it goes all the way round into a very memorable performance. Mortensen truly delivers deep charatcer, and his work with Linda Cardellini as Dolores Vallelonga I'd say was one of the highlights of the film. But of course, his chemistry with Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley is the highlight, the play between these two, one is an informal bullshitter and the other a high class musician, the sparring is fun and memorable. Truly well cast and directed, there's so many scenes, almost all deliver the perfect chemistry to near perfection.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley is the supporting role of this road feature. I believe that his performance here may be even better than in moonlight, for not only is there more content, but the layers that Ali delivered through this character are incredible. He is a black man in 1960's America, the best piano player possibly in the world, and keep's his sexuality and past quiet. He is a highly conflicted and rather tragic character, and Ali delivers his vulnerability, and bravery with such class and vexation. Truly it may be the best of his career so far. And how this spars with Tony Lip is truly amazing. They are polar opposites, and the film doesn't just say it, it shows it, it make's it a core aspect of their relationship, they they can come together in such a wonderful intertwined friendship. Ali's gives a highly emotional and very layered performance, extremely well processed and masterfully performed, both seem like real awards contenders.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of this film was very strong, they all had functions that were clear. Most of all was Linda Cardellini as Dolores Vallelonga, her performance was absolutely wonderful. I'd say it's even being overlooked by awards due to how good the other two were, its truly amazing in its own right.<br/><br/>The mix of drama and comedy in this feature is tonally near perfect. Many films would dream of being this consistent and well balanced, it gets it just right, and is a great achievement by the screenwriters and how director Peter Farrelly has constructed the film with his editor. The characterisation in this film is very strong, for almost a fifth of the film is carried by Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip at the beginning. We meet him in the Copacabana nightclub in way that reminded my of Rick's in Casablanca. The vivid colours in the film and the suits, it displays who Tony is highly effectively and is some of the strongest characterisation I have seen all year. It was a perfect start to the film, without staring card and credits, just straight into it in a very natural and really probably my favourite opening to a film all year. The film has such a great message about friendship, overcoming racial boundaries and personal identity, it is a really good aura and atmosphere, particularly in these polarising times.<br/><br/>Musically this film is magnificent, I had heard that the films composer, Kris Bowers, had been a double for Ali on the piano. It seems absolutely seamless, we see Ali's full body while playing, its very well integrated. the score its self is beautiful, these compositions are complex and help to deliver Don Shirley's character, its part of his identity.<br/><br/>However, I must mention that in the innards of the second act, the film dragged a little too long. Perhaps if the film had been 10 maybe even 15 minute's shorter, it could have been a little bit slimmer but overall this didn't impede upon my enjoyment of the film overall much.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a wonderful movie, I enjoyed all parts of this feature. The spectacular cinematography that was poignant from start to finish, particularly in the opening. The wonderful performances that are truly worthy of all their recognition, and the great direction by Peter Farrelly, the beautiful music and heartwarming message the film delivers. Truly worth watching during this years christmas/holiday/awards season, great for all types of moviegoers, a great feel good movie. And truly a memorable one, 9/10."

Acting was on point, the history of the men's friendship was funny and had its ups and downs. It also showed racism which was nice to further show how dumb people were and still are about it but then again Morgan Freeman said it best.

","A immensely likeable true story of a couple of New Yorkers, one, an Italian from the Bronx hired as a driver to a black man from Manhattan, a piano prodigy, on a Southern bound tour w/his band. Played by Viggo Mortensen & Mahershala Ali respectively, this offbeat duo generate credible warmth & understanding as we see 2 opposites deal w/an ever changing world. Coming from Peter Farrelly, one half of the writing/directing duo behind many gross out hits, this down to Earth 'reel but true' account of this mismatched pair hits the right note of historical perspective & measured levity in a story that could've gone badly if presented incorrectly.

"bankofmarquis","9","2","4","14 December 2018"," A film with heart and 2 wonderful performances
","When the dust is settled on 2018, you can be rest assured that GREEN BOOK will be listed as one of my top films of the year.<br/><br/>Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>""Based on a true story"", GREEN BOOK stars Viggo Mortenson (Aragon in the LOTR films) as ""Tony Lip"" a bouncer at the Copacabana in the early 1960's who is tapped by African American concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali) to be his driver/escort/security on a tour of a very prejudicial Southern part of the United States in the early 1960's. Both Tony and Dr. Don look down their noses at the other one, but during the course of this film, the two develop mutual respect and a friendship that lasted until the both passed away in 2013.<br/><br/>That is, in essence, the entire plot of this film. But it is not the destination, but rather, the journey that is the core of this film - and what a journey it is.<br/><br/>We, the audience, probably spend 70% of the film in a car with the 2 stars of this film, so they better be interesting to look at and listen to (for nothing much else happens) and both characters - and both actors- are up to the task.<br/><br/>Ali won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brief turn in Barry Jenkins MOONLIGHT - and he is even better here as Dr. Don Shirley, an elitist virtuoso piano player, with strong pride and hidden secrets of his own. Ali brings a humanity and vulnerability to this character that acts as a softening of the hard shell of this character that allows us, the audience, a glimpse into this character's heart. This person could easily have been a one-note caricature, but in Ali's hands, it is much, much more.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me is two-time Oscar Nominee Mortenson as ""Tony Lip"". While the character starts as a typical early 1960's Italian-mob type, Mortenson brings humor, humanity and (yes) heart to a matter-of-fact character and continues to evolve the rough edges of Tony as Tony, himself, develops throughout the course of the film. I have always ""liked but not loved"" Mortenson, but, I LOVE HIM in this film and will be rooting for him come Oscars time.<br/><br/>The other big surprise of this film is the strong, subtle and human way that Director Peter Farrelly brings events to the screen. Prior to this, Farrelly (along with his brother Bobby) Directed such over-the-top comedies as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and KINGPIN, so I was a bit concerned that the Direction would be over-the-top. But...it wasn't...and I wouldn't be surprised if Farelly's name is called when Oscar nominations are announced.<br/><br/>I was charmed and moved by these characters - and this story - and was glad to spend 2 hours with them.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","Just got back from a secret screening of this movie. Never heard of it before this evening, when the title came up I had no idea what it was about. And sometimes that's the best way, no preconceptions to influence your experience.
This film is brilliant, if you get the chance to see it when it comes out on general release, go.
It's based on a true story, about an Italian American who is employed as the driver for an African American classical pianist on a tour of venues in the Deep South in 1962. A time when racial prejudice and segregation was rife, so much so, they were given a guide book of places ""coloured"" people were allowed to eat, sleep etc. And even though that sounds like it's going to be a gritty story, it was really funny too."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","26 November 2018"," Two knockout leading roles put ""Green Book"" on the level of similar uplifting Civil Rights-era movies
","We have no shortage of challenging/feel-good educational films about the Civil Rights era and Jim Crow South. That puts ""Green Book"" in the position to prove its salt, and while it doesn't necessary exceed the accomplishments of the prestige films of its ilk, it does enough to belong in the conversation among this frequented sub-genre's best thanks to a couple of outstanding lead performances.<br/><br/>The title refers to a guidebook published in the decades leading up to and during the Civil Rights era that listed lodging and other businesses friendly to African-Americans in a time when travelers might not know what to expect while traveling the country. In the instance of this story, it's a helpful resource to Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), the hired driver and bodyguard of renowned classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) who embarks on a concert tour of the South. Although incredible educated, talented and acclaimed, Shirley is nevertheless a black man, and the framework of segregation (maddeningly) applies.<br/><br/>Shirley is strangely not the main character of ""Green Book"" - Tony is - but this makes sense given that the story was co-written by Nick Vallelonga, Tony's son. We consequently experience the story through the eyes of this classically Italian-American nightclub bouncer from the Bronx, eyes that are of course a bit prejudiced and short-sighted, but clearly capable of seeing the truth.<br/><br/>The producers could've found any number of actors capable of playing a working-class Italian with a penchant for competitive eating, so the casting of Mortensen is both conflicting, because Mortensen isn't the slightest bit Italian, and brilliant. Seeing him take on a transformative role with a blue-collar comedic bent is a big part of the film's entertainment value. He's not always hilarious, but he's fun to watch and he can of course hit all the dramatic notes.<br/><br/>Humor is, of course, the specialty of director Peter Farrelly, who with his brother Bobby is best known for ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something about Mary"" and other low-brow comedies popular in the '90s and 2000s. Farrelly proves he's capable of more than gags with this effort, but there's a fair share of scenes whose purpose is solely laughs and that tactic proves hit and miss. In general, the weaving of lighter scenes depicting an unlikely friendship and the dramatic moments brought to bear by the cultural and historical context develops into a fairly obvious pattern.<br/><br/>Again, acting comes to the rescue. Don Shirley is already a distinctive character for a film of this kind given his wealth, education, taste and social status. Ali brings additional nuance to the role that highlights the unique difficulties of a man who doesn't even identify with or fit in with most other black people economically and socially yet faces discrimination from white people all the same. Ali shows us that loneliness while also conveying Shirley's courage and conviction.<br/><br/>These performances bolster a film that otherwise fits squarely in the mainstream mold of Civil Rights comedy/dramas. ""Green Book"" could easily be downplayed for never veering too far from the path of these inspirational Hollywood movies, but Mortensen and Ali insure the film's dimension and complexity enough that the cheesy uplift feels earned.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"cultfilmfan","10","2","4","25 November 2018"," Peter Farrelly's Green Book
","I love it when filmmakers who are usually classified, or tend to stick within one genre, or type of film only and then they eventually break that cycle and area of familiarity and do something radically different. In recent years I have cited examples such as Adam McKay who got away from his Will Ferrell films to do The Big Short, and not only was it the best reviewed film of his career, but it also won him a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. Something that most likely would not have happened if he had just stuck to his usual fare of manic if not sometimes annoying comedies. Also please take Todd Phillips who is also known for often raunchy teen oriented comedies such as The Hangover trilogy and others that pretty much fall into the same category. He branched out and tried a mix between comedy and drama in War Dogs, and whilst the film got mixed reviews generally, I would personally say that it was the best accomplishment of his career and further reaching out for new goals, he was also the producer of this year's version of A Star is Born which has been a big hit with audiences, critics and at the box office. Some say that it still has a very good chance to nab several Oscars, possibly even Best Picture. Now in this case with Green Book, we have writer/director Peter Farrelly who is again known for mostly doing gross out, or raunchy and immature comedies such as the Dumb and Dumber films and various others. I have liked some of his and his brother Bobby's work in the past, especially something like There's Something About Mary, but more often than not, their particular brand of humour was often far different than my own personal taste. This time around, Peter takes a true story and helps write the screenplay and directs, but here he chooses a film that has just as much if not more laughs than the films he would normally do, but also at the same time he gives the film a timely message of friendship and acceptance and I think anyone who is not deeply moved by the film on some level probably saw a different film than I did. It is full of rich humour and some of the best work from dependable actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. The film is all the more timely because as we all know the problem with racism in our world is still running rampant and how refreshing it is to see two men from completely different backgrounds and are more or less worlds apart from one another and how they form a bond and connection that will lead to a lasting friendship and a road trip across the Southern United States that I doubt either man would ever forget. Viggo's character is a bouncer in several nightclubs in the Bronx area of New York. He has a large appetite, uses coarse language on a regular basis and is a little rough around the edges and tends to have a habit of either winning people over with his schemes and dubious personality, or at the same time completely offending, or turning people off as in the case of Mahershala Ali's character. Ali's character is a concert pianist with many degrees and doctorates and is very well spoken and educated. He couldn't be more different than Viggo's character if he tried. And there is also the cultural differences such as Viggo's Italian background and Ali's character being of African American descent. This looks like it would be the worst possible match in history and yet Viggo drives Ali's character across the United States for about two months to get him to his various different concert performances. The two will occasionally bicker with more often than not, Ali's character being completely exasperated and often offended and turned off by Viggo's character's more street type talk and peronality. However, as time goes by the two do form a common bond with one another and actually start to become friends. As well as on several occasions while in the deep Southern states that Viggo will come to Ali's rescue and one humourous instance where Ali uses a powerful ally to bail them out of a tough spot. This is a film about putting any and all prejudices aside and seeing goodness within your fellow man and learning to appreciate that. This road trip truly shapes these two characters in marvellous ways and we see that deep down under a rough exterior that Viggo's character has a huge heart and that Ali deep down is dealing with loneliness and his own trials and tribulations, but is further helped by Viggo's friendship and way, or should I say lack of way with words and handling people. This is an absolutely wonderful film that made me laugh more than any other film this year and at the same time it warmed my heart and moved me and helped me to appreciate the racist attitudes of the 60's when the film takes place and again show how we still need to further move ahead as a society. The performances by the two leads are I think the two best male performances I have seen this year and the characters are so wonderfully vibrant and full of emotions, personality and life all thanks to a meticulously researched and well scripted story for our actors and characters.
A film of this type of quality does not come along too often, so I suggest you see it while you can and do not be surprised to see various Oscar nominations and even potential wins. One of the best films of this year."
"jcoberkrom","9","2","4","24 November 2018"," TV Preview Does Not do this movie justice
","First, this is a great Christmas movie, but a little more on that latter.
Second, this is a buddy movie! One that consists of the two people who could not be more different.
Third, this is a VERY funny movie and there in lies its strength.
Sadly, the TV preview makes one think this is a movies of prejudice and discrimination the south in the 1960's. But it's about a white average Joe and a cultured black man. who help each other become more well rounded and better human beings overall.
It reminds us of the segregated south and it's evils (alas too much of which still remains) but it does it almost surreptitiously. It makes it personal, so we can understand it better.
However, without this aspect it would still be a good movie, but with it, it makes it great.
While the acting of the two leads could. not be better don't overlook the performance of Linda Cardellini.
before As for it being a Christmas movie, Christmas is about family, friends and peace on earth good will to men, See it. You'll see exactly what I mean."
"Andrew_Wiper","9","2","4","24 November 2018"," Great acting, heartwarming story.
","As far as on the road, buddy movies go, I'd say Green Book is my new favourite. This was marvellously directed by Peter Farrelly in his first solo venture, apart from his brother Bobby. The movie, though it has some good laughs in it, is clearly more of a dramatic movie and Peter Farelly's first one in his career. I guess he knows how to do great drama too! The performances were stellar. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are terrific together and have a great chemistry in this. The musical scenes were tremendously performed by Mahershala Ali and on top of that the score was great too. For a movie about race and prejudice in the early 60's south it will undoubtedly win you over with its heartwarming touch. Funny and dramatic. This is a great holiday movie. 9/10"
"championscon","9","2","4","24 November 2018"," Rocking!
","The Holidays often bring too many quality choices on our screens and all families have a hard time choosing a quality film to enjoy. As a mixed couple now in our 40's we got to check the Green Book and what a beautiful thing that was.<br/><br/>The Director, Peter Farrelly, which is most known as one of the Farelly brothers that penned funny, yet on the offensive side of things, movies when I was coming of age, surprised me greatly here because of the engaging rhythm and subtle yet powerful approach he instilled in this particular work.<br/><br/>It is a road trip movie, with tropes that we may expect but also with just the right amount of surprises, softness, power and explosive moments all audiences like to experience.<br/><br/>In the political context we are living in, revisiting such a disgraceful period of the American history with such poise is actually remarkable. It could be the breath of the original story and characters we explore, it could be that we indeed learned from decades of subtle and not so subtle struggles, but this movie instead of being sanctimonious, dragging your spirit down or simply being boring gives you that elusive but so lovely feeling that the world can be right, can be funny, and certainly can still be surprising.<br/><br/>There undoubtedly are recognizable steps found in most road trip movies present here, but the fact that you are limited spatially and morally by the external boundaries shaping the lives of the protagonists, your life, following theirs, expand in such a way that there is a real delicate pleasure found in undertaking this journey with actors portraying these imperfect characters with gusto and inspiration.<br/><br/>The laughs are authentic, the music is a pure pleasure and the character development is genuine. It bears to talk for a moment about the beautiful recreations of the 1962 urban landscapes, the approach to costume design and the fabulous sets for the interior design giving depth to the story. It shows you how people lived and worked vividly, including how tight spaces were.<br/><br/>It really is the kind of film you can enjoy by yourself, as a couple, with the whole family, and even your whole congregation. You would come out of it eager to take a moment to discover the soundtrack, to share the feelings of kindness and decency it inspires, and even better, to root for this little movie that could...<br/><br/>Let's be particularly glad to know that in this day and age there are courageous souls that choose to produce, write, direct and play in movies that are willing to face history rather than discredit, malign or ignore its lessons, as well as its surreal and malicious impact on the lives of those that have no power and means to protect themselves.
We need more of those and until then let's appreciate this wonderfully engaging and satisfying movie that is the Green Book, and be thankful for Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen chemistry and skills as actors. They rocked it!"

"rannynm","10","2","4","21 November 2018"," Green Book: Powerful Portrayal Of An Inspirational Journey Promoting Courage, Activism And Always Doing What's Right
","Sometimes being alone means not being accepted. A fact that some have attempted to convey in the art of cinema, but only a few reach the precision and emotional strength of Green Book which shows not only the complex and dark social issues of the 1960s but also demonstrates the power and emotion of feeling truly alone.<br/><br/>This movie contains a massively wide range of emotions. At times, the story is driven by love, romance and family. At other times, the characters live in racism, homophobia and segregation as it directly addresses and shows the darkness of the 60s in the United States. Yet still, the viewer will be surprised by the amount of humor and wonderfully vibrant moments that are portrayed. They will make you laugh in all the right places, without interrupting truly emotional moments.<br/><br/>Taking place in the 1960s, Green Book follows the highly famous and incredibly successful pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who takes great risks as an African American man touring through the highly racial deep south. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) accompanies Shirley going from his driver to savior to eventually, his close friend. As the tour progresses, the audience goes through many parts of the south where not only racism was prevalent against African Americans and Italians, but also acknowledge the severe homophobia that existed so terribly in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the most lovable aspects of this movie can be attributed to the story itself. Every person in the film has a major character arc in which they become completely reshaped and remolded by the end. The entire cast performs with Oscar-worthy emotional portrayals of their characters. Mahershala once again delivers absolutely heart-wrenching scenes as the audience becomes acquainted with the lonesome and depressed life Don Shirley lives in, despite being unarguably talented and highly intelligent. The complexities in the set design, costume design, and overall tone of the entire world never run out of depth as the entire film feels as if it truly belongs in the 1960s, despite being shot nearly half a century later. Director Peter Farrelly may be seasoned in humoristic comedies, but makes sure his background stays separate for this film. With his lead, the audience experiences bitter reality and, with the help of cinematographer Sean Porter, view a vivid and colorful picture of United States in the 1960s, from up north in New York all the way to down south in Alabama.<br/><br/>Cinema about musicians would be blasphemy without an impressive soundtrack to follow suit. From music considered modern and pop for that era, to classical pieces hundreds of years old, Green Book promises a highly wide and diverse soundtrack that highlights itself as one of the greatest this year. Furthermore, the music tells the story as it begins with 1960s music, but slowly goes more and more towards classical and orchestral as the story unfolds and the viewer learns more about the conflicts of pianist Don Shirley. Furthermore, despite being over two hours long, the film keeps you captivated for the entire runtime and leaves you satisfied with a natural and beautiful ending.<br/><br/>Instead of a favorite scene, I would like to talk about several sequences present in the film. Since they're on tour, of course, Shirley and his fellow musicians in his trio are shown playing music. Yet, this varies in emotion, strength and passion as real-life events impact Don Shirley's craft just as the events impact his actual character. The power of his work never dwindles and always leaves you in awe. During the performance scenes, every aspect of the film shines with absolutely masterful cinematographic compositions that seem to isolate the musicians and truly captures the raw emotions such powerful music creates.<br/><br/>Despite the beauty and power that hold true throughout this film, it does have things to concern parents. As previously stated, the film embraces the bitter and blunt reality of the 1960s, from homophobia to racism. This makes it most appropriate for ages 14 to 18, as well as adults. I absolutely give the film 5 out of 5 stars for its powerful portrayal of an inspirational journey that promotes courage, activism and always doing what's right in the world.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

Regardless of how the underlying colored people are oppressed but succeeded, the elegant non-white people can't integrate into the mainstream society, and the perspective is quite unique. When I saw it, I knew it was based on a true story, even if I knew that the movie was inevitably sensational, but in the social environment at that time, the friendship between the two people was still beautiful and touching.

","A subtle movie that makes its points with action, showing us just a glimpse of what it was like in the southern states in the 1960s. The Green Book was a real book that Negroes had to use to find out which hotels would accept them and which wouldn't. The black person, in southern states, had few rights until the landmark civil rights bills of 1964-65. This film shows us some of milder white reaction to black people. Murders, lynchings are violence of all kinds was par for the course in these states. The movie does a great job telling a true story -- one that involved a high-ranking official in the Kennedy administration to bring justice for Dr. Shirley. The soundtrack is the worst aspect of the film. Only one song, ""Slow Twistin'"" by Chubby Checker is reminiscent of 1962. If the filmmakers really wanted to set the mood for 1962 they would not have used songs from the 40s and 50s and pretended that was what Americans were listening to in 1962."

","Even after the freedom of slaves by the 13th amendment, still the black people in america were not living well. they had to face sever discrimination. This movie points out the dark colors of the white peoples minds in treating black people. Even though they in some cases became higher in class than them in education, skill, qualification. Yet the skin of their color made white people think they cannot sit with us, they are inferior, they cannot come to our homes, they cannot eat with us. it is a journey of two minds learning from each other. Knowing each other made them point out their faults and both tried to change those faults and became a new person. this movie will make you feel like you are on a journey of souls and emotion and discovery and ofcourse, history. definitely worth watching"

","The color matching version of ""untouchable"", a road trip across the United States, but also a human journey across race and color, identity and class. All the subordinates were respectful to Tang. Only Tony treated him as an ordinary person, gave him fried chicken and told him the real idea. It's true not to discriminate against him by not treating him as black. On the other hand, Tang was discriminated and insulted by other people. He always held his breath. The audience who listened to him could eat in the restaurant, but not as a performer. It was Tony who taught him to fight back, to speak for himself and to defend his rights and dignity. It's ironic to be treated unfairly in the so-called ""high-end and noble"" places, but to be respected and supported in the ""low-end and humble"" black bars. Genius is not enough. Only courage can change people's hearts. Since he doesn't think about your feelings, why do you take care of his emotions? Bear to push forward for a while and step back to make progress.

In the eyes of blacks, he was also alien, because he lived an elegant life and never lowered his posture, contrary to the black public at that time.

","The most basic ability of the ""Green Book"" is to show a fun journey between two people, and it is meaningful.<br/><br/>Tony (Vigo Mortensen) is street wise. Over the years, he has been crawling on the ground floor. He is like a cowboy under the sun and dusk. He is good at weaving Xiao En Xiao Hui Xiao Xiao into a shabby but durable rope, and set it out, always getting some benefits back. In his case, there is no way out. Even if there is no job, the weight of the 26 hot dogs will at least be enough for him to collect 50 dollars.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Tang (Mahshara Ali), as a well-established musician, does not touch the spring water with his fingers, and the ornate residence on the top of the theater, plus a high throne, is enough to exaggerate his identity and glory. Such a person is self-denying and elegant. If he wants to eat, he must lay a napkin of good quality.<br/><br/>Such two people who couldn't beat each other in life were tied together for two months because of the employment relationship they needed each other.<br/><br/>Everyone looks down on each other. How much Don looked down on Tony casually, how much Tony looked down on Don's contortion. However, Tang's cultivation will not let him show over-excited emotions, and Tony's profession makes him do his job.<br/><br/>""Green Book"" is very playful, causing frequent friction between drivers and employers. It is not the confrontation between the needle point and Mai Mang, but the provocation, helplessness, curiosity, and tolerance mixed with each other, transforming each other's ""offense"" into a highly infectious understanding and acceptance.<br/><br/>Tony, who was by nature, thought that he couldn't smoke in the car and had to be standardized, but he saw Tang's performance the first night, and the expression of appreciation and even pride appeared unconsciously. Don respected the fried chicken, but Tony couldn't help but draw a chicken leg out of the KFC's family bucket to him, leaving him helpless, but also enjoying an ""unhygienic"" happiness.<br/><br/>Countless clips that can make people smile, the Green Book becomes more and more like that warm spring, with snow and snow."

"higherall7","9","0","0","25 March 2020"," One Odd Couple for the Road...
","This is a fine movie about what makes for friendship across cultures. At the beginning, the gruff 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga played by Viggo Mortensen seems too down with it and streetwise to meaningfully bond with the exalting Doctor Don Shirley as stirringly represented by Mahershala Ali. However, through the course of the narrative, their characters prove to have complementary angles that eventually add up to the 180 degrees needed for a stable friendship.<br/><br/>The truth is people like Doctor Don Shirley are much more familiar to me than characters like John Shaft and Priest Youngblood. Black Folks can seem like everyday people until you sit down and talk to them and gradually find they are revealed as highly accomplished, and, more often than not, formally or informally expert in some field or another. I knew this fellow named Amos, an older gentleman I worked with when I was transporting cars around the lot at Hertz Rent-A-Car. Anyone could tell him about a major or minor problem they were having with their car, and you would swear you were listening to Sherlock Holmes, the way he could deduce from signs and symptoms what was wrong with your automobile, or less charitably, a professor at a Community College giving a lecture on Automotive Mechanics.<br/><br/>We would hear about what happened to the John Shaft and Priest Youngblood types in anecdotes. Usually, how they had been thrown in the river or died in some kind of shootout. But the Don Shirleys of the world I more easily found myself crossing paths with in some way or another. There were the magnetic and charismatic individuals like Reverend Spahn, who would come to our house and wax rhapsodic about Gandhi, and the sense of liberation he discovered and experienced devoting himself to the service of others. There were other folks like the Reverend Tommy Butler, who wrote and directed the Pulitzer Prize caliber musical SELMA, with followers and devotees comparing him to Duke Ellington, not withstanding that he was also a third degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. So running into every day people who, when you scratched the surface, were highly accomplished in one way or another, was more commonplace within the Black Community than you might imagine.<br/><br/>Doctor Don Shirley, you could say, represents the apex of his ilk. A man who, evidently, spoke several languages and was the proud possessor of several academic degrees, while being feted around the world as a great classical and jazz pianist. He still finds himself, whether he realizes it or not, in need of serious security and the muscle of an Italian American bouncer, notwithstanding his true status as a member of intellectual and artistic royalty. He will also be depending on a guide book compiled by Victor Hugo Green as he makes his way through the Midwest and the racism of the Deep South with his concert tour.<br/><br/>There are surprises galore as the two men evolve past their own prejudices against each other and use their wits and good will to navigate through the chauvinism of their times. The director Peter Farrelly, with a penetrating sociological and psychological insight that hits more often than it misses, drives along with this unlikely pair through the cold and the snow home to the rousing musical score of Kris Bowers. Seems we are just in time for dinner, not far from the street sign that reads LIFETIME FRIENDSHIP.<br/><br/>I would also like to thank a beloved friend for recommending this movie to me and bringing me here as well."

","Green Book, the Best Picture Academy Award Winner of 2018, is the story of Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) and Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). The latter being a celebrated African-American pianist and the former being the man hired to drive him around Southern USA. In the 60s, when racial separation was still very much enforced in those states.<br/><br/>It is a good movie. A bit of a slow one, with a clear, easy to understand structure. But it's very much an actor's film, with most of the heavy lifting resting on its two main leads. Luckily, both of them are powerhouse actors, easily able to sell the complex emotions, frustrations and joys required to sell you, the viewer, this emerging friendship. Both were also nominated for an Academy Award for their performances, with Ali winning for Best Supporting Actor. Earned, I'd say.<br/><br/>I call it an actor's film, but it's not like all the other aspects of a film were in any way lackluster. It's a well-shot, well-paced film with good dialogues, good music and good locations. Not a flashy movie by any means, but the craft is definitely there.<br/><br/>All that being said, I don't think this was the best film of 2018. It's a good film, but quite honestly I found myself thinking that I had already seen many movies just like it as I walked out of the theatre. It's a feel-good movie about two people finding common ground despite their differences. With a healthy dose of race being thrown in. Does this lessen the movie's value? No, no at all. But I'd like to expect something extra from a Best Picture winner.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is good, don't get me wrong. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of its genre."
"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Null","0","0","7 July 2019"," Having good friends is important, interesting idealistic secondary character
","This movie probably could have been made more interesting, but it does have a few interesting ideas.<br/><br/>Firstly, it shows that in life you can endure a lot if you have people that you can trust and rely on.
Also, it shows an interesting idealistic secondary character (black guy), who also works hard to make the best impression of the people he represents and is prepared to endure a lot because of that.
Another thought that I have is how lonely the black guy was. Not great, not terrible, but it seems you can endure being quite lonely for a long time, even though he wasn't feeling great.<br/><br/>This movie does have quite a few emotional moments and it was good.<br/><br/>I was happy to see that Aragorn actor made another famous movie after so many years."

","The subtlety in this movie is exceptional - and it has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, racism, music and friendship.

The Green Book is a film about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual support between people. Enjoyed it thoroughly."

","""Green Book"" tells the story of a talented musician of color who needs a driver for a tour to the South of America. When he is confronted with a rather direct Italian with some mafia contacts, a tour begins in which they both learn a lot about racism and themselves.<br/><br/>The movie has a very touching and inspiring story. There were some controversies regarding the authenticity of that story and it should be stated that it is not sure to which extent the film is based on true events. The producers have an eye for comedy elements and tend to use them quite often, which is good for the entertainment value of the production but sometimes prevents a more sinister look on the underlying questions and problems. As it is, the movie is a good one and an enrichment but it isn't, in my eyes, absolutely outstanding.<br/><br/>All in all this is surely worth a watch and raises some questions for the audience to think about.

","Damn those critics! I had my expectations of this film sullied by the critics who had described Green Book as ""this time the racist is in the front"" - a nod to Driving Miss Daisy. By this I had expectations that Viggo Mortensen's character Tony would be repulsive. This never manifests as barring a scene early on in the family home, he comes across as a wily, streetwise bloke. For the 1960's Tony 'The Lip' is incredibly open minded.<br/><br/>The film itself is poorly written, on more than one occasion I exclaimed ""that character would not do that"" or ""this wouldn't happen"". I was also confused as to why the Dr actually wanted to venture into the deep south of America only to suddenly feel a fit of personal aversion on the last.<br/><br/>I also strongly feel that the director failed to get true pathos from either lead especially when they demonstrated the had it in them in a couple of scenes: when the car stops next to the field workers and when it stops in the rain.<br/><br/>It is a good film but the discerning purveyor of decent cinema will not enjoy the shoehorning in of identity politics to gain American kudos."

","Green Book<br/><br/>The hardest part of driving through the southern US is convincing folks the internal combustion engine isn't witchcraft.<br/><br/>Sadly, the driver in this drama must also persuade southerners that his black passenger is human.<br/><br/>When nightclub bouncer Frank Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is laid off, he takes a job driving around jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he plays throughout the lower states. While the lowbrow Vallelonga and the snobbish Shirley struggle to find common ground, they eventually become friends and learn to navigate the racism embedded in the south.<br/><br/>Loosely based on a true story, many liberties were taken to make this interracial buddy movie more palatable to modern day audiences. And while the freedom taken can be called into question, the overall message of tolerance is inarguable, along with the strong performances.<br/><br/>And while having a white male driver may curtail racial violence, road rage incidents would double.

","This is a tale of a working-class Italian American driver - Tony (played by Viggo Mortensen), hired by a celebrated African-American pianist - Don,played Mahershala Ali. Tony is seen to be prejudiced and politically incorrect while Don seeks to refine his language and behavior, projecting his superiority. But both men have something to teach each other, as Tony tries to chip away Don's quixotic nature, which is a poor and potentially fatal fit for the Apartheid system of the South in the 1960s. Particularly memorable is a brief scene of Don, in his suit, staring out at the plantation filled with African American workers.<br/><br/>Tony and Don get through many problems, some of them self-inflicted. They solve the problems in their own ways, although Don keeps emphasising his idealist spirit while Tony prefers to solve his problems in a quick and dirty way.
By Christmas, the pair return back to New York, after their experiences have changed them. Despite all his wealth, Don is often lonely while Tony is willing to welcome him like a brother, overcoming his past prejudices."

As some, who doesn't particular find any sexually related humor, anything but funny, this movie was able to not only put a smile on my face, but rather laugh out loud. Although, themes like segregation and racism are being touched (i guess it would be inevitably considering the time that the story is being told in and our main character), the overall movie remains light and funny.

","Green Book is a well-directed movie with great acting not only in the main characters but in my opinion it is lacking some detail and therefore depth in the story. While addressing the on going race issue (as such an important topic especially nowadays) it would have been nice to see the focus on Dr.Shirley and his very moving & mysterious character instead of giving too many (unnecessary) details about Tony-the white guy. To me, this makes the movie less credible in the way that it attempts to address the racial issue but appears to be making some mistakes in that agenda itself.

"v-tepavicharov","10","0","0","26 February 2019"," Reality makes this movie truly shine for me
","First of all, I would like to point out that I am an IMDB user for the last decade. Apart from the 600+ ratings and the fact I am a self-proclaimed movie critic, if there is even such a thing, I never write reviews since not many people share my points of view but this movie deserves all the praise it gets and more.<br/><br/>First off, the actors - Mortensen has been a favourite of mine from a long time. He came to my attention with his performance in ""Eastern Promises"" followed shortly by ""The Road"". I never could get into all the hype surrounding ""The Lord of The Rings"" back in the good old days, so I can't really say anything about his performancet there. Here he plays the role of your typical ignorant tunnel-vision 'smart guy' that think he is on top of all things and knows it all. As the movie (and real life story happened, I hope) progresses he starts to see the faults in his ways. Viggo or Tony has seen and dealt with things that Dr. Shirley hasn't really encountered since he steers clear of most people and things. He holds knowledge in him that is new and somewhat interesting to the Doc.<br/><br/>Second, the Doc.Mahershala Ali's talent is well known. From his role as Remy Danton in House of Cards (my first real observation of his talent) to one of his latest portrayals in True Detective as Detective Hays. I am pretty sure he can act as anyone in any type of movie and any setting. Enough gushing over him. He plays this immensely talented piano player who is coloured during the 60s in the States. Now, I ain't American hence I do not really understand the whole grip but I suffer from a rare disease so I kind of know the feelings of isolation, mockery and straight-up shunning. He holds his standards high since he is used to them and initially cannot see the ways of Tony. As the road passes by so does their time spent together and eventually the Doc warms up to his driver. As I pointed out previously the Doc posses knowledge of something that Tony doesn't truly understand and hence why they make such a good combo and are eventually brought to life by those two great actors beautifully.<br/><br/>All in all - a rare Oscar winner that actually deserves it. I was very nicely surprised when it finished and the feeling that it left within me. I won't spoil anything further. All I will say is - watch it. Totally worth it and I hope you take out something more from this movie besides ""a chauffeur and a musician"" movie since there is. You just gotta really watch the movie. Verdict - 10/10. Hats off."

It casually win since Driving Miss Daisy. The point of society may treat not right and life cruelty. The friendship develop fire forge understanding bigotry of white and black in 1960s. The problem is racial slur N word upset African viewers which Viggo role of Tony Noble bigotry use but Mortensen doesn't want or like say because he wary of word. I understand he doesn't so did Ali had to accept the Best Picture due to Era of Trump. Movie bug viewer which show life unfair to Don.

He knew Duke Ellington can't get more black than him.<br/><br/>He was not estranged from his family. He had three brothers also all Drs - (one medical or maybe two) and they talked all the time.<br/><br/>He came from an upper class family who are of Jamaica descent, there is no way he saw Tony as anything but his employee, saw straight through that one as soon as the film started. Though I'm sure they had a mutual respect for one another.<br/><br/>I guess creativity is part of what the movie industry does, but it would have been nice if some more of it actually paralleled his life.<br/><br/>Also, the green book could have been explored more since that was the title of the film and it was very important, providing lists of safe, welcoming, nice accommodations, also overlooked in the film.<br/><br/>I begining to sound like a film critic.

","Peter Farrelly, who is mostly associated with his quirky, slightly offensive comedy and romantic comedy films that he usually directs with his fellow brother - Bobby, such as Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, makes a solo heartfelt, pragmatic and humanistic direction (that marks a stark contrast of his directions on the comedy) while tackling down difficult subject matters of racism into the filmmaking, making it as relevant to the today's divisive political background and at the same time, blending well with comedy into the narrative.<br/><br/>While the story is nothing short but meaningful, compelling, nuanced, and thought-provoking, it also resembled some similarity to Driving Miss Daisy, in which the narrative of a black driving for the white is now role-reversed with a white driving for the black, which is somehow problematic but is nevertheless outright entertaining. Furthermore, its display of an unconventional friendship between a black and white is also convincing.<br/><br/>But what truly serves as the film's shining quality was of the exceptional, charismatic and superb performances, and chemistry of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in their performances of Tony Lip and Don Shirley, both of which really nailed the perfectly comedic timing as well as the earthly dramatic performances in every scene of which they dominate and can be summed up as a total knockout.<br/><br/>Yet, the film can't be described as truly perfect as it has its share of flaws, most particularly into the story's blatant historical inaccuracies, which focused onto the relationship of Shirley to his family and to Tony Lip that were being misinterpreted into the translation to the film, as well as its perceived white savior narrative. In addition, the story is also predictable especially to the third act. Other issues that plagued this film is mostly focused onto the pacing that can be uneven and quite dragging as well the editing which also looks uninteresting and cliched.<br/><br/>Still, the film is yet worth watching and makes it as an heartfelt and entertaining experience especially to any group of friends that can relate to its story and is no doubt serves as one of the best films of 2018."

","'Green Book' is charming, funny and heart warming. Oh, and ""based"" on a true story. ""Inspired"" may have been an even better choice. So if your looking for historical accuracy, you may want to pass. However, taken for what it is, a road trip movie about two diametrically opposed characters directed by Peter Farrelly, it's a fun and thoughful story. It's flawed only by its inability to decide if it is about the characters or investigating a bigger idea about race then and now. There is no question that this subject, especially in these times, deserves better and more serious consideration but does every movie about race in America have to be charged with that duty? (This may be the fault of sloppy marketing that leaned into the ""based on a true story"" trailer plug. ) Having said that, there is a lot to unpack here and the movie gets bogged down in too many running themes. (Thus a 7 over an 8 rating) Mortensen and Ali have a nice chemistry. It'd be cool if they did something else together.

Not every movie about racial issues need to be like 12 Years A Slave or American History X. A more light-hearted story could be equally effective to deliver its message.<br/><br/>However, what made me love this movie the most comes down to the fantastic performances by both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali who share great chemistry in every scene they're in. Something about their interaction with each other strikes me so sincerely. They develop nicely throughout the story as they face so many hardships together and the ending left a small tear in my eye.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Green Book will win the ""Best Original Screenplay"" category at the Oscars as I feel the competition is very strong (especially with ""The Favourite"" being in there), but I really feel like it deserved its nomination and the dialogue between Vallelonga and Shirley really brought out the best from their characters in a humorous way. The audience at my cinema had plenty of big laughs throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For the technical side of things, this movie isn't that special; cinematography, editing, costumes, sets are all fine but nothing outstanding. But it doesn't matter too much as the script and acting performances is really what should be enjoyed in this one.

Simple as that. The man is our modern day Robert De Niro but better. Tony easily could've been unlikable, but Mortensen exudes charm without sparing complexities. His Tony still says wrong and insensitive things but with Mortensen's nuance the audience are able to understand where this comes from. Another staggeringly warming performance to add to Mortensen's impressive resume.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali, I said to everyone after seeing Moonlight he would be the next big thing and my god is he a talent. Subtle, refined and vulnerable. Ali contrasts his mighty stature with an incredible vulnerability that gives Doc Shirley all the layers that in a lesser actor's hands would be one note. Mahershala Ali never fails to impress, at times showing his comedic chops but then his deep isolation only seen through his expressive eyes.<br/><br/>Linda Cardellini also provides solid support to a script that doesn't really do her any favours. The minor gripes I had with the film was the workman like effort of the cinematography and editing. Simple two way shots and cuts but this was all pushed aside for Mortensen's and Ali's magnetic performances.<br/><br/>The story was interesting and one hopes that it was true and without any addition of false events as some scenes were genuinely funny and it would be even funnier to know that they happened in reality.<br/><br/>Whilst the script in my opinion wasn't worthy of an Academy Award Nomination (mainly due to worthier competition), there are some incredibly subtle references and notions that were fun to pick out whilst the more overt references were also enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film is infectiously funny, heartwarmingly touching and I completely recommend the picture to go and have a great laugh and an enjoyable time. I usually go to watch more serious and depressing stories at the cinema but it was a lovely change to come out of the cinema with a great big beaming smile on my face, which was in no small part to Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali."

","I'm all for crowd pleasing movies. I'm the guy that loves The Intern, Eddie the Eagle, and this year's Instant Family. Green Book falls into a similar category to an extent, but it attempts to be a little more than it may have earned. The crux of Green Book is the bond and chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), and in this vein, it succeeds immensely. It's their back and forth that proves to be a powerful viewing experience in the theater. However, what the film tries to save about race, sexuality, & class feels very surface level and cliched. It works consistently but not to the point that other films have in recent years about similar subject matters. And perhaps it's not trying to be anything more than a crowd pleasing movie about friendships and criticisms like mine won't seem fair, but if it's going to be considered for best picture, then it should be brought up. In the end, it's about how everyone in the world has something to learn from somebody, no matter race, gender, nationality, or sexual preference.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"blanbrn","10","3","8","27 November 2018"," Great film of connection and uncommon friendship, speaks and brings thought to a troubled age of today.
","""Green Book"" is a great and film that really speaks volumes and sends a message of love, caring, and friendship. It proves that thru bonding that prejudice and racism can be challenged and fought against. The film which was well directed by Peter Farrelly(""Dumb and Dumber"") is based on the true story of black classic concert pianist Dr. Shirley(in a super performance from Mahershala Ali) and his travels thru the deep south for concert work during the turbulent times of the 1960's. And shown is the work of his sidekick and go along travel partner and driver Tony Lip(in a well rounded and blended take from Viggo Mortensen) who as an Italian American bouncer learns life and forms the friendship of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The film really captures the times of the 1960's well with it's scenes of the automobile types and the food products, diners, and gas stations. Most of all the way it portrays the times and the people of the south is spot on with racism and prejudice. Shown are the moments Dr. Shirley faces of not being served with whites at fine restaurants and his not being treated well at a clothing story. Plus the police treat him and Tony both different as arrest are made of both on their journey trip adventure of human growth and developing friendship.<br/><br/>Overall excellent film that should bring up thought and conversation to want to change people's views and outlook on race, class, and life as we still occupy a troubled age. This film sends a message to love and live life thru connection as on one's journey friendship is possible as no matter the color of skin or how different that of a background love defeats prejudice and racism."

","The basic storyline for this movie, a very personal look at the state of race relations in America in 1962, is all set up for penetrating drama, but one thing I didn't expect going in to the the theater last night is how funny it is. It's an Odd Couple buddy movie, and the script gives lots of chances for driver/bouncer/jack-of-all-trades Tony (played by Viggo Mortensen) to bounce off pianist virtuoso Don (Mahershala Ali) as they gradually come to understand each other's very different worlds during a two-month road trip.<br/><br/>Ali plays a rather restrained role this time out as a famed classically trained pianist who has learned to keep his temper and maintain his dignity in the face of constant, daily insults, slights, and (at times) physically dangerous attacks simply because he's black. On concert tours we see that he keeps to himself, drinks pretty heavily at night, and is flat-out lonely. But this movie really belongs to Mortensen, who has to be the best actor around never (yet) to win an Oscar. As he has done with all of his movie roles, he completely and utterly vanishes into his character, down to the smallest gesture, details of accent, and even weight gain (to match Tony's habit of constantly eating mediocre food accompanied by chain smoking). He's an actor's actor, and I sure hope his work gets recognized this time out.<br/><br/>The script has a pretty big cast overall, because Tony and Don meet a lot of other people on their extended tour (in addition to very entertaining occasional cuts back to Tony's extended Italo-American family in the Bronx as Tony's wife (Linda Cardeliini) reads out his letters from the road). They're all excellent. Go see this movie, you won't regret it."

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such great rapport in this movie, you can't help but be 100 percent along for the drive. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and most of it sticks. It's a story we have seen before, and will likely see again, but it's these two actors' chemistry that make this film. It could have been a little more dramatic and I do wish it delved into that a little more, but it ended up being a nice Christmas movie that arrives just in time for the holidays."

","I was lucky to have been able to attend an early screening of this wonderful movie.The Green Book was so shocking but historically and tragically realistic. During a period in our lives when there is so much hate being perpetuated, this movie is a great eye opener. A very brief glimpse of the way African Americans were being treated in the eastern -midwest and South in particular.
I highly recommend this film. It is both heart warming and shocking. Don't want to spoil any of the movie for anyone.
Dr. Don Shirley was an Amazing Virtuoso. Born with a Savant talent for piano that only others could wish for. Mahershala Ali's acting and piano playing were remarkable. A must go see. Bring your teenagers. Its a great history lesson and great eye opener."

","So, I had to watch Green Book after it won Best Picture at the Oscars. I was weary of the movie even before I made plans to watch it. Why? The reactions of Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee at the Academy Awards were reason enough. Having seen the movie, I realised that this had ""Oscar Bait"" written all over it. But, I'll admit this. Green Book was a nice one. You get that heartwarming feel as the end credits roll. It's a bit too long though. They could have cut 15 minutes off of it and nothing would have changed.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances: Mahershala stole the show. This was his movie all along. At least in Moonlight, there were the other kids and Naomie Harris. However, I wasn't onboard with Viggo Mortensen's Tony Lip. It was as if he prepared for the role by watching Scorsese films. His character seemed like an extra from The Sopranos. Linda Cardellini does a pretty good job as Tony Lip's wife - a role that could have used additional screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, Green Book can best be described as a White Man's Wet Dream."

","1962. A bigoted Italian-American bouncer, Tony Lip, gets the job of driving Dr Don Shirley, renowned African-American pianist, on his tour across the mid-West and South. The two could not be more different.<br/><br/>I did not have high expectations for this movie. I knew it would be good, but figured it wouldn't cover any new ground. Moreover, it seemed like a reverse Driving Miss Daisy (not that DMD is a bad movie - quite the opposite - but that it had been done before).<br/><br/>I needn't have worried. The outcome is fairly predictable, but that doesn't matter: the getting there is original, interesting, engaging, thought-provoking and great.<br/><br/>Director Peter Farrelly sets the scene well and paces the movie to perfection. The characters of Tony Lip and Don Shirley are well drawn and developed, making for high engagement levels. You can see their views and characters evolve before your eyes, see the events that shape them and how these influence their future actions. There's also a decent smattering of humour to aid the engagement.<br/><br/>Some great social commentary too, especially on racial attitudes of the day and on tolerance in general.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Don Shirley, and well deserved the award. Great work too from Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, resulting in a Best Actor nomination (he ultimately lost out to Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody).<br/><br/>The movie itself won the 2019 Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>Great film."

","Green Book is a crowd-pleaure and Oscar winner not because it deals with racial tensions in the segregated American recent past, but because it deals with two very human and humane characters who form an unlikely friendship in the midst of a lifechanging and life-affirming road trip. A hallmark of a great film and journey is that the audience or at least myself was left wanting more and deeply care for these characters based on real life people and events. I would have happily hopped on their next road trip to continue to share the intimate details of their endearing bond.<br/><br/>The screenplay lead by real life Nick Vallelonga is absolutely absorbing and drips with laugh out loud humour and characterization from the two leads and also some of the supporting cast. Mortenson plays the role of his life and has all the maneurism, talk and conflicted emotions of his flawed and interesting character. Ali assures a stoic and unsympathetic complex personality who excels, perseveres and has is own proclivities. He won the supporting actor Oscar for this while Mortenson was nominated for best lead but was in tough company with Cooper and Malek who won. The screenplay also won best original and deservedly so. Editing was also nominated and the story could not have been really told in a much better way dramatically while hitting all the humour and emotional marks.<br/><br/>In the end, although racism, classim, homophobia and other strong and important social subjects are dealt with extremely well, the strength of Green Book lies in its capacity to allow us to discover an average man and his family while changing his preconceived ideas and giving contrasts and thought to an accomplished and inspiring musical genius. Genuinely rewarding cinema and highly recommended."

","Two of the world's finest actors take on, what on the surface seems straightforword, but eventually becomes complex issues facing men in the early 1960s. One character, a virtuoso pianist of African American descent, is doing his part to dismantle the race barriers which identified much of our society then, and even today, while also managing other facets of his personal identity. Now, place him in a small space (a gorgeous teal 1962 Caddilac Sedan d'Ville) for a long time with an unsophisticated bouncer/brawler/man-of-the-streets from New York, and watch the humanity ooze. The filmaker did not grovel to us, the audience, with simplicity-of-character; each main character brings to light the true complexities of the experiences that each of us endure and manage in this ever complex world, and honored those unique attributes in ways that make you, as the film viewer, feel hnored for the unique and complex person that you are, and I am, and each of us are. It proffered the humbling truth about slipping into ""simple thought"" and geralizing about any individual or group of individuals is a disservice to our own dignity. A nice flip of the name-calling, tolerance of unconstructive behavior toward others, racism, sexism, and other judgements thast are used by the more powerful to subvert the less powerful. Each character demonstrated that whether one is of the most educated and priveledged class, or of the most street-wise and unsophisticated class, personal dignity and respect are mandatory for a successful life...and sometimes valuable perspective and insight comes from the least likely of sources; we need each other."

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali both give award worthy performances. In fact, I read that Viggo won best actor, and the movie was named best picture by National Board of Review.

","Confession: when the film introduced us to Dr. Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali), I thought that he was disgustingly pretentious and garish. He had exotic furnishings and clothes, and he sat on... a throne. I didn't know if the film was trying to present us to him as a self-actualized and respectable person. Although Viggo Mortensen's Tony character was ignorant, he seemed much more likeable to me than Shirley.<br/><br/>I was extremely pleased as the film progressed to confirm to myself that they were willing to expose some of Shirley's pretentious tendencies as character flaws. Although his character arc wasn't as extreme as Tony's arc, this film's director Peter Farrelly and the multiple screenwriters who constructed it did a fine job of illustrating profound growth in each man. One of the saddest and most meaningful moments that I've ever seen in a film is when Tony returned to a massive, loving Italian family, and Shirley returned to his empty, sanitary, lonely apartment. Whereas he was a pariah in the deep south, he was now also a solitary figure in his own home. I'm unashamed to admit that I bawled. So my opinion of him did a complete 180. Mission accomplished, film.<br/><br/>If it has flaws, I believe that it made Tony seem a bit too oafish, and he was condescended to by various people a bit too much. I enjoyed the hilarious, ironic
moments when he doesn't even seem to realize what he is saying-- i.e.: when speaking about Robert Kennedy: ""what else does he have to do?"" What else does the Attorney General of the United States do aside from bailing out lesser-known musicians from jail? But I thought that they leaned on it a bit too much. Also, if you're really familiar with film making (a curse, to be sure) some of this material might feel a bit too ""safe"" and paint-by-numbers.<br/><br/>However, it's twenty times better than last year's ""Best Picture"" winner (""The Shape of Water"") even the vast majority of last year's Best Picture nominees."

"bdl7431","7","2","6","16 December 2018"," Reverse Driving Miss Daisy meets Big Bang Theory with social commentary
","The review title pretty much says it all...don't get me wrong, the film has a lot going for it - but........<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Here is the thing - there are two main characters - Don Shirley - a world class concert pianist who basically is the Miss Daisy. Then there is his chauffeur, Tony Lip - the lower class Italian who gets a temporary gig driving Don Shirley around. In the course of their road trip, the two interact and wind up changing each other - sound familiar?<br/><br/>So the movie alternates between serious scenes and more whimsical scenes. The thing is - Don Shirley comes across almost like Sheldon in Big Bang Theory with times of extreme arrogance and needing things to be just right during the whimsical moments. Really, if you are a fan of Big Bang Theory, you will see echos of Sheldon and it is distracting as all get out.<br/><br/>The movie becomes serious when it talks about race relations in the 60's in the US. Don Shirley is a highly talented black person in an environment where a black is expected to be uneducated and eating fried chicken - like Hidden Figures, it becomes necessary to break that stereotype. These scenes are powerful and meaningful - but we have the same sort of conflicts we have seen in Hidden Figures and The Help - basically black people trying to do things like use the bathroom, eat in certain restaurants and stay in certain motels (the title - Green Book - refers to a guide to establishments that allow black people to use their establishments). OK - I get it - this was actually the way things were and it is an easy way cinematic way to bring the discrimination up the but this is getting well tread.<br/><br/>And as I write this - it becomes obvious that I don't talk about Tony Lip much. He is really a foil for Don Shirley - but taking that out - he is a stereotypical uneducated Italian - hooked up with the mob apparently, smokes and drinks, and will throw a punch in nothing flat.<br/><br/>At the end of the day - OK - we got a necessary history lesson about race relations in the Sixties...with well acted performances to be sure - but it is still a largely formula buddy/road film. Certainly worth a look, but don't expect too much you haven't seen before or new if you are familiar with race relations in the Sixties...."

"PotassiumMan","7","2","6","30 November 2018"," Decent, enjoyable but standard prestige film based on a true story
","Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali give stellar performances in this true story about a NYC club employee and bodyguard who is hired by a classical pianist from Carnegie Hall to drive him through his performance tour across the South in the early 1960s, during which they develop a solid bond, despite their considerable educational and socioeconomic differences.<br/><br/>I would call this film decent, light entertainment. It definitely offers a glimpse into how impressive Mortensen's range is an actor. The same actor who gave compelling performances in films like ""A Dangerous Method"" and ""Captain Fantastic"" is thoroughly riveting to watch here as he disappears into the role of ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga and Ali is impressive as Don Shirley, a Jamaican-American musician who became well-known in his era.<br/><br/>This film doesn't break too much ground, in all honesty. It's good diverting cinema but as a film released during Oscar season, it's fairly run-of-the-mill with no real surprises. But I do give Peter Farrelly a lot of credit for stepping out of his usual repertoire and giving us a different genre to look at within his filmography. Recommended."

It touches those sentiments and emotions that are almost forgotten nowadays, like compassion, true friendship, solidarity, courage, and obviously love. This is an story rare for today's superhero and marvel blockbusters, it's about being humans, good humans. And what makes this movie really unforgettable is the acting from these two individuals that captivate the audience, and make us feel that we are with them all the way.

Visually the film was nice too, there weren't any magnificent set pieces or anything like that but there was an intimacy to the cinematography that I haven't noticed in many other films. I'm sure people will complain that it's a little fluffy, but it took on very sensitive subject matter head-on and did it in a way that forced the viewer to confront their own beliefs in the process. Personally, I loved it and I'm going to remember the way it made me feel.

","Set in the 1960s, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) an Italian-American bouncer is hired to be the driver for Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) an African-American musician who is going on tour through the American Deep South. What entails is a deeply complex and honest study of the relationship between these two characters and that is the absolute heart and soul of the film. The two central performances are outstandingly good; Mortensen continues to impress and creates a very comic yet grounded in reality character in Tony here; a family man who is proud to provide, loves them very dearly, just above as much as he loves food! He really packed on the pounds for this one; good for him! He was insanely funny at various points throughout the film as well as being a reliable source of comfort for Dr Shirley in the confrontational scenes. His wife Dolores is played fantastically by Linda Cardellini! Ali is really amazing in the role of Shirley too; a very well spoken and dignified man who just asks for a very simple thing from fellow human beings; respect. He is the emotional undercurrent of the film and helps to bring that emotion out through Tony also. Of course this is set during a time of extreme prejudice and bigotry which creates the more tough to watch and infuriating scenes in the film; all of Shirley's loneliness and pain is caused by people mistreating him just for the colour of his skin. It's unbelievable to even imagine that these grim events occurred in human history and it is highlighted here and exposed for the true crime it really was. Unfortunately, we still see this sort of behaviour today even if it's in milder forms and we can only hope for a time when any discrimination just goes away. It's a film that knows to take its subject matter seriously as it should be but also manages to be comedic aswell as the interaction between Tony and Shirley for the most part is very funny while managing to be profoundly moving. I could talk for longer but in summary! I think it's a masterpiece"

"jd-71458","9","1","2","12 March 2020"," It's just a buddy flick - and it's wonderful
","I had heard the criticisms of this film - pandering to white guilt, white man saves the black man, too shallow on a deep subject - and found none of that.<br/><br/>What I did find was a little gem of a buddy flick - beautifully shot, with fantastic music, great nostalgia, and above all, incredible performances by the protagonists and the supporting cast. I don't use the term ""buddy flick"" to demean the movie. it's a perfectly valid sub-genre, done to greater or lesser effect since light met film.<br/><br/>I only mention this because I think some people either expected something more poignant on the subject matter, since it dealt with racism and segregation, or they want to read a broader meaning into what is basically a character-focused story about two very different people who became friends. It's there, and it's addressed, but it not what this movie is about.<br/><br/>Since there is really no plot to speak of, this movie really hinged on the relationship between Tony and Dr. Shirley. While the buddy concept has been done before, it often depends upon the classic situation-conflict-resolution plot structure as well.<br/><br/>That's not to say there isn't a story, but it's more of a shared adventure than a quest. There is conflict, but it has more to do with the characters, their relationship, and their own inner demons than the story. There is resolution, but it's not a two-out, bottom of the ninth, walk-off home run resolution - it's slower, deeper and more gradual, and as such, more deeply satisfying.<br/><br/>So I claimed a spoiler, and here it is. I did not know the story before I watched this movie, other than that it was based on a true story (that's not the spoiler :) ).
I was genuinely worried that some tragedy was going to befall these two right up to the end. I was worried about their being robbed in Birmingham. I was worried about their driving in a snowstorm and being killed in a wreck. I was worried about the cop that pulled them over in the North, fearful of one final, ironic, heartbreaking twist. I was deeply invested in these characters, and was rooting for them.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Happy ending. Dr. Sterling went to Tony's house and had Christmas eve dinner with his family, and they remained friends for the rest of their long lives."

This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human.

"lucifer_over_tinseltown","7","1","2","22 July 2019"," Mahershala is our finest living actor
","Don Shirley is regarded by hardcore jazz connoisseurs as a darker shade of Liberace. Sure he's technically proficient, but his music lacks feeling. He had a propensity for diluting his jazz attack with vanilla classical leanings. Most likely his way of currying favor with rich benefactors. So, I was shocked to hear, as a jazz aficionado, that a biopic was being made about the Dr. Why not Horace Silver, Bobby Timmons, or Bud Powell? Players that skinned their hearts for music, gigged all day and night (when not locked into marathon recording studio sessions) while folks threw pennies, and in the end couldn't even afford to pay for their own funerals. Those cats were real artists and hopefully their time to be rediscovered and appreciated will come. I pray that an actor of Mahershala's caliber is called upon to play them. Mahershala performs a pure act of alchemy here. He takes on the role of a man who was too dull to even make a brief appearance in his own life story, and transforms him into the hippest, most engaging cat on the planet. While doing so, he gives yet another subtle, nuanced, refreshingly ego-free masterclass on the fine art of acting. By all accounts Dr. Shirley was bereft of any sense of humor, so it was smart to have a Farrelly Bro direct this. The laughs come well-timed and in gale-force. Viggo is solid as usual, but even an actor on his advanced level is dwarfed by Ali's preternatural talent. Linda Cardellini is as cute as a squirrel's nut, it's as if she never ages. I was pleased to see her doing her natural thing in this. She's always worth watching. Between this and Ali's bravura performance in True Detective III (with a fine Stockton to Malone assist from top notch writer Nic Pizzolatto) I can unequivocally and categorically state that Mahershala Ali is our greatest living actor, hands down!"

","Review:
What a brilliant film! For such a low budget, and no fancy graphics, this highly entertaining film proves that a good story, and excellent acting, is all you need to produce something special. This reverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" type road movie, see's Viggo Mortensen (Tony Lip), playing an Italian bouncer, who is forced to take on a job, to drive a African American pianist to various locations during his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South, while the Copacabana nightclub, were he works, is closed for renovations. The eccentric and highly educated classical pianist, Doctor Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), hires Tony on the strength of his references, even though there were several candidates up for the job. As this movie was set during the early 1960's, it's extremely rare that a white man chauffeur's a black man, so they had there ups and downs throughout there tiresome journey. The fact that this film is based on real characters, made it even more of a joy to watch, and the various obstacles that Tony and Don tackled together, made them become closer as friends, even though Tony had a problem with black people at the beginning of the film. For this day and age, the subject matter was extremely relevant, especially with the American president trying his utmost to divide us. From an entertaining point of view, there is enough content to keep you glued to the big screen, which is rare for a movie in this genre. Throughout there journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, correctly spelling and rephrasing passages, which I found touching and emotional in places. Even after the episode in the YMCA pool, which I thought would change the direction of the film, was brilliant because the director chose not to dwell on the matter. The main element that made this movie unique, has to be the excellent performances from the leading actors. Their chemistry on screen was amazing, like Cruise & Hoffman in Rainman, and the director shot the period well, but it's not the type of movie that you can watch time and time again. In real life, Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley remained friends until they died within months of each other in 2013, so you're actually watching a life-long relationship unfold on screen. In all, I highly recommend this movie to all adult movie-goers because it has something for everyone, and you will be left feeling hope and joy. Great!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Peter Farrelly, who also brought you Dumb and Dumber in 1994, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Me, Myself & Irene, Osmosis Jones, Shallow Hal, Stuck On You, The Perfect Catch, The Heartbreak Kid, Hall Pass, The Three Stooges, which was awful, Movie 43 and Dumb and Dumber To. His change of direction with this film has really paid off because it won the Best Motion Picture of the Year Oscar, along with the Best Original Screenplay and the Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting role for Mahershala Ali. Personally, I thought that Viggo Mortensen deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, but he sadly lost out to Rami Malek for his great performance in Bohemian Rhapsody. For such a highly rated movie, which has won many awards and loved by critics, it still didn't smash the box office like a lot of the weaker movies did, but at least it was recognised by the people in the academy, even though they don't always get it right. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and for a director who has produced more comedic movies than serious drama's, he put together a good script, along with great actors, who brought this true story to the big screen with style.<br/><br/>Budget: $23million
Worldwide Gross: $319million<br/><br/>Genre: Comedy, Drama, Music
Cast: Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardellini, Sebastian Maniscalco, Mike Hatton, P.J. Byrne, Joe Cortese and Maggie Nixon. 8/10"

","Green Book is an excellent film. It is about a working-class Italian-American bouncer who becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South. Viggo Mortensen and Marshershala Ali give fantastic performances. The script is well written. Peter Farrelly did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor and drama. Green Book is a must see"

","This film has gotten a lot of bad press from the historical inaccuracies to it's controversial win for Best Picture-I have to admit I did buy into some of that press. Despite that however, the audience reaction seemed to be very positive (at least in Japan)-several of my friends recommended the film to me. So, with slightly low expectationsI I finally watched the film last night-it was pretty good. The performances (especially by Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, and Linda Cardellini) were wonderful, the story was very heartwarming, and the music (both the score and soundtrack) were solid. Was it worth the Best Picture? Not really, far from the best, but I don't think it was an outrageous decision either. One of the controversies was the depiction of race- such example is apparent when Don Shirley, a high-brow black man embraces the low class stereotypes in the latter half of the film. I personally thought it worked in the film because the friendship and trust between the Tony Lip and Don Shirley changed the two men-both embracing something new. It's a typical buddy, road trip movie, not a historical epic like 12 years a slave or The Color Purple. Some critics and haters called this Driving Miss Daisy 2, I completely disagree because it does this film does provide a fresh take (A white working class man chauffeuring a black and gay musician) on the Roadtrip genre. It's worth the watch!"
"Tanay_LKO","8","1","2","10 April 2019"," Green Book - about a Journey of miles and ""Friendship""
","The Academy Award winning film doesn't do anything extraordinary; only, it takes the usual, ordinary stuff and does it extra beautiful.<br/><br/>Despite the catchy synopsis of a black music-virtuoso being driven by a white Italian bouncer, the film in its core is all about ""friendship"".<br/><br/>It depicts the real-life story of Dr. Donald Sherley, a celebrated pianist of Afro-American descent who is on a tour to the south of USA back in '60s when aggressive reservations about Black people were still prevalent. As he hires an Italian driver-bouncer named Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga, little did they know that its shall bring their internal-struggles forth - minimally depicted by the selection of hotels in a certain ""Green Book"", where only Black people are allowed to stay in order to avoid ""aggravation"" from the Whites, along with the discriminatory alienation of ones existence by creed, colour, ethnicity.<br/><br/>However, that all arrives with an intermittent tenderness - of human bonding over wording out letters to one's wife, eating chicken-wings in a moving car no matter how unsanitary it seems, appreciating inherent talents of playing music or just playing with people, laughing-out loud, and then driving those long distances only in each other's company talking about what-not, and then appreciating how human it is to just be so.<br/><br/>I, for once, was left smiling at the thought of just ending up with family and friends around as I had the time of my life enjoying two people covering miles while scaling distances within their heart; not to mention in ours as well.
Safe to say that it's a mark of a good film to make you feel so. So, watch to believe it or just be happy to have read about it, here."

","This was a very good movie, not the best , but considering most of the others movies the last few years have been garbage, this is one well worth seeing. The movie is entertaining, music is enjoyable, and overall it will make you feel good. It does not portray New York Italians as very bright, which is not really fair, but does show a friendship can develop between people from different backgrounds regardless of their ethnicity. Of course a good part of the movie shows how bad it was in the south with Jim Crow in effect, and rightly so, but I was happy the movie did not make that the only focus like the movie Mudbound (a depressing movie). This movie is well worth your time to see, and both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were superb in their respective roles."

","Up against racially charged cinematic explosions at the Oscars, ""The Green Book"" took home the grand prize, and made Spike Lee attempt to flee the premises. The polarizing win makes for healthy debate and curiosity seekers should check this film out.<br/><br/>This role reversal, buddy-buddy shtick flows mighty thick, but it actually happened. A good natured Italian thug is hired to drive a prim and proper black musician on a tour of the South. In 1962. Yup. A big-hearted, big-stomached Viggo Mortensen stumbles perfectly through his inevitable transformation from racist simpleton to enlightened simpleton, while Mahershala Ali's hard shell eventually softens enough to join in the Merry Christmassy ending.<br/><br/>The cookie cutter script is baked just right, but anyone hoping for an edgier take on America's race relations best look elsewhere. Where ""The Green Book"" shines is in the background details - the sets, the cars, the hotels, Little Richard on the radio. This is 1962 America.<br/><br/>It may not have been the game changer folks craved to see groping golden statuettes on Oscar's night, but Mortensen and Ali made it come to life, and that's why the ""The Green Book"" succeeds."

","This movie shows friendship is beyond racism, caste and religions . The bonding between Tony and doctor Shirley shows that how Africans have overcome racism in United States of America and respect they gained from Americans in past four decades. This movie dialogues are very much lucid and communication between Shirley and tony were so much of mixed emotions. A must watchable film."

Viggo Mortensen is his personal driver for his piano tour down south.<br/><br/>There is a very well-made screenplay, complemented brilliantly by the excellent performances by Ali and Mortensen. I believe that Mortensen nailed it particularly as the bouncer type, and I would have loved to see him win the academy award for best actor in a leading role rather than seeing Ali win again for supporting.<br/><br/>I must say that the script is very PC but it is still a great buddy film that I can highly recommended - a life-affirming film with a great message."
"JamesHitchcock","7","1","2","8 March 2019"," Most Alright Picture of 2018
","""The Negro Motorist's Green Book"", which took its name from its publisher, one Victor Hugo Green, was guidebook published between the 1930s and 1960s. Its purpose was to help black travellers find hotels and restaurants that would accept them at a time when many such establishments, especially but not exclusively in the South, operated a colour bar. (It will probably come as a surprise to younger viewers to realise that, as recently as the sixties and seventies, the words ""negro"" and ""coloured"" were still regarded as perfectly respectful ways of referring to black people. Indeed, in some contexts they were regarded as more acceptable than the word ""black"" itself).<br/><br/>The film tells the true story of a tour of the Midwest and Deep South undertaken by Don Shirley, an African-American musician, in 1962. Although he was classically trained, there was a widespread feeling at the time that classical music was ""white man's music"" and that the public would not accept a black classical pianist. His recording company therefore signed him as part of a jazz trio. The film is told from the perspective of Shirley's driver Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American New Yorker. Tony takes the job because he is temporarily unemployed from his normal work as a nightclub bouncer while the club is being renovated; the concert promoters anticipate that Don is likely to get into trouble with racist elements in the South and that Tony's skills as a bouncer will enable him to double up as Don's bodyguard.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Green Book"" is essentially that of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in reverse; a working-class white man acts as chauffeur to an educated, well-to-do African-American employer. The relationship is initially a difficult one, although the differences between Don and Tony are dealt with in a largely comic way, reminiscent if the differences between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's differences in ""The Odd Couple"". The refined, fastidious Don takes exception to Tony's crude manners and to his standards of honesty, whereas Tony sees Don as a conceited snob. As the tour progresses, however, their relationship becomes a closer one. Tony comes to appreciate Don's skills as a pianist and his literacy, which comes in useful when Don assists Tony with his letters home to his wife Dolores.<br/><br/>Things take a darker turn when the tour enters the South. Don innocently wanders into a whites-only bar in Kentucky and has to be rescued by Tony when he is threatened by a group of angry locals. Tony, whose views on race were previously not particularly liberal, begins to change his mind when he sees the depth of hostility and prejudice displayed by many Southern whites towards blacks. Things come to a head when Tony and Don arrive at their final venue, a country club in Birmingham, Alabama and the management, although happy to allow Don to perform for their guests, refuse to let him eat in their whites-only restaurant.<br/><br/>The film has been praised- in my view rightly- for its acting, with Mahershala Ali, who plays Don Shirley, winning a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar and Viggo Mortensen (Tony) being nominated for Best Actor. Now I have no problem with the quality of Ali's acting, which was certainly deserving of an award, but the fact that Tony was clearly perceived as the main character suggests there was something odd about the focus of the movie. It suggests that this is a film about racism seen through a white man's eyes, even though black people were the main victims of that racism, and that Don has been relegated to the position of a supporting character in what should have been his own story.<br/><br/>And Don's, I think, would have been the more interesting story. He is an affluent, educated black man whose lifestyle in the cultural milieu of New York has isolated him from the great majority of black Americans- he admits that he has little idea of how they live or of the problems they have to cope with- and yet who is not accepted as an equal by many white Americans. A complicating factor is that he is either gay or bisexual, thus making him a member of two different minorities at a time when prejudice against homosexuals was even more deeply rooted in American society than racial prejudice and was shared by both white and black Americans. Don's sexuality, however, is only mentioned in one single scene, when Tony has to bail Don out after he has been found in a compromising position with a white man in a YMCA bathhouse. During the rest of the film it is not referred to at all. By not pursuing Don's story further, I think that the film-makers missed an opportunity to make a deeper statement about racism and other types of prejudice than they actually did.<br/><br/>This was, of course, the film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2018. I will wait until I have seen more of the possible contenders before I give my opinion as to which film should have won, but my views about this particular award were summed up for me in the words of the BBC's film critic Mark Kermode. He said that there is nothing wrong with ""Green Book"", that it is alright. They just don't hand out Academy Awards for ""Most Alright Picture"". 7/10"
"diegoframeto","9","1","2","7 March 2019"," Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen never fail to impress
","Heart warming drama. Great music that we Boomers could relate to. Tony had a foul mouth, but somehow it wasn't as hard to listen to as usual, because it fit his upbringing and culture. A good look at life for a coloured person in the 60's and just a great Friend story."
"classicsoncall","9","1","2","5 March 2019"," ""It takes courage to change people's hearts.""
","In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart."

","This movie was uplifting. It was based on the association/friendship between two men, but it is, for the most part, fiction. It is only loosely based on truth. To please Hollywood, they put in the part about Don Shirley being caught having sex with another man at a YMCA. According to what I have read, this never happened. It surprises me that Hollywood is so concerned about furthering the cause of the LGBT community, and about paying homage to the plight of African Americans in this country, yet they give the Academy Award to a film that portrays an Italian American man in the worst light. This film plays off a stereotype that insults the intelligence. This movie portrays Frank Anthony Vallelonga as a total idiot. That he wasn't. He was a very intelligent actor. If he were alive today, I am sure that he would object to his name being placed on this character in the film. I am sure that Don Shirley would object to the way his character is portrayed, as well."

","Film about dignity, courage and true friendship.<br/><br/>After more than 20 years since Peter Farrelly directorial debut with movie Dumb and Dumber, he has directed a truly masterpiece. Working throughout his career mainly with the comedy genre, Green Book has absorbed all the Farelly accumulated experience about how to make the audience laugh, but now with the help of a completely evolved type of humor - an intellectual one.<br/><br/>In the tragicomedy as a cinema genre, a balance between the quantity and quality of humor and the dramatic part is very important and the authors of the film coped with this task with a bang.<br/><br/>Extraordinary combination of Viggo Mortensen (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, A Perfect Murder, The Road) and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, True Detective) acting duet and good story makes this film really fun to watch. The feelings and emotions of the main characters are sincere and real.

I'd vote for Mahershala Ali to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- superior work in developing a complicated character -- gifted, eccentric, idealistic, ambivalent -- and for ultimately being successful in creating pathos and admiration for the character in the audience. b. To highlight one of many excellent scenes (you'll know when you see the film): one of the best ways to fight racism is for the decent person in the room to have the guts not to deliver a sermon but to just tell the fool in the room to knock it off and to damn well watch-your-rear mean it."

","The critics review's of Green Book naturally zero in on artistic merit and other factors but I review movies based on how much I enjoyed them and artistic merit is factored in later. Green Book was the movie I enoyed the most this past year. It kept me engrossed from start to finish and at the end I felt that was two hours well spent. Acting was superb, store was fasinating, and it was fairly accurate as biographies go. Even though I came of age during the time period of the movie I had never heard of Don Shirley. His musical style does combine jazz, pop, and classical touches and it played well on the big screen in 7.1 Dolby. A great sound track of his music as well as other popular music of that era. Yes, the movie was somewhat formulaic but so what? It was both funny and dramatic and captured the spirit, good and bad, of the times. I especially liked the way the movie opened with recreated scenes of the famous Cocacabana night club in New York, and ending with the extended family Christmas dinner in the Bronx. The two leads should both get Oscars as should the original screenplay. My overall feeling is the movie somewhat downplayed the racial issues in the south, even though they were disturbing to watch. I have a feeling it was even worse that we northeners could imagine. But maybe that is what made the movie enjoyable - it wasn't a downer by any means, but reflected the good in people for the most part. Go see it. It is a great story with great actors."

"dromasca","7","1","2","19 February 2019"," music, friendship and prejudice
","'Green Book' seems to have been designed according to a recipe for winning Academy Awards. The subject is historic but with reverberations in current politics and the approach is in tune with the mood at Hollywood. It addresses one of the painful topics of recent US history, but it does it in a sufficiently careful manner to get a rating that makes it accessible to audiences of almost any age. It has as a hero a musician and includes a lot of (good) music at a time when musical films are again enjoying great success. The cast includes a couple of well known actors who are given the opportunity to play consistent roles. Finally, the film is based on real life heroes and a true story. And yet, despite all these arguments, I do not think the 'Green Book' will be able to gather too many statuettes.<br/><br/>The story of the friendship between the high-class musician and the driver he hired for a two-month tour of the Southeast US of the 1960s is unusual. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) was an exceptional musical personality, one of the virtuoso pianists of his generation, but he could not get recognition into the world of classical music because of his Jamaican origin. He played a brand of sophisticated jazz for rich audiences. Yet, the rich musician, accustomed to first class hotels, when in tournaments in the southern states, as a black singer, he was subjected to racial discrimination in the still partially segregated America. Don 'Lip' (Viggo Mortensen), the driver and bodyguard hired to accompany him on the trip is an Italian from the Bronx, not missing a dose of benign racism. A lot seems to separate them, but the differences in race, culture, social classes and personal tastes will be tested and will melt during this road trip together that allows the two to get to know each other and to learn each some lessons from the experience of the other.<br/><br/>What I liked. The music. The authenticity of the details. The acting performances of the two lead actors, but also of many of the ones in supporting roles, including the non-professionals. The way in which the realities of the 1960s are brought to screen.<br/><br/>What I liked less. The predictability of the script. I was several times in the situation of anticipating a few minutes in advance what was going to happen on screen. The director and co-screenwriter Peter Farrelly went too far to make of 'Green Book' a feel-good film to be enjoyed by the audiences and especially by the jury of the Academy. The result, even if it has the excuse of being inspired by a true story, is conventional and syrupy. I think this movie could have been much better if it did not try that hard to be a crowd-pleaser."

","One of the least surprising film's you're likely to watch from this year's awards season heavy hitters, as this is a trip we've taken in different variations many times before, Green Book is still an undeniably fun piece of Hollywood entertainment that will leave you with a big smile upon your face once the credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>The very definition of a feel good film, with a well-worn but never the less important message, Green Book sees Dumb and Dumber and Something About Mary co-creator Peter Farrelly graduate from low-brow comedy to tell the true-life story of Italian nightclub bouncer Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga and black American pianist Dr. Don Shirley's unlikely friendship, as the two mismatched souls take a cross-country journey to the deep south of America when Vallelonga takes up a job as Shirley's driver and bodyguard on a concert tour in the early 1960's, when racial prejudices still ran rampant.<br/><br/>It's one of those stories that's quite clearly been exaggerated and Hollywoodized but it doesn't make Farrelly's film any less entertaining thanks to the experienced filmmakers assured handling of the material, that includes one of recent memories most assuredly witty scripts, with the banter between Viggo Mortensen's uneducated but well-meaning Vallelonga and Marershala Ali's upper-class and serious Shirley producing some brilliantly realised moments of comedic brilliance that also acts as a fine showpiece for these two actors skills.<br/><br/>Green Book is arguably one of the lightest and easy to digest movies of Mortensen's career and while there's been some controversy surrounding the portrayal of Shirley after his family members have spoken about the film, Mortensen and Ali make for one of the most enjoyable double acts in some time and when two actors connect so well together and with the material, it goes a long way to elevating whatever movie they're in, which is certainly the case with this road-trip drama.<br/><br/>These two certainly help you overcome some slightly cringe-worthy and somewhat eye-rolling moments, like a fried chicken bonding experience or a night-out at local African American bar and make some of the films more poignant moments really stick, as the two begin to become more than just business associates and build an understanding of each other's trials and adversities.<br/><br/>With the film becoming such an audience favourite and even a potential Oscar winner, it's to be expected that a fair share of naysayers have made their way out of the wood work to justify why Farrelly's film is undeserving of any awards love but there's a reason why the formula at the heart of Green Book has been utilised so many times before, as when it's done as well as this, you just go along for the ride and enjoy the time spent with these likeable, flawed and realistic characters. It's unlikely that Green Book is a definitive or even 100% accurate portrayal, but it doesn't dilute the core messages, wit and heart on display.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A feel good movie that's quite simply a joy to watch, there might not be any shake-up of the well-worn road trip/mismatched duo formula but with a razor sharp script and some awards worthy performances, Green Book quickly becomes a charming and loveable trek across 1960's America.<br/><br/>4 pieces of Kentucky Fried Chicken out of 5"
"ericwoltersnz","9","1","2","4 February 2019"," A movie to savour
","This is one of those movies that no-one wants to leave when the credits roll round. Based on a true story it plots the unfolding of an unlikely friendship between diamond in the rough Bronx-born Italian Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). Shirley is a concert pianist who needs a driver and some protective muscle as he tours the prejudiced South during the early 60's. Shirley is too cultured to fit in with his own race but too black to fit in with the white one. His internal conflict, Tony's external one as a coloured man's minder, and the friendship that develops make for riveting cinema. There is drama, hilarity, education and pathos in this wonderful movie. A masterpiece."
"bbewnylorac","8","1","2","2 February 2019"," Good film with a good heart
","Director Peter Farrelly succeeds in making his first serious drama. It's not perfect but it is captivating and entertaining. Viggo Mortensen, always an under-rated actor, is wonderful as chauffeur Tony ""the Lip"" Vallelonga, who is from working class Bronx stock, and who has an amazing ability to deal with trouble as a night club bouncer. And as the very posh black concert pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali is also great, in portraying an emotionally repressed artist, who during his tour of the Deep South comes somewhat down to earth. Both men have their eyes opened and have something to teach the other. Some of the characters' darker sides, such as Tony's resorting to violence, and his mafia ties, are shown, and not glossed over, which is refreshing. There are one or two scenes that were a bit preachy, but overall it was a nicely shot and edited, and lovingly made film."

","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick. Nice surprise to hear it was mostly shot in Louisiana, where I live, even during a snow scene when it actually snowed in my state during December of '17! My friend and I really liked this one so that's a high recommendation!"
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","2","31 January 2019"," The Feel-Good Movie of 2018...
","It's an old misconception that opposites attract each other. Why should they anyway? We welcome personalities that comforts us, reassure us, if they differ from the way we are, I can only imagine the situation where the strong attracts the weak, but you can't make a buddy movie picture with one weak character, you'd be like splitting in half the entertaining value of the film. Fortunately, Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"" is about two characters, with sharply defined personalities, who are only opposite on the cinematic surface, the difference is the silver platter on which the meal is served.<br/><br/>But we can't overlook the platter, can we? A Caucasian middle-aged man and a young black man, a colorful Italian-American man with a well-spoken, highly educated and cultured man or if you prefer a street-smart larger-than-life robust-looking average Joe and a misunderstood sissy-looking genius, a family man and a bachelor... finding a common denominator between Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip aka running-gag-first-name Vallelonga and Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley is tougher than spotting Waldo in a bazaar.<br/><br/>But for all these superficial differences, the two guys were meant to form a pair, especially when the story of their road-trip and building friendship has 1962 in the backdrop, when we know that the South is part of the itinerary and that it's based on a true story. That's pure Hollywood Oscar-bait stuff, in fact opposite don't attract each other but they certainly attract audiences. So the film is formulaic but the dynamic chemistry between Ali and Mortensen elevates it to an enjoyable, heart-warming feel-good picture worthy of all the applauses at the end despite its 'obvious' significance, the film feels calculated to please but I would lie if I said I didn't like it.<br/><br/>And the theater was quite crowded tonight and when it began and I was trying to counterattack any attempt to move me with emotional tricks, I was quickly drawn into the simple straight-forwardness of the story and the fact that (and that's a pattern I noticed in many great friendship stories), no matter how different Doc and Tony are, they strike as nice and decent guys, and on the basis of these characteristics, they attract each other. Tony is so particularly sympathetic that he makes Doc look arrogant by pure contrast, so much that I was questioning the choice of that scene where he put two glasses in the trash bin after his wife (Linda Cardellini) gave them to two Black workers.<br/><br/>Yes, that scene was welcomed with a few gasps and many laughs but retrospectively it doesn't quite hold up with the personality of Tony Lip who could be a caricature if Viggo Mortensen wasn't so damn hilarious. The fact that his behavior all through the film belies this character-establishing made me wonder whether it was meant to mislead us of it was an actual flaw in the narrative. Anyway, I liked Tony. We don't know exactly what he used to do for a living: bouncers for night clubs, occasional muscle man, driver for pick-ups or plows, he's obviously a man who can do anything and can't afford to be broke. The set-up to his unemployment is rather confusing, it only allows us to visit his family and neighborhood before it gets quickly and thankfully to to the point, the man's hired as a driver for Doc Shirley during a tour in the South that would end before Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>The film might be set in 1962 but we've seen enough movies to anticipate crucial scenes from the the first incident to the Christmas celebration and the introduction of a new friend, yes, it doesn't help if you've seen ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". But let's not kid ourselves, the film that is more likely to be compared to ""Green Book"" is obviously the Best Picture winner of 1989 ""Driving Miss Daisy"" which had moved me so much that I could bet a fortune there would be a scene with the Mississippi Police and even one where urination would be an issue. It's also interesting the way the film switches traditional roles by having the literate Doc teach his driver how to write letters, in ""Miss Daisy"", it was Tandy teaching Freeman. I'm not trying to diminish the film's originality, many scenes play out fairly well because of the atypical aura of Doc and how Tony plays it like Joe Pesci with the appetite of Homer Simpson (his comical timing is perfect) and yet has a somewhat dignified constancy forcing our respect.<br/><br/>And that's the film's miracle, it only relies on the acting power of these two giants, they're so good that the plot hardly matters, the two of them make the most predictable, even contrived situations such as a bar brawl, an arrest or a simple conversation a pure delight. And as if the film was aware of that force in the characterization, I had the feeling that it tried to reach some spectacular climax near the end, make some political and social comment and yet halfway through the final act it changed its mind and provided a fun, nice anticlimactic ending, convincing us that the film is meant to feel us good, and we do need sometimes a good feel-good film.<br/><br/>A few hours before getting to the theater, I was controlled by three police offers, I was confused by the hostility I could read in one's eyes, why was he acting that way, what was wrong with me? And maybe that's one of the thing with the film, people judged for the way they look, the way they behave and the way it just doesn't seem to fit. It's possible that the best trick of ""Green Brook"" is just when you think it's Tony who'll be taught a lesson, you have another thing coming. The arch is rather obvious when you think about it, but I don't mind the kind of obviousness that would made me feel good at the end."
"siderite","8","1","2","29 January 2019"," Funny little movie about the friendship between two people in the middle of an ugly world
","The story of an Italian driving a Black man in the 60s, when both peoples were persecuted by the ""red blooded Americans"", whatever that meant. It seemed a bit off some times, with the elevated black man behaving inexplicably or not knowing or understanding some concepts, but having perfect knowledge of other more complex ones. The completely unbiased Italian-American family was also a bit of a stretch. But the tale is heartwarming and fun, without getting into violence or too much ugliness and the acting is good."

","Indeed. An Italian-American working in a nightclub in the sixties of last century accepts the job of driver of an African-American pianist during a tour the latter is going to do in the Deep South. Their very diferent cultures and minds soon lead to situations of deep disagreement. Nevertheless as the tour goes on they begin to be closer to each other and they end up not only undertanding and respecting each other but also becoming respectful friends. This is speciallly patent when durig the tour the negro pianist is a target of racial discrmination and even of physical aggression and always gets help from his driver. A movie that shows excellently how was the American society at that time particularly in the Deep South and how the relationship between those two so different men develops itself."

"richard-1787","7","1","2","27 January 2019"," A fine performance by Mortensen, but an underdeveloped script
","Viggo Mortensen definitely gives a fine performance in this movie as Tony Vallelonga, a man who shares the racial prejudices of his Italian-American world but then learns to overcome them during the eight weeks that he drives gay Black piano player Don Shirley through the 1960s American South. It's a great role - as it should be, since the script was written by the real-life character's son, Nick Vallelonga. Granted, it's hard to imagine that a man who came from that much prejudice so easily overcomes homophobia - he's even willing to spend the night in the same bedroom with Shirley - but the script was clearly written to make Tony Vallelonga look good.<br/><br/>Granted, it's a little hard to accept Mortensen physically at times, since the original Vallelonga ate astounding quantities of food - and was a very big guy as a result - but I guess there was no point in putting him in a fat suit.<br/><br/>My problem with the movie, which I enjoyed, is that the script did not do a very good job of developing Don Shirley's character. Anyone who has seen *Midnight* knows that Mahershala Ali, the actor who plays him here, could have handled a complex character, but he isn't given a lot to work with. It's a shame, because it would have made for a more interesting movie.<br/><br/>The whole movie is really the relationship between these two characters. The rest is all fine, but peripheral."
"writers_reign","8","1","2","25 January 2019"," Driving Mister Daisy
","Like the man said you got seven basic plots; you get to plot eight you're back to one with maybe a little backspin. Back in 1987 Alfred Uhry wrote a Pulitzer prize-winning play called Driving Miss Daisy, it was a fine play and, when subsequently adapted for the screen, an equally fine film. Set in Atlanta, Ga, it featured a Black man working as a chauffeur to a White Jewish lady. Green Book features a White Italian-American chauffeuring a Black man through the Deep South. Similar stories, right? Well, maybe. Miss Daisy actually lived in Atlanta while Dr Shirley was merely touring whilst playing a series of one-night concerts. Actually the film is about two disparate individuals, chalk and cheese, initially antagonistic who learn to respect, admire, and bond with each other - now that IS a new plot. This is an exceptionally fine film boasting two exceptional performances and a fine supporting cast. Bring on the dvd."

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali absolutely nail the evolution of their relationship as two polar opposites show us how the differences are exactly the same. ""Green"" is in the dead centre of the spectrum and this film effectively takes you through it. It laughs at stereotypes and deals with shameful things from the past. It reminds us how far things have come and how far they still have to go. It leaves us with a poignant message that It's not about fitting in where you belong but more about belonging where you fit in.

"stevendbeard","8","1","2","26 November 2018"," Unlikely Friendship
","I saw ""Green Book"", starring Viggo Mortensen-Eastern Promises, the Lord of the Rings movies; Mahershala Ali-Luke Cage_tv, House of Cards_tv; Linda Cardellini-Hunter Killer, Avengers:Age of Ultron and Sebastian Maniscalco-Tag, The House.
This is based on a true story of an unlikely friendship between an Italian_American bouncer and an African_American classical pianist in the 1960's. Viggo plays the bouncer that is between jobs and is hired for 2 months to drive Mahershala, the pianist, on his first concert tour of the deep south. I say unlikely friendship because Viggo is an uncultured racist that uses his fists to settle matters and Mahershala is a sophisticated professional with a doctorate that does not believe in violence. Viggo does have principles that he lives by and he does need the money, so it is interesting to see their views and relationship grow into a friendship. Linda is Viggo's wife and Sebastian is one of Viggo's relatives, neither one of which thinks Viggo will last the whole trip. For those unfamiliar with the era, there were lots of racist ideas about places African_Americans could eat, sleep, buy things, etc. Of course, this would be a problem on the tour with Mahershala-he could perform music for white audiences but could not use the restroom in the same building. The name of the movie-Green Book-refers to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book', which was an actual guide to lodgings, restaurants and businesses that would service African_Americans. It was published from 1936-1966. During the end credits, the actual people are shown and you are told what happened to them after the events of the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language-including racial epithets-smoking and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

","Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Lip who gets a job driving around a concert pianist named Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, around the Deep South. Despite Shirley's money and prestige audience (or more likely because of it) there were only certain places in the Deep South were a man of color can eat and sleep and apparently they had a ""tour guide"" for this called the Green book (Hence the name of the movie). You learn something new everyday.<br/><br/>For the most part this movie was not about the Greenbook but the friendship that these two men developed while traveling through the Deep South. Obviously, the subject comes up as Tony Lip learns first hand what black men had to go through and on the other side Tony Lip became the friend Dr. Shirley really needed, in a strange reversal of Driving Miss Daisy.<br/><br/>Though I can't help but to be moved by how good of a job this movie did showing how common and acceptable racism...""once"" was, and the loneliness Dr. Shirley felt in his battle to stop it (Being that his music wasn't exactly being played by black folk of the period), it's not that compelling of a story but Mortensen and Ali show why they are such good actors and the chemistry between both actors is working well.<br/><br/>So well it becomes beautiful and you can't help but to be touched."

It also showed how two extremely different kinds of people, with different growing up backgrounds, well educated or not, through a long journey, both gradually open up and tried to accommodate each other and finally completely merged as a one great American that should be, although came a bit late.<br/><br/>This movie also felt like an educational road trip, both characters were at first so stereotyped biased by their own cultural and ethnic backgrounds, the ways how they each grew up, a complete different kind of day-and-night races, but through endeavor from each side, they have both transformed into a better person, not just relying on each other, but also educated each other, and proved that racial differences was the least thing to be bothered. Loyalty and friendship through the long road trip gradually grew organically.<br/><br/>The guy who threw two water glasses just used by two black plumbers in the very beginning, then transformed into a person who'd sacrifice anything to protect the person whose race he used to dislike even hated so much, it was told by the storyline so naturally and subtly, simply allowing us, the viewers, to understand our own morality and emotions with deeper insight, a soul search and recognition to we human beings, and completely change us like those two characters in the movie; more open-minded with a well balanced conservatism and liberalism.<br/><br/>A great road trip story was told here."

I MUCH prefer the real Donald Shirley. Why ""Hollywoodise"" him? By contrast, Mortenson was far more believable as Tony Lip.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that if we keep on lying about the past, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes. You can still make an interesting story without putting Mr Shirley on a pedestal. It made me laugh when the movie preached about being polite and not being able to look past skin colour. That scene summed up Hollywood perfectly. This was the ""Oscar"" token movie of 2018.<br/><br/>This movie is far better than the Thurgood Marshall movie recently released, however, that's a very low bar to set.<br/><br/>Is this worth watching?

","Othershipwrecks, I greatly appreciate your accurate and educated thesis on our culture and general lack of awareness. However, many writers, filmmakers and other artists have tried your logical and direct approach in laying bare the institutional and structural racism all of us European descendants both benefit from and purposefully or complacently further; an activity we suspend or deny when emotions are charged. I commend such efforts to clarify the brutality that Green Book only hints of.<br/><br/>But we also need artistic half-measures, like Green Book, which are, indeed, a passive reminder of our racism, to provide a gentle prodding to place our racism top of mind for awhile without alienating us.<br/><br/>Those more profoundly disturbing and accurate films haven't accomplished much more, though we both may wish they would. And they only draw a much more receptive audience. You see, most of us will avoid a direct assault on our lack of moral outrage and action. A combination of many influences must be used to alter the structural racism, if even possible.<br/><br/>And, as we witness, will likely never succeed so long as the white minority controls most of the nations' wealth.<br/><br/>I do not believe humans will ever trade our tribalism for homogenization; our need for visual familiarity is in our animal nature and only evolution may alter that characteristic. So, in the meantime, we must recognize our racism, promote awareness, protect each other, and strive to be better than we are.<br/><br/>Green Book is well-written, superbly acted, and tries to provide something more than stereotypes, not well enough to get the last two stars.

The dynamic and dialog between these two characters are what makes the film so great.

"barevfilm","10","1","3","1 December 2019"," Richly deserved Best Film Oscar for 2018
","A working-class Italian-American bouncer becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour through the 1960s Jim Crow American South.
After a string of weak and questionable choices in recent years the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences finally got it right for a change by awarding Green Book the Best Film Oscar of 2019.
Whether or not similar stories have been told before (e.g., Driving Miss Daisy) this one takes the cake on every level. Viggo Mortensen is beyond belief as the low class Italian American slob hired to Chauffeur an erudite posh mannered snobbish  Pianist (Don Shirley) on a concert tour of the horridly outrageously racist deep south in 1961. The way in which their early antagonism turns into deep friendship along the way is told in a most amusing manner skedaddled along by the bottomless talents of both actors. The situations are perfectly chosen to point up the deepening racism the deeper south they go. In one rain soaked scene we are subtly reminded that in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave there actually existed places (in Mississippi) where it was illegal for a black person to be see on the streets after dark! ( don't let the sun set on you) -- Shameful, shameful but true! In this scene Viggo punches out one redneck cop and both land in jail. Will they ever get out of this one? -- Shirley knows his rights and is allowed one call to a lawyer. The return call shocks the sickening redneck cops into letting the prisoners go. It was from the Attorney General in Washington -- Shirley was a personal friend of RFK, brother of JFK -- neither mentioned by name.
The picture opens without so much as a main title plunging right in to the back story of Tony Lip the night club bouncer (Mortensen) and his Italian dialect speaking extended family with Mafioso connections. All mix their English up with snatches of Sicilian immigrant Italian (subtitled) adding an immediate element of authenticity. We don't even get to the main part of the film for art least twenty minuted when Tony, out of work, is hired for a well paid job as a chauffeur and bodyguard by Shirley (Mahershala Ali, Best supporting actor) but this part alone is almost a complete movie in itself. We don't get to understand that the Green Book of the title is the name of an actual hotel/motel guidebook that was published to help black people find accommodations when traveling in the racially segregated south until nearly a third of the way into the story. But by this time the tone is already set. Another strong plus is the way Shirley's swift piano fingering is shown without a hitch making it look as if Ali is doing the playing himself.
At the Oscars Spike Lee was brimming with bitterness that his BlaKKKlansman was so easily outflanked by Green Book, but having seen both pictures I am inclined to agree with the critic who said that he was very glad that a heartwarming and highly entertaining film like Green Book won out over Lee's angry hate filled diatribe. And that's exactly what KKKlansman was. A hate filled diatribe.
Ps: Although I was very favorably impressed by Rami Malek's rendition of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody I was even more impressed by Mortensen's amazing ability to totally enter the skin of a low class Italian slob and endow the role with a perfect mix of violence, humor, and humanism. For me it was Best Actor, Viggo."

This movie is a real joy, and a breeze of fresh air compared to other movies that addressed this subject.
To take an Italian 'white supremacy' type of guy, and put him with a very gifted 'but black' artist, and make him understand the crime of racial behavior while showing him the other side of...well...everything... while taking us on this trip with them - was a wonderful idea and that's what makes this movie so good !!

","Story of a black musician and a white bodyguard, ""Green book"", through the archaic system of trip and adventures during it, is based on the opposition between this two characters that discover to like each other beyond the differences of status and skin that society stresses. The particularitg is in the fact that the white man is of asocial condition less higher than the black man's one, that's instead a rich and famous pianist. This strange condition, for 60s racist USA, brings the protagonist to a tragedy of not being part of a defined group: he is richer than other black men but always different, for the skin, from ""real"" white people; so his dramatic situation is to be outside of all of categories. Through ironical and light expedients, the movie condemns racism but also understand complexity of psychological lifes behind conventional social divisions, and, even if for wasn't the best movie of that year to win the Oscar, it is appreciable and original."

","This film is very enjoyable to watch. Given the very difficult issues of discrimination that are at its centre that is quite a surprise. The film in no way undermines the importance of its subject matter by being surprisingly easy to watch, it really is quite a success.<br/><br/>It is a road movie and this is a favourite genre of mine. It is also what some call a ""buddy movie"". It is a journey and the experiences of that journey change the two travellers. The film has some special magic because to describe it makes it sound like a series of clichÃ©s, but that is not how it is at all.<br/><br/>I think this film very successfully engages the viewer in its story, not using any clever plot tricks but rather by having interesting characters that you care about.<br/><br/>It would make a great Christmas movie and my guess is that was the intention. I notice it was originally released in October in most places.<br/><br/>It does not shy away from depicting the terrible discrimination and attitudes but at the same time it is very warm-hearted and entertaining.<br/><br/>Really quite a success I think!"

"stevenrotherforth","10","1","3","22 September 2019"," Heartwarming, heartbreaking. One of my celluloid highlights of the year
","Green Book<br/><br/>'Green Book' is a truly captivating story of a blossoming friendship between two men from very different worlds that over the course of the movie realise they have more in common than they initially believed.<br/><br/>Dr Don Shirley played by the brilliant Mahershala Ali is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx.
In need of a driver to help him get from gig to gig so Shirley can fulfil his contract he realises he needs someone to protect and guide him through the racial prejudices he meets along the way.
Viggo Mortensen plays Tony Vallelonga or known as 'Tony Lip' to his friends.
Mortensen gives a spellbinding performance here which is often hilarious.
This movie isn't a full blown comedy but Tony's approach to life is often comical.
His sometimes crass and blunt outlook clashes with the soft spoken subtly of Dr Shirley's persona.
Ali is equally good and
the chemistry between the two lead actors is what really drives this road trip movie.
Each other's character rubs off on one another creating a strong bond as the film progresses.
'Green Book' completely surprised me and by a third way into this film I was giving it 10/10.<br/><br/>This is perhaps one of Hollywood's greatest onscreen friendships and by the time credits are about to roll I didn't want to say goodbye to these two engaging characters and their exploits.
Often heartwarming but equally heartbreaking as Shirley struggles to fit in.
Set in a time of extreme racial prejudice. Dr Shirley didn't fit in with his own people and wasn't truly excepted by the rich white people that paid to hear him play.
A scene in a restaurant was upsetting and disappointing.
It saddens the audience to think that not so long back we had very primitive and racist views.
To such an extent where people of different colour could not dine in the same room.
The Green Book featured in the movie is actually a small publication that informed of establishments where people of colour could stay whilst in the Deep South.<br/><br/>'The Green Book' boasts a wonderful soundtrack and is masterfully directed by Peter Farrelly.
There's strong support too
making this movie one of the celluloid highlights of my year.
I urge you to watch this film.
Even if like me this isn't your go to genre.
I was mesmerised by this fantastic film, enjoying every second of it.
One that I can't praise highly enough."

","From Peter Farrelly, director of such classic fare as Kingpin, Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary and Shallow Hal comes a fantastic and surprising little film about friendship, acceptance and resistance in the face of rampant racism.
Viggo Mortensen plays Tony 'the Lip', a small time bouncer who is hired to drive Doctor Don Shirley, a piano virtuoso on his concert tour of the Deep South. The year is 1962, segregation is in full swing and racism is everywhere, including in New York.
This is a warm, moving story about two men who form a strong friendship that overcame both of their prejudices and helped each man become a better person. It's based on a great true story, well acted and well directed, earning its many nominations and awards and the controversy surrounding the film is worth overlooking. It's not a perfect film, there are questions over its 'white gaze' on Jim Crow racism, over the true story and more but as a piece of genuine heartwarming entertainment it's fantastic and is definitely worth your time."

","Without a doubt, Green Book deserved Best Picture of 2019. Everything about Green Book is perfect, and I have no complaints about the movie. The film just gives out a positive vibe, through beginning to end; even during the darker times in the movie, because the darkest moments of the movie is when both characters evolve into better human beings.<br/><br/>We follow Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley tour around the south of America. We learn how it was a struggle for black men in the south during the early 60s. The plot is simple, and it always stays on its tracks. None of the scenes felt too short or too long, creating a consistent pace. Every scene in Green Book was about character development, and how both Tony Lip and Dr. Donald Shirley slowly start respecting each other.<br/><br/>The cinematography was hands down amazing, and I think Green Book should have at least won an Oscar nomination for best cinematography. The film had a very colorful look to it, teal being a very prominent color. The atmosphere Green Book created had such a warm feel, which made the movie so much more pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>Vigo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both great actors, and they give solid performances. In my opinion, the acting was not ground breaking, but it's still on a A+ level. I'm more impressed with the supporting cast than Vigo Mortensen, as they give more ""Italian"" performance than Vigo<br/><br/>Everything about Green Book fell right in place like a jigsaw puzzle. The film had such a unique mood to it, which was created perfectly by the cinematography and atmosphere. Very few movies can compete with Green book when it comes to character development. Green Book is by far the best movie of 2018, if not the best movie in the past five years."

","'It takes courage to change people's hearts.' - Oleg (Green Book)<br/><br/>'You never win with violence. You only win when you maintain your dignity.' - Don Shirley (Green Book)<br/><br/>'The world's full of lonely people afraid to make the first move.' - Tony Lip (Green Book).<br/><br/>And i liked these part of conversations after Don Shirley and Tony leaved police station:<br/><br/>Dr. Don Shirley: You shouldn't have hit him.
Tony Lip: I didn't like the way he was treating you, making you stand out in the rain like that.
Dr. Don Shirley: Please, you hit him because of what he called you. I've had to endure that kind of talk my entire life, you should be able to take it for at least one night.
Tony Lip: What, I can't get mad at that stuff that he was saying because I ain't black? Christ, I'm blacker than you.
Dr. Don Shirley: Excuse me?
Tony Lip: You don't know s**t about your own people, what they eat, how they talk, how they live. You don't even know who Little Richard is.
Dr. Don Shirley: Oh, so knowing who Little Richard is makes you blacker than me? Oh, Tony, I wish you could hear yourself sometimes, you wouldn't talk so d**n much.
Tony Lip: Buls**t! I know exactly who I am. I'm the guy who lived in the same neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life, with my mother, my father, my brother, and now my wife and kids. That's it, that's who I am. I'm the as****e who has to hustle every godd**n day to put food out on table. You, Mr. Big Shot, you live on top of a castle traveling around the world doing concerts for rich people. I live on the streets, you sit on a throne. So, yeah, my world is way more blacker than yours!<br/><br/>Dr. Don Shirley: Pull over.
Tony Lip: What?
Dr. Don Shirley: Pull over.
Tony Lip: I ain't pulling over!
Dr. Don Shirley: Stop the car, Tony!
(Tony stops the car and Don gets out and starts walking in the rain)
Tony Lip: What? What are you doing?! Doc? Doc, what the hell are you doing? Doc, get back in the car!
Dr. Don Shirley: Yes, I live in a castle! Tony. Alone! And rich white people pay me to play piano for them, because it makes them feel cultured. But as soon as I step off that stage, I go right back to being just another n****r to them. Because that is their true culture. And I suffer that slight alone, because I'm not accepted by my own people, because I'm not like them either! So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am ?!"
"k_grall","8","1","3","3 September 2019"," A good Hollywood film. Good acting and the camera work as a foundation
","I was impressed by both Mortensen and Ali, and the story is alright. Camera work; more than solid, and it's like the 'best butter' you can find in an Old Hollywood type of way. However... my main complaint is a focus on dialogue scenes, particularly with the Lip's (Mortensen's) wife, played by Cardelini, that just drove a point home... too cute? I don't know, but these 'golden'-type moments in a 'golden'-type movie, just detracted from it all, from what I like, completely.<br/><br/>Also, one final - minor - complaint I had that ticked me was Doc's seeing and observation of the rural black-Southern workers, who were looking back at Doc, dressed in his fine clothes and chauffeured in a car. That shot needed to be there, I'm pretty sure, and it goes to Doc's unsettled identity issues on race, gender and sexuality, later. However, it is, as a scene, comparable to Tarantino's own point on this in Django Unchained. So, it's like I've seen this point recently before, and this took away from the complete profundity of the moment, for me, in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, worth a watch for all the good reasons people are saying though. A good Hollywood film."

","While the movie offers two great performances from actors undeniably in their prime, it still manages to adhere to every Oscar bait drama trope in the book.
That said, the movie admittedly is very enjoyable and well edited, but any experienced viewer should be able to accurately predict the complete plotline as soon as the first 10 minutes are over. So although this still is recommended viewing, I'd rather rewatch ""The Intouchables"".

"Ed-Shullivan","10","1","3","21 August 2019"," Entertaining and reminiscent of the 1960's that I remember, sadly it was also a time for much bias
","A perfect 10 for 10 rating<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali were destined to play the characters of the tough and gruff Italian night club bouncer Tony Lip, and the sophisticated African American classic pianist Dr. Donald Shirley respectively. Some road trip movies can drag on and on and leave their audiences minds' wandering as the constant babbling by the main characters over incidentals drags on. But this was not the case with this ""road trip"" film which in my humble opinion was deserving of the five (5) Academy Award nominations that this film received, and definitely deserving of the three (3) wins for Best Picture, Best Supporting actor (Mahershala Ali), and best original screenplay.<br/><br/>Mrs. Shullivan and I did see Bohemian Rhapsody and I believe that Viggo Mortensen was robbed of the best actor award over Rami Malek's ho hum performance as Freddy Mercury. Maybe Bohemian Rhapsody should have won for best make up and hairstyling. Malek's fake portruding front teeth were over empha""sized"" and over exaggerated, and maybe the voters were paying more attention to the visuals rather than the content of the performances because Viggo nailed his performance as the tough Bronx chauffeur who loved food as much as he loved talking (thus the monogram Tony Lip) and living life.<br/><br/>Green Book refers to today's version of an on line travel log, but back in the 1960's the real Green Book identified which Hotels/Motels would accept African Americans in the deep south for an over night stay and where they could eat their meals. The picture reflects the disparity between whites and blacks in the 1960's and we see how Tony Lip gradually becomes close friends with his black, gay, and sophisticated boss, Dr. Donald Shirley. There are some really sensitive yet touching and emotional scenes that are surely to become film classics. No spoilers, you need to watch the film and suck in all the great acting, music, and cinematography on your own.<br/><br/>Mrs. Shullivan and I agreed that this film was definitely worthy of the Best Picture award and I hope to see this duo of Viggo Mortensen, and Mahershala Ali star in future films together as their portrayals were so natural that they fit together like the right and left shoes even with each foot having some different characteristics and flaws, they walked and talked as if they were one and the same.<br/><br/>We were not bored at all through this road trip film and the only sad part was when the film was prompted with that subtle but effective ""THE END"". Fortunately I bought a copy so Mrs. Shullivan and I can watch it again and again.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 for 10 rating"

Both of the main performances are fantastic, I especially think Viggo Mortensen was truly amazing in this movie and to take this part at this stage in his career, I think is amazing. I really got to the point where I forgot that I was watching Viggo Mortensen, because he's so good in the role that he completely becomes this working class italian bouncer, he's really really outstanding here. The movie has a great message, of course, but it's not like hitting you over the head with it, I think it comes pretty natural. The only downside I see here is that it's kind of predictable what's gonna happen from the start, you know these two are gonna end up getting along, no matter what.

","For my sins I had never heard of black musician Don Shirley before this film dramatisation of his purposeful 1962 tour of the southern states of America with his two accompanying white musicians. To drive him around the land of Jim Crow, Shirley hires a tough, barely literate but mob-connected Italian bouncer Tony Lip, late of New York's Copacabana Club, who is temporarily out of work when the famous night club closes for repairs and so is looking for work in the run-up to Christmas.<br/><br/>What follows is a combination road-trip, buddy-buddy, civil rights revisionist feature which if it too often falls into cliche and sentimentalism, nonetheless delivers an upbeat, feel-good movie, as these two polar opposites, one impeccably spoken and dressed, the other guttural and slobbish unsurprisingly rub off on each other changing their perceptions of their own places in society and basically confirming the old truism that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.<br/><br/>To be fair, I was almost counting off the stock situations Shirley would blithely walk into on the road, such as an encounter where he seems bemused at the sight of poor black sharecroppers working in the field, the inevitable injurious run-ins with racist Southern citizens in a bar, redneck Southern cops keen to put him down for being ""uppity"" with them and even the in-bred bigoted attitudes at the very night-spot he's been hired to play. Luckily Big Tony is on hand every time to rescue him with a mixture of brawn and bluff so that by the end, the ice-cool Shirley's reserve and distance duly breaks down and the hot-headed Bronx-bruiser has come to admire the bravery and musicianship of his passenger.<br/><br/>Sure some of the situations seemed contrived, like the cultured Shirley letting his hair down with an R 'n' B group at a road-side bar or the Capra-corn-type Christmas scene at the end but there were compensatory scenes elsewhere like when Tony mis-remembers the title of one of his new boss's celebrated. albums or when the erudite Shirley helps Tony to write his letters home.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed the acting of the two leads and the authentic settings depicted of early 60's America and even if this story based on true events (at least according to the film's introductory titles) was a little too sugar-coated, I must admit I enjoyed the ride with these two larger than life characters."

Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Dr. Don Shirley who is an African American prodigy pianist. By his own choice Shirley decides to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South during 1962. Knowing he will need protection, Shirley hires Tony Lip whose reputation as a fast talking, tough bouncer proceeds himself. Lip is an Italian American who resides in the Bronx and is currently unemployed due to renovations at the Copacabana. So as fate has it, the two men from completely different sides of the proverbial spectrum start a unique road trip. Despite their differences in culture and ethnicity, which is revealed through their constant banter and time spent alone together, the men form a special bond. This all occurs while the two men face danger and racism during an era of segregation. The plot is clever, crisp, insightful, thought provoking, heartwrenching, heartwarming and has a wonderful ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. Lip's quote, ""Don't worry 'bout it. I been working nightclubs in New York City my whole life. I know it's a complicated world."" rings true today. That is what adds to making this an eventual timeless and classic work of art, which is symbolic of the friendship that was formed."

","Green Book is simply a great movie. The acting is excellent. It's always hard to watch any movie that deals with America's awful and forever embarrassing chapter of segregation and the outrageous Jim Crow period. This was deftly handled. My only complaint is that the movie wasn't 15-30 minutes longer."
"inker-13614","9","1","3","16 April 2019"," Excellent
","I cannot believe I didn´t watch this movie earlier, but I am so glad I got to it at all. As I have stated before with other movies - for me a very important part of a movie is to make you feel something, anything, stir up some emotions and leave you thinking and debating on some things. Yes, this movie has all of that. It talks about imoprtant issues and gives a glimpse of different sides of humanity.
I do believe that the big part in the success of this movie is on Mortensen and Ali - they did their roles just perfectly, but I was especially impressed with Mortensen.
What is another interesting thing about thos movie is that it often seems like you can predict what´s gonna happen next, but that´s not the case and I quite liked that.
Also I just realized in the very end that this was a true story and usually movies make it pretty clear at the very beginning. But that just made it all that much more enjoyable.
When the movie ended I felt sheer happiness and gratitude that I had spent 2 hours of my life looking at an incredible story that took my mind to so many different places and made me feel in many different ways. I fully reccomend this film to everyone."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","23 March 2019"," Inspired by the real 1962 musical tour down South.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. This movie recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Ali won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The lead role is Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, a New York bouncer of Italian descent. His club is closing for the last two months of 1962 and he is recommended as the driver for a black musician, a pianist, who is going on a tour, a series of performances, in various Deep South locations.<br/><br/>Mahershala Ali is in the role of Dr. Donald Shirley, who was a real jazz and concert pianist who over his career played in many high-profile venues. In 1962 he has planned this musical trip to hopefully change some perceptions about black musicians. Having a tough bodyguard as a driver will help insure his safety.<br/><br/>The title is a reference to a book which is a guide to where blacks can eat or sleep in southern locations, in 1962 the Deep South was mostly still segregated, blacks could not stay or eat and many locations.<br/><br/>As the writer, one of Tony Lip's sons, reveals, the story is only regarding that particular trip and he says the input comes from Ali himself some years earlier, and of course his dad. It is a story of how two men from greatly different backgrounds and world views became friends. Ironically both men died in 2013.<br/><br/>Good movie."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","3","23 March 2019"," Well-Made and Effective, if Overly Safe
","A refined, classically trained black pianist recruits a blunt, tough-guy NYC Italian to serve double duty as both chauffeur and protection during an upcoming tour of the still-segregated south. Cruising along the back roads and highways in a curvy blue Cadillac DeVille, the pair quickly dispenses with the pleasantries to share a few essential truths, each giving as much as they take. They rankle and irritate, an odd couple on wheels against the backdrop of a volatile social change, but through several close shaves and heated arguments, they develop a mutual admiration despite their fundamental differences.<br/><br/>Mostly a two-man show, Green Book thrives on the performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who enrich twin roles that could have otherwise fallen into broad generalizations. The life and depth they bring to both individuals, and to their complicated friendship, make for more than just a standard morality play. It's also an impressively restrained turn for director Peter Farrelly, better known for his work with brother Bobby in a series of zany '90s comedies. He lets the tone set itself, resisting the urge to bludgeon us with the message, and sprinkles in a few solid laughs when the moment calls for it. A well-made and effective, if overly safe, best picture winner."
"alessandroiskay","8","1","3","22 March 2019"," Excellent in every aspect
","Green book is an amazing movie not only about racism in the south and in the time of segregation but it so also a movie of how someone from a poor background makes an excellent relationship with someone very sophisticated. Tony lip played by Viggo Mortensen is a bouncer who worked at the copa un New York City. He is an Italian American who has some problems with people of color. As he is confronted with a job working for a black man he tries to do his best despite his views. It is an amazing movie about a irregular friendship confronting racism on their Roadtrip."
"vangilswouter","8","1","3","19 March 2019"," Dark times, lovely portrayed
","Going to keep this one short:
Green book is a lovely story of two men crossing state and personal borders and become friends. It's a story about racisme in a period of segregation, but it's told like a roadtrip movie. It has drama, it has laughs (mainly thanks to Vigo's character) and a pretty good story. Only critique that can be given is that the movie sometimes feels a bit to safe. But in the end a splendid movie."

"mmunier","Null","1","3","18 March 2019"," Anyone would take a leaf out of Green book
","Green book...Nominated and winning this that and the other...'must be something I should see. So on this very Monday, midday, we went to Hoyts Sydney having a gift card for Hoyts and Green Book not showing near our place in these particular cinemas. Then I read it was a comedy? This did not sound as good as I thought it may be, feeling more interested in a racial conflict I understood it was... We got our tickets and in due time entered a little cinema. Little but so well furnished with spacious and reclining chairs! Our ticket also mentioned 'coarse language'; something not rating high on my wife's taste, how would she cope with this? After some 20 minutes of the 'usual' (allowing for some shut-eye on my part) the movie finally started.
I really hadn't read much about it at all, so did not expect to see a mismatched pair embarking in an unforgettable journey. I was so glad not to have any real idea about it. Yes racial difference it had, but it had also indifference of race and it was so wonderful. Why oh why were they only a handful of people watching with us? Yes it was a Monday and day time; still I would have expected more people.
Both main characters were so likeable in their own make up. You grew with them through the story and fell for them. Although they underwent some changes they remained themselves till the end. I have never heard or seen these actors before, so it was another bonus for me. It was not ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" or ""Intouchable"", but a charming yet thought provoking epic. If you were a little more curious than I am you would have to know it is about a white Italian American Bouncer in need of a job that is channelled to drive for a black 'gentleman' concert pianist who despite his talent and reputation is not immune to racism as we found about it during his epic tour about various ""united states"".
Both actors are so pleasing and I would not want you to fear about the coarse language, I did not resent or even remember hearing it. There were a couple of appropriate violent moments but quite obliterated by the good nature and familial portraying.
As for the comedy...There were a few very funny episodes.
This shows that it is still possible to deal efficiently with gritty topics without indulging in over used vulgarity and profane language.
And it was nice to leave the theatre rewarded with a contented feeling, again from me no rating since I don't believe in rating."
"cherold","8","1","3","17 March 2019"," Enjoyable movie in spite of its flaws
","Green Book tells the presumably true story of white racist guy hired as the chauffeur for a black musician doing a tour of the deep south. It's predictable, following the well-worn path to racial understanding of similar films, but it's got solid performances and is engaging throughout.<br/><br/>There have been various criticisms of this movie. Don Shirley's family says its ridiculous to claim he'd never eaten fried chicken before having it forced on him by a white guy, and that's probably true. But it works as a way to contrast the plebeian white guy with the sophisticated black man, and it's silly to expect any Hollywood movie to not be at least half fiction.<br/><br/>(It's hard to know who's telling the truth. Shirley's family has complained a lot, but from what I've read they don't seem to have been that close to him. The movie was written by the chauffeur's son, who says Don Shirley himself approved it, but the guy also echoed Donald Trump's lie that thousands of American Muslims cheered during 9/11, which makes me consider him inherently untrustworthy.)<br/><br/>The movie has also been criticized as yet another movie funneling racism through a white lens; this is the chauffeur's story, not Shirley's. But because a movie is part of an unfortunate trend doesn't mean that individual movie isn't good, it just means Hollywood has trouble breaking out of its boxes.<br/><br/>The title does, however, bug me. The Green Book was a guide on where to find hotels where black people could stay at a time when many hotels were whites only. It's a good example of what black people had to deal with, it was written for black people by black people, the existence of the book is a condemnation of the white culture that made it necessary, and even though it's a fairly insignificant plot point this is the title they chose. This is a movie about a white guy learning about racism; why make the title something so much a part of a particular black experience? It feels a little like theft.<br/><br/>Still, I really enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was super memorable, and it seems like a movie I'll have pretty much forgotten in a year (so maybe I should give it a 7?) yet it's mix of humor and pathos make it a very enjoyable experience."

","Frank Anthony Vallelonga, Sr (Viggo Mortensen) is the husband of Dolores (Linda Cardelina) and the father of two sons, Nick and Frank, Jr. This man is a bouncer at nightclubs and goes under the nickname of Tony Lip because of his ability to BS. Tony lives in New York with his family in the early 1960s. He is Italian and talks like a sailor and also speaks Italian. The club Tony is a bouncer for closes down for repair and Tony needs a job. A human being with amazing gastric ability like Tony can only earn so much money from hot dog eating contests!
Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is the polar opposite of Tony. He is not a medical doctor and has doctorates in music and psychology instead. He is also a gifted African-American pianist from the age of 3 and beyond. Dr. Shirley is well-breed, polite and intelligent. Tony is offered a job from Dr. Shirley to act as the man's chauffeur and body guard. He has to drive him through the prejudiced south to gigs. They use the titular Green Book as a guide to motels both men can stay at.
Two men who are poles apart become very good friends in this wonderful biopic! Tony introduces Don to the music of other black musicians like Little Richard and Aretha Franklin. He also shows him how good KFC is. On the other hand, Don teaches Tony how to write lovely letters to his wife and how to be well mannered.
Tony's son wanted to tell everyone about this unlikely friendship and this is a loving portrayal of his late father who was born in 1930 and died in 2013. Dr. Shirley was three years older than Tony and by a strange coincidence, died in the same year. I recommend this movie highly!"

Green Book is a film which really hits you after you watch it. From the images, to the sadness, and anger, to the camaraderie, peace and acceptance. And most of all to the friendship and love during the rough times it was taking place, what a beautiful message the film promotes to all of us. Superbly acted from top to bottom, well written, and well directed as Peter Farrelly steps out of his comfort zone of zany comedy, and makes a warm hearted, comedy-drama (for you Kingpin fans, the road trips in the Green Book will feel kind of nostalgic).
A powerful statement and a film which will put a big smile on your face. In my opinion, some of the best films are the ones which hit you in the heart days after you see it. And Green Book is just that. You will definitely love this film!"

"jrarichards","10","1","3","16 February 2019"," Most of what you could ever want in a film
","When Viggo Mortensen in the role of heavy-set hustler Tony Vallelonga acts as driver and minder for highly-gifted if somewhat effete pianist Dr Don Shirley (here played to a tee by the ever-dependable but ever-better Mahershala Ali), the gorgeous, gigantic blue Cadillac with its radio and all still manages to overheat once and get a flat one other time, and its wipers don't work too well. Likewise, the gorgeous American landscape in this ""road movie"" set in 1962 is tilled by black farmworkers not looking a whole lot different from their slave ancestors a century before. And then there is the titular ""Green Book"" (of clubs, hotels, garages, barbers' shops, beauty parlours, etc.) that in its oh-so-tasteful and user-friendly way provides handy hints to Americans of colour - needless to say the (real-life) book calls them ""N**ro Motorists"" - how to get the most of their tourism in the southern states ... without there being any tensions.<br/><br/>Just three of the ways (there are many more) in which Peter Farrelly's ""Green Book"" follows what are almost companion movies like ""Hidden Figures"" and ""The Butler"" (or indeed even ""The Shape of Water"") in exploring that now-exotic world of an all-powerful 1960s America with its ostensibly slick, wealthy, consumer-friendly lifestyle hosting within it a tumour of nastiness that is as malign (and HUGE) as it is absurd.<br/><br/>Don Shirley is inded gifted, and applauded wherever he goes, yet he has to use a different toilet and stay in different motels (just as the ""computers"" in ""Hidden Figures"" were trusted with sustaining America's cutting edge space-effort for NASA, while also having to use a separate kettle from their white - and at times professionally inferior - colleagues).<br/><br/>So there is anger and disdain for that world in this film, even as its beauty and elegance are put on full show. But - wonderfully - it is neither in-your-face or overdone; but is rather evinced (mostly) far more effectively in mini-scenes and dialogues more or less erudite and often warm and witty between the two key characters.<br/><br/>How on Earth anyone could have foreseen the slim, bright-eyed Mortensen being made over into a somewhat overweight, and not-too-bright (though at times canny) middle-aged Italian-American is beyond me. This is the antithesis of Aragorn (or indeed of John Halder in the great play-turned film ""Good"").<br/><br/>But it's just SUPERB anyway...<br/><br/>Of course, this story is interesting (and portrayed spellbindingly) in part because Tony is less wealthy, less clever, less pretty-much-everything than Don, but because the latter keeps being brought low by the world around him (and occasionally by his own pretty-understandable lapses of various kinds), the characters equalise ... and hit it off better and better in an amazing way that history records as a true event. (At this point, care might be taken, as I know already that some criticise the presentation of this story for being not as true-to-life as it might be. Fair comment, but this film is a wonderful work of art anyway).<br/><br/>At one point, the above effect is made clear in a heated ""race to the bottom"" dialogue between the two that Shirley wins with a statement to the effect that he is not black enough or white enough or man enough to be anybody at all...<br/><br/>It's as somehow beautiful as it is devasating and heartfelt.<br/><br/>Given that this is also (almost too good to be true in being) a ""driving home for Christmas"" story, there is a slightly implausible but also wonderful ending that speaks volumes in its mini-attempt at Jewish-Italian-Black reconciliation, but the sour aftertaste (the same one as with ""Hidden Figures"") is the real-life awareness that reconciliatory steps of this kind were too few and far between, and have perhaps continued to be so.<br/><br/>Yet the overall effect of the film remains a warm one, if one of undulled core message, and that is a great trick for Farrelly and the two remarkably good key actors to pull off. All credit to them."

"eagandersongil","7","1","3","8 February 2019"," The superficial script. And the great performances
","""Greenbook"", a film that calls attention to the acting and direction, but it sins in the script, the new long one of the experienced director Peter Farrelly arrives with an inexplicable force for the ossuary 2019. Telling the story of a racist Italian driver that arranges a job of a renowned black musician. The drama of the film is inspired by facts and is good, but the solutions of script are weak and end up leaving the average film. Script options, how to expose Tony's racism is silly, has no depth and meaning, is made solely and exclusively to cause empty aversion to the viewer, and opt for a line of script that follows in every movie, we have the discussion, the problem, the resolution and the moral lesson, such a set of events are repeated throughout the film without any news, which ends up leaving the work extremely predictable beyond its last scene, which I like for the good feeling that it cause, but it diverges from the movie message, which is good, but poorly executed.
But not everything is hurt. Viggo Mortessen is very cool in his character, a raw Italian, the actor seems to have fun in making a mega canastrão character, and that suits him a lot, you perfectly buy the character. And Mahershala there is great again, bringing us a dubious and confused character with his ideas, a deep character with troublesome feelings and veiled veils in a layer of coldness, and Ali's performance restrains this to perfection.
Another cool point is Peter's focused direction, with great set compositions, a bluish photograph and good use of the cameras, the director drives his film well, nothing exceptional and the only technical mistakes are associated with script mistakes. ""Green book"" does not enchant, but it is a legal film, mainly on account of its protagonists."

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Green Book. I thought it was a strange title for a film then I realised as the film progressed that the Green Book was a thing, and as I sat captivated throughout this entire film I found that it never ceases to amaze and sadden me how humans treat fellow humans based on colour alone. This is a story inspired by the true friendship that developed between Tony Lip, a working-class American Italian from New York and Dr Don Shirley, a black pianist who employs Tony to be his driver for a tour of the Deep South where racial prejudice is right at the forefront of their whole existence. This film was exquisite, a tale of two men who are as far apart as can possibly be, one street smart, rough and ready, the other a highly educated and cultured person. They began as boss and employee and slowly formed a true and lasting friendship. Viggo Mortensen played Tony Lip and delivered a quite amazing performance. He combined the brash Italian character, with someone who had strong family values and a deep sense of good about him, even though he took the job just for the money he developed as a character as the film went along. Mahershala Ali, who played Dr Shirley was elegant and dignified throughout. This is a film I would happily watch again and again."
"Troy_Campbell","7","1","3","31 January 2019"," Two commanding central performances.
","Based on a true story, this drama retells of how Italian-American bouncer-turned-driver Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga and African-American pianist virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley became friends during a 1960's concert tour of the Deep South. The plot may be relatively simple but the road trip these two embarked on couldn't have been more difficult. A turbulent time for African-Americans (when isn't it?) - particularly down south - Dr. Shirley faced constant racism in his pursuit to spread the splendour of his music. Written by a trio including Nick Vallelonga, the screenplay has some issues. Operating in the well-worn 'odd-couple' subgenre (it's essentially a flipped Driving Miss Daisy), it relies heavily on cliché to progress their relationship along. Dr. Shirley is the hard-nosed, cultured artist who at first is dismayed by Tony's uncouth behaviour, however, after bonding over racist cops, pub beat-downs and eating fried chicken (that Tony introduces to Dr. Shirley), their vast differences become the glue to their friendship. Yet the familiarity of the plot beats and character developments is largely surpassed by two powerhouse performances that elevate proceedings beyond the midday-movie script. Mahershala Ali imbues Dr. Shirley with layers of hidden guilt and regret, not least over his ostensible distance from the black community, whilst his stiff upper lip veneer subtly wavers through a plethora of emotional tribulations. As the other half of the duo, Viggo Mortensen's no-frills wiseass is also a complicated beast; his desire to do the right thing and be a more well-rounded person constantly battles with his overt masculinity and lack of formal education. Showered with awards nominations and wins already, Green Book overcomes its narrative shortfalls through commanding, complex portrayals by Ali and Mortensen."
"alindsay-al","10","1","3","30 January 2019"," An Epic truly special film
","This film has been gaining a ton of buzz especially with Oscar season coming around so I had to see Green Book and this is one of my favourite films over the last few years. The Premise of the film is set in the 1960's and sees and Italian - American Man become a driver for a Black Piano Player as he travels the deep south of America. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead in this film, he is totally brilliant in this film, This smooth talking guy is so fun to watch with that everyday charm about him that makes him totally relatable to us the audience as he tries to help this rich man. He will definitley be a frontrunner for the Oscar which is great to see as I haven't seen Mortensen in that much recently. Mahershala Ali is absolutley brilliant in thsi film, his character arc in this film is truly important to watch, seeing these two guys learning from each other is truly fascinating to watch. He gives a really powerful performance that in my opinion will give him the Oscar this year. The rest of the supporting cast all fit their roles very well and immerse you into the story that you are watching. The story sees these two very different people go on an emotional journey of deiscovery dealing with some heavy issues and build a truly great story. It is a bit predictable but I believe that actually worked for this film. The script is actually pretty hilarious with a lot of funny moments that really worked for this film. But when the drama is needed it delivers some truly amazing moments in this film. The style is great, I wasn't bored once in this film and I loved seeing the different parts of America and how they react to this situation. Overall this is a film you must see to appreciate and is definitley going to be up there for my best movies of the year."

","My Review-<br/><br/>This is the best film of the year as far as I'm concerned and deserves the 5 Academy Award nominations it' nominated for,in fact I'll go as far as to say it should win all five, if I had a vote Green Book would win Best Film, Best Actor,Best Supporting Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay.<br/><br/>Why? Because It's the most touching and revealing story of two human beings ,poles apart in every way who experience through the challenging experiences of racial prejudice and more importantly their own personal perceptions and prejudices of each other in the America of the mid 1960's ,two very different halves of a nation that is still divided in 2019.<br/><br/>I couldn't help comparing this movie to the great film of 1989 ,Bruce Beresford 'S classic Driving Miss Daisy ,except in Green Room their driving in reverse gear with Viggo Mortensen in role of Tony Lip ,a tough Italian rough diamond who's racial ignorance is truly shown early in the movie when he returns home to his lovely wife Dolores,played beautifully by Linda Cardellini to find 2 coloured plumbers in his home.
Out of sheer economic desperation after being laid off from his job he applies and accepts a position as driver for Dr Don Shirley,a classical and high brow jazz pianist impeccably played by Marhershala Ali,and they set off on a concert tour of America's Deep South ,where the title of the movie is revealed and says it all.<br/><br/>Tony's employer and passenger is Don Shirley a elegant,cultured ,talented and incredibly wealthy Afro American concert pianist who is lonely and isolated from the reality of racial prejudice in New York society,totally opposite to Tony ,who has a loving family ,uneducated,can barely write a letter to his wife and comes out with every racial stereotype comment not through hate but just plain ignorance.<br/><br/>The journey the two men embark on has a destination more than just the red neck bigoted towns they arrive in ,when they return home they both have arrived at the most important destination, a better knowledge of themselves and their humanity and a better grasp of the defects
of character that have held them both back all their lives,it bought a tear to my eye and that's why it should win the 5 Academy Awards its nominated for, it's a rare and splendid movie."

I am super glad that I did. I was captivated from the start to finish. The movie's narrative revolves around how two people with completely disparate background, educational level, and color of skin come to understand each other and become lifelong friends, fabulously complemented with a plethora of humorous scenes and dialogues, great music of piano pieces and indelible hit songs of the 60s, and a timely and needed message in this troubled era that we should not build walls around our hearts to discriminate and hate other people who do not share same skin color, culture, or ethnicity. The movie could have become overly serious or didactic, but the director skillfully avoids the pitfalls and does not try to needlessly expand the emotional effects. I hope more people would gravitate to the magic of this movie, letting the message break the walls in their hearts."

"varun-25071997","6","1","3","4 January 2019"," Viggo Mortensen All The Way
","I mean, I could watch Viggo Mortensen for a day without getting bored but something was missing in this film. Viggo plays Tony an Italian American bouncer who goes on to work for an acclaimed singer who is African American. Initially he shows prejudice towards them but as he accepts to be the driver of Maharshala Ali (Don Shirley) he understands the evil of Jim Crow in the southern states. While the plot may be generic and Oscar bait, the performances makes it worthy enough for a watch. Viggo Mortensen nails the Italian American accent perfectly and continues to be the most consistent performer out there. While this film doesn't offer something you haven't seen and relies on cliche, it ends up being heart warming enough to impress us."

","Text: GRADE: B+<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An above-standard road movie that enthralls with its powerful message and offers two of the best performances of the year.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Road movies are nothing new. They usually follow a predictable formula with two mismatched people who begin as distant strangers and end as the best of friends. But getting there is the challenge. Past Oscar-winning best picture favorites like It Happened One Night (1934), Rainman (1988), and Driving Miss Daisy (1989) have successfully elevated this genre due to strong acting and a script that brings these character studies to life. Now we can now add another title to this illustrious group...Peter Farrelly's immensely satisfying Green Book.<br/><br/>Green Book takes that narrative structure of these celebrated films, although it owes a great deal to the latter. Let's call it Driving Dr. Shirley, especially due to its primary subject being race relations as its two characters meet and travel down south in 1962. But just as that film had two great performances (by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman), this film can also boast about two sensational performances and a literate screenplay that deals with racism head-on.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, the film takes these two vastly different personalities on a journey to self-discovery. The simplistic plot revolves around driving a gifted musician into Jim Crow territory to perform concerts for his upper class patrons who can accept his talent but not his race. Taking the maestro to his musical destinations is a bigoted lout named Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga from the Bronx. The obvious set-up is a battle of class vs. crass. Dr. Shirley is uptight, snobbish, and a sophisticated prig; Tony is loud, brutish, and a redneck. This odd couple are destined to debate and argue their one-sidedness as they journey on.<br/><br/>Helping them cross the Mason-Dixon Line safely is a little green book, a Negro Motorist CliffNotes guide to safe lodgings and restaurants in the Confederate South. Of course, there will be a series of run-ins from local haters which will bring together Tony and the Doc, as he is nicknamed by Mr. Bada Bing. That is a given. But the treatment to these intolerances is handled very astutely by Mr. Farrelly. He captures the 60's era well and allows his two actors to inhabit their roles. Kudos to the detailed production design by Tim Galvin too.<br/><br/>The powerful screenplay by Brian Currie, Nick Vallelonga, and the director is quite effective in its underplaying of events. It depicts the violence and overt racism on display very clearly. My only problem with the film is the continual stereotyping of Italian-Americans. This film, like many others, does proliferate that pre-conceived notion with its cliched roster of thick accents, shady gangster types, and food-gorging personalities.<br/><br/>However, what makes this film so very special are the two stand-out lead performances. Mahershala Ali is wonderful in the less showier role as Don Shirley. He shrewdly tampers down the anger, frustration, and righteous indignation of a man ""not black enough, or white enough, to fit into any world"". Mr. Ali plays the role hiding the rage simmering within him. It's a revelation to see his acting range. Viggo Mortensen is terrific as his bodyguard and chauffeur. He plays this strutting bull as a foolish oaf and yet somehow makes Tony endearing. The actor imbues his character with a sense of humanity, avoiding all the pitfalls in this cliche-ridden role. Both deserve many accolades this award season. Also making a strong impression in a smaller role is Linda Cardellini as Tony's loving wife, Dolores.<br/><br/>Green Book cast a mirror on racism, exposing our past mistakes and reminding us that things really have not changed in over a century. Sad."
"mungfish","10","1","3","25 November 2018"," A Classic Period Trip
","There are seldom any movies released today that compare with Green Book. This is a well written and acted film that spans comedy and pathos. The performances by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are award worthy. The filming in period locations using vintage cars and fashions was outstanding. The story of the seedy ""colored only"" hotels and the overt apartheid of the deep South of the early 60s was revealed through the eyes and feelings of the pompous but educated and musically talented black man and his white Bronx-raised chauffeur. Both characters took a journey together for two months on the tour-stop road and learned great lessons about each other. There were powerful scenes throughout the film that left one amused and uneasy. Nevertheless, this was a completely unexpected treat and one that I would heartily recommend."
"Rosemonter","10","1","3","25 November 2018"," Pitch Perfect
","Far and away one of the best performances by Viggio ever. Ali played a more nuanced role but does Viggio shine in this one! I realized it was Viggio but he transformed spectacularly to be the character with his weight gain for the role, perfect accent and mannerisms of the man with his gruff but heart of gold (and then some) man. A minor surprise about the nature of Ali's Dr. Shirley was done well and was not the focus; it was the racism and loneliness of his existence and due to those factors that you slowly begin to feel deeply for this self-made, reinvented man who creates his own existence out of the world he lives in.<br/><br/>It was much better than expected and a true story, with embellishments of course, told in a non-judgmental way as to let the viewer come to their own conclusions. One of the best movies of 2018 so far and would not be surprised to see multiple awards for this."
"zdfranz","8","1","3","22 November 2018"," Real Good - Feel Good
","Most would never mistake Hollywood marketing executives for softies, but this time they could have fooled us. How else to explain why Universal knew to release Green Book around Thanksgiving, a time of celebrating family and friendship. For, while the movie's true story may not be profound enough to change your life, it certainly altered its characters for the rest of theirs. Watching such endearing kinship play out on screen is enough to melt the heart of even the staunchest scrooge.<br/><br/>New York, 1962. A bouncer at the Copacabana nightclub named Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), aka Tony Lip, is temporary laid off after the building suffers fire damage. Seeking work to support his wife (Linda Cardellini) and two sons, he is referred to Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a virtuoso pianist who needs a driver to ferry him on a concert tour through the Deep South. But Dr. Shirley is black. His companion can't just camp out behind the wheel; he has to be able to make problems...go away.<br/><br/>Tony, as it happens, is quite good at this. So after some haggling over price, the two embark on a two-month journey from Macon to Memphis, Birmingham to Baton Rouge. The bigotry and violence they find along the way are no surprise; the fact that their relationship almost makes us forget about such hardship is another story.<br/><br/>Peter Farrelly directed this movie. Yes, the same Farrelly brother behind such comedies as Dumb and Dumber and Shallow Hall. Green Book is obviously a different bird. But while Farrelly does impress with his handling of the dramatic material, it's the humor that sets this film apart from so many others of its ilk.<br/><br/>Race is a tense, heavy subject. We need to be able to laugh, not just at characters on a screen but, perhaps, at ourselves. In comedy, like a universal smile, we find common ground.
Which is a perfect Segway to Tony Lip. I have to believe Mortensen had a ball
playing this character. Vallelonga is a pasta-munching Italian from Brooklyn who isn't just a presence, he's a force. Tony is the truth behind the stereotype. And despite a rough exterior, he loves his family-which, of course, includes aunts, uncles, cousins and the old couple who run the pawn shop down the street. There's more than one shade of Moonstruck lighting these tenement floors.<br/><br/>All this describes the character, but that's the heart of Mortensen's performance. He disappears into Tony, making him cringeworthy and loveable all at once.<br/><br/>Then there's Doc Shirley-talented, educated, single. Essentially the antithesis of Tony, which is the surface conceit of most 'road' movies. ""They couldn't have been more different..."" But, like the better entries of its genre-Midnight Run, Trains, Planes and Automobiles-Green Book finds the humanity in its headliners. Are Tony and Don really that different? And if so, why not celebrate such variety?<br/><br/>Ali, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2016's Moonlight, makes the difficult seem effortless in peeling back the doctor's layers. Shirley is a complex character-austere yet vulnerable, lonely and proud-but by the end of the movie, we know him. We love him.<br/><br/>When it comes to overall quality, Green Book is a unique case; there's nothing specifically ""wrong"" with it. That's not, though, the same as saying it's perfect. I've seen more emotional and inspiring movies, and even deeper characters. But the film is still a triumph, a 'real good feel good' experience that's hard to forget.<br/><br/>The biggest reason for this is because of how it addresses its racial subject matter. There is no pointing of fingers. The movie pulls no punches when recounting instances of discrimination, but that's not its focus. Instead, the spotlight shines on two men accepting one another as fallen, beautiful human beings."

That would mean the tour took place in 1972 which would make it difficult for Robert Kennedy to get them released from jail as he was assassinated in 1968."
"carolinericemakeup","10","1","4","26 March 2019"," Captivating
","Captivating. That is what this film was in short. It was a pure story of finding peace in one another and understanding what you once did not understand. It is not just about a driver and a pianist, it is about forming a friendship where others deemed it unfit. This movie was entertaining the entire way through and it shared a beautiful tale. I will recommend this film to anyone asking what they should watch."
"s_iliya_p","10","1","4","26 March 2019"," Well-acted, well-directed, well-told, well done!
","I loved everything about this movie. Not the usual redemption story and not the common ""let's grow together"" movie you may have warched before. Firstly and mostly, it's just a very well told story. No matter where do you come from, and what is your background, you can see this movie and enjoy 99.9% of it. Just with a notch of comedy when necessary, inherently charming acting of Viggo, fantastic acting of Maharshala, for which they both received the Oscar nomination, and Maharshala won it for the second time after Moonlight.
It's such an easy movie to watch, and such an easy one to love. Let alone the cinematography and the expected beautiful landscapes when driving in American roads.
I don't completely get the frustration of some film critiques, from not a very trained eye's perspective, it's a complete movie. And isn't what most movies should be about?<br/><br/>Notice the details in the movie, most of which are perfected meticulously. The influence of both main characters on each other that comes from respect, or plain situational necessity, is remarkable. Both characters are vastly different from each other, and I'd assume from people like me. What keeps the audience's focus in tact is for sure the universal values they share. Both of them. Reminding us, no matter the difference in backgrounds, values can be the same and used as infrastructure of relationships, growth, and in some cases prosper.
I'm trying to stay out of spoils, but may I be excused to mention the farm scene? Reminding me once again, that what may lead to a certain race being/staying in a certain class of society.<br/><br/>How prejudice can cause problems all around. It's not just one race towards another. I'm in a place in my life that I'd appreciate the globalization and interracial understandings and relations.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd watch this movie again, I love the music in it from the very first scene. I love how the story is told in a soft way. I love how Mahaeshala and Bowers worked together to create all the Piano scenes, which to be honest, is so cool. I love how the amount of redemption in the movie is not that big to be interpreted as excessive or emotionally surprising, yet not that small to omit its significance. I just love that this movie has people who do good and the ones who do bad. To me it's just real!
How Dr. Shirley tries to impact the society with his music knowing the obstacles is another great interest of mine. I love a good struggle when I see it, and I loved this one."
"grz-98-880629","9","1","4","24 March 2019"," Great Movie for Free-Thinkers, and Others
","This is a good story, and nicely told and acted. It's worth watching a few times, because it has a few tiers and points of view for assessment. (From whose point of view, inside-out or outside-in, etc.)<br/><br/>For a prejudiced person, it probably will not cause the trauma needed for deep change, but perhaps for someone on the fence, it will teach something. For an inviting free-thinker, it is a pleasure of truth.<br/><br/>There is the usual hypocrisy juxtaposition, such as in the Godfather. In the Godfather, assassination scenes were cut into the communion scene. Here, it's acts of prejudice followed by religious symbols and prayer.<br/><br/>Starting conflict, the growth of bond, transformation and redemption. Low-key comedy along the way, which was nicely balanced to the message and tone.<br/><br/>There is a great discussion in the car, too subtle for some, about the complexity of a human being, but the singularity of how prejudice is formed. That is, how we form opinions based upon one criterion, when a human being is complex. Again, it is subtle, but the movie balances nicely that human beings in similar roles, including roles of power, all do not act the same.<br/><br/>Well-done. This story and the acting duly earned its awards."

","It was supposed to be sad, yet it made me laugh most of the time. Ineffable story, it touched my sensation sometimes, although I knew it's different from the reality.<br/><br/>The most unforgettable plot is when the pianist saw the black slave farming laboriously under the heat, Dr. Shirley was well dressed and sat inside the car while his white driver needed to check the car motor. That contrast was so strong; The white driver and the black farmers, they all doing the labor work regardless color. Meanwhile, Dr.Shirley and those farmers are all black, but their status are totally different. This part aroused audiences sensation for purpose. Not in favor, but strong contrast indeed, it's a good trick to leave impressions.<br/><br/>The movie also got me down every time when the pianist suffered unequal treatments. A top educated pianist with two honorary doctorates couldn't win him any respect in South. The movie named Green Book, it's a travel guide, only its listed businesses would accept African American customers. Dr.Shirley was refused to many place under the segregation, even a bathroom - to handle a man's basic needs. The host of the house would still turned his request down, the irony is they claimed themselves the most educated and powerful in the area. They appreciated Dr. Shirley's skill, but didn't respect him as an equal person. Dr. Shirley endures all these unequal treatments. He still put out a big smile, act courteous and speak mannerly to his white audiences. This suffer is silent but I seem to hear the heartbreaking from his soul. A silent torture of a man's pride, again and again, but a brave soul always born with endless courage.<br/><br/>Despite this, the rhythm of the movie is not depressing at all, it's bittersweet and heartwarming. The journey is funny with the Foodaholic driver, Tony lip's character image is hilarious. Dr. Shirley and Tony became friend, and their understanding of each other is more than just two cultures or any stereotypes. Their friendship is beautiful and rich in layers. However in real life, the pianist's family claimed Dr. Shirley never be friend with Tony, the movie was edited by Tony's son. Whatsoever, the script provoked thoughts, But when you walk out the theater, you would still memorize it as being short and sweet."

"Benslie","10","1","4","17 March 2019"," A surprise masterpiece of film
","First of all, the acting in this done by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen was amazing. Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn't afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it's dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don't feel it. Really even though I don't say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would've cut but not that many. In the end, this is a film that I think everybody should check out at least once. Whether just to learn about this interesting story about two friends who defied the odds or just a movie to watch."
"shouborno","10","1","4","16 March 2019"," A timely movie about friendship, encouraging battle against all inequalities - Well-deserved Oscar
","Despite ongoing term finals at university, many of my friends are watching this movie and talking about it (some of them watched it multiple times; some even called it one of their favorites). All those buzz got my hopes up and I started to expect a masterpiece, and I was not disappointed. It felt like looking through a timeless window at a broken society clinging to false traditions. There were funny moments, and also moments which would motivate anyone. I would keep two such motivational quotes forever fresh in my mind. I believe anyone watching this film would find their own favorites.<br/><br/>Nick Vallelonga did a good job with the script. I looked him up and found some stories regarding his apology for an old Islamophobic tweet. If everyone gives up their ego and tries a little more to banish all hatred / prejudice, a few years later, even 2019 would feel like a dark past. For which, the motivations derived from this film, I believe, can work as magic. Yes, I agree that genius is not enough, that it takes courage to win hearts. Yes, I also realise that the world is full of lonely people waiting for someone else to take the first move. We have to act out of friendship and love without waiting for the other party to do it firdt. We have to be courageous enough to stand up for ourselves, and to share our genius in such a manner that it breaks the walls that isolate us. Life is too small to stay in our own islands, afraid to take action to reduce distances. And for that, we have to forsake arrogance or violence, for temper tantrum will only cost us our loss - to win, we have to protect our dignity and stay civil even in the face of unjust humiliation.<br/><br/>Now, without spoiling much, I would like to analyze a couple scenes. If you are reading this, thanks a lot for reading a review brain-dumped by a humble being. Please stop reading right now if you haven't watched the movie yet.<br/><br/>The KFC scene was humorous and heart-warming. The best part was that Dr. Shirley made Tony drive back and pick up the plastic cup he had thrown up, showing that littering should not be tolerated. Mother earth deserves all the care we can give her - and she deserves more than that - she deserves action; the thought is not the only thing that matters in this case. I thought that this is it, but I had to brace myself for more - since it's a long ride, and we have just started.<br/><br/>Also, during the return drive, a cop followed their car. This scene was important. It showed that the police are not the bad guys - no particular group ( profession, race, gender, religion, etc. ) can be incriminated by the act of some of them. If we keep hating entire groups for some people's fault, we'll end up hating the entire humanity, and it's not worth it, for love brings life, and hatred takes it away."

Being Italian and watching the family was like being sent back in time to a simpler era where I am sad to admit was also very brutish in social awareness of the south and it's rural roughness. I grew up in Central New Jersey in the 60's and I can tell you for a fact that racism was still practiced that far north. As a child I remember traveling just 20 miles south of where we lived and everyone spoke with a deep southern drawl.
I am glad social awareness is spreading in the right way and Green Book reminded me about my life in the south pre-MTV I call it. Brutish to northerners and people of color.

The story was meaningful, thoughtful, and tears were brought to my heart. It's one of those movies that made me laugh, that made me cry, and that made me sit there in shock, in wonder and awe. This movie is simply about a black man and a white man, and a friendship, an unlikely friendship tying them together. With all the challenges that they face, and the obstacles in the way, they face them, and you'll see what happens next. The story of Tony Lip and Doctor Shirley is surely a story that we want our children to know, their children to know, and our great grandchildren to know, and the entire generation passed down before us; to show people what really matters in the world, what reigns over racism and electronics and following what the society does, letting reputation get the best of you. These are all the least important. Friendship can tie us together. So let us appreciate it. It doesn't matter what other people do, it matters what you do. What you do, make it right.

The way he is playing a (quite not smart) food minded Italian-American is making this movie really funny and without exception one of his best role's he has ever played.
My most funniest scene is when someone offers Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) a snack, he's tasting it, grabs a napkin from the plate the waiter is holding, spitting it out on the napkin and puts the napkin with the snack and all of his slime in it back on the plate.

","""The whole story is about love... it's about loving each other despite our differences and finding out the truth about who we are; we're the same people.""
These are the words of Director Peter Farrelly upon accepting the movie's well deserved Best Picture Academy Award. Despite all the controversy about the film at the moment I must say I have enjoyed it. Spike Lee and other not-so-enthusiasts set aside, Green Book is the perfect metaphor; a symbol of pacifism and interracial respect that we should all take into personal account.<br/><br/>African-American piano virtuoso Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Italian-American Tony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) face a fair share of injustice and discrimination as they travel together through Southern USA, encountering all sorts of people types and scenarios that they must work together to resolve. Ali's character is a reserved, unspoken type with a pacifistic approach to the dilemmas the pair find themselves in, with Tony being quite the polar opposite. But at the end of the day, the two are safe from trouble and on their way to the next location. As the film moves on, we watch the pair get to know each other and respect each other for their own differences, a rather satisfying feeling if you ask me. A picture is painted of the way things were in the early 1960s and it could not be more accurate.<br/><br/>I think that most of the controversy originated from the fact that Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga never got the revenge that some cinemagoers were expecting. Green Book is not a story of zeal but that of pacifism. And even if you don't personally agree with the story's message, the excellent job the movie did at presenting their perspective must be appreciated. For I do not believe a movie should be judged in regards to one's own personal prejudice or anecdotal experience.<br/><br/>Mortensen and Ali both played out their characters perfectly, and accompanied by 2019's Best Original Screenplay, the film was already set for big results. I doubt I will forget this wonderful film anytime soon, I would rather remember it as the iconic masterpiece it is. And to the rest of us it can be a reminder that even in 2019, there still are decent and authentic movies being made."

"Gendorius90","Null","1","4","21 December 2018"," Because I am human nothing human is alien to me. (Spoilers at the end)
","Green Book is a very typical film by how you see it, a poor working class Italian is paid to drive a rich black classically trained piano player around the deep south of the USA while it is still normal with racism.
But the movie knows that it's a cliché, and it constantly rewards you for guessing right and makes you smile when it takes a turn you didn't see coming.<br/><br/>The movie is serious in how it is played out and that is what makes it a good comedy to me. The jokes are mostly referring to what happened before.<br/><br/>If you have grown up a little rough you can get the character of Tony and his ways, ""It isn't stealing if the rock lies on the ground."" and even if you don't get it I think you would come to like him by the end.
The same goes for Shirley who starts off being very aloof and hard to like because he appears so snobby but by the end he shows off a side where you finally understand him to a whole new point and you are happy to see how they end up treating one another.<br/><br/>The racism in the movie feels realistic in that not everyone is a redneck, they are just set in their ways and most people don't go out of their ways to be racist and even when they get angry it is because they have been wronged most of the time.
To me this movies way of treating racism is the best I have seen in a very long time because it didn't take sides and it wasn't about racism but it always came back to it. Just like taxes and death, back in those days you needed a handbook to know where to be safe and the movie really pulls that aspect off.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is incredible and I found myself tapping along with the music in one way or another, the classical, the radio and the bar music.
It had soul and it felt good.<br/><br/>!!Spoilers!!
There was a scene in the movie which sum up the movie in a very simple way where Tony tells Shirley that he is blacker than Shirley because he knows the culture, grew up on the streets and is a worker having to constantly work to pay for his family. It really puts it into perspective that things are not all about skin color, race or where you grew up, it is all a part of you and you are not less black because you are rich, and you're not more happy because you are rich neither. It all comes down to everything that makes you, You. That you can relate to anyone if you only talk to them for a while.

","Green Book Review:<br/><br/>Green Book is inspired by the true friendship of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a working class Italian-American bouncer and Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American pianist, as Tony Lip drives Dr. Shirley on his venue tour in the 1960s in the southern states. This is the movie, other than A Star is Born, that has been getting the biggest Oscar buzz this season. It seemed like an interesting plot and looked really good. I've given out 4 A+ scores this year, one being for the miniseries Sharp Objects, and I'm happy to say Green Book joins that group. I loved every minute of this movie! The story by Peter Farrelly was so good. Definitely will get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, though I do think Roma will end up winning it. The dialogue worked. The pacing was good. There was just so much emotion put into this. As the tour gets deeper into the South, Dr. Shirley experiences more racism and you just had no words to describe all of the emotion and feelings put into those scenes. The performances by the two actors are the best of all year. Viggo Mortensen will win Best Actor. His portrayal of Tony Lip was amazing. His best performance yet. He was a lovable character. And it's a character that has flaws and it's acknowledged throughout and Viggo knew how to do that. Mahershala Ali will for sure win his second Oscar, first for playing Juan in Moonlight, playing Dr. Shirley. This is his best role to date. There were scenes that made me laugh and some bringing tears. This is a lock for Best Supporting Actor. I loved Linda Cardellini as Delores but I don't think she'll be recognized for her role. Peter Farrelly's direction was great. He has made some horrendous films in the past, one being Movie 43, but he did very well and could get a nomination for Best Director, probably won't win however. The score by Kris Bowers was very good. It was a mix of classical music that Dr. Shirley played and 60s jazz. I think he'll get a nomination for Best Original Score. Not too many scores have been released for upcoming films so it's hard to tell what he's up against though there are a few from earlier this year that could get nominated. The cinematography was good but not good enough for the nomination. In all honesty, so far this is the film that I think will win Best Picture at the Oscars 2019 (I will put my top 10 Best Picture Predictions below). It had so much to say and I think it's a film everyone should see. It's relevant and I will say my favorite Christmas movie to date. I was disappointed to see that it didn't make too much at the box office yet, only making 14.0 million and only #10 at the the top box office for its second week into its release. It was promoted at theaters but not many theaters got it. I had to go all the way to Appleton to see it and it was in a small theater that was packed. I was happy to see how many people went to see it. Overall you should see the movie when you get the chance. I don't think you could hate it.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+<br/><br/>My Oscar 2019 Best Picture Predictions so far (they're pretty close to the Gold Derby Predictions):<br/><br/>1. Green Book
2. Roma
3. A Star is Born
4. If Beale Street Could Talk
5. The Favourite
6. Vice
7. BlacKkKlansman
8. First Man
9. Black Panther (it's really getting a lot of buzz)
10. Can You Ever Forgive Me?"
"kjproulx","10","1","4","1 December 2018"," The Feel-Good Movie of the Year
","Usually, when a film is made and has very little depth in terms of storytelling, it would be forgotten about, but if you have a unique take on a specific story and the point of the movie is to keep it simple and explore only one facet of history. Personally, I prefer when stories are a little more fleshed out, but I also believe this simple story in Green Book is one of the best films of 2018. This is a movie that cares about its characters first and foremost and we don't see many of those films hitting the big screen very often, so this was a pleasant surprise. Although there's not much meat to the story (which may bore some viewers), I found Green Book to be a fantastic piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Fired from the downtown club and forced to take any job he can in order to support his family, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) decides to take on the role of driving pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) across the South, as he and his band perform for audiences. With the inclusion of the fact that Don is an African-American man in the 1960s and Tony being an Italian-American, many racial occurrences arise for these two. Being an unlikely pairing for that particular decade, these characters needed to be like-able and completely fleshed out in order for this film to work and those two aspects were absolutely astoundingly well-done in my opinion. This also stems from a particularly great turn by director Peter Farrelly.<br/><br/>Although his earlier work on films like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary are very commendable outings, his recent comedies haven't exactly struck gold. Having his last few films being Dumb and Dumber To, Hall Pass, and The Heartbreak Kid, I was very worried about him taking on a more dramatic film. After watching this film, I felt ridiculous even thinking that, because not only has he shown maturity as a director this time around, but also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a more meaningful premise. If he sticks with this style of filmmaking, I can definitely see his name in the public eye more often in the coming years. The way he handles his performers here was truly something special.<br/><br/>As I said, it truly is the character arcs that carry this film and without amazing performances, this movie would've been forgotten. Mortensen and Ali both give their all in these roles and it shows. There wasn't a single moment where I found myself scratching my head or not believing a decision they made or line of dialogue they spoke. In the vein of films like Driving Miss Daisy or even Before Sunrise, the conversations are the reason this film doesn't feel slow. There's hardly a single exciting scene and the movie clocks in at nearly 140 minutes. That's when you know the dialogue has been written very well by the trio in Nick Vallelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Peter Farrelly.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't see everyone loving this film, due to the slow pace it has, but it's a breezy crowd-pleaser nonetheless. This movie has been generating major awards consideration and I think it deserves every bit of it and then some. I loved my experience watching this movie and I can't wait to revisit it and take this journey with these characters again. Funny, sad, and heartwarming, Green Book easily earns the title of being one of the best feel-good movies in recent memory (at least to me). I loved this movie and I can't recommend it enough."

","It's movies like this that give movies a good name. At least in my book. Before saying what I like about it I will venture to say why some people didn't like Green Book. Such people are either too jaded or numb to appreciate feel- good art. Or they went to film school and they can't get the formulas out of their heads long enough to view something with fresh eyes.<br/><br/>The biggest compliment I can give Green Book is I didn't want it to end. . Forget the race stuff. Forget the politically correct BS. This movie consisted of great actors doing a great job with a superlative script and spot-on direction. The story tugged at the heart strings in ways that celebrated humanity, not black or white humanity. Just humanity."

That movie struck out with me already. Viggo and Mr. Ali were great in every scene of this movie. The way that they shared their two different worlds with each other was epic. DMD lacked all of that depth. You very seldom seem that kind of brotherhood and male bonding in a movie that is not either a war movie; or a sporting event movie. I cannot even name one."

"sunhongbao1","10","1","5","27 March 2019"," Dignity prevails all.
","The scenes of Doc. Shirly wears beautiful suits can't be remove from my mind for a long time. In 1962, most black men still lived a hard life which was not respected by white people. Even Doc. Shirly, who was such a famous musician, couldn't eat at a gorgeos canteen and try on suits in the tailor's shop. Meeting with such bad things, he just showed his dignity to fought. Maybe he felt alone all the time, but the dignity of his character would never vanish. The happy ending like many Hoolywood movies is just as common, but it makes our heart warm."
"rohitbalaporia","10","1","5","26 March 2019"," green book
","The title of the movie, Green Book, one would expect it to be a movie about romance or a chick-flick. However, Green Book is a movie about Donald (Don) Shirley, who was an African-American musician. The title of the movie itself originates from The Green Book which was published by Victor Hugo Green and his family. The book served as a guide as to which establishments served African-Americans in the segregated South. As such, it is no secret that this movie is heavily influenced by the series of events that took place in the 1960s. The movie highlighted the misfortunes faced by people of color during that time.<br/><br/>Both protagonists were a perfect match for the movie and for each other. Shirley, portrayed by Mahershala Ali, has endured racial discrimination his whole life. In this movie, he had set out on a mission to recruit a chauffeur for his upcoming tour. The chauffeur is none other than, Tony Vallelonga (Tony Lip), portrayed by Viggo Mortensen. It is important to note that Ali is an Academy Award winner whose acting skills are quite intriguing. It is also through their opposite characters that we are able to see their contrasting ideologies. As it was hard for an African-American musician to travel around the country, all Shirley wanted to do was to perform so that he could prove his point, even though he was secretive. As the movie progresses, it is evident to see how an inevitable friendship slowly develops.<br/><br/>Back in the day, New York City was a buzzing hub for various mafias, gangs and drug dealings. Through this movie, the ways in which ""Tony Lip"" turned down illegal offers is evidently portrayed. The bouncer turned down many opportunities, after losing his job temporarily. Thus, Lip was hired by Shirley to be his personal assistant and chauffeur. Even though the offer was turned down by Lip due to his ego, Shirley knew that losing Lip would prove to be a huge lost due to his reputation and by the way he handles situations.<br/><br/>The way in which the movie was shot was quite amazing, to say the least. From the perspective of a viewer, it feels like you went back in time to the period where overt displays of racism were the norm in America. It is quite saddening to see the extent to which racism occurred back in the day. Unless one has lived through it and experienced the injustice first hand, one cannot fully comprehend the depths of emotional and physical abuse endured by people of color. A lot of emphasis was placed on the segregation between people of color and the whites, a significant example was that they had to stay in different hotels. By how the scene is set, one could get a glimpse as to some of the adversities faced by Shirley. One of the many examples was how difficult it was for him to go on tour."

","Set in the 1960s, Tony (Viggo Mortensen) works a bouncer for a local club. When the club closes its doors for a couple of months due to the club requiring renovations, Tony seeks other employment until he can return to work. He soon accepts a job as a driver for Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a pianist who will be going on tour, visiting many venues and locations.<br/><br/>As the two travel, they have many conversations, encountering many situations and issues along the way. They also soon find out they can help one other personally as well as professionally. This film is based on a true story of a unlikely friendship.<br/><br/>Needless to say, when our two leading actors are on screen the film is incredibly alive and enjoyable. The chemistry these two have on screen is believable and their relationship feels completely real, giving the audience the feeling that you too are on this road trip. At selected moments, the two leads are also really humorous to watch in the way they interact with each other and question each other's logic.<br/><br/>The actors also deliver performances that are different to their previous work. For example, Viggo Mortensen put on weight for this role and delivers a great Italian- American accent. It's basic elements like these that make you forget he was ever a King protecting Hobbits with a ring.<br/><br/>Without giving too much of the plot away, the story is basic and focuses mostly on the friendship and chemistry of our leads. Despite this, the film can be rather dramatic to watch at key moments. As the two go from town to town, it's unfortunate to witness how people react to both Tony and Dr Don, in particular when it comes to the topic of racism. Needless the say the film touches on this topic rather positively as by end of the film there is a great message for all which I really loved.<br/><br/>With incredible acting done by both performers, the film's audio and visual also can't be faulted. I personally enjoyed the film's soundtrack (yes, lots of jazz). I noticed all the shots and camera movements were clear and smooth. Other elements such as set design were also really enjoyable to see on the big screen. My biggest surprise was to discover that Green Book was directed by Peter Farrelly who is best known for directing crude and rude films such as Dumb and Dumber, Hall Pass, Three Stooges and Shallow Hal etc. This alone completely surprised me given the director's past experience. It's a completely massive change in film style unlike anything I have seen.<br/><br/>Overall, Green Book is a fantastic film and I personally enjoyed this film more than I expected I would. With fantastic acting, audio visual and a positive message to share, I have spent a long time trying to figure out what I personally didn't like about the film and my answer is... I have nothing. No complaints, not one. Green Book is an unforgettable masterpiece and simply a must see. Finesse!<br/><br/>10/10

","This is a classic film already. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali worked this ""odd couple"" to perfection actually defining how the development of deep lifelong friendship is derived. Having seen the film tonight for the first time after hearing all the Oscar talk, it strikes me profoundly that the best supporting actor role was undeniably dependent on the nominee for best leading actor in this film. I think that both actors deserved Oscars, but not one. That is to say it should have been both or neither as the only choice. I don't get the academy's ambivalence, since they awarded best picture for the film. (Yes, I have seen Bohemian Rhapsody and loved the film and Rami Malek's performance.)
This was a beautiful and moving film mainly due to the chemistry between the two men."

His family did not write the film. This story developed from the writer hearing it mostly from his dad, the driver. So from that point of view the story depicted was accurate. It wasnt the important view, or the more interesting that of Don Shirley. I think that would have been a better movie.<br/><br/>My guess is there was some distance between Don and his family; or they would have written his story. A black man in the 50's and 60's who was a music savant; PHD in 3 subjects; and they didnt write his story? Spike Lee didnt think enough of Don's contribution not to write it??? Is it because Don has contributed more than Spike? Noone should care what Spike Lee thinks anyway.<br/><br/>Again I do think this story is accurate, but from the wrong perspective. It could have been a great one....."

"andrewroy-04316","6","1","5","17 February 2019"," Crowd pleasing thanks to its humor and performances, but ultimately overly predictable, bland, and forgettable
","I have few big complaints about Green Book, but just an hour after watching it little of it stayed in my mind. It's a dramedy focused on the relationship between a working class white guy and a black pianist in the 1960s. Mortensen and Ali are both excellent in their roles, with Mortensen bringing some depth to an exaggeratedly written character and Ali bringing a balance of professionalism and emotion. Their relationship certainly has its share of humor, and it is fun to be along for the ride as they banter. I didn't think the racial elements of their relationships and identities were well explored, with the exception of Ali's monologue about how he doesn't fit in with any community. Mortensen was overtly racist early on, and there's no real explanation for why he's quickly so willing to work for a black high class man and put those prejudices aside. The differences in viewpoints and nuance were largely brushed aside in favor of a broader, optimistic arc where both of them are just good friends who save the other from racial/class problems when they need it. The ending does a good job of bringing full circle the themes of courage and integrity, but they still feel quite surface level and manufactured for easy, light satisfaction. The humor is fine and adds to the movie but isn't essential to it. It's a movie that's easy to sit back and go along with, but a hard one to think deeply about and come away with new elements to ponder. It's a crowd pleaser, but felt all to predictable and pandery to be memorable."

","I saw the trailer for this movie a couple of times before its release, it looked exactly like the sort of thing that would do well during the upcoming Awards Season, and it sounded very interesting after reading more about it, so I looked for to it, from Golden Globe nominated director Peter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary). Based on the true story, in New York City, Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) works as a bouncer at a nightclub, the place is closed down for renovations, so he seeks new employment. He is invited for an interview with Doctor ""Doc"" Don Shirley (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Mahershala Ali), a black pianist who had Tony suggested to him, he is looking for a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Mid-West and Deep South. Based on the strength of his references, Don hires Tony, they embark with plans to return to New York on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for black travellers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve black people. The tour begins in the Midwest before they eventually head further south. Don and Tony initially clash, with Tony uncomfortable being made to act refined, and Don being disgusted with Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, he also becomes increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment the musician receives from event hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. One night, Don's life is threatened by a group of white men in a bar, Tony rescues him and instructs Don he should not go anywhere without him for the rest of the tour. Before leaving, Tony's wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) desired him to write her letters, to let her know what he is up to, and express his feelings for her. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her, while Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that his professional life and achievements are stopping him. Don is caught in a gay encounter with a white man, Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest, which upsets Don, as he feels that he is ""rewarding"" them for their treatment. Later, Don and Tony are arrested after being pulled over by a police officer in an all-white town and Tony punches him after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, rather than using his call to contact his ""lawyer"", Don uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who orders the governor to release them. Tony is amazed by the experience, while Don is humiliated, this leads to an argument between them. Having reached his breaking point, Don tells Tony that his fame prevents him from identifying with people of his race, while his race prevents him from being accepted by white people, and his homosexuality from being accepted by anybody, making him feel truly lonely. The night of his final performance in Birmingham, Alabama, Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the country club venue he is performing at. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play, so Tony takes Don to dinner at a predominantly black blues club, listed in the Green Book, where Don plays on the stage piano and rouses the crowd with his music. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve, Tony gets tired during a snowstorm, so Don takes over driving duty, and they make it in time for Tony's family dinner. Don later returns to Tony's apartment, Tony invites him in, there is a brief silence from everyone, but he is welcomes and thanked by Tony's wife for helping him write his letters. Also starring Don Stark as Jules Podell, Sebastian Maniscalco as Johnny Venere, Dimiter D. Marinov as Oleg and Mike Hatton as George. Mortensen is likeable as the amusing Italian-American rough diamond who slowly has his attitudes changed, but not his manners, but Ali almost steals the show as the talented African-American pianist who struggles during the time of segregation and has standards, together Mortensen and Ali are a wonderful odd-couple on the road. The style of the story is very similar to Driving Miss Daisy, with the chauffeur forming an unlikely friendship with his passenger, the scenes of piano playing and concerts are also likeable, this film really makes you realise the severe nature of the treatment of black people during the 1960s, but it leaves enough room to make you laugh and have well-meaning and touching scenes, it all adds up to a satisfying crowd-pleasing biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Good!"
"joelwatchesmovies","7","1","5","31 December 2018"," The hilarious and heartwarming character dynamic is what works best here
","The film's attempts to address racial issues are flimsy, formulaic, and awkward, but when it focuses on the positively hilarious and often heartwarming odd couple dynamic of the crass but warm blue-collar Tony and the classy yet aloof Dr. Shirley, it succeeds (see the chicken-eating, letter-writing), though considering Tony's relatively flat arc, the latter should've been the lead (see his speech on identity in the rain and hints of a troubled backstory that receive no further treatment)."

","While this is an interesting movie, somehow, I can't say that it is great. Sure, the actors are flawless, the images are splendid, the editing is impeccable, the sound is perfect. There are no dull moments when the action seems stalled. Yet, I had a constant impression of déjà vu. I constantly thought of Driving Miss Daisy, Intouchables and, up to a certain level, Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Not to say that the movie is copy-paste of proven hits, but the result just wasn't as striking as I hoped it woud be."
"jespiddlin","5","1","6","7 July 2019"," What a letdown!
","I am not surprised that nobody has mentioned the actual Green Book they used on the trip. Nobody knows about it and this movie didn't help them learn. The title was extremely misleading. It promised something it didn't even try to deliver. It's more about Don Shirley's tour in the south with Tony serving as his driver and bodyguard, basically. It was NOT about the Green Book. It missed the whole point. What an excellent opportunity to share what the Green Book was all about. Instead, they grazed over the purpose of that valuable book! With the violence they showed, they could have had later scenes with them wishing they'd consulted the book first, or learning what a sundown town was AFTER they went through the experience.<br/><br/>While the movie seemed to try showing how harsh the times were (and did a fairly good job), it seemed too bent on fixing it with a counterbalance somewhere else. I think there should have been more concern about following the ""rules"" of The South--once they realized they existed, so they could stay out of trouble. Instead, they treated the situations almost as if they were just odd instances of racism.<br/><br/>With all that said, it was easy for me to know what was coming in many cases, but it was a very enjoyable movie, and the end--the last phrase spoken--was PERFECT.<br/><br/>I penalized the movie 5 stars for having a misleading title (which was very important in this situation), and I gave the movie 5 stars for being enjoyable."

","""Hollywood"" is often used as a pejorative when describing films. In Spanish they say ""americanada"" to mean just about the same thing. Hollywood as an insult usually means predictable, over-saccharin, and always with a happy, feel-good ending. Green Book is guilty as charged. The funny thing about ""Hollywood"" movies, they are quite often very entertaining. Once again guilty as charged.<br/><br/>I will defend ""Hollywood"" to my Spanish friends by simply reminding them that most European movies are dreadfully boring, poorly directed (my biggest complaint), and they could use a little ""Hollywood.""<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was less than totally convincing as the New York Italian tough guy. The movie held nothing in the way of surprises. I like the fact that it didn't try to rewrite America's shameful history of racism but it at least gave us a glimpse of hope on a snowy Christmas Eve on a rural back road. We can do better as a nation. We have to do better.<br/><br/>Green Book is shy of being a good film, but my standards have been lowered considerably because of the torrent of crap I've watched this past year."

"areatw","7","0","1","28 March 2020"," Enjoyable story of an unlikely friendship
","Based on a true story in the US deep south during the 60s, 'Green Book' is an enjoyable and moving film about an unlikely friendship between a black jazz musician and his white bodyguard and driver. It's a nice story and the film does a good job at balancing the humour and drama so that it feels neither too light or heavy.<br/><br/>'Green Book' is well-written and looks great. The two main characters, Tony and Don, are brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali respectively. They work well together and share great chemistry, with some very funny moments and individual scenes.<br/><br/>If I had one criticism, 'Green Book' does feel quite clichÃ© and somewhat forced in getting its message across. Of course, race relations were always going to be a big part of this film as it is set in a time in American history when racism was rife, but I do often feel films like this try too hard to make a statement rather than simply tell the story."

If it helps, I can 0nly say to please not think he has been compromised.<br/><br/>It also taught me that a Green Book exists. Like seriously? And sundown towns? Jesus, you Americans are up. And still today you do this to people because of colour? You only show how scared you are about your disempowerment.<br/><br/>It's an interesting film. Of relationships of empowerment. These gentlemen are presenting their differences with honour, together. Not a black man at the mercy of a white guy. They needed each other. To the family of DS, honestly, he is presented as an extraordinary educated gentleman.<br/><br/>And living on top of Carnegie Hall? Wow. i used to live on top of a room of a swanky pub. That was cool at the time. That's about it.<br/><br/>Movies are never real, more bromides to allay our reality of compromise in cages. But humanity is learning.

Those whities were such losers.<br/><br/>How people think power is built on compromise, segregation, and dominion are pathetic.<br/><br/>PS (at the risk of DS's critique of such a format of writing), I really hope Viggo didn't really put on so much weight for his role."

"fmianzhicao","9","0","3","12 December 2019"," STREAMING GREEN BOOK ON NETFLIX: NOT A JOKE
","Until last weekend, as my roommate asked help for her shutdown iPhone, I had firmly believed that Netflix is used for TV episodes other than movies. Not anymore. When I was trying to save the phone through the long process of system upgrade, she warmheartedly recommended a title from movie selection. It took me almost a minute, awkward enough, to process that she was talking about a film. Nonetheless, after my finishing the tournament of repair service, I felt obliged to call it out, ""it is the end of an era, isn't it""?<br/><br/>According to recent researches, people start to open Netflix and its counterparts on a smart TV for a decent movie. By referencing to decency, I am talking about a movie of some real-deal production, during which you'd better dress yourself up and pour a glass of wine all the way down. The boundary, as my theater teacher friend Dolores correctly points out, is determined by the manners of watching. For me, episodes are what you can go through with other stuff on hand, nonetheless movies are those you have a protocol to follow, such as the solemnities of remaining presence and concerns for context loss by taking a leak. The streaming giant is no longer associated with cheap thrill on a lazy couch, sometimes accompanied with the cheese and crackers. Sorry for your bladder, but you may have to respect some rituals to follow a movie through.<br/><br/>The popularity of movie on streaming service, as a result, blurs the given boundary. In the good old days, the disparity can't be more significant, just as lobster and crayfish, champagne and beer, phone number on a handkerchief and sex robot deep in the cupboard. Despite some still uphold the irreplaceability of physical intercourse, the rest of demarches is increasingly meaningless, after all, we are living in a world where all are buried equal. For instance, it is increasingly risky for an elected politician to talk posh on TV, since it may detach the base of politician through the distance being created.<br/><br/>Bearing that in mind, it won't be surprising that some audience, especially international ones, spare the first round of Green Book to Netflix. I am proud enough to claim that I belong to the fraction. Yes, I haven't watched Green Book in cinema, and yes again, I feel terrible when my people remind me of their commentaries. For a long time, despite the saved-up bow tie and tuxedo, I tend to visit cinema to pay my tribute for a movie of Oscar. Likewise, under the magic of Academy, I feel mandated to bear a particular state of mind and offer a specific form of comment. Due to the recommendation from Dolores, I feel obliged, as solemnly as Trump's presidential oath, to follow the thread and catch up with the speed.<br/><br/>I have to confess that the experience of streaming an Oscar-winning movie at home is roughly incredible. In the age of Netflix movie-watching, all you need is a subscribed New York Times newsletter, in addition to a Netflix account for around 8 euros which is charged monthly, to trigger the curiosity. I still keep notes and highlight plots, but all being done on my tablet. The only item that associate myself with a 19-century nostalgia is a typewriter-style keyboard, which actually connects my tablets through Bluetooth. Nowadays, it costs far less than ever to pretend like a good liberal, letting alone well-informed voter.<br/><br/>Against the background, the movie's notorious reputation is somewhat made reasonable. No doubts, it is a wonderful story of reconciliation and redemption, and moreover, epitomes the American way to humanity. The tension is primarily constructed between an unlikely pair from New York, an African American renowned artist and his Italian American valiant muscle. In time of December 1962, an epilogue for an age of turbulence and remake, they started a courageous music tour into deep south.<br/><br/>For a moment, I am almost motivated to tears. The theme of civil rights movements repeats by my ears. Hand in hand, both characters fight their fight against various discriminative manifestations, varying from explicit exercise of segregation to implicit stereotypes arising from prejudice. Finally, the pair, seated by the Christmas dinner table, were savoring the gratification of family reunion. The whole story almost resonates the theme of American patriotism: God, family, and the beacon of freedom. By the way, it is not a joke.<br/><br/>However, the story, all magic twists regardless, is merely too good, or too American, to be true. Despite people seldom reckon it in moment of joy, they have to come to terms with the imperfection of real life. In this regard, the redemption theme is far too mythical that most reasonable minds may feel reluctant to embrace. After all, in the early 60' America, the odds that Don Shirley mainstreams himself in the white-dominated culture is almost the same as the chances that Tony Lip survives the bullets and punches in nightclub scenes. The storyline typically fits the desire for simplification, and sometimes trespasses the safety valve, making it into oversimplification. In some scenes, it is almost similar to gauging the catering cost of ordinary families through the menu of a Michelin restaurant.<br/><br/>I won't find it difficult to apprehend Spike Lee's anger after Oscar ceremony though. In Lee's take, Oscar merely acknowledges an exceptional figure who is capable to assimilate with mainstream. Meanwhile, the figure remains ambiguous on his stance towards the heterodoxy. In spite of these, the mainstream still tries to embark it with the tag of reconciliation, which is truly annoying. The logic behind the reconciliation reiterates a self-fulfilling prophecy; do you know why you fail? Simply because you suck. Look at Dr. Shirley, he is the one that makes it.<br/><br/>Just as those people in need of a charismatic leader, the storyline of Green Book is built upon the moment of singularity. The character of Dr. Shirley represents an endeavor to create that singularity, after which the history of whole universe makes sense. However, for people in the age of streaming service, it is more plausible that the big bang, instead of a fictional starting point, creates all that follows. The same as most of geological event, it is ashes, rocks, and ruins that purports all the spectacular.<br/><br/>By saying that, till today, only a few of minority can make a career that is comparable with Dr. Shirley. For the making of minority, two options are set ahead: following the successors of Malcom X who struggle to shake the establishment bottom-up, or joining the alike of Dr. King that manages to alter the system from top-down. By the way, both of them end their life in a way they have never expected. The in-your-face struggle, after all, defines how the Green Book unfolds.<br/><br/>Or, with all that in mind, we probably demand the moment of singularity. The truth, after all, can be unaffordable, intolerable, and insufferable, and we, as human beings, just don't want to deal with it.<br/><br/>If so, why don't we stream Green Book on Netflix, and make a joke about it?"
"CelluRob","8","0","1","10 December 2019"," A indictment of shocking bigotry tinged with quite a lot of hope and optimism.
","I really enjoyed this story of racism and double-standards that tugged at the very hypocritical heart of 1960s America. An initially hostile Viggo Mortensen is assigned as guide and bodyguard to the hugely talented Don Shirley as he and his quartet tour the still racially divided US Southern states. Mahershala Ali is formidable as the creative, and somewhat aloof musician, who naively sets off on the enterprise not quite prepared for the reactions he is to get - at times he is viewed as little better than a performing seal and is treated accordingly by his ""hosts"". The score is superb and the writing and photography a delight. Was it the best film, though? I sometimes think that much like with ""Moonlight"" and ""Call Me By Your Name"" the Academy is genuflecting to the fact that Hollywood has been so far behind the curve in reflecting the changes in society, that it now feels compelled to pat itself on the back at every opportunity just for catching up with cinema from the rest of the world. This is certainly a better film than the the other two I just mentioned, but will it still be a topic of conversation in five years...?"

","A delicate and precious film, ruthless towards good feelings but hopeful towards racism that comes from ignorance and not from the heart, when in the end human solidarity is still able to redeem men and their sins. It is a film that perhaps we Europeans cannot fully understand (even if racism begins again to meander dangerously between our feet) but I like to think that the choice of an Italian American of the populace as a counterpart to the cultured afro doctor American is not random. After all, among the many ugly figures that the driver does, in the end he is saved because he truly begins to believe in his neighbor, because in the end he makes himself loved, because he begins to understand and participate in the harshness of the battle, because he contrasts and shares a fundamental value, that of the family, which we once had but which we are losing today. Because it is true that in life you have to be what you are (otherwise you generate monsters) but what sense does it have if to crown a successful life, on Christmas Eve we find ourselves alone or worse on the point of death there was no one to greet us with the serenity of an affectionate embrace? Another element common to films that involve some form of catharsis is that of travel, an ancient metaphor for the path of the soul. I sincerely would have given the Oscar to Viggo Mortensen, more and more an actor of thick cast in roles that makes him look easy but that are not easy. And as the protagonist says, it's really a pleasure to see the landscapes that are the backdrop for this trip."

","A tough Italian-American from the streets of the Bronx takes on the job of chauffeuring a talented African-American pianist from the lofts of Carnegie Hall through the Deep South in the early 1960s. While pat and predictable at times, the film tells an engaging story about the growing friendship between the disparate leads. Viggo Mortenson is excellent as 'Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga' (a real-life character straight out of a Scorsese screenplay) although at first the character comes off as a bit stereotypical, but I found Mahershala Ali's 'anti-stereotypical' urbane, polyglot classical pianist Don Shirley somewhat of a caricature at times. I liked the film more than I expected to and while I understand why there was some controversy about its somewhat fairy-tale depiction of understanding and reconciliation, the excellent acting and core story of a growing bond between two men make the film well worth watching."

"Paddy-49","9","0","2","13 October 2019"," Authentic depiction of the North/South, Black/White and educated/not educated divides of the ""Land of the Free""
","The myth that the victory of the Union in the Civil War freed the African-American is punctured in this extraordinary movie which does not duck one issue about the continued post Civil War divisions - even well into the second half of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>The ""Green Book"" is a travel guide which listed the places where negroes were permitted to overnight. Especially in the South. In 1962. A hundred plus years on from Lincoln. As in ""The Heat of the Night"" if you venture south of the Mason-Dixon Line you'll find a foreign country where they do things differently.<br/><br/>Don Shirley, the black pianist, and Tony Lip, the Italian from the Bronx who is his driver, defy the black/white stereotypes. The former is sophisticated, supremely talented, squeamish and refined. But black. The latter is rough, lives from hand to mouth, physical and limited. But white. In Birmingham Alabama Tony can eat in the restaurant and piss in the bathroom. Don has to go down the street to somewhere the black folks eat and piss in a shack in the yard.<br/><br/>That's the essence of the story. Prejudice. Racial divides. Discrimination. Overt and largely unchallenged racism. Even to a genius who lives in a beautiful apartment on the top floor of Carnegie Hall. The ""Boy"" has to telephone Attorney General Bobby Kennedy to get released from jail where an indiscretion of Tony has landed him.<br/><br/>The film is impeccably directed, brilliantly cast and cleverly written. It is fictionalised from the true story of Don and Tony but this is not a documentary. In 2019 in the Age of Trump it is appropriate to revisit the recent past of explicit prejudice ( and worse). America is rotten fro the bottom up - ""Green Book"" tells you why."

","This is a great movie with some magnificent directing; it has some of 2018's best acting, writing and soundtrack. It's well cast, using big names like Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali that does a fantastic job at playing their real life counterparts. The dialogue between the characters are witty and you see the chemistry between everyone, mostly with the two main actors. The world building is just incredible with its sets, music, props and cars. You can so easily immerse into this biography period piece. The comedy is so clever written, beatifully executed by the actors. The funny writing cracked me up almost everytime.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the highlights from Viggo Mortensen, a real talented actor that doesn't let down, ultimately bringing in one of his best performances. Mahershala Ali does the more drama heavy things as his role is much more personal, more important as the character grows in every scene and he portrays the character with perfection. It isn't his best acting performance but it's a memorable one! I'm going to end the review regarding the story, it's a story about two men on a journey in the controversy and sick racism in the 60's. We see them bond and become great friends whilst hearing some superb music, but the best part about the movie is their big road trip and it'll probably be a hit for a lot of people."

","I enjoyed everything about it. The scenario, the characters, filming, directing, everything. The humor was also exceptional. I was absorbed in the movie until the very end.
What's very interesting and special about this film is that it gives a different perspective of racism against Afro-Americans, because it talks about an Afro-American that had a completely different lifestyle. High class, economically successful, always formally dressed, performed music for the Western European people etc. Before watching this movie, I'd rush to the conclusion that he'd be very respected because of his fame and skills, but that was certainly not the case. There was prejudice about him from both sides: light skin colored and dark skin colored people. I had the impression that individuals like Aretha Franklin or Sam Cook wouldn't have to deal with racism that much: but maybe they faced it, just like Don Shirley did. Therefore, this movie presents everything from a very unique angle.
It's a movie I'd definitely recommend, not only for entertainment purposes, but also educational and awareness reasons."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This story portrayed a strange juxtaposition for the 1960s, especially while travelling in the south. A 'colored' man, Don Shirley, is being chauffeured by a 'white' man, Tony Vallelonga, of Italian decent. Even deeper than that is how Don is much more sophisticated and proper than the more casual and brusque Tony. Don hired Tony to drive him to a series of musical gigs. Through the journey they slowly learn to respect each other as well as expand their social views while dealing with the racism of the time in the South, thus both characters have meaningful story arcs. The production quality is rich with a great color pallet which complement the meaty dialog which is told through a straight-forward story. Quality."

So to the viewers, it of course infuses with fury to see how people practiced inhumanity and prejudice, but at the same time with so much joy to notice an endearing friendship was formed and some light of hope was sparkled at the end.<br/><br/>A lot of mutual understanding has been transcended via the culture roots and it progressed to remind everyone again of the same longing for love and acceptance.<br/><br/>It's a true 10 over 10 for both the script writers and the casts.

"junshiwilda","9","0","2","12 June 2019"," 👍 (Oscar 2019 reviews #1) A instant Christmas classic you must have on your Blue Ray shelf.
","Green Book is officially this year's winner of the Best Picture prize in the 90th Academy Awards. When I checked the winners online and saw this, I was very surprised. This movie was relatively less well received compared to the other movies (though it is certified fresh with a 78% on RT) so that might have been part of the surprise, but the biggest surprise was the movie it beat; Roma. Count me in as one of the people who were mad that Roma was snubbed. However, after watching this last night my perspective on this whole movie changed. Now this without question is my favorite among the Best Picture nominees this year.<br/><br/>As many point out, the acting in this movie is fantastic. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have great charisma and chemistry on screen making their characters very likable. It is the type of performance you just can't forget and want to see again. The reason why this can be a feel good movie is because of their performances and how the characters were designed in a way we can care for, so definitely the acting deserved Oscar recognition.The looks of the film in general is very good and as they say in the movie you will be ""knocked out by how beautiful this country is."" As you can assume from the set up with a white driver driving a black pianist to the deep south, this film heavily focuses on segregation. But what this film does really well is it never gets off track. Instead of trying to be politically correct and preach political correctness to the audience, Green Book takes it's segregation to it's advantage to deepen the friendship of out 2 leads. I was very pleased to see a heart warming tale about friendship instead of a # Black Lives Matter propaganda. However, this doesn't mean the movie ignores all the important politics of this modern world. A quote that stoop out to me was the quote by Dr. Shirley ""If I'm not black enough and If I'm not black enough, tell me exactly who am I ?"" In this era where political injection to a certain race is common (eg. if you are black, you need to be liberal), this quote personally reminded me that we should judge people not by race but actually who they are. While not being preachy on political correctness, I think this movie became a important reminder on our modern political climate at the same time. All politics aside this is just a movie that makes you feel so good, and who knew this was a Christmas movie? I am not going to spoil it, but as soon as you finish the movie I can guarantee you will go buy this on blue ray and watch it every Christmas with your family.<br/><br/>As wonderful as this movie is and how much I want to give this a 10/10, there are some issues I need to point out. Though this is not a boring film at all it does some times feel a bit repetitive. The entire second act though it did a very good job building the friendship of the 2 leads felt like a repetition of this: Doc gets in trouble, Tony saves him, Doc teaches him how to write letters. Also the music kind of seemed to be over used a bit too much though the performance scenes were all very good. But the second act is still very good and though it is a bit repetitive you will never get bored. These are very minor issues compared to the positive aspects which definitely out weight the negative.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic movie that will probably be on my blue ray shelf by tomorrow. I think this will be a instant Christmas classic where every family will watch it on Christmas eve as soon as their children turn 13. Though Roma (which I gave a very positive review) might be a better movie if I was to rank all the Best Picture nominees, I think Green Book would hands down be my personal favorite and the one I will re watch the most. I rate it a 9/10 and I suggest you don't just watch it but buy it."

","Green Book is definitely a solid film to watch. I'm still quite surprised that the direction was good coming from one of the Farrelly Bros.; but hey, he proved me wrong. The true heart of the film comes from the relationship of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as it felt so natural, comedic, and quite touching. The story isn't really that original (been there done that, especially when it came to the third act); but it still kept intrigued and the again, friendship angle was gold.

The script was so well done, I don't know if it's because it takes most of it's scenes from a true story or cause the writers knew what they were about. Both actors, Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen did exceptionally well. And I have to give it up for Viggo. I haven't really seen him do any mega project since the Lord of the Rings, so watching him play this Italian ruffian was a delight and an eye opener. The entire movie was well done. The directing impeccable. I loved the pace, the cinematography, the highs and lows and man, there couldn't have been a better ending to this great friendship.

","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"

","I liked Green Book a lot, it is clearly well made and I had a good time watching it. But I felt I've watched this before because it has far too many similarities with ""The Untouchables"", a French film from 2011 that I loved. It is simply the same story but in a different context: two men from opposites worlds that meet each other because of working motivations, that become friends enriching themselves and growing through the film. Also the alternation between the humor and some touching moment is very similar between the two movies. The fact that ""The Untouchables"" was so surprising and great at the time is a clue that even this ""younger cousin"" will be that for the ones who will watch it for the first time. But if you watched both you will probably feel like ""I've already seen it"" at the end of it."

A lighthearted film which manages to touch on a couple of topics without over doing it and will almost definitely have you in tears by the end.

It is about a working-class Italian-American bouncer who becomes the driver of an African-American classical pianist on a tour of venues through the 1960s American South. Viggo Mortensen and Marshershala Ali give fantastic performances. The script is well written. Peter Farrelly did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor and drama. Green Book is a must see."

","It is difficult to make a movie based on a true story, with characters that existed, that has to walk a fine line when it comes to racism, the history of America and not making them too unlikeable, but also finding the middle, so there is still enough tension between the pair we are about to go on a journey with - and overall the movie succeeded.<br/><br/>There are certainly things that did not work or might seem like an omission - Viggos character shows a despise, a darker shade to him at the beginning, that does not really seem to come up later. And then there is the meeting - which is cleverly orchastrated but we never really understand why it continues from there. But not everything needs to be explained. Unless that takes something away from your movie watching experience.<br/><br/>Script is tight and the actors are really getting it on good. And there is still enough drama to go around. You will laugh, you may cry a little (or a lot) and overall you will see a great movie. All cynicism aside, this very well made (did not look into how close this is to what actually happened, you may research that on your own, if you like)"

","The title refers to a travel guide used by African-Americans during the time of segregation to find safe, friendly hotels and restaurants from 1937 to 1966. In 1962, African-American pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) employed Frank Vallelonga, aka ""Tony Lip"" (Viggo Mortensen) to be his driver and bodyguard when his trio, which included George (Mike Hatton) on the upright bass and Oleg (Dimiter D. Marinov) on the cello, toured the American Midwest and South. Shirley suffers many indignities, and, to a certain extent, Tony can shield him. For example, the trio is employed at a country club in Alabama, but Shirley cannot eat in its restaurant so he and Tony find a BBQ restaurant down the road. Other complications are that Shirley is gay and an alcoholic. The two men bond, of course. One of the funnier scenes takes place when Tony serves Shirley friend chicken without utensils, which Shirley initially refuses because he is a fastidious eater. Overall, this is the feel-good movie of the year, although predictable and rather old-fashioned, and the two leads are excellent with able support by Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife. One reviewer described the movie as ""The Odd Couple"" meets ""Driving Miss Daisy"". It was based on a true story, and Tony's son Nick co-wrote the screenplay, which won the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category. Unfortunately, it has been a controversial winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, because many people felt that it oversimplified race relations in the United States and members of Shirley's family have objected to his portrayal."
"summerhartinger","9","0","2","9 May 2019"," Green Book
","Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly and staring Vigo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali, which opened in November 2018, describes the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Vallalonga in the 1960's. In the beginning of the film, viewers watch Dr. Shirley hire Vallelonga to be his chauffer and body guard as he embarks a two month long musical tour as a pianist. Vallelonga, an Italian American man, became Dr. Shirleys chauffeur. Dr.Shirley, an African American, was a wealthy and very sophisticated man. The two men travel around the Midwest and in the deep South, while Shirley preforms music on his piano at many different places and event. As the film progresses, viewers watch the two men develop a friendship and grow closer to each other through cultural and personality differences. Greenbook is a compelling drama because of the tension between Mortenson and Ali, the cinematography, and the music and sound effects.
The tension between Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali and Tony Vallelonga, played by Vigo Mortenson is truly captivating. In a scene at the start of the film, Vallelonga and Shirley meet to interview about the job. Shirley, sitting superior in his throne wearing a white and gold gown develops a tension between him and Tony. It caught Tony off guard because it wasn't very common for an African American man to be wealthy and sophisticated. Vallelonga was middle class, racist, and extremely rough around the edges, so him and Shirley were very different people. In the middle of the film, the men stopped at a place where Vallelonga had secretly stuffed a rock into his pocket, and Shirley forced him to return the stolen rock, but he didn't. This scene indicated that Shirley was starting to figure out who Tony was, but was expecting more out of him. Toward the end of the film, Vallelonga and Shirley grew closer as they started to see through each other's differences. Eating without utensils was not an option for Shirley, however toward the end of the movie he broke through his pride and sophistication and started eating fried chicken with his hands, just like Tony. That showed that they were stating to mingle together and overcome the differences of each other. Tony stands up for Shirley throughout the movie when he is faced with discrimination along their journey. The two men developed a friendship through hard times, but also the good times too.
The cinematographers created a film that is very eye capturing. The lighting, dull and dim, throughout the movie portrayed the time period that the movie was set in. The scenes that were shot in the bars helped to create a shallow mood throughout the story because the bars were dark, smoky, and dingey. The actors wore clothing that really fit the 1960s because the women dressed in dresses and hats, while the men wore suits. The viewers really got to dive in and feel more a part of the story with small details like the old cars. Specific parts in scenes that are shot around the different towns that they went through had old classical cars, and the car that Tony chauffeured Shirley around in was an old car, but classy to them. At the end of the film, there were old photographs showed of the real people that the story was based off. Those photos helped the film become so much more alive than it already was.
The music and sounds effects are a very important part of a movie to make it more realistic. There was good music throughout the film to create moods for certain scenes. During the film, they were all out at a gathering and there was classical upbeat music while there were shots of people having a good time. When there became racial tension between Dr. Shirley and the white crowd, the music changed to a more serious tone, then stopped. The sounds effects help move along parts of the story because without them, the movie wouldn't feel realistic.
The Green Book is a feel-good movie for families to sit down and watch together as Dr. Shirley and Tonys friendship evolved over the film, to observe the cinematography, and to hear the music and sound effects that the editors placed to make the movie realistic. If you are looking for a film that is going to end with a good underlying story, then you should purchase Green Book."

"jeremiahjohnson-cda","7","0","1","9 May 2019"," Green Book: Cover to Cover
","When portraying trust, friendship, or racism in today's hybrid genres that batter the big screen, it can be difficult to lay out the perfect balance of suspense and comedy to set the right tone for any pivotal scene. Written by Nick Vallelonga and directed by Peter Farrelly, Green Book is an amusing drama released in November 2018 that steps up to the plate and delivers a solid feel-good hit for today's family audience.<br/><br/>Set in 1962, the movie tells a story about acceptance, companionship, and racial tension that permeates the Deep South. Playing the role of New Jersey's finest family man, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga, is Viggo Mortenson. He is hired to accompany a virtuoso black piano player, Dr. Don Shirley, played by Mahershala Ali, through a months-long musical odyssey as Dr. Shirley and his trio move from venue to venue across the country, following ""The Green Book"" to find accommodations in the still-segregated Southern states. The tour culminates in a Christmas Eve show in Birmingham, Alabama, before the duo race home in time for the holidays. The chemistry between Tony (Mortenson) and Dr. Shirley (Ali) is unparalleled in capturing their relationship as they travel together across the nation. The plot structure starts slow, but it builds decent momentum as the story takes a few murky attempts to portray the significant racism ever-present in the early '60s. Finally, the top-notch soundtrack, featuring music from the likes of The Blackwells, Timmy Shaw, and Bobby Page, is enough to keep you wrapped up in the rhythm of the moment until the next defining scene.<br/><br/>The strongest asset of this movie comes from the ability of the all-star actors. The chemistry between Viggo and Ali is immersive and quickly becomes the highlight of every scene. The story of Tony Vallelonga begins with a man that is confident in what he knows about the world and the way it works for him. He uses his deviant skills to get favors and anything else he might need to get by. In the scene where Tony first meets Dr. Shirley, he is seated on a throne in a room of elegant taste. It quickly becomes apparent how uncomfortable Tony is at the initial idea of working for an educated, wealthy black man like Dr. Shirley. At the first venue they attend together, Dr. Shirley reveals a similar sentiment when he tells Tony that his speaking skills are unrefined and advises him to stay quiet and shorten his last name. Dr. Shirley then offers an olive branch during the scene, giving Tony spending money for incidentals and whatever else he might need. However, as they travel together, Tony still shows a misguided level of suspicion towards Shirley when he comes back to the car to get his wallet off the dash. As he walks away, his emotions show that even he understands how unnecessary his actions were. Through the movie, they grow a closer friendship with one another as they stick together through difficult times. When they first arrive in Tennessee, Tony is offered a job by some acquaintances from New York. Unaware that Shirley understands what they are saying, he agrees to meet with them. Dr. Shirley later confronts Tony about this, offering him more money and a promotion to road manager if he will stay. He declines the extra money and reveals he had no intention of leaving, showing a level of new-found appreciation for the trust and friendship that has grown between them.<br/><br/>The biggest setback for this movie is the depth of the story. There are gray areas that leave the viewer wanting more. The PG-13 rating shows that the true issues of equality and segregation are not explored to a great depth. The plot feels shallow, and the character's motives are often unrefined. Dr. Shirley's unique personality is often manipulated into whatever role is necessary to appeal to a middle-class white audience, making it feel forced. In the scene where the duo cross into Kentucky, we get a brief glimpse of Don Shirley's troubled past and his tangled relationship with his family as he reveals a few sparse details about his failed marriage and his estranged brother. But once the attitude of the movie shifts, so does the character's motivations. We don't hear about his backstory again until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is rife with Motown, blues, and classical music that hit all the right notes in all the right places. Swinging at the Copacabana, waltzing with masterful composers, and getting down on the gritty blues of the South all play a critical role and pull the audience right into the '60s. During the bar scene at the Orange Bird, Dr. Shirley finally drops his misconceptions about popular music of the time. He is then immediately able to connect with the people around him thanks to the music and emotion that brings them all together. By changing the notes he plays, Don Shirley finally realizes he isn't just some outcast. Instead, he has been distancing himself from people that will accept him for who he is.<br/><br/>Even with a few bumps in the road, Green Book drives home a 7/10. It's an agreeable feel-good movie that tries to look past the heavier context and focus on moving forward through relationships and self-acceptance found in each character. The story is delivered with some exceptional cinematography and unforgettable chemistry. However, the fact that it won Best Picture in 2018 over more original movies is not something I would expect, as the story did not leave a lasting impression like other nominees in the category. While it doesn't offer up any real solutions for racial equality, Green Book still fits the bill for a solid family night movie. It's a story that is sure to entertain, even if it is just to sit back, smile, and watch an astounding performance of two grown men throwing chicken bones out of a moving car together."

","Green Book is one of the best road movies in a long while. We have seen a lot of films that deal with ""the Afro-American experience"" in the last decade, some of which have been highlighted by various awards. But Green Book goes beyond them, because it covers the diasporic standpoint not just from an Afro-American perspective, but also suggests that white Americans have a cast system between them as well. As we see in the film, Italian-American, as opposed to Irish-American, British- American or German-American, is the black of the white race. This is where the chemistry between Tony Lip and Doc Shirley is formed; Shirley is a black man who lives by the white standards and cultural values, but as we see later; he has been through a lot, he has experienced what being Afro-American means in this country, although buried deep; he still knows his roots. But he has ""whitened"" himself to fit the society; and in Tony Lip, he sees himself, and Italian-American, not much different than himself, the only difference is, Tony does not care to hide his true identity and Shirley learns from him throughout the film.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen and Marshala Ali have a chemistry beyond words. They brilliantly convey the brotherhoodly bond between the characters to the audience.<br/><br/>Except for a few minor plotholes, this film is amazing."

"browniesnack57","10","0","2","21 April 2019"," Dear Critics Of This Motion Picture
","Green Book is an absolutely beautiful film. It shows tolerance, acceptance and friendship, against all odds, despite all the arguing the main characters are doing. The purest kind of friendship, the unconditional, natural and semi-confrontational. Tony and Don's friendship happens purely out of circumstance, the fact that they are driving many miles on the road together, from state to state. I have heard that this film has gotten a lot of critique, and I'm not sure why. I presume people think it overshadows the deep problems of segregation by having it be a signle man, a musician, who is less affected than most other African-Americans in the deep south at the time. Frankly, I disagree with this complaint. The Jim Crow days of US History spanned not one, but TWO decades, and were wildly complex, I mean, if it wasn't, JFK would have been able to do a lot more than he did. And that's why I don't blame him, nor do I blame this movie. It's impossible to make a heartfelt movie about race and not miss details some people find crucial. I think, to truly enjoy movies like this, one shouldn't nitpick these films, but look at it in regards to the big picture. This movie is instrumental in bringing awareness, as there very well might be people who think like Tony, narrow-minded, but not with the intention of supressing or hurting non-whites. Simply because they don't quite get it. Here, one can get educated through seeing Tony taught lessons as well. All in all, this a wonderful, family friendly, hilarious film with huge societal impact. Recommended for everyone."

","In hindsight, the character setting of this film is immediately reminiscent of Les Intouchables, but with positions inverted, namely the black man being the one solicits the service and the white man offering it.<br/><br/>Set against the background of 60s in USA, the film approached the racism subject with a different touch. At the beginning of the flick, the Italian-American, working as a bouncer in a night club, was never to think that he would be working for a colored man. As when some repairers of African origin came to his house, his wife called the whole family there in order to guard against the unexpected.<br/><br/>His employer, however, offered a quite handsome recompense and even gave a call to his wife to acquire her consent. After setting off for the south, soon the two have had opportunities to get familiar with each other through hours of highway conversation. Trying to help the Italian get rid of his cheesy habits, the pianist meanwhile was endeavoring to persuade him into pursuing a different way of life. Nonetheless, as the film unfolds, many complicated aspects of this sophisticated pianist are to be revealed.<br/><br/>Brought up in the environment of high culture, the pianist is certainly with a distinct personality from most of his fellow compatriots. On the other hand, he is also alienated by the mainstream Americans because of his complexion, only with the exception when he is performing on the stage. In want of recognition and companion, the inner self of the pianist actually lived in agony, as was proved by his bursting into roaring confession to his driver while they were rushing through the rainy night.<br/><br/>At the end of their journey, the pianist finally stood up for himself by turning down the request of the restaurant where only the white people folks be served. They ducked into a roadside bar and drank with local colored community. Previously in despise of popular music, the pianist even willingly condescended to play for the not-so-educated crowd. The applause that he won from his fellow people is the sign of recognition that he had so long been desiring for.<br/><br/>The film has a quite heart-warming ending, where the pianist drove in the place of the fatigued driver and managed to get back to New York at Christmas Eve. The pianist received the invitation and came to greet the Italian's family. As it turned out, the wife had always been aware of the participation of a ghostwriter, but who would care? The friendship of the duo from different race and social class finally melted down the barriers, and made each one of them benefit and grow from the experience. We would be surprised to find that pianist, who was supposed to be the educator among the two, has also gained more spiritual maturity through their relations. In the end, nurture and nature have reached their best reconciliation."

","Based on a true story: In 1962, Tony ""Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) lives in an Italian neighbourhood in the Bronx and works as a nightclub bouncer. During a period of temporary unemployment, he signs on to work for renowned classical/jazz pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as a chauffeur as Shirley travels from his Manhattan home to locations in the US mid-west and Deep South for an arranged concert tour. As Shirley is African-American and the Deep South had segregation laws at the time, great difficulties are faced and the two men bond.<br/><br/>The initial clashes between these two opposites is funny, moving, and genuine. The differences in advantage also make for an interesting dynamic. Tony has the advantage of race which is not only magnified while in the southern states; it also shows in his foolish assumptions he has about Don and black people in general. Don has the advantage of status, culture, and education which he often uses to criticize Tony in ways that make Don easily seem like an annoying teacher.<br/><br/>The two lead performances are brilliant especially during a confrontation scene that takes place during a rainy night. Mortensen is raw and rough but with a human edge that shifts during an experience that is radically new to him. And Ali is exceptional in one of the best characterizations in many years.<br/><br/>As Don, Ali begins by being truly irritating with his snobbishness and class prejudice. As the film progresses, the viewer at least begins to understand Don and even sympathize with him as his complexities are gradually exposed. And by the end, Don is not just likeable; he's downright loveable.<br/><br/>In ""Moonlight"" (2016), Ali showed depth and subtlety in a role that was unfortunately too short. In ""Green Book"", his talents are on full display in an expanded role that shows his best. Again, his depth of subtlety comes through particularly in a scene when Don is vulnerable as he thinks he might lose Tony as his driver.<br/><br/>Director Peter Farrelly, also a co-writer, shows a subtle touch especially in a scene that silently show southern blacks reacting to the presence of a fellow African-American who seems to have reached heights that may have thought impossible.<br/><br/>A shocking scene that takes place at a YMCA building is one that could have been expanded but the secrecy behind it is actually appropriate given the time period.<br/><br/>With so much going for it, ""Green Book"" carries the torch right to the end with a superb conclusion that is emotional but with the restraint that matches Don's character so well. It allows the tears to get close to the surface but without exiting the ducts. And Tony's wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) eases the the tension with a hilarious line - one of many in this great film. - dbamateurcritic<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:<br/><br/>1) Screenplay by Peter Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga, and Brian Hayes Currie<br/><br/>2) Acting by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen"

But someone might have left the mystery of a country on its slow journey to decency. That would have maintained the lump in my throat. It was still worth seeing."

","I really have nothing but praise for the Green Book.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Mortenson and Ali nailed all the nuances of their characters. The development of their friendship is at the heart of this movie and without their efforts this movie couldn't be this great.<br/><br/>The transitions of scenes are also perfect. Every scene moves the plot forward and feels genuine. Keeping momentum is very difficult. I think why it worked is that they kept the storytelling simple but not too simple to the point of boredom. And also not too ambitious to the point you'll lose interest because it gets convoluted.<br/><br/>The scenery was beautiful. The 1960s is visually stunning to see and also compounded to the surreal feel when underneath that beauty lies the ugliness of racism.<br/><br/>To me it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

","I've been truly disappointed in the Oscars over the past few years. It seems that movies winning the biggest prizes have always disappointed me, not being movies that I thought were worthwhile but instead movies that were politically correct. This took away the luster that the Oscars had possessed for decades of being movies that were the cream of the crop, the best movies made in any given year. So imagine my surprise to find that this year they chose the right movie when choosing GREEN BOOK as best picture.<br/><br/>The story, based on real life, follows Frank ""Tony the Lip"" Vallenlonga (Vigo Mortenson) a Brooklyn man striving to make a living to support his family in 1962. Currently Frank works as a bouncer at the Copacabana but the club is shutting down for a few weeks and he's in need of work. A friend tells him he heard about a potential job driving a doctor around for a few weeks. With nothing to lose he gets the address and goes to check out the job.<br/><br/>But the doctor is no physician. Instead he is Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a doctor of music and acclaimed classical piano maestro. What he is looking for is someone to drive him on an 8 week concert tour of the Midwest and deep South, someone who can handle himself if the need arises while on tour. At first unsure if they are compatible or not with Frank being basically an uneducated thug and Shirley being a cultured musician, they agree to terms and Frank is on board. Before taking off the record company provides him half of his fee as well as the Green Book, a book listing hotels and places to eat that will accept blacks.<br/><br/>The trip doesn't begin well with Shirley finding Frank to be uncouth and intolerable to his refined ways. For Frank it's just a job and he's willing to put up with the attitude he gets from Shirley along the way. With each passing mile we learn more about each man though. In Frank's case while his background has led him to think less of blacks he still has an appreciation for many of them. This is shown as they drive and he plays popular music by Chubby Checker and Little Richard which Shirley seems to not know or perhaps not care for.<br/><br/>The stops along the way aren't bad at first but there is still a different treatment to be found for Shirley than there is for the other two white members of his trio and Frank. Frank is stunned at one hotel which the Green Book lists as a wonderful place but turns out to be closer to a low level motel. But it isn't just the places that display the prejudice found in the locations but the prejudice that both men possess as well.<br/><br/>Thrilled when they are in Kentucky to find a Kentucky Fried Chicken joint Frank stops and buys a bucket but Shirley refuses to eat saying eating with his hands just isn't right. Frank threatens to toss a piece in the back seat with him and eventually Shirley takes a piece and begins eating. He's had no experience with fried chicken which Frank can't believe because ""his people"" all love fried chicken and collard greens. Shirley takes offense to this and after a short argument Frank realizes maybe he doesn't know what being black is all about after all. But Shirley has his own set of prejudices as well. His snobbish ways get to Frank and the two go back and forth as they're on the road. And as the trip progresses they both come to learn about one another.<br/><br/>When the pair begin to move through the South is when bigger issues come to play. As they have traveled Frank has come to appreciate the skill and genius that Shirley displays while performing. He also begins to notice that the people that Shirley performs for might appreciate his skill but not the man. He is refused restrooms, dressing rooms and eventually even a meal in the main restaurant. Where Frank can't understand why he would be treated this way, Shirley knows where it stems from. But can these two men get past all of that?<br/><br/>The movie works on so many levels and never becomes dull. I test a movie on my remote: do I want to fast forward or not? I never felt the need to hold the remote the entire picture. The script is amazing (and an Oscar winner too), the direction is perfect and the acting by both men in the leads is amazing to watch (Ali also won an Oscar for supporting actor).<br/><br/>Perhaps best of all is that we have a movie discussing the history of race relations in this country as they were in the sixties but we don't have that excess amount of violence or required Klan rally to sit through. While these things occurred the story isn't about those things but about how two men can conquer the so called norms of the time and become friends. It shows that such things are indeed possible. That's a story that needs to be told in today's world."

","In the early 1960s, voracious, uncouth Italian-American bouncer and family man Tony Vallelonga is employed at the Copacabana nightclub in the Bronx. In need of employment while the club is under renovation, he reluctantly takes a job to work for Dr. Don Shirley, a cultured, genteel black man and musician in need of a driver while he embarks on a concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Of course the obvious question is: can this unmistakable odd couple co-exist long enough to get the job done? Inspired by a true story this delivers many expected and familiar themes like racism, dignity, and friendship, and while the comparisons with Driving Miss Daisy are simply unavoidable, it features some snazzy musical numbers, a good central theme, and is highlighted by the performances of Mortensen and Ali who play so well off one another. ***"

","Ali and Viggo Mortensen, bring to screen a chemistry that is poignant and rousing. Yet, for a film that underscores the ability of American racism to permeate the length and breadth of public consciousness, Green Book gives an inexplicable viewpoint of racism. Much of the movie's commentary on racism is designed in the past tense and even the condemnation comes with a straightforward solution. As if implying, that racism is one of those problems that once existed and is now eradicated. Even Tony's bigotry, is shrouded in layers of sympathy - the kind displayed by well-meaning, but eventually racist, friends and family. It's this superficial self-congratulatory cliched tone threatening to undo the bonding of the odd-couple pairing for much of the film's two-hour runtime. Overall a great adaptation of a true story."

"gradyharp","8","0","2","16 March 2019"," 'You never win with violence. You only win when you maintain your dignity.'
","Director Peter Farrelly co-wrote with Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga, brother of the main character, this true story adaptation for film. It succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is a reflection on the racism of the 1960s era as a too close comparison for the current status of prejudice. It is a powerful movie that makes its point simply and strongly, largely due to the very fine performances By Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali.<br/><br/>Briefly, the story takes place in 1962 when Tony ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), a tough bouncer at the Copa, is looking for work when his nightclub is closed for renovations. The most promising offer for employment is to be the driver for the African-American classical/jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin the concert tour armed with The Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. They are accompanied in a following car by the other two members of the Don Shirley Trio (Dimiter B. Marinov and Mike Hatton). Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.<br/><br/>One reason the film works so well is the use of bipartite examination of the response of each man to the stat us of the other: Don Shirley gains respect for the importance of family milieu (especially the Italian-American version) as Tony learns by direct observation the African American plight in a world of prejudice. Of note, a post-script after the film reveals that in real life, Tony became the maitre'D of the Copa, and Dr. Shirley continued being successful in music. They remained friends for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Both Ali and Mortensen provide outstanding performances and head a cast that is consistently of high caliber. This is a powerful film with a very important message. Recommended."

","If I was not white enough. If I was not black enough, tell me who I am!.
This sentence that comes in the middle of the film almost embodies the content of the entire film.
I was reluctant to watch this film first, because the American director Peter Farrelly, one of the directors specialized in the manufacture of light comedy. There is an implicit fear of a distinguished director in the humor industry that would be able to make a biographical, dramatic film. But what I saw was truly amazing. Farley has outdone himself here.
For the first time, I see a highly professional film dealing with a recurring issue in American cinema, the issue of racism that America had more than 50 years ago. A very clever dramatic adaptation of the famous pianist Donald Shirley and his relationship with his white driver Tony Lip, who in turn had a somewhat racist view of black, but who, as a result of his need to work, agreed to become a driver for Shirley.
On a long journey towards the southern cities, Shirley plays for the white class, when it feels the importance of its culture when it listens to a genius. the story of the different style begins between the two people in a very sophisticated manner, especially from Mahershala as Shirley.
Interesting dialogues, cultural backgrounds, and dramatic development by influencing the other. Explains the racist concepts of circulation."

"cruise01","9","0","3","16 March 2019"," A fun emotional journey of two people going on a road trip.
","Green Book (4.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Green Book is a really well done biographical comedy drama film about a true story of a Jamaican classical jazz pianist and his personal driver going on a road trip tour to some of the rough parts of the country during the time of racial segregation. It is a good story. Almost like a road trip buddy comedy. With two opposite people. The jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is a high class Jamaican American and has a condo of many expensive furniture and antiques. The bouncer/driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is an Italian American and struggling to make money to support his family. He is a loud foul mouth, blunt, a chain smoker, and eats a lot. He even put himself in a bet in an eating competition to make some money.<br/><br/>The plot follows Tony when he loses his job in a night club cause of renovation. He gets an interview from Dr. Don Shirley. Tony is a bit of a racist. When he sees two African Americans doing some plumbing work in his apartment and his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) serves them a drink. After they set their glasses in the sink. Tony grabs the glasses and throws them out in the trash. When Shirley recruits Tony to be his driver for this music tour. Which would set him away from his family for two months. Tony and Shirley will have a lot to go over about each other. Shirley is proper and mannered. Tony is the complete opposite.<br/><br/>It is one of those heartfelt stories. Yes, it does have some difficult scenes to watch during the racial segregation when Don Shirley gets denied to use the whites bathroom or eat in a public restaurant with the rest of the people. Or when he is given a closet of a room to get ready for the concert. Sure, Tony does not take that likely and react poorly by knocking whoever is rude to the guy out. There is some character development with Tony and Don becoming friends throughout the movie and are able to tolerate each other. Don trying fast food restaurants with Tony. It is fun to see Tony and Don react to each other on screen. From being the people who can not stand one or another to being close friends throughout the road trip journey.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was great playing Tony. With the gaining weight for the role and an Italian accent. Mahershala Ali was also great playing Don Shirley who is prim and proper with his mannerisms. Linda Cardellini playing Tony's loving wife, who is set more aside on the screen time. Waiting at home and writing to her husband.<br/><br/>Overall, Green Book is a really good film. It does have a heartfelt emotional true story about Tony and Don Shirley. It does have some fun humor that will make you laugh and some tough emotional moments. The performances are great."

","This is based upon true events<br/><br/>In 1962 in New York, due to the Copa Cabana closing for renovations, club Bouncer, Tony Lip (Mortensen) needs a job and takes one driving Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) a snobbish person, but also a genius pianist to concerts in the deep south.<br/><br/>Tony is given the Green Book which is called The Negro Motorist Green Book, which tells Blacks traveling in the south the safe places to eat and rest.<br/><br/>This is a movie that we will see attitudes and prejudices change and it won't be easy for both Tony and Dr. Shirley. We will see Dr. Shirley try to cultivate Tony as best he can and that is an uphill battle, but Tony rolls with the punches. It's not at all quite obvious, but changes are happening within Dr. Shirley, too.<br/><br/>It is definitely the script banter that wins in here. It is honest and often very funny. At one point Tony tells Dr Shirley that he, Tony, is more black than he is because he (Dr. Shirley) knows nothing of the current black music, has never eaten fried chicken and really doesn't know how the blacks live and he sits on his throne looking down on everyone. And to be sure, Dr. Shirley has a good rebuttal for all this.<br/><br/>Notable: Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife.<br/><br/>We also see troubles along the way and most times Tony handles all. One time Dr. Shirley gets them out of trouble and he admits to calling someone in Washington DC and that person called Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States to help and he did.<br/><br/>The banter between Tony and Dr. Shirley is pure gold and this keeps us engaged and hoping for the best.<br/><br/>Near the end I kept hoping that the family dinner at Tony's would encounter one more knock on their door. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a MUST SEE. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Stay tuned before the credits run for pictures of the real Tony and Dr. Shirley and statements of how Tony and Dr. Shirley ended up. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No.

"12_Monkeys","10","0","3","13 March 2019"," A great film in its entierty
","Forget about analyzing a film in sections, talking about its cinematography or the production design, or the choices the director made to work with actors that may or may not have acted before. 2018 was cluttered with talks about films that pure and simply did not have compelling stories but somehow made it to the festival headlines. Thankfully, this was NOT this type of film. The fact that Green Book is able to cohesively tell a heart-warming tale of two men from different ethnicities who become friends in the early sixties USA, and somehow get the attention of even the most cynical of centennials, is an unbelievable achievement in itself. Add the fact that the script was inspired by true events, written by Frank Vallelonga's son, and that the director of ""There's Something About Mary"" was the astonishingly best choice to take this ship to sale, and you got something special. The film is funny, witty, controversial, and simply put: beautiful. And how about that Viggo Mortensen? The guy can go from Sigmund Freud to a hippie living in the wilderness to an Italian garbage truck driver in a split second, and you believe every word that comes out of his mouth. He deserved the Oscar for this in my book."

","Let me try to explain.<br/><br/>This is a difficult subject to handle. One of the most difficult ones in our time. But In my opinion the film was too one dimensional while handling the other main character and rather too cheeky at couple of times.<br/><br/>For example, from the beginning Tony Lip was portrayed as a person with prejudices. But as soon as he started to work with Doc Shirley he was nothing but a good person with good deeds. Change was too rapid and unrealistic. In my opinion they should have let Tony Lip be more edgy with the prejudices he had at least a little longer.<br/><br/>The christmas scene in the end was so sweet and predictable that they shoud have let it out, even if it did happen in the real life. It was so cheeky that it made me puke pink marshmallows.<br/><br/>But, like I said In the beginning I have mixed feelings with all of this. I realize that with this time and age we need cheekiness and pink marshmallows. This movie has a great story, actors are superb and it made me laugh many times.<br/><br/>Still, I am not sure which is the best way to deliver Doc Shirley's message.<br/><br/>Time will tell."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>It is easy to see why ""Green Book"" won three awards at the Academy including Best Picture for the year 2018 - and it had some stiff competition too.

Among them is one of the Nightclub's bouncers, ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga.

Viggo Mortensen a working-class Italian-American bouncer cum Driver is outstanding. We liked him so much that we believe he should probably have won Best Actor. But yeah Rami Malek has gone through several transformations and literally lived Freddie Mercury on screen so no complains. Mahershala Ali as an African-American classical pianist is so convincing, you feel as if this role was meant for only him. No wonder he won his 2nd Oscar this year.<br/><br/>The screenplay is apt. The 2 hours plus run time felt gone without realizing. The friendship that these two main characters develop on the journey is such a joy to watch.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","4","27 February 2019"," A good film overall with 2 or 3 great moments and references even, a pretty good watch when it is not too desperately trying to make a statement on race relations
","""Green Book"" is an American movie from 2018 and one of the big players this awards season. So it surprises me a bit that with all the attention it racked up, this film ""only"" managed five Oscar nominations. Still, it may still be in second position for the Best Picture win (behind Roma) after its massive success at the Golden Globes. And it has Mahershala Ali pretty much safe winning his second Oscar (who'd have thought five years ago) while also being more than an underdog to add another for its screenplay. The man in charge there when it came to adapting this over 2-hour movie was Peter Farrelly and he is also the director. Among others, Farrelly got help with the script from Nick Vallelonga and if you paid only a bit attention during the movie, then you will recognize immediately the last name. Yep he is Tony Lip's son and it is pretty fitting that not just his father appeared in several mob-related movies that are deemed classics today. Anyway, lets not talk about these now, but about this one here. Who would have guessed that the director of Something about Mary and Dumb & Dumber would come up with a movie like this. Actually, if you take a closer look, it is not a huge surprise because the critical reception here has not been as one-sided as you may guess. The subject sure comes in handy for Hollywood these days with the diversity issue still going strong, probably not as strong as at its peak, but still. Yes sometimes, it may seem a bit shallow honestly and I would not put the film anywhere near my favorites of the year, but there are also many good aspects. First of all, it flew by and for a film considerably over 2 hours, that is always a success. Then there's the acting. Everybody really does a good job here and that includes most of all lead actors Mortensen and Ali. Yes, lead actors. There is no way Mahershala Ali is a supporting player. What a ridiculous idea. No story without him, no journey throughout the States, no messages about racism. The film would not have existed without him just like it would not have existed without Mortensen's character. Actually, this is a pretty poor decision and going strongly against everything the film teaches us by putting the Black character in second row and it is even more disappointing to see the Academy really falling for it, most of all because of the character's background and story, but also because of the massive screen time honestly.<br/><br/>Okay, what else was good? Individual scenes. You will recognize them when you see them. One would be when the two recognize immediately how their humor is really different early on. I am talking about the salt joke and the Pittsburgh boobies joke here. One of many fairly funny moments too that are not lacking despite the serious background like everything about the letters. Another would be whom the Black protagonist calls from jail and how Mortensen's character is completely stunned. This is a scene that while it works nicely from the comedy perspective is also fairly crucial drama-wise as Ali explains in the car. Another entertaining scene was the KFC one when we really see the two bonding and joking for the first time. It is also a good scene with a look at perhaps the most intriguing issue of this movie: namely Ali's character being too white for his own and too black for the high society that enjoys his music. He is scared of doing what Black people do. He knows less about Black music than his Italian lower class driver and he eats no food that Blacks usually eat. Instead he drinks a fine wine on his own. To avoid having to play a ballgame with other Blacks, he lies he has a meeting with someone and leaves. He sure belongs nowhere and this story line is where the film really delivers. And opposing who Ali's character is and isn't, there is Mortensen, who faces a very slightly similar fate with being part of the dominating race, but really just at the bottom end of the food chain beating people up for money and making ends meet. He is a simple guy, but a good guy in fact. Do not mistake the fact of what he throws away early on because it was used by Blacks for him being a racist. It is more the general movement that made him do so, what society was like in the 60s back then and also what his buddies were like and these sure do include a handful racists. Had he been really racist, he would not have accepted the job as a driver. The fact that he refuses to clean his boss' shoes has not anything to do with racism either, just with him not wanting to be humiliated in any way. This also becomes obvious in the luggage packing scene where he won't be anybody's servant or butler, just the driver and man who solves problems his very own way. Now as for the police, they sure don't get away in a likable manner here and the final police officer scene with the one not minding the man's color during Christmas time cannot really save it and feels for the sake of it. But good inclusions nonetheless, even if the scene at the indoor swimming pool was not the best, actually the worst probably. An indicator at homosexuality that I don't mind, but it really did feel rushed in and there are no further elaborations. On the contrary, we find out he was married before, so was this one reason why it failed? It is not too important eventually and should have been left out in my opinion. Of course, another good aspect here is that the film is really linked to actually existing people that did share a lifelong friendship following their journey together as we find out right before the closing credits roll in. Overall, a good and interesting movie with a right now obviously very appealing subject to liberal Hollywood. I think this one's worth watching for the two lead performances alone and the pretty nice chemistry they had and who would have thought Mortensen can pull off Italian this well. I don't think many actors would have been as good and gotten the Oscar nomination here being next to a far showier and baitier character (Ali's), but proves again that Mortensen is probably still the number one actor from Scandinavia (well he's American, but has roots there) in 2020, even if I personally like Mikkelsen at least as much. Drifting away now from this film, so it is time to end this review. I give Green Book the expected thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Not an overly enthusiastic one though."
"cricketbat","8","0","2","27 February 2019"," Best film? Debatable. Good movie? Definitely.
","Green Book is anchored in two wonderful performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. Their characters are complex and nuanced and it's the relationship between these two characters that keeps you engaged. It's also interesting to see Peter Farrelly direct something that isn't as goofy as his previous movies. This story felt unique and was able to address the subject of racism in a way that didn't feel cliched or cartoonish. Is it the best film of 2018? That's debatable. But it's definitely enjoyable."
"banuyagmurlu","9","0","1","26 February 2019"," A good movie with an impact
","I loved the movie and enjoyed every minute of it. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were both incredible to watch. Ali had a better performance comparing to his other Oscar win and seemed like he really earned it this time. Viggo's only misfortune was Rami Malek being his rival. Otherwise his acting was also Oscarworthy. I can't come up with any downside to say about the movie but I have for the Oscar win as the best picture of the year. It appears to me that an other cliche took place and a movie about race discrimination and homosexuality took the Oscar home. Maybe Green Book is the best of the best among the other movies emphasizing on similar messages, but this award will always be a shade on it as some may wonder whether it got the Oscar because it was really good or because it was an other black/gay movie. It is a pitty because this time I really watched a good one. Bohemian Rhapsody was better though (according to me of course), but who can win against these two golden tickets that never fail in the eyes of the academy, right?"
"Waiyan-1999","8","0","1","25 February 2019"," Sure thing that I still won't pick this as Oscar Best Picture but it is a good movie and real crowd-pleaser
","Set in 1962, when an racist Italian nightclub bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), who is searching for a new job because the place he worked is shut down a while for preservation. When he got into a bit of a financial problem he had to take a job as the position of chauffeur for black musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who is gonna do a tour through deep south. While on the road the two developed unlikely friendship and all these barrier between them came down<br/><br/>It said it is inspired by the true story but just watching at the story alone, you could tell that it is dramatized a lot.
Central piece of Green Book is Racism and it also talked about difference between race, class and about unlikely friendship but I don't feel the later part was truly evolved in the film.
Also one my biggest problem is Tony character development, he went from the man who dumped the glass used by two colored people to having a family dinner together with black man but it is not convincing and felt handled a bit rough.
But script address all the other things really well.
This got a lot of comedic moments and I loved them but when it tried to be serious, it is does turned into it and really engaging. I am aware of stereotyping problems here but I would say my certain enjoyment feeling took over all these things but it certainly got a problem<br/><br/>Talking about two leads, both Viggo and Mahershala Ali did fantastic job, they got their respective nomination deservingly.
Viggo played quite the same role we seen him in his previous film like Eastern Promises and A History of Violence, a family man and a tough guy but this one got more humorous characteristic and hugh load of appetite for food.
Mahershala Ali got more dramatic moments to show his talent and his shone in all those moments. As performance wise Ali is more outstanding than Viggo here<br/><br/>For everyone who is a sucker for sentimental movies, Green Book will surely work even if it not it will still entertain you.
Not even in a single tiny bit two are related but final part of the film reminded me of John Hughes Planes, Trains and Automobiles that kind of heartfel feeling is not something you can easily find in movies these days"
"saptesh786","8","0","2","22 February 2019"," Friendship of Black and White !
","Seen must talked movie 'The Green Book'. Thinking that it would be a good movie. And to my wonder it is indeed a good movie. Based on a true story which is very simple not any twists or a single unbelievable situation. It is a saga of black and white human's friendship which grows from bottom to high sky. They give and takes interchange their native qualities. First part of the movie is not so impressive but when end is coming over then we realise the value of what we are seeing on the screen. Ending is very fascinating where 'Doc' comes Tony's house and meets them especially with Tony's wife.
As me this is the most emotional scene of the movie and other word it is highlight of the movie. Acting from Viggo Mortensen ( Tony ), Mahershala Ali ( Dr. Shirley) and Linda Cardellini ( Dolores ) are brilliant performance. Atmosphere of 18th century is created very well. Last credit gives you photo of real personalities of this story definitely will connect to the movie after ending too.

"mitsubishizero","9","0","1","20 February 2019"," Great Movie!
","This story has been done to death with movies such as ""The Help"" and ""Race"" but what pulls it through are the Characters and the sense of humor employed. Viggo Mortenson and Mahershala Ali and Linda Cardellini are great in this movie. Their chemistry is believable and it's great to see how they play off eachother. They're the yin and yang to eachother in both background, mannerisms and class. Viggo plays a working class italian-american bouncer named Frank ""Tony Lip"" Vallelonga who reluctantly agrees to chauffeur a classical pianist named Dr. Don Shirley on his tour in the south during the 60's to make some side money. Along the way they both deal with injustices around the country and in the process begin to see eye to eye and develop a mutual respect for eachother.<br/><br/>While successful, Shirley's also a victim of his own fame as his marriage failed due to his lifestyle and the isolation he feels from by both sides of society and his driver Tony doesn't care what people think about him and as such comes off as a sloppy thug to others. While they have biases of eachother they slowly began to lesson after sharing experiences of prejudice themselves. Probably a good example is when they get arrested by 2 racist cops after getting pulled over for driving past a sundown town which leads to Viggo punching one of the cops for insulting him.<br/><br/>As they soldier on, Viggo writes daily to his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and with the help of Shirley his penmanship improves and leaves his wife touched. The reason I gave this movie 9/10 stars is because like I said earlier this story's been done before and while they're usually good the story's basically the same: The black character needs a white person to help them get by. However, the acting is what pulls it through and makes it a great movie. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself."

","Two different heroes influence each other. In the end they get better. The film is filled with humor and rich history. The film says that there is always a choice, regardless of the rules and standards of society. Awesome performance of roles, great compatibility of Viggo and Mahershala."
"jtindahouse","8","0","1","4 February 2019"," Chemistry makes the film
","'Green Book' is a film that had it not been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards I would probably never have gotten around to seeing. And yet I'm so glad that it was nominated because otherwise I would never have gotten to experience such a great film. This is based off a true story and clearly glamoured up to make a worthy movie out of a simple concept. The chemistry between the two main actors is simply phenomenal and makes this film what it is.<br/><br/>Consequently both Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have been nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Both are fully deserving. Both are almost unrecognisable at times because they lose themselves in their characters so deeply. I have a hard time imagining Mortensen winning, only because the field is so incredibly strong this year. He keeps churning out brilliantly performances every year though and he will get the Oscar he deserves one day. Ali on the other hand I can very much see winning. He had a tremendous amount of screen time for a ""Supporting Actor"". Combine that with the fact that he was genuinely brilliant and I think you could almost call him a lock.<br/><br/>The film ticks all the boxes for an Oscar movie but I can't see it getting the win for Best Picture, simply because it failed to deliver the knock-out blow. It's consistently charming, genuinely funny, has a beautiful message about acceptance and pushing boundaries, is well acted, well directed and expertly written - and yet I still couldn't help feeling it was missing something. It never had that killer blow moment that knocked me off my feet. I wanted more from the ending (and yes I know it was based on a true story which limits their ability). This is a brilliant movie that just couldn't quite put the cherry on top."
"phd_travel","10","0","2","24 January 2019"," The best movie about racial prejudice in a long time
","The best thing about this movie is the characters in it. Ali portrays a classically trained jazz musician and highlights the dilemma of the highly educated and cultured Black man of his time. Viggo with weight gain and all is amazingly authentic as the good hearted hot tempered Italian American driver. There are some laugh out loud funny parts like the letter writing and fried chicken. The humorous tone and approach of the movie is what sets it apart from other race relation movies. That doesn't mean that it glosses over the discrimination at the heart of the movie. Even if you think you have seen enough of white people behaving badly in the South the incidents portrayed really cause the most righteous indignation in anyone watching. Very illuminating is the difference between the cops in the North and South.<br/><br/>This is the best movie of the year."

"darkreignn","9","0","1","1 December 2018"," A fun, feel good film
","Let's be honest: the trailer for this film made it look like a typical, Oscar-baiting, end of the year awards contender, and in a way it is. We can't deny it - the Oscars love their films about racists turning from their prejudiced ways, and about people struggling through the atrocities of racism and bigotry, and this trailer just looked like more of the same; it's hard to get excited about a film when it looks like it was put together by a bunch of studio executives whose only thoughts were, ""How can we win the Oscar this year?"" But if there's one man I have faith in, one man who is a light in a dim, dark world, it's Viggo Mortensen, so I held out hope because if there's one thing Mr. Mortensen doesn't do, it's star in bad movies. And you know what? ""Green Book"" is most certainly not a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty darn excellent.<br/><br/>Look, is this movie Oscar bait? Yes. But is it well-done Oscar bait? Oh yes, it is. Immediately this movie is entertaining, right from the beginning. It's never overly melodramatic, nor too serious, like ""Crash,"" the so-called king of Oscar bait. Instead, while it is still maddening to watch people be casually and unflinchingly racist, ""Green Book"" has an overall softer, more lighthearted, and humorous tone throughout. And this very fun and entertaining tone was a much needed change of pace from other Oscar bait films, which tend to emotionally manipulate audiences by tugging at their heartstrings, using emotion, instead of quality, to trick their audiences into thinking they just saw a good movie. ""Green Book"" is straight-up entertaining from beginning to end, and has more than its fair share of laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali also had amazing, standout chemistry. I mean, watching these two guys drive around, become friends, crack jokes, and stand up for each other? I loved it. The movie could've been 4 hours long of them driving around and I would've loved every second because watching these two men interact is some of the most fun time I've had at the movies. Viggo Mortensen is amazing in practically everything he's ever been in, and ""Green Book"" is no exception. He plays a character with such a strong personality that when he's on screen, you really can't take your eyes off of him. And Mahershala Ali, too, plays a character with a unique personality, just a very different one. And regardless, seeing both characters change, and change each other, for the better was riveting and highly entertaining viewing; they played off of each other so well, and you really feel like you become friends with them as you're watching them go on their cross-country journey.<br/><br/>Obviously, this isn't a perfect film. The direction does feel a little stagnant; yes, the acting is phenomenal, but the film feels very glossy and glazed over, just a little too ""high-definition,"" for lack of a better word. Also, there are a few moments that do feel a little on the nose (look for the scene with people working in a field), but overall I found this movie to be an incredibly fun and entertaining time at the theatre. The acting is really, really good, the story is endlessly entertaining thanks to the marvelous chemistry between the two lead characters, and the message is undoubtedly important. If you want to have a good time at the movies this holiday season, you don't have to look much further than ""Green Book."""

","I always consider whether paying $10 was well spent or wasted. Green Book was money well spent. Viggo was brilliant as usual and the story line flowed nicely. Continuity issues aside it was a nice story told well."
"bostonct","10","0","2","24 November 2018"," This is an excellent movie
","I'm not going to rehash what everyone else is saying. See it for yourself. This should be a 9+ movie. I think the critics are hung up on the racism issue but these so-called critics don't know the difference from ignorance and deliberate, conscience racism. I think many of them think it's all the same. Tony of the former, and over time he sees the truth. It slowly changes and we as the audience feel it and empathize. This is why you get nominated for an Oscar. See it! For those bashing Mort for his ""N"" word transgression, ""He who is without sin can case the first stone!"" Too many hypocrites out there."

","Green Book is about a black piano player who is going to the western part of the U.S.A. He needs a driver and a person to protect him. He finds a person and they both go through many challenges to make all the concerts.<br/><br/>Green Book was a great movie. The writing was outstanding. It was funny in some scenes and series in others. The comedy was just so funny at times. It wasn't any dumb comedy it was all clever. The depiction on racism was really well done in this movie. It gave you the idea on how hard it was for colors back then. Also how hard the police was. Some scenes in this movie were great. One scene when they were in a restaurant towards the end was beautiful and powerful. The acting was astonishing to watch. They both portrayed there parts really well. The times when they played the piano was great. It showed how cool it is to be on a stage.<br/><br/>Green Book was a great movie. I would recommend to go see it."
