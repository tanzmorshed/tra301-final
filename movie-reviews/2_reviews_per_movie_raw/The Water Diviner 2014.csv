"ma-cortes","8","40","47","13 February 2018"," A moving and sensitive picture about an Australian father who attempts to find his sons , being Russell Crowe's directorial debut.
","After the Battle of Gallipoli, in 1915, an Aussie farmer called Connor (Russell Crowe), travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli to attempt locate his three sons , allegedly missing in action . At a hotel he meets a beautiful widow (Olga Kurylenko who learned Turkish for her character), and later on he tries to find out a way in arrive to Gallipoli , where reportedly died his children . As he must travel across the war-torn landscape with the help of a British Lt Colonel called Hughes (Jai Courtney) and a Turkish Officer (Erdogan) . Meanwhile , there takes place the Greek-Turkish war and the invasion of Smirna by the Greeks . As it is set during the Turkish War of Independence, in revolutionary days during fall of the Ottoman Empire . The War resulted the defeat of Greece in Western Turkey (Greco-Turkish war), on the East, Armenian state and Britain, France and Georgia.<br/><br/>
This is a family story in which is treated thought-provoking issues with a tough man holding onto hope, fighting for a desire , and bringing to life a promise . Australian Russell Crowe gives an acceptable actiing as the Aussie father who goes out to find his 3 missing sons and while staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he falls in love with a gorgeous widow. The charming Olga Kurylenko is good as the attractive widow mistreated by his brother-in-law who wants to marry her . Support cast is pretty well , such as Jai Courtney , Isabel Lucas and Jacqueline McKenzie who also starred with Crowe in the 1992 hit Romper Stomper . And some fine Turks actors as Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan who are both comedy actors in Turkey .
 It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar-winning cameraman Andrew Lesnie , being his final movie . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by David Hirschfelder , helped by Lisa Gerard .The motion picture was stunningly acted/produced/directed by Russell Crowe . <br/><br/>The picture gives an interesting portrayal about the bloody campaign and battle of Gallipoli . There happened the following : The Gallipoli Campaign, also known as the Dardanelles Campaign, the Battle of Gallipoli, or the Battle of Çanakkale , was a campaign of the First World War that took place on the Gallipoli peninsula (Gelibolu in modern Turkey) in the Ottoman Empire between 17 February 1915 and 9 January 1916. The peninsula forms the northern bank of the Dardanelles, a strait that provided a sea route to the Russian Empire, one of the Allied powers during the war. Intending to secure it, Russia's allies, Britain and France, launched a naval attack followed by an amphibious landing on the peninsula, with the aim of capturing the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (modern Istanbul).The naval attack was repelled and after eight months' fighting, with many casualties on both sides, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force was withdrawn to Egypt.The campaign was the only major Ottoman victory of the war. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand national consciousness; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as ""Anzac Day"", the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing Remembrance Day , Armistice Day .The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey eight years later, with Mustafa Kemal (Kemal Atatürk) as President, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli. Mustafa Kemal, Attaturk commanded the Turkish national movement in the war of independence. His successful military campaigns led to liberation of the country and to the establishing of Turkey. He transformed the former Ottoman Empire into a democratic, modern, secular nation-state , his reforms are referred as Kemalism. Ankara became the new capital and Kemal abolished the Caliphate and Sultanate. ."
"mailes22","9","243","324","26 December 2014"," Just a really terrific movie. Great job, Russell Crowe.
","Not going to give it 10 out of 10 stars, because you should always save your 10. However, this movie is close to perfect. Very loosely based on what might have been a true story (a war record that mentioned that 'only one father came looking for his sons' at Gallipoli after the war). Really well acted. The war scenes conveyed some of the horror without being gratuitous in the violence or gore. There was some shown, but only briefly, and really just enough to set the scenes. The movie is well- paced, well edited and doesn't drag. The lead actors (including the young Turkish boy) were all perfectly cast. At the start of the 100th anniversary year of the Gallipoli landings, this is a story that was well worth telling. Great job, Russell Crowe."
"vinifrss","10","180","240","13 January 2015"," Cross-Cultural Jewel, Incredibly Powerful Message
","First of all, I am neither Australian nor Turkish. I'm from Rio, as far away as it can get from either country - not only in terms of geography, but also, and most importantly, in culture. I enjoyed ""The Water Diviner"" enormously nonetheless (watched it in Mediterranean Turkey on a trip), for this jewel of a movie is built upon universal themes of common appeal to our shared humankind.<br/><br/>This is the first film from an English-speaking country with a huge budget and world-famous actors that thoroughly succeeds in overcoming jingoism and achieving a perfectly harmonious, cross- culture balance of fairness that I have ever watched in my entire life.<br/><br/>The story has an amazing soul, a mesmerizing spiritual power, and a refreshing perspective on History. As a scholar of History, I'd say it treats a noble Turkish nation victim of absolutely unprovoked aggression from all sides during World War I with long-overdue justice after a 100 years, while retaining the dignity of ANZAC soldiers who fought with great bravery and loyalty for a dubious British cause.<br/><br/>""The Water Diviner"" is not only a cinematographic masterpiece of rare beauty. It is a powerful statement of tolerance, a testimony of endless hope and love."
"skw2001","9","200","270","26 December 2014"," The best movie we've seen this year
","The preview did not hint at the complex and gripping tale in store for us, beyond that of a father seeking his sons' fate on the battlefields of Gallipoli. Crowe clearly sought to make a powerful statement about war (my wife was moved to tears during the battlefield scenes) but did not overdo it at the expense of an engaging plot. We left the cinema with a new insight to the Gallipoli story, that being the cost to the Turkish people.<br/><br/>Crowe was very convincing in his role of the grieving, relentless father. Fantastic support role by Yilmaz Ergodan and, although brief, Ryan Corr was very moving.<br/><br/>Don't wait for this to come to DVD, it is best appreciated on the big screen."
"tillydimech","9","136","184","28 December 2014"," A Great Film from A Great Man
","If this is Russell Crowe's first film I can't wait to see what is to come. The Water Diviner takes you an an impossible, heart warming journey of a father looking for his sons after the tragedy of Gallipoli. What this film does well is captures both sides of the battle, the Turkish and the ANZAC's. It is visually stunning, emotionally charged and does more than most movies to pry open your empathetic side.<br/><br/>The cast are amazing but I think my praise would have to go to Ryan Corr, Yilmaz Erdogen and Olga Kurylenko for three beautiful performances. All three of them aid Crowe's performance in a highly emotional way and create depth and love within the film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend giving this film a go if you appreciate a film with a good story and good talent and I hope it receives the praise and attention it deserves. It is definitely worth the watch."
"warthogjump","Null","110","148","17 December 2014"," Amazing! Kudos to Russell Crowe
","I was persistent enough to get tickets to the special Village Cinemas Screening of this great film in Australia.<br/><br/>The plot is very novel and interesting - focusing on the aftermath of the Gallipoli/Anzac War and one father's (Russell Crowe) determination to track down each one of his presumably deceased three sons - all who served as Australian soldiers in the war - in order to bury all of them ""at home."" Definitely a unique plot.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a mix of epic Hollywood elements and an accurate, respectable portrayal of both the Turkish army and culture. The latter is largely why this film succeeds - because it doesn't judge, but rather it observes the practices of the Turkish people. This element combined with some powerful Hollywood emotional scenes make for a very enjoyable and extraordinary viewing experience.<br/><br/>In some scenes, the Australian soldiers express regret in relation to the Gallipoli War - why were we there? what did we achieve? what did we aim to achieve? These questions are very important because the only outcome achieved from the invasion was the death of countless Australian and Turkish soldiers. Ironically, this may be the main critique by media and other reviewers - because Russell Crowe will be wrongly hated for using film to communicate to the audience how futile the Gallipoli War was, how thousands of lives were lost and families destroyed all in the name of nothing.<br/><br/>The most intriguing and amazing aspect of the entire film is the close friendship between the Turkish and Australian soldiers after the war - there are even multiple comments in what appear to be in jest of this bond - however, to say the least, it is a great exemplification of the humaneness and genuineness of all soldiers who fought in the war. The similarities between soldiers on both sides of each army is so unsettling it is almost uncanny - the most obvious being the Turkish Major Hasan's (played by a very convincing and excellent Yilmaz Erdogan) decision to help Crowe (Mr Conner) in his search for his sons. Hasan is a father just like Conner - he can share the pain and heartbreak of losing children and simply not knowing their precise fate.<br/><br/>The Turkish army is manifested to be a group of very respectable people merely defending their home land and for this I praise Crowe the most - there was no bad guy, there was no evil, there was just useless and pointless killings and this epiphany is (unfortunately) recognised only after the war was over. Ultimately, we were all friends, we could all get along, but it took thousands of soldiers lives just to realise this.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was very smart as both Director and Actor in this film. There are multiple scenes in which Crowe appears to very ignorant of Turkish ideas, customs and behaviour. However, it is very clear that Crowe has extensively studied Turkish culture as he could not have made this film so meticulous otherwise.<br/><br/>I give the Water Diviner a solid 9.5/10 - just short of a masterpiece. The only thing Crowe could have added is a touch more character development and depth. Not to say that it was not sufficient, because it most certainly was, but if he just took that extra step he may very well have created a flawless flick - or maybe I'm just nitpicking!"
"ipekmine","9","220","309","27 December 2014"," A beautiful, heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.
","One does not have to be Turkish or an ANZAC descendant to be interested and touched by this film.. doesn't need to be necessarily interested in history, either. The Water Diviner offers something for everyone who carries a heart and soul. It offers a beautiful yet heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.<br/><br/>If I were asked ""what is this movie about?"" I'd say it's an epic tale of love and hope, a beautifully crafted story inspired by real life, and a breath-taking masterpiece that makes you forget where you are, or what time/day/year it is. It really is a captivating film. The story itself may sound rather simple to some, but in my opinion it's a spectacular mix of reality and art. Hats off to Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight for their great work, the Water Diviner tells a magical tale and reminds us what wars do to people, to families.. and to our humanity. I cannot imagine anyone who won't be touched by this film, touched very deep inside, that is. Whoever that ever loved somebody or lost a beloved one –sibling, parent, child, significant other, or friend, you name it– may have their heart shattered during certain scenes of the Water Diviner.<br/><br/>Apart from the story, the characters too felt so ""real"", and the cast performances were nothing short of what one would expect from such brilliant names. Russell Crowe, as always, seemed to ""live"" the role, not ""just act"" it.. and I'm so very glad that Cem Yilmaz has been in such a special project. In an attempt to keep my review as short as possible, and choosing to comment on acting after I see the movie more than once, I won't go into detail of each and every name. But.. I have to say that Ryan Corr's performance was outstanding! He and James Fraser certainly nailed it, causing a flood of tears among the audience –during a certain scene of this duo, I could hear sniffles and see shoulders shaking among the audience.. and I'm not exaggerating one bit. Speaking of the scenes that certainly leave a mark on the viewer, I'd like to say that certain scenes from the battle field were spectacular – both technically and artistically. The scenes are so ""real"" that they take you from your seat and put you on Lone Pine battlefield , feeling scared.. helpless.. angry.. and questioning what a war is.. and if it's even worth it. And then, there is a specific scene which reflect how a war can make people lose their humanity and surface the ferocity of human nature. As my favorite scene from the epic Noah, the creation scene, reminded us all: ""Brother against brother. Nation against nation. Man against the creation. We murdered each other. We broke the world, we did this. Man did this.""<br/><br/>The fascinating art is not limited to battle scenes, though. Andrew Lesnie simply works miracles, turning the movie into a feast for the eyes –from the dust storm in Australia to the breath-taking views of Istanbul, the Water Diviner presents top-quality cinematography *thumbs up* Before I wrap up my words on this beautiful piece of art, I'd like to mention two of the many special scenes which may well be extra-touching for the Turkish: i) The scene where Jemal (portrayed by Cem Yilmaz) raises a toast to Mustafa Kemal: During the screening at the Istanbul premiere, the audience responded to this by loud and clear applause, and it certainly will remain an unforgettable scene for many, many Turks. ii) Another special part of the movie that I really loved is the old Turkish folk song Jemal sings –an old song called ""hey fifteen year olds"", telling the story of 15 year old boys leaving home to join the battle of Gallipoli.<br/><br/>Taken together, the Water Diviner tells a tale of love mingled with adventure, delivers a sea of emotions from grief to hope, and works the magic of cinema, reaching the viewers' heart and mind in a way that crosses all barriers of language, different cultures, politics, and history.<br/><br/>PS: the Water Diviner was rewarded standing ovation, and I believe this was not only because it's a great movie, it was also a heart-felt ""thank you"" to the director for such an honest story which the Turkish audience isn't used to seeing in foreign films about Turkey and its history.<br/><br/>Kudos and hats off to Russell Crowe & the entire cast and crew. The Water Diviner (Turkish title: Son Umut, i.e. 'the Last Hope') is a spectacular movie, a must-see, a masterpiece."

","Russell Crowe has absolutely outdone himself with this film; it had me entranced from the start. Beautifully shot, amazing casting and the time and effort put into the making of this film really shone through. I feel the costumers deserve an Oscar nomination for this one - everything was spot on which for a period drama is almost impossible:) Flawless casting and great character development leads the viewer through the story; this film will bring out emotions and provoke thought. I loved the perspective of the film; it is an exceptional sensitive retelling of an historical story from both perspectives and I think this is one of the absolute highlights of this film.<br/><br/>See it - you won't be disappointed!Take the tissues though..."
"s-sheen","Null","58","86","21 December 2014"," Gallipoli reality for both sides
","I managed to get to a pre-screening at Orpheum, Cremorne NSW. Very glad I did as this was a refreshing change to the standard Aussie renditions of the Gallipoli story. The audience burst into applause at the conclusion of the movie me also.<br/><br/>Having the Turkish view of the British and ANZAC invasion makes the film feel balanced as there are two sides to every conflict. The horrors of the campaign are relived by the story and the performances of the main characters are good I do feel the Turkish command got a good rap from this script. The trauma of a father searching for his Sons after 4 years of not knowing.<br/><br/>The Greeks this time getting the spray, but 100 years on I see Greece as a firm ally but politics aside.<br/><br/>Crowe, I actually liked in this movie the casting of the Turkish Mother and her young Son was good the casting of the Turkish Commander better, The British were as obnoxious as the Australians prefer to depict them.<br/><br/>The film at 2 hours I never felt bored or restless and this I suspect is that the story is grasping it has War, Love, Heartache, Compassion and a little Hollywood to ensure appeal to wider non-Australian Turkish audiences.<br/><br/>I rate this highly in the movies I have seen 2014..."
"sheer64","9","76","118","3 January 2015"," Quality, Respectful and Entertaining.
","The quality of the acting and the production is first class. It is s well directed movie, hats off to Russell Crowe for his directorial debut. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie showed respect to the cultures depicted and kept things on a level playing field. During the screening it was very clear to me the audience was won over and totally engrossed in the movie, just as I was. Watched allot of movies in 2014, but this one is of a higher standard all round. This movie has the potential to be nominated for awards and any it wins would be well deserving. Special mention to Dylan Georgiades who was a delight to watch in the film. I rated this movie a 9/10, and I hope it is successful as it deserves to be, Russell Crowe has done it again."
"Svengali-2001","10","72","113","28 December 2014"," A great piece of story telling... possibly contains spoilers
","I've read various comments about this movie being just another chance to show Aussies at war; being something of a flag waving opportunity. These comments have emanated mainly from Americans who haven't even see the film. Yet it pales in comparison to many American war films, which also have traded on jingoistic fervour for the last 80 years. Modern war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket blow their Nationalistic horns very loudly. You would be mistaken for believing that only Americans died in WW1, WWII and Vietnam. America didn't even join WWI until it was half finished in 1917, took a year longer to join WWII and also fought alongside Kiwis & Aussies in Vietnam. Just as Aussies fought with Canadians, Kiwis and Brits in WWI & the Allies in WWII. The best example of a great war film is Paths of Glory. A war film and anti-war film in the same breath. However, it is jingoism and national identity which dies in that extraordinary film, dark and dirty and deep in the trenches, where such notions belong when they bring death for no good reason and for no real cause.<br/><br/>The fact is, the writers and Russell give a balanced and even-handed approach to the Turkish side of the story, and rightly points out that the Turks lost about 7 times as many people as the Allies. Russell also gives viewers a peek at what happened to the Ottoman Empire after the war, when other countries were carving it up for themselves. Especially by the British, in much the same way they acted later on, in their appalling handling of Palestine. And the rest of the world has been paying for it ever since. Just as the rest of the world also paid for the creation the Weimar Republic.<br/><br/>I once read that the Aussie population today would be more like 55 million people instead of 22 million if we hadn't entered this foreign war at the behest of the British, although the great immigration schemes of the 50s, populate or perish would have probably changed and maybe not to the good, given the many cultures new Australians continually bring to our shores.<br/><br/>To me, WWI was more about big business making a buck out of political good fortune than any true ideology except for the cannon fodder we call soldiers, and the poor civilians in those various war-torn lands.<br/><br/>I also want to point out that I have lots of cool American friends (and relatives including my lovely wife) and they are great people, but many of them tell me how insular and inward looking many of their citizens can be. That they are less likely to watch subtitled films or learn about foreign lands. And yet they embrace our actors. How many American TV shows have had Aussies (and Brits) in their casts lists. Like in The Originals, Vampire Diaries, The Mentalist, The Secret Circle, Moonlight, Defiance, True Blood, Hostages, United States of Tara, nip/tuck (A Prime Minister's son at that) Fringe, Unforgettable, Without a Trace, Spartacus and Longmire, to name a few.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome. I hope it is a hit, but I will be content for those people who see it, to enjoy it and take it for what it is, an entertainment. I think Olga is wonderful and all that actors are wonderful although Dan Wylie appears miscast. Megan Gale is in the film as Fatma, and does a good job although I must say I barely recognised her. It might have been a nice touch to have hired Turkish actors in the female leads, but I do think Olga is developing into a multi-faceted actress. The two Turkish leads are brillian and bring a lot to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>A special mention too, for young Melbourne actor, Dylan Georgiades who plays Olga's son. Dylan is great in his first major film role and brings much humour to the film, and steals most of his scenes. His relationship with Russell seems very real. It is also utterly ironical that a boy of Greek descent is playing a Turkish lad!!! For those of you that may not realise this, Robert Mammone, who plays the Greek officer later in the film, made his theatrical movie debut with Russell Crowe in 1990 in The Crossing. The lead actress in that film, Danielle Spencer is also married (although currently separated) to Russell. And for our overseas friends who like Russell's movies then I urge you to get these movies on DVD if you can, Proof (Hugo Weaving 1991), Romper Stomper (his lead actress in that film is his wife in The Water Diviner - do you spot a trend here?) The Sum of Us (where he works with Jack Thompson (and Russell is almost Jack Thompson incarnate in this film) You may want to check out some of Jack's early films if you can find them, like Sunday Too Far Away, The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith and Caddie.<br/><br/>This isn't really an Aussie film, but a film for everyone, set mainly in Turkey, and which could have happened to any family living in Britain, USA, Canada, NZ etc but just happened to be written here. If you wish to be entertained at the movies this year then this is one of the best films to see. I saw The Hobbit on the same day as it was my Birthday, and both cinemas were packed. At the end of the Water Diviner most people clapped and quite a few women, like my wife cried. The Hobbit was also terrific, but no one clapped at the end. :) :) :)"
"hopeless_23","10","75","120","28 December 2014"," Masterpiece from the master
","When i saw this movie out, i said ""i must watch it quickly !"" Because i know there will be no movie about Gallipoli war like this for a long time. Hollywood never tried to enter this area. Luckily we have Russell Crowe, an Australian brave heart. It's true, you never know what reactions may come from people who lost their families at Gallipoli for both sides. He took hard responsibility for it and showed great courage.<br/><br/>First, I want to criticize about dubbing. I really wanted to watch it with cast's original voices. I know it's meant to be for Turkish people who doesn't speak English but personally i didn't like it. Anyway, it's not about the movie so skip it. Sound, music, story, background, colors, special fx are high class and deserve to watch. The story balance is a bit to Turkish side as if it tries to give the message to ANZACs ""why are you here even if you don't know where Turkey is on the map"". It's just my opinion though.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely heart touching, no doubt. At the very beginning, the movie already touched my heart by the war scene with a child soldier. It's very emotional moment for me because lots of child soldiers died during the WW1. And i can imagine Australian and NZ viewers (especially mothers) cry for Eliza's (Connor's wife) situation. For Turkish and Australia-NZ sides, the movie deserves very special place which can't be replaced. For the others, it is a very very good war drama you've watched in years."

","I've just come back from the cinema after seeing this movie and will now be emailing everyone on my contact list that it is a 'must see' on the big screen. Not just for Australians, but for everyone, as it deals with universal themes. The cinematography is stunningly beautiful, the casting and acting is superb and the story is fascinating and never lags. A great blend of emotion and action, and the occasional bit of humour. Last August marked the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WW1, which influenced all our lives. It is so important for people everywhere, and especially young people to learn about what has happened in the past and to gain an understanding of history from the point of view of others, and to learn about their cultures too. This movie, set mainly in Turkey, about 4 years after the end of the war, is one small story of one man's search, set within a much larger story of the meaning and consequences of war. Superb acting and direction by Russel Crowe. Don't miss it !"
"silencer90","10","97","182","23 January 2015"," Almost Perfect
","This movie managed to satisfy my thirst for a genuine war film. As a historian and a cinephile, I must say it even exceeded my expectations. Standing ovation for Mr Crowe!<br/><br/>Water Diviner contained a gripping story, brilliant cues and amazing scenes as well as a fresh approach to the events of WWI, all of which will stay embroidered in my memory for the rest of my days. Acting was pretty solid. Especially the performance of the local comedy star Cem Yilmaz was impressive and some hilarious moments he offered stood as a fine contrast to the general melancholia of the scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the user reviews here on IMDb accused the production as falsely depicting historical events. Most of these strange reviews contained the same copy/pasted lines that had nothing to do with facts. I've done my finishing thesis on the World Wars and I know enough to say there has never been a genocide of minorities in Turkey. These minorities wouldn't be ""minorities"" if (as claimed by a few users here) their numbers could be measured by millions. If you add the numbers up, the total ""death toll"" would be almost higher than the entire Ottoman population :) And the assertion that the Greek were sent to Western Anatolia just to protect the Christian population there... utter nonsense! The Greek troops were merely tongs of the British army who were too wise to handle the fire themselves. They were there to occupy those lands and they committed lots of atrocities, burning down Turkish villages even as they retreated from the battlefield. The movie depicts them as what they really are.<br/><br/>All in all, a definite recommend to any war movie fan out there. This was one journey to remember!"
"prospectus_capricornium","8","20","32","18 July 2015"," Exquisitely-Acted and Heart-wrenchingly Sentimental,
","Right from the beginning, Russel Crowe's directorial debut, THE WATER DIVINER, is already sweeping with unfathomable amount of emotions, gathering affection the moment it flashes grim representations of war and what follows at its heels. From there, it treads through compassionate subjects of ambitious scale, stumbling upon its own entanglements at times, but gets saved by towering affectionate performances from its actors.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of miraculous farmer (he knows where to find water underneath the arid earth) Joshua Connor (Crowe), whose three sons were sent to the war in Turkey. Years later and none of them has ever come home. His wife mourns over their presumed death, and succumbs to fatal depression. Swearing at his wife's grave to bring their sons' remains home, Connor voyages to Turkey, not even knowing what exactly to expect and see.<br/><br/>There is much to admire in Crowe for helming such historical romance, teeming with bold themes about love, family, and war. His directorial inexperience screams with some odd choices he made, like the forced romance between Connor and Olga Kurylenko's widow character, and the mostly ill-woven narrative his screenwriters knitted, but the sentimental performances of his actors and himself, are overwhelming enough to make up for the narrative inconsistencies. These solid heart-shattering performances summon the affection they truly deserve, and make the film, amid of its script's evident flaws, able to relay its sincere intentions, to the audience. Also a key factor for its effective delivery, is an exquisite cinematography that is able to capture the dreadfulness of the war, the sorrow of a grieving and longing father, and the breathtaking sceneries of countryside Australia, assuming incredibly toned palettes that shifts along the landscapes of the story.<br/><br/>This movie could have been perfect with an excellently-written script, but considering it's just Crowe's first directorial assignment, I'd say this is one hell of an epic job. Sincere, heart-wrenching, and beautifully-acted, THE WATER DIVINER, packs an incredible wallop of searing emotions, sending the most striking of sentiments, despite the faults in its storytelling."

My partner and I go out of our way to see every movie even the horrible ones this year such as transcendence but this was such a shock. The trailer leaves you thinking it'll be a good movie, but not until you experience the raw truth of Gallipoli and the amazing story of a father finding his sons lost at war can you know that Russel Crowe has directed a masterpiece. The Water Diviner is an inspiring film and *spoiler* the relationship Crowe's character forms with the Turkish General, and the empty the general feels for him and his desire to risk it all to help him find his sons could inspire anything. *It's an amazing movie with a silver brumby feel about it at the start which only made me love it more.

"btorun-368-612496","9","31","55","7 January 2015"," A heartwarming, humane look at Gallipoli and wars in general
","First of all I have to say that I am Turkish so you know my perspective. Though I am not a nationalist of any kind and oppose all sorts of militarism, violence and aggression. While I enjoy action films in general, deep down in my heart I have problems with many war films mainly because of their jingoistic, hateful, alienating, dehumanizing and polarizing approach. The most well- known examples I can think of are Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings. I am very pleased that nowadays there are true anti-war films and was especially happy with 2014's Fury. I was also pleased with The Water Diviner for same reason but additionally found other aspects of the film great as well.<br/><br/>Very few negatives I can think of are the editing of the film, portrayal of Greeks and also ironically Turks. The film left an odd feeling of discontinuity. The scenes jumped from one to other and undermined the natural flow of the film. Nevertheless I don't want to blame Russell Crowe much because it is his debut. The Greek soldiers invading Anatolia were realistic. Their costume and makeup might be over the top but they did not come back to Anatolia for peaceful purposes for sure. Though because the film did not feature a positive Greek character at all, I felt this was unfair to Greeks because indeed Greek society contributed a lot to Ottoman society and they were still huge in numbers in Istanbul. Perhaps the presence of a couple of nice Greek people in Istanbul would change that image. Although great effort is put to display Turkish culture accurately, there were still several scenes which were historically wrong. I am sure women in Ottoman Empire were veiled but burka was never a part of Ottoman culture. It is an Afghan costume and as a secular Turk I am not pleased with that portrayal.<br/><br/>On the positives side, I liked the anti-war message most. The film intentionally fools you first by showing three brother heroically charging against Turks and winning the battle. When they are gunned down by machine gun fire later, that little heroism myth is revealed to be just nonsense. The scene is highly disturbing (as it needs to be) with one of brothers moaning in pain and the others face is blown away. Moreover I liked everyone's acting but special mention is to young Dylan Georgiades who played Ayshe's son. His chemistry with Russell Crowe was wonderful. The atmosphere in the film is very realistic. When watching, the film indeed took me to 1920's Anatolia and Australia and I remained there for 2 hours. There were nice small details put in the story and dialogues which enormously helped establishing that atmosphere. <br/><br/>Overall I really liked this film and look forward to see more films by Russell Crowe. I gave it a 9 because of some minor mistakes. It is a very well directed heartwarming anti-war drama."

","The new film from Russell Crowe's new production company ""FEAR of GOD Films"" is remarkable. Truly the BEST film Russell has ever made.<br/><br/>In The Water Diviner the characters were real, with a depth of emotion and feeling not seen in many films today. The choice of actors was spot on and I could not find fault with any of their acting, from the young boy to the love interest. The parts of the Turkish sergeant and commander were played by men who gave their all and it showed.<br/><br/>The roles played by the English and Australian officers was also commendable and their portrayed anxiety for the man wanting to visit Gallipoli, was done with a true sense of feeling and concern, even though this concern was misguided in this case.<br/><br/>The locations for Gallipoli (near Pt. Lincoln)and other areas (Burra) were well chosen and apart from some scenes, were filmed at the South Australian Film Corporation on Greenhill Road, Adelaide, South Australia.<br/><br/>The story is wonderful and who ever wrote the script is to be commended.<br/><br/>If Russell and others in the cast are not recommended for the Academy and other Awards I will be most surprised. The film should be nominated for best film 2014 and best director. Many of the cast should be nominated for Awards in each of the relative roles.<br/><br/>A Great film, a very commendable film, Russell's best and to date Greatest film. My belief is, that ""The Water Diviner"" is in the category of being one of the very best films made since WW2.<br/><br/>A great film, made and directed by an Aussie too! The love interest between the farmer and the girl was tender and Russell's treatment of this was brilliant, whereby even a look between a man and a woman conveys all that is needed.<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5"
"crocolm","6","20","34","18 April 2015"," Reasonably promising premise which ultimately falls short
","Set in 1919 The Water Diviner tells the story of an Australian father of three young men all of whom have enlisted with the ANZAC's in the Gallipoli campaign in World War 1. Subsequent to the battle in which the Allied forces were defeated all three have failed to return home and are now presumed dead. Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) their father, a Victorian Outback farmer with a gift for divining water makes a promise to his wife to bring them home and heads off on a quest to Gallipoli to find them.<br/><br/>This is the reasonably promising premise laid out in the first 20 minutes of the film. I didn't envisage a swash-buckle fest at this stage; nor is it true to say it becomes this, but the film does veer in that direction once or twice over the ensuing hour and thirty minutes. It seems like a betrayal of the seriousness of the subject matter because of this.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner is relatively entertaining but it falls short of what I was hoping for and I think this is because it neither all-out delivers as a full on ravages of war redemption story or as an all- out high-spirited adventure. Having said that some of the battle- scenes (shot in flashback) are unflinching and are probably the best scenes in the film. <br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful to the eye but the end effect here is that it feels too sanitised at times. There are other things that rankle as well- a burgeoning love story which comes over as too shoe-horned and heavy handed for my liking and in my view steals the central story of its import. There are two scenes in particular where the viewer is required to make the jump from believing in the power of the diviners hand to believing in altogether more mystical powers or insights divined by the same hand (also to do with powers of location). Another thing to watch out for; the film plays host to a stock character or two- witness the very officious English officer who speaks in stereotypical clipped tones, previously seen in countless other films."

","This war movie was released on 100 year commemoration of War of Gallipoli. Strange enough this is not a just a war movie, because it has such a strong human story that stretches beyond any particular war. An Australian father searching for traces of his three lost sons on the battle field of Gallipoli after 4 years past the war. Would not an actor jump on his feet hearing this theme of a movie! And there was incredibly talented Russell Crowe as an actor as well as director making the most out of the great story line. It just got better every minutes; setting against the backdrop of early twentieth century's Istanbul, as beautiful and standing tall as it is today with its markets, blue mosque and what not. Who could show a better and almost clairvoyant depiction of traditional Turkish muddy coffee? A good movie is never called good for one actor. Yilmaz Erdogan was equally brilliant in his subtle expression, so was Olga Kurylenko, what a transition from Oblivion star! All actors including young Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) are never weak links. The closing song ""Love was my alibi"" is so melodious. All in all I would recommend everyone to watch this beautiful masterpiece."

","The Water Diviner shows the emotional aftermath after the battle of Canakkale ( Gallipoli) which had a deep impact on the Turkish and Australian people.The story is about a father (Russell Crow) looking for his three missing sons.The tragic part of the story is that it was the first time the Australian people suffered a great deal of casualties and gained nothing at the end.What I liked about this movie was that they showed both the Australians's and Turk's perspective of the aftermath, which showed that war IS war and no matter what both sides suffer.Considering it was Russell Crowe's first movie as a director, I think he did really well especially the scene where one brother is on the ground and the other two go to help him and they all fall.One of them dies quickly and the other is hurt but not severely and the last one is on the ground moaning in pain.In the end he asks his brother to shoot him so he can have a quick death which he does.This fictional story is based upon the real events that occurred in 1918, which lead to the fall of the Ottoman Empire.All in all it is a great movie except for the ending which I found it somewhat predictable.Other then that a really good movie."

","This movie is a perfect example of what a storyline means for mainstream commercial cinema. You know that graphic with the ups and downs, how the story should go from positive to negative, how the protagonist should suffer and then recover, so on and so on? Here it is, LITERALLY, in the worst most obvious possible way.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last movie i saw with all the possible clichés you could put in it, seriously, they don't even try to disguise it. The melodramatic music, the flashbacks, the suffering of the characters, the happy ending you can see coming from the first minutes, i mean, this movie has it all, all i say. I was shocked with the pace of the editing in the beginning, Russel wanted us to know everything right away, stuffing the needed information to start of the story plus the sad music on top wrapping it all up in the first 15 minutes, from then on it's all about his journey, which starts when he meets the beautiful secondary actress, and right there you know how that is gonna end for them, and believe me, this is no spoiler, it's just really damn obvious.<br/><br/>The editing was awful the entire movie, putting together flashbacks with sentimental moments between him and the actress so that later you can understand that they are close enough to run away together, shame it was so fast edited and terribly ""i've-seen-this-a-thousand- times-before"". The directing had a lot to say about it, with some crazy framings, like some parts where the camera starts zooming into people faces, what's the idea there Russel? The color correction was so saturated at times, and so not saturated at times that at a certain part of the movie, i even thought that maybe i had downloaded an unfinished version of the movie, and damn i really wish i had. Editing should be something like a referee role in a football match, the least you notice him, the better, and in this movie it was all about the referee, i mean, yellows and red cards every five minutes.<br/><br/>The story about the Gallipoli campaign is very interesting, but this was a total mission failed with clichés after clichés, the most awful editing and storytelling i've seen in a long time. The 2 out of 10 rating goes for the costume designs and the nice landscapes they shot the movie at. I decided to watch this movie because i like Russel and i trust a lot IMDb ratings, but the 7.7 it had is still a complete mystery to me.<br/><br/>I don't like not-to-recommend movies, even if they're really bad like this one, it will help set a bar on your mind on how money can be wasted and how not so bad other movies you've seen before were."

"ozzycelebi","10","30","61","10 March 2015"," Good war movie
","Crowe did a good job telling the story from the only point of view that matters to Gallipoli - the experience of ANZACS and Turks during and after Gallipoli. ANZACS and Turks were both unwilling participants in a brutal war started by imperialist and nationalistic goals. They paid dearly and in return got nothing, except each other's well deserved respect. <br/><br/>England, France, Italy, Greece, Russia, Armenians, Arabs, Slavs, and even the US (covertly) were allied against the Turks for the sole purpose of carving the Ottoman Empire among themselves. It was a war purely for imperialist and nationalist profiteering, with complete and utter disregard for humanity, justice, or the lives of Turks, or even their own people for that matter. But for Turks, it was much, much worse.<br/><br/>Is it so unfathomable that the Turks suffered more than anyone in WW1? But unsurprisingly, and callously, a lot of Turk haters are here using movie reviews to spread their propaganda. These are the people who ultimately lost to the Turks - Greeks and Armenians. They cannot move on like ANZACS and forgive the Turks - as Turks have forgiven them. They are still fighting their war. They are giving a movie low reviews based solely on their agenda, nothing more. It is sad.<br/><br/>It is as if nobody else in the world can have their own version of events that they were personally party to, or that Russell Crowe risked his career by telling his version that he based on his own research and the experience of his own nation. How dare he not consult the Armenians or Greeks! One thing for sure, this movie would never be made in Hollywood. If you look at some Armenian or Greek reviews, it's as if their version of events is some indisputable holy gospel, and Russell Crowe was bribed to tell lies by evil Turks - and that he put his career and reputation on the line just to serve a political purpose or greed. As if. If you see the movie, you will see his intentions are noble, not based on politics or greed.<br/><br/>Australians and Turks fought for nothing in that battle. They gave their lives for greed and treachery of others (Armenians and Greeks), and got nothing in return except pain and suffering. 100 years later, Crowe tells us, it was not for naught, but for a beautiful friendship forged on the battlefield, by blood, of a common pain, of consecration of new nations of their own, and of proving to the world what both were and are made of. Courage to fight, and to forgive.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Crowe for having the courage to stand up to bullies and liars (Greeks and Armenians) even if it was not your intention. Now, if Hollywood would start being more objective, we could have less hatred and more understanding in the world. <br/><br/>It is a great movie. And I give this movie a 10 because of the honor and courage it took in telling the story that nobody else dares to tell, because of fear from reprisals from the Armenian and Greek lobbies. Thanks again Mr. Crowe, you truly are a gladiator!<br/><br/>""Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side now here in this country of ours... you, the mothers, who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.""<br/><br/>~ Mustafa Kemal Pasha - Ottoman Commander, Gallipoli."

Of course it wouldn't be an Aussie film, in part, without sticking it up the Pomes! The romantic subplot was rescued by Olga Kurylenko's radiant presence. I think l am her biggest Aussie fan.

","For a man who has worked with some of the most accomplished and respected directors in the industry, from Ridley Scott, Ron Howard, Peter Weir and Michael Mann just to name a few, you'd expect Australia's (although it should really be New Zealand's) very own Russell Crowe to have learnt a trick or two in the art of directing but sadly his debut The Water Diviner suffers from some uninspired and at times amateurish direction that halts any of its power it may have otherwise possessed.<br/><br/>A huge hit here in Australia, with box office receipts of well over 10 million dollars, a huge feat here for a locally made film and with success at local industry awards, it's abundantly clear that the Water Diviner struck a chord with both audiences and critics alike. From this it's suffice to say that Crowe was obviously onto something in setting his story in the oft spoken about and patriotic battle of Gallipoli and the aftermath it would have on the Australian populace. In saying this though the film which is inspired by real events, fails to emotionally engage or resonate on anything more than a lower level, a judgement that can be based around Crowe's uninvolving directional style and a film style that suffers badly from countless and often unwarranted tonal shifts.<br/><br/>It really feels like the Water Diviner had suffered an identity crisis in its development stages and no one was sure enough on how to fix it. We get a family drama, a love story, a few war set pieces, some politics and some cricket bat's being put to good use, but what we don't get is any of these becoming engaging in their own right. Just as one element of the film may be set to take hold of you and keep you glued to the screen, it disappears, only to be taken over by some awkward loving glances, a beat down with a Christian cross or a chase through a crowded Turkey set street. With so many things going on it's hard to feel much towards any of the characters and while Crowe is his usual gruff self, there's not a lot to write home about in regards to the acting states, although a moustached Jai Courtney, an underused Ryan Corr and Yilmaz Erdogan do have moments that suggest there was more to do with all their respective characters.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner tries hard to be many things, a targeting at a mass market appeal that worked wonders for its financial success at local cinemaplexes and will no doubt work wonders for its shelf life in rental stores and in local's homes, fans that love nothing more than some patriotic tinged locally produced goodies. For fans of well-made cinema however, this is a hugely disappointing and only barely acceptable debut by Crowe, that suggests he has a long way to go before he reaches the heights of the directors his worked for.<br/><br/>2 games of train cricket out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","Just another of Russell Crowe's self indulgent movies. The Ottoman Empire picked the wrong Allie during WW1 (Germany) and we are expected to feel that we Australians were the aggressors. From 1915 to 1921 the Ottoman Empire eliminated 1,000,000 of their neighbor's namely Assyrians and Greeks yet in Crowe's movie the Greeks are type cast as the bad guys. What a load of crap! The final escape by Crowe and his last surviving son was ludicrous with the invading Greeks mortaring the hillside just to blow up two non military and non Turkish individuals. Prior to that, in the train scene, Crowe managed to escape his Greek captives by hitting them with a cricket bat despite the fact that he had numerous weapons at his disposal. It is disappointing that in the 100th year anniversary of the Gallipolli campaign this over rated New Zealander can muddy the water and try to change the facts for the sake of making a few cheap bucks."

","Crowe has done a marvellous job in all respects. The history is just touched on and is subsumed by the narrative, as it should be for an entertainment. Nevertheless the Gallipoli campaign was not merely a bloody folly as Crowe would have it. British Prime Minister Asquith put this into perspective in a speech in 1915.Even although he admitted that there have been failures and shortcoming on our side, he drew attention to the probabilities had the attack not been launched. ""These words must have the effect of toning down the disappointment of troops on the Peninsula, who have striven so earnestly and brilliantly to attain the whole object and have had to admit to a certain amount of failure.""<br/><br/>Mr. Asquith tells us, ""that had the invasion of Gallipoli had not been attempted, Turkey would have undoubtedly marched on Egypt; our greatly successful operations in Mesopotamia would not have been realised and our interests in the Persian Gulf would have been hampered. The Russians would have probably been ousted from the Caucasus and no doubt the Balkan States menace would have been far more serious, even that it is now. So in the face of all that, we have no reason to feel disappointment...we are keeping two hundred thousand Turks from doing any damage in another part of the war zone."" Kemal Ataturk is briefly mentioned and the Turko-Greek conflict skated over with not too much background for the uninitiated. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, a great film.<br/><br/>Did I see a modern 9mm submachine gun with a perforated barrel in the train battles with the Greeks?

So I would do the same criticism if any other people was depicted negatively."
"l_rawjalaurence","5","31","68","6 January 2015"," Thoroughly Disappointing Gallipoli Tale
","The intention behind Russell Crowe's film, based on true events, is a noble one; to remind contemporary viewers of the horrors of the Gallipoli campaign, the hundredth anniversary of which takes place this year (2015), and to show how ANZAC and Turkish troops set aside their differences and embarked on a collective effort to disinter the hundreds of thousands of corpses buried on the battlefield and give them a decent burial and/or tomb.<br/><br/>Sadly there is a world of difference between intention and execution. Filmed in Turkey and Australia, THE WATER DIVINER manages to include every possible stereotype about Turkey into its 111-minute running time, save, perhaps the hubba-bubba pipe (or nargile) and an aerial shot of the Bosphorus. There is the sound of the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer (which Connor (Russell Crowe)); the hordes of veiled women peopling the teeming streets; the violent uncle Omer (Steve Bastoni) wanting to take revenge on Conor in the belief his honor has been impugned; and the ritual scene of relative-beating, in which Omer assaults Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko). If Crowe had wanted to make a film advertising the country as repressive and arcane in its rituals, he couldn't have done a better job.<br/><br/>Other stereotypes have along history going all the way back to BODYLINE (1984). In that never-to-be-forgotten miniseries about the English cricket tour to Australia in 1932-3, Hugo Weaving played English player Douglas Jardine with lip-curling relish; here was a villain to savor. The same applies to Jai Courtney's Lt. Col. Cyril Hughes in THE WATER DIVINER; sans any redeeming features, he regards both ANZAC and Turkish troops with contempt. His British accent wavers somewhat, but we are left in no doubt that Crowe blames British imperialists for the mess created both during and after the Gallipoli campaign had ended. While his interpretation is certainly valid, the use of stereotyping seems superfluous.<br/><br/>Nor do the Turkish actors escape a certain amount of stereotyping. Yilmaz Erdogan does what he can with the role of Major Hasan, as he emphasizes the fact that the Turkish army was only trying to defend its territory against foreign colonizers. However Cem Yilmaz's Jemal veers towards caricature, his use of grimaces alternating with smiles proving once again that Yilmaz is a far better stand-up comedian than film actor.<br/><br/>The film's shortcomings do not end there. Although ostensibly taking place in Anatolian Turkey, much of the action has obviously been filmed in Australia. The daylight scenes - especially those taking place in summer - lack the intense looks of a Turkish summer, while the landscape is far too fertile to stand in for the Anatolian plains. Crowe also includes scenes of breathtaking incongruity; at one point he is shown enjoying a candlelight dinner with Ayshe, something that would have been hardly likely to happen in late Ottoman times, especially with a married woman and a protective family dedicated to restricting her freedom of movement.<br/><br/>THE WATER DIVINER looks and feels like a foreigner's view of Turkish history, one that lacks sensitivity to other cultures. Anyone looking for an effective representation of the Gallipoli campaign and its consequences in English would be better advised to watch Peter Weir's GALLIPOLI (1981), or more recently, ALL THE KING'S MEN (1999)."

","The Water Diviner is about a man who travels to eastern Thrace and Anatolia after the Battle of Gallipoli to try and find his three missing sons. The premise of an Australian wandering around western Anatolia in 1920-21 is itself incredulous. The story deals (in part) with the Anzac prisoners-of-war of the Ottoman Empire in World War One. The Water Diviner paints indigenous Anatolia Hellenes as barbaric invaders, at one point being labeled ""Satan's army"" by one character. Surviving Anzac prisoners recorded how Hellenes assisted their survival – and in some cases, their escape. The danger of this and other similar films that claim to be ""inspired by actual events"" is that because Crowe is a famous actor, his words are taken as being authoritative. His film may be treated as actual history. The Water Diviner is a film that will undoubtedly offend the descendants of numerous victims and should therefore be condemned. Russell Crowe's film is a distortion of history."

","'THE WATER DIVINER': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut, with this war drama film; about a farmer searching for his missing sons, who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli, four years earlier. Crowe also stars in the movie, as the farmer, and it costars Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan, Cem Yilmaz, Dylan Georgiades, Ryan Corr (of 'WOLF CREEK 2' fame), Jaqueline McKenzie and Jai Courtney. It was written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight; and it's based on the book, of the same name, by Anastasios and his wife, Dr. Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios. I found it to be pretty slow-paced, and clichéd (at times), but it comes to a pretty rewarding conclusion; that almost redeems the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The story begins in Australia, in 1919 (four years after the end of World War I). Joshua Connor (Crowe) is a farmer, and water diviner, that's still obsessing over his three missing sons; who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli. His wife, Eliza (McKenzie), commits suicide; due to the presumed death of their boys. After the loss of Eliza, as well, Joshua decides to travel to Turkey; and bring back his sons.<br/><br/>The film starts out promising, while setting up it's story (and characters), then it becomes really slow-moving (and dull). The movie really takes a turn for the worse, when a war-widowed love interest is introduced, for Crowe (played by Kurylenko). That's when the film gets really clichéd (and corny). It does come to an exciting, and pretty emotionally charged, conclusion though; that almost makes it all worthwhile. Crowe is good in the lead performance, but his directing skills can definitely use some work. I've also read that the movie is incredibly historically inaccurate, and insulting to some (many it appears, actually).

","IF YOU'RE LOOKING for quality productions and thought provoking themes that carry into post-screening over-coffee conversation and well beyond, two new historical dramas topped by A-list stars are just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>""Woman in Gold,"" starring Helen Mirren as a woman determined to reclaim a lost art work stolen by the Nazis, and ""The Water Diviner,"" directed by Russell Crowe and starring him as a father determined to find his three presumed-dead sons following the Battle of the Gallipoli, are those rare films that handle scope and intimacy with equal adeptness.<br/><br/>In 'Gold,"" a British-American production directed by Simon Curtis from a script by Alexi Kaye Campbell, Mirren plays the late Maria Altmann, an aging Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles who enlists a young lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds in a bit of Jimmy Stewart channeling) to fight the government of Austria to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic portrait of her aunt, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"" which was stolen by the Nazis from her relatives just before World War II. Altmann took her fight all the way to the United State Supreme Court _ and Austria.<br/><br/>To say much more would spoil the film, but suffice it to say that the writing, directing and acting are so skillfully rendered that the story is both moving and educational without being maudlin or dull.<br/><br/>Mirren is completely believable as Altmann, and Reynolds opens eyes as young attorney Schoenberg. The supporting cast _ Katie Holmes (as Schoenberg's wife), Daniel Bruhl, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern (as a judge!!) and Jonathan Pryce _ show their respect for the piece and its subject matter through wonderfully understated performances.<br/><br/>The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the Berlin International Film Festival.<br/><br/>""The Water Diviner,"" or ""Last Hope,"" an historical fictional drama, is an Australian production directed by and starring Crowe with a screenplay written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight from a book of the same name by Andrew Anastasios and Dr. Meaghan Wilson- Anastasios.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1919, just after World War I (1914-1918), as Joshua Connor (Crowe), an Australian farmer and water diviner, has discovered ground water on his land and is digging a well. His three sons have left to serve with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at the Battle of Gallipoli five years before and are thought to have been killed in battle.<br/><br/>When Joshua's devastated wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), commits suicide because of the loss, he vows to bring back their bodies and bury them next to hers.<br/><br/>Joshua travels to Turkey and stays in an Istanbul hotel operated by Ayshe (a hauntingly beautiful reed of a woman, Olga Kurylenko), who has been widowed by the war, and grows close to her little son, Orhan (a charming Dylan Georgiades), whose unusual way of bringing Joshua to his mother's hotel is alone worth the price of admission. Ayshe at first is suspicious of Joshua, but after learning about his reasons for being in Turkey, that changes, much to the chagrin of her brother-in-law, who had coveted her as his own.<br/><br/>Ayshe suggests that Joshua bribe a fisherman so he can go to Gallipoli by boat. He does, and upon arriving there, meets all sorts of resistance, especially from the ANZACs, who are taking part in a mass burial detail from which civilians are banned. There he meets Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan in a riveting turn), a Turkish officer who is helping on the mission. The major becomes a friend and ally of Joshua's and we're off to the races.<br/><br/>""The Water Diviner"" at times boasts the kind of lush scope used by director David Lean in films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago,"" and like those films, manages to flesh out both character and story with unusual depth and intimacy.<br/><br/>Both ""Woman in Gold"" and ""The Water Diviner"" give the audience a run for their money, providing a sense of emotional attachment while offering historical perspective and enlightenment."
"diane-34","10","13","25","16 January 2015"," A war movie that is not about war(?).
","As a migrant to Australia of many years I still cannot fathom the Australian patriotism that surfaces when national citing of Gallipoli is mentioned; as many people know it was a defeat packaged in that over- credited brain of the first lord of the admiralty: Winston Churchill. We all know that his use of Australian troops, among others, in an ill- founded attack at Gallipoli which strategically may have been reasonable but tactilely virtually impossible given where the Allied landing occurred.<br/><br/>With this monumentally futile battle as the background a father returns to the actual battlefield after the war to find the bodies of his three sons who never returned to Australia and their parents. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a film about war but has a minimum of scenes of the warfare elements. It is a film about the search, definitely, but it is also about what he finds in that country so far away with people that are far away from his own parochial patch of farmland on the desert's edge in NSW.<br/><br/>I thought the film was about discovery; the discovery of his missing sons and likewise the discovery, not so much about himself but about a larger world with vastly different people who have their own unique approach to life on this rock. It is a movie of joining and of the realization that we are far closer than the war leaders would like us to understand."

","I enjoyed this movie, I loved the camera work, and it's colour, it's warmth as a story. I enjoyed the essential values of love in the narrative. <br/><br/>Some minor disjointed moments did not destroy an overall excellent effort by the films team. <br/><br/>As an Australian I welcomed the damning portrayal of the.British leadership, a ""leadership"" which led a generation of young Australians to its senseless slaughter. I also enjoyed the humanity of allowing the Turkish soldiers to show their perspective and the depiction of a frustrated Turkish people yearning to throw off centuries of Ottoman decay. <br/><br/>Where the film totally lost me was its clumsy and ignorantly cruel portrayal of one of the twentieth centuries most brutal genocides. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the Greek Army is caricature worthy of the worst of Hollywood ""Cowboy and Indian"" films. This lapse is surprising given the welcome humanisation of the Turkish enemy in the battle scenes. It's as if we can only cope with one moment of generosity per movie and that we always need a simplistic bogey man in the plot. <br/><br/>What really hurt me, on a very deep level, was the filming of a Greek bandit attack on the ""Turkish"" Village late in the movie. The location is, in real life, one of the deserted Greek villages left over after the 1922 genocide and transmigration. <br/><br/>Over 1,500,000 Greek men women and children, including members of my family, were brutally and inhumanely slaughtered in the genocide (not including millions of other ethnicities). <br/><br/>Their ghosts must be perplexed as to why a century later an Australian Film not only forgets them but twists reality so cruelly. <br/><br/>The defence of ""it's only a film"" does not wash. <br/><br/>Imagine if a Japanese Film Company arrogantly made a film actually set in one the WW2 Japanese run prisoner of war camps where Australian prisoners were systematically tortured and murdered. Imagine again if the plot had Australians torturing and killing Japanese prisoners in a distortion of history. <br/><br/>Now multiply that 1,500,000 times.<br/><br/>Filmmakers have a duty of care, if their movie purports to have even a minor historically accurate resonance, the makers of this movie have failed that duty."

","Never heard of this show, and that's sad. With all the junk out there it's too bad this one missed our theaters.<br/><br/>Exceptionally well done and accurate in telling the tragic story of Gallipoli from both the ANZAC (Australia) and Turkish points of view. In that WWI was a totally absurd war with no reason (most wars do have reasons; WW2 was essential etc.) made the entire premise of a father from Australia leaving his farm to find his three sons whose bodies were never found after the campaign a profound premise. <br/><br/>The film mixed in flashbacks to the campaign to win the heights overlooking the Bosphorous Straights between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Churchill was blamed for the naval debacle that occurred (and he bore some culpability but little) but the entire idea of invading Turkey, especially at Gallipoli was insanity that soldiers like the Cooper boys paid for.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent with a host of different characters representing effectively the Australians, British, Turkish, and Greeks. The levels of conflict arising from a nation going from being the once proud Ottoman Empire, to a carved up mess with Islamic State overtones, to a Turkish nationalists movement that led to a secular state that Turkey is today, to the Greek/Turkish war continuation (that actually began long before the siege at Troy with Achilles) is all presented carefully in this film.<br/><br/>Crowe is humorless in this film, but there's not much to smile about as the Gladiator faces his worst fears head on with dignity and determination.<br/><br/>Well done, Russell Crowe. This is a hidden jewel of a movie. The R rating is a soft R at best and is only there for a few bits of war time violence that isn't much different that television violence. No profanity, no sex or nudity or drugs. Recommended for teenagers to understand the realities and tragedies of history and war. Recommended for all adults as a gripping mystery and adventure in historical fiction."

","I went to this film with high hopes, having seen so many good reviews. I was very disappointed. The film did not flow, it was just a bunch of short scenes joined up with no particular segue. The Turkish kid was so annoying (we are expected to believe that RC could find his way through a strange city chasing a kid he constantly loses sight of, then he ends up in the right place), the romance was totally unnecessary and took up too much time in the movie, the British were badly stereotyped (yes I know they were not the good guys). And divining the graves of his sons in such a large battle field, come off it. The bullet hole in the back of the skull was in the wrong place. So many parts of the story did not make sense or were impossible on closer scrutiny. And lastly, why set the beginning in north west Victoria and film it in South Australia, the countrysides are totally different. Maybe I am just too fussy but I kept seeing glaring errors throughout.<br/><br/>This could have been a great movie - it was a fairly good idea. Shame."
"Leofwine_draca","4","14","29","14 August 2016"," Russell Crowe's love letter to the Turks
","THE WATER DIVINER is a family drama set in the years following Australia's disastrous foray into WW1, the Gallipoli campaign. Russell Crowe plays a grieving father whose three sons all vanished, presumed dead, in the battle. Spurred by an old battle diary he decides to travel to Turkey to find out the fate of his offspring for himself.<br/><br/>This is a film that seems to have been devised as an ill-conceived history lesson for Australian viewers. Certainly as a movie it's not very interesting, lacking life and vision. There are a handful of flashback battle sequences in the film which play out all the clichés, and the present day material involving Crowe's character isn't very good. His romance with Olga Kurylenko (utterly out of her depth in her attempt to play a Turk), clumsily shoehorned into the story, is quite laughable.<br/><br/>Elsewhere this veers between maudlin introspection and old-fashioned jingoism. What's most surprising is the blatant way this film whitewashes history, with each country being stereotyped to basic levels. The British are humourless, dour, and unfriendly; the Greeks are evil; the Aussies are gentle and heroic; the Turks are misunderstood. It's basic stuff indeed and portrays certain events in surprising ways given the complexity of the real-life historical situation. The climax is as predictable as they come, and although Crowe employs decent cinematography in his directorial debut, he just doesn't have the power to bring a lacklustre script to life."

They don't need those bones any more and you don't either.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in an Australian desert with Russell Crowe digging a well and finding water. This is a clever foreshadowing to future events.<br/><br/>Fast froward to Turkey where Thousands of soldiers have lost their lives in a wartime battle covering miles of ground. 3 of those dead were Crowe's sons. He has sneaked in the battlefield where other soldiers who also have nothing better to do, are collecting bones and supposedly identifying them, although nothing is explained how they are attempting to do that. <br/><br/>Next we see Crowe looking for his son's bones the way he did with a divining stick looking for water back in Australia and viola, he sticks the wood in the ground and proclaims that is where his son's bones are.<br/><br/>Sure enough, a soldier finds a watch of one of the boys on that spot.<br/><br/>Sure enough that is where I stopped watching.

","This movie screened on free to air TV in Sydney last night- only a few months after it was released at the cinema, which must be a record. One of the backers was channel 7 so I guess that explains that. Anyway Its a great film despite a few flaws, mostly technical. I noticed a few camera flashes (is that what that's called?) early in the film- and the scene where Russell strikes water he has cotton wool in his left ear (not sure if that was intentional IE to protect the actor from infection or something the character would have done) the cotton wool isn't in his ear in the next scene) Anyway- very minor flaws. Like a lot of Australians- my grandfather was at Gallipoli so anything on this subject will always get a strong emotional response from me. The acting was excellent- Olga K once again showing what a great actor she is. The Turkish cast, including the boy were all excellent. And its good to see it shown in a mainstream film how things were for the Turkish people- after all they lost over 70,000 in that battle- it is an event of obvious great importance to the Turkish people. Yes- there have been better films about Gallipoli but this takes it to a very personal level about a father grieving for his sons- I assume nothing is known about the rest of the real story that the film is based on - we will never know what happened to the father who went there to find his sons body, so apart from that element, I assume the rest of the story is a fiction- and an excellent one it is too. Good to see on screen at last respect for our Turkish friends.Its their country and we should not have been there. Its now holy ground for both Australian and Turk."
"margosanci","8","9","17","18 March 2015"," Why using colored screen?
","The movie is an art, or it should be... One-dimensional, one-sided, one-directional film like this one has too much color, too much noise. The story about Great War, guided by the fairytale carpet and the storm of emotions, can not have another burden. Simply, it is too heavy. Many other art directors left their work in black&white mode, in piece with the victims, because in the end they are all victims, victims of an unimaginable horror called war. This one can also be blue&white, like our brain perceives the water... Like you should not ""invade a country if you don't know where it is"", you should not make a movie about the people, nations, its cultures, languages and history connections, if you do not know them. The victims are everywhere, why measuring the ground under their feet, why choosing the side, why choosing the language, why measuring them at all? The life is one that matters. All war movies should be remainders of it. You can confront the ideas, the principles, but not the nations (war already done it). This film licks the wound to someone, and for the others makes it deeper. That war, unfortunately is not over yet. The chance of ending it, is in the heart and mind of the people who outlived, who survived. The hope and the quest of one man in this film defies the war and its meaninglessness. But, I will repeat it: every movie needs to be art, not a tool in someone's hands."

The Turks denying almost a full century the genocide of Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians, they will love the movie as historically correct.

"mmsbk","8","14","30","28 December 2014"," Pretty fine movie overall ( spoilers)
","One thing I believe this movie does well is the portrayal of the Turks as a complex, cultured people. The excellent actor Yilmaz Urdogan is a major player in this of course, but credit must go to Russell Crowe for his direction, and though he has himself starring, he is a generous lead actor and not at all afraid of portraying a character less than utterly heroic. The almost supernatural element of his water divining and , by extension, the ability to know where his sons fell was fine by me, I don't need total realism to like a movie or a book . Where I found it less than likely in an unacceptable way was around the finding of the surviving son. If one is to believe he was so damaged and guilt ridden as to give no word - at all - for four years - to parents (whom he knew loved him greatly) then I find his apparent sudden and complete return to normalcy on meeting his father completely unlikely. Granted he confessed and explained and was forgiven but that might have been done by letter years before . He seemed so returned to normal as to be able to make little jokes even . Not believable to my mind. Also a false note, I thought, was connected to Ayshe's son. It was clearly a cultured, middle class family , even if a little short of money. I found it unlikely she would have allowed him to be down at the docks touting for customers. He'd have probably loved it, being just at the age to be adventurous and want to feel useful. I just think she would have been less than happy about it. And his conventionally-minded uncle certainly would ! And while I'm discussing what IMO were weaker parts, I could actually have done without a the love story angle, which felt like an addition for box office purposes, though a well executed one admittedly . I really liked the gravity and dignity with which they both approached each other however, and I am always more moved by a gesture and a intimate smile than the tearing off of clothes. So well done, if superfluous, if that makes sense .<br/><br/>All in all, a good Boxing Day movie and I am glad to have seen it and glad to find Russell is still my favourite leading man !"
"howard.schumann","8","8","15","3 May 2015"," Strikes a universal chord
","""Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes"" - Wilfred Owen, Anthem for Doomed Youth <br/><br/>In 1915, Australian and New Zealand (Anzac) soldiers formed part of the expedition that set out to capture the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey in order to open the Dardanelles to the allies with the ultimate objective of capturing Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire, an ally of Germany. It was a campaign in which over 50,000 allied troops were killed including 8,000 Australians. Directed by Russell Crowe from a screenplay by Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios, The Water Diviner, an Australian-Turkish co-production, was released in conjunction with the 100-year anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli which is celebrated in Australia as an event of national pride even though it led to a military defeat.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner focuses on Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe, ""Noah""), an Australian farmer who uses his skills as a dowser or water diviner to attempt to find his three sons who were reported killed at Gallipoli. Without any historical or background information to guide us, the film thrusts us directly in the battlefield where Turkish troops wait in the trenches, ready to advance to positions that have been abandoned by Anzac soldiers. It then shifts to a time before the war when Joshua, his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie, ""Beneath Hill 60"") and three sons, Art (Ryan Corr, ""Wolf Creek 2""), Edward (James Fraser, ""Sleeping Beauty""), and Henry (Ben O'Toole) are enjoying life at Connor's farm in Victoria. It is before the boys, encouraged by their father, leave to join the Australian army out of a sense of patriotic duty.<br/><br/>Fast forward four years to 1919 where we watch as Joshua successfully finds a water well on his arid land using his skill as a dowser, a centuries old practice that uses a divining rod or other device to point towards an area where there is water or other objects. It is a skill that requires psychic ability as well as a strong knowledge of topography. Sadly, we soon learn that Connor and his wife are mourning the loss of their three boys, missing and presumed dead in the war. In a poignant scene, Joshua, on his wife's urging, agrees to read the book Arabian Nights to the boys, but all we see is Joshua speaking to three empty beds.<br/><br/>After a further tragedy strikes the family, a heartbroken Connor leaves Australia for Turkey where he hopes to use his intuitive powers to locate his sons' bodies at Gallipoli and bring them home for a consecrated burial. When he arrives in Istanbul, he is met by a precocious ten-year-old boy, Orhan, wonderfully performed by young Melbourne actor, Dylan Georgiades. The boy dutifully steals his luggage and leads Joshua to a hotel where he is reluctantly given lodgings by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko, ""To the Wonder""), a widowed Turkish innkeeper who still views Australians as the enemy.<br/><br/>When Ayshe sees that her son relates to Joshua better than he does his overbearing uncle Omer (Steve Bastoni, ""Drift""), she warms up to him and good chemistry begins to develop. Though told by the occupying British officers that he is not allowed to visit the battlefield, Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan, ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"") and Sergeant Cemal (Cem Yilmaz, ""Coming Soon""), leaders of the Turkish army helping the ANZAC ""Grave Unit"" find missing soldiers, military officers, smooth the way for Joshua to go to the restricted zone. It is there that he makes a surprising and life-changing discovery.<br/><br/>Bolstered by the vivid cinematography of Andrew Lesnie (Oscar winner for his work in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" and a frequent collaborator with Peter Jackson), The Water Diviner is an honest and heartfelt effort that shows in human terms the futility of war and the devastating effects it has on families. It is marked by outstanding performances by Yilmaz Erdogan, Olga Kurylenko, and especially by Russell Crowe, who, in an understated way, carries the burden of every father who has lost children in war.<br/><br/>Though the film develops complex characters such as Major Hasan, it also contains some unfortunate stereotypes such as the Turks as noble and heroic, the British as pompous and arrogant, and the Greeks as merciless, marauding bandits. In spite of its tendency towards oversimplification, however, the heart of the film is the simple and personal story of a father's love for his sons. It is a story that is not afraid to show a connection between former enemies, a connection that strikes a universal chord in those who long for peace."

Elegant, compassionate, multi-faceted, elevating, intimate, vigilant . . . these are some of the words that come to mind when reflecting on this work. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the music very much; Russell wrote and produced the ending credits song. He tells a good story about how the song manifested at the 11th hour via Skype and several European countries.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, full of emotion that Russell captures with beautiful close-up shots.

I applaud him for his leadership, and respect for the art.

"raiderhayseed","7","15","33","11 January 2015"," The Water Diviner Discovers a Flaw in Australia's National Myth
","""The Water Diviner"", Russell Crowe's first attempt at directing a film, opened the day after Christmas and within a week, Australian cinema goers made it the biggest grossing Australian film for 2014. Money talks, and the critics are grudgingly acknowledging its success. (It was popular in Turkey too) But their praise is muted.For exampleThe Water Diviner is far from perfect Its main failing is that it tries to be too many things it feels like you've watched three or four different movies.<br/><br/>I beg to differ. To me it seemed like the film was propagating a very simple yet radical view of Australian history. It's one that I have been thinking about for some time. It is a view whose expression will mark one out as mad, bad and dangerous to know. Unless, of course, you can wrap it up in a rattling good yarn, as Crowe and his writers have succeeded in doing admirably.<br/><br/>So I will start by mentioning my maternal grandfather. He fought in the first World War, in Europe rather than Turkey, before being wounded, sent home and conceiving my mother before the armistice had been declared. <br/><br/>My mother said he, like so many of his fellow soldiers, refused to talk about his war experiences. <br/><br/>Albert Facey, a survivor of the Gallipoli expedition and author of ""A Fortunate Life"", a best selling memoir, was rather more forthcoming about his experiences. However, when talking about his fellow Australians who were not there, he said (287), ""Some men who did not go got a rough time, but we never said anything to them because we thought they had some brains. I would have stayed behind if I had known""<br/><br/>My grandfather had a few of things in common with Albert Facey. They were both wounded in the first world war, they both had their first encounters with the girls they would marry in the tea rooms in Boans, Perth's biggest department store and both of them outlived their wives.<br/><br/>The film opens with the Turkish army, advancing against the armies that have invaded their country only to discover that they have retreated after a bloody war that has achieved nothing other than to hasten the already inevitable decline of the Ottoman Empire. The post war Greek incursions into Turkey to take chunks of its territory for themselves forms the backdrop to the film.<br/><br/>So why were the Australians invading a country that was no threat to them in 1915?<br/><br/>There is a disturbing answer to that question.<br/><br/>When Connor (Russell Crowe) intervenes in a fight between the film's charismatic love interest, Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her brother, she remonstrates with him, saying that Australians involve themselves in other peoples wars for no good reason. Connor does it again, taking the side of the Turkish commander whose actions led to the death of his sons, against the invading Greek armed forces.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of cant, masquerading as history, taught to Australian school children, about Australia becoming a nation of the shores of Gallipoli. <br/><br/>The real reason the Australians were there was an ill-founded belief that the military might of the British Empire had to be defended at all costs, because Australia's very existence depended on that remaining the case. During World War II, when it became clear that this was no longer the case, Australia found a new master to serve - the USA. The nonsensical and disastrous post war military adventures of the USA, have all been aided and abetted, small part, with Australian troops. Or as Ayshe said, Australians involving themselves in other peoples wars for no good reason<br/><br/>During World War II, the Australian prime minister turned back the boats that were transporting Australian soldiers at the whim of the British prime minister (who had been the architect of the Gallipoli landing) to some foreign theatre of war, and brought them back to thwart the previously unstoppable Japanese army's southward progress through New Guinea. That should have been the cause for national myth building and solemn remembrance. That should have been the genesis of a proud and militarily self reliant Australian nation.<br/><br/>Canberra Times editor at large, Jack Waterford, wrote about an Australian senior Defence Department bureaucrat seconded to work at the US Pentagon. He jokingly asked the Americans with whom he was working what they thought of Australia. After the platitudes such as ""old friends, steady and reliable allies, close companions who have stood along side us in tough times, etc"", he asked them what they really thought. There was a silence, then one of them said, ""we think you are an easy lay"".(26 July 2014)<br/><br/>That is the kind of relationship a pimp has with his whores.<br/><br/>I have been critical of the way in which the nation state of Israel has conducted itself since 1967, but it has to be admitted that they have developed a proud and militarily self reliant national mythology in a way that Australia has failed to do.<br/><br/>So, far from trying to be too many things, The Water Diviner, has made a bold statement about the craven lack of self reliance that has infected the Australian national spirit. And it has done that in a way that has had Australians flocking to the cinemas to enjoy a rattling good yarn. That's something of a coup for Crowe and his collaborators to have pulled off, if you give any credence to my take on film."

There is no consistency in the script, scenery has been set as in contemporary Turkish mini series, with aesthetics like Mexican TV series. Characters' development lack essence and complexity. Schematic plot, holds the viewers interest loose. Some interesting battle scenes and that's all. So same that Erdogan, a class A Turkish actor, known by Ceylan's films, is in the set. Russel Crow, should do himself a favor and stay out of directing (and cheap policy) from now on. See 1982's, Peter Wier's film with Mel Gibson, instead."

","Overall rating: 4 stars Cinematic value: 4 stars Family value: 2.5 stars<br/><br/>'The Father loves the Son' - John 3:35<br/><br/>Joshua Conner (Russell Crowe) is an Australian farmer who has an uncanny knack for finding water in desolate places. In the story of The Water Diviner , he is a man on a different type of quest. Conner is a father on a mission to find his sons. The boys had followed in the path of many Australian young men of that era and had gone off to fight on the shores of Gallipoli in World War I. To the best of his knowledge, his three sons were dead, Connor had promised his wife is to bury them in the consecrated soil of Australia. Conner goes to Turkey to search for his boys and comes in contact with Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), who manages the hotel that he will stay in throughout his search. Ayshe and her son, Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) help Conner in understanding the nuances and beauty of this exceptionally foreign culture. Many challenges confront him as he works through the bureaucracy of the British military, the Turkish culture and the emotions surrounding the loss of his sons. Throughout his experience, he begins to see that his loss is measured against all of the tragedies of war, those that occurred to other Australians and especially to the Turkish people. Through a series of events surrounding his search, he comes in contact with the leader of the Turkish forces, Major Hasan or better known as the Assassin (Yilmaz Erdogan). There relationship is adversarial at first, but they soon become friends on this journey of finding the souls buried in the ground of the battleground. In the end, they help each other in finding what they seek in the wasteland of Gallipoli and in their own hearts. <br/><br/>Being Russell Crowe's first directorial effort, there was an obvious wisdom of staying close to his homeland and telling a story that is close to the heart of Australians. It is a film that depicts the tragedies of war, but at the heart of the story is a man's love for his family and his desire to find them. This is a universal tale that transcends cultural heritage. Anyone who sees this film can connect with the characters, regardless of the awareness of the historical components involved. The story is based on a novel that that relates to actual events following the war. Crowe does an admirable job of directing the storyline and delving into the heart of the human condition. As an actor, he manages to get draw us into the story and get great performances out of his cast. These are the best works for many the film, including Olga Kurylenko, Ryan Corr (Not Suitable for Children) and Jai Courtney (Divergent, Jack Reacher), but Crowe's performance was the one to take into consideration. The storyline contains a quest and in it he seems to find himself. He utilises the beautiful canvas of the Australian and Turkish landscapes and manages to bring forth a wonderful artistic work of a father's love and forgiveness. Crowe travels through the story and throughout his search for his sons and he comes to realise that war has victims on many fronts. He should be commended for his maiden directorial venture, but needs to be recognised for finding the Russell Crowe that most came to love throughout his career in films like Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind. <br/><br/>The Water Diviner is a wartime film and there are gruesome battle scenes, but they are necessary for the sake of the story. These should not deter people from going to see this film. The over use of the Gallipoli tale can become wearisome at times, but it is merely the backdrop for a wonderful film. There are obvious challenges and stretches in believability throughout the film, but the overarching narrative of this man's love for his family will grab the hearts of all and make up for any weaknesses in the story. The deeper considerations of a man wrestling with loss and his anger with God helps to bring forth the authenticity of the cinematic experience. He does not come to terms with this battle in the film, but his unrelenting drive to find his sons has many Biblical underpinnings. One of the key themes of the Bible is the relentless pursuit that God the Father has for mankind. In studying this them in more detail helps to understand the hearts of mankind and a father's love for their family, regardless of the difficulty of the experiences of life. On its own, this is a beautiful story of a father searching for his sons, but the value of the film is found in the multiple layers of the story which brings forth a rich cinematic experience. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Call me sentimental, but I loved this film. It was not a perfect film, but Crowe managed to find himself in the making of this film. The man that grabbed our attention in Gladiator has come back and found himself in this endearing Australian tale. It may only grab the attention of Australians, but he manages to get the best out of all of cast involved and direct a fine film of a father's love and hope. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film?

","I had little knowledge of this movie before going to see it. I went in with a little skepticism. Almost all movies I see now have some type of agenda. Pro-War, Anti-war, Pro-Liberal, Pro-Muslim, Pro-Christian, Pro-Conservative, etc...everything has an agenda. This movie, I felt, had none, except for a little victimization of muslims. It was simply about history and facts and just one father's search for his sons. In that search, we come across some Turks who have lost as much as he had. The movie doesn't focus on politics. Its just about the people in the aftermath. Now Im not talking about the relatives of suicide bombers or bad people/terrorists, but just regular people and their relatives that fight in the wars that their country asks them to fight in. There were a few points where the female Muslim defended her beating by saying she hit him first, but that was a Hollywood ""bone"" where the Muslim brother was justified in beating the woman. The movie ultimately shows the muslims as being victimized by the greeks and the British Empire, but it is what it is. Great movie."

Making victims from turks is completely inaccurate in this film. Whoever watches this film, please, please, please, consider it just like a scenario, just a fake but ""interesting-like"" story and not a true flow of history.

I am a teenager who certainly did not want to spend her Saturday evening watching a movie about war, but at the end I really liked it.I loved the fact that it was mostly unbiased since not a lot of movies these years have that about them. The people of the Middle Eastern countries are always bad people and Muslim people are always terrorists is what is generally portrayed in movies today. But that was not the case in The Water Diviner. The Water Diviner displayed the idea that people of different countries, different places can unite. That a person shouldn't be defined by the country they're from.I think this was both an excellent and a very educational movie that had just the right amount of sentiment and action. I congratulate Russel Crowe and all the actors of The Water Diviner and hope you watch this movie."
"gradyharp","10","6","11","12 September 2015"," 'Because he is the only father who came looking.'
","As written by writers Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios and directed by Russell Crowe, THE WATER DIVINER is one of the most profoundly moving stories about the devotion between fathers and sons that has been placed before us on the screen. The photography in both Australia and Turkey is astonishingly beautiful and the interplay between past actions and current circumstances that create this story is sensitively interwoven, emphasizing the passionate need for re-connection even after war has torn a family asunder.<br/><br/>Based on real events, the story opens in Australia in 1915 where we find Connor (Russell Crowe) divining for water and successfully discovering a hard won well. He returns to his farmhouse and we meet his wife Natalia (Isabel Lucas) whose mind has been damaged by the loss of her three sons away at war – the Battle of Gallipoli. She pleads with Connor to find them, not admitting to herself that they are war casualties – a state of mind that eventually leads to her suicide. After burying his wife he promises her he will find their sons and he travels to Turkey to gain permission to get to Gallipoli, believing that his water divining powers will help him find their graves. He meets with obstruction form the English and Australian military (Jai Courtney) still mopping up after the horrendous defeat by the Turks and gains help from a compassionate Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmas Erdogan) and his assistant Sgt Jemal (Cem Yilmaz). Meanwhile while awaiting papers to gain permission to go to Gallipoli Connor stays in a 'hotel' in Istanbul where he meets hotel manager Ayshe (a brilliant Olga Kurylenko) and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgiades). The relationship is strained because Connor represents the 'enemy' (Australian) but there is a chemistry that sparks and a tenderness and mutual help results. Connor ultimately is allowed to go to Gallipoli ('Hope's a necessity where I come from'), finds the bones of two of his sons, but the third is missing – he was taken prisoner – and it is this remaining live son that binds the story of the love between the Connor, his deceased sons and his deceased wife together in an ending that will gnaw at the emotions long after the film is over.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent with Russell Crowe in an especially brilliant and subtle performance. THIS is an Oscar worthy film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 15"
"ferguson-6","5","8","16","25 April 2015"," The Father who went Looking
","Greetings again from the darkness. The lure of the director's chair is sometimes too much for A-list actors to avoid. We have watched Mel Gibson, Angelina Jolie and Kevin Costner have success behind the camera, and now we get Russell Crowe with a story tied to his roots in Australia. The film is scheduled to open in conjunction with the 100th Anniversary of ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), a day of national pride and remembrance.<br/><br/>Mr. Crowe also stars as Connor, an Australian farmer with a gift for finding water sources in the outback – hence the title. Connor and his grieving wife lost all three of their sons in the Battle of Gallipoli, when Britain and Allies invaded Turkey, resulting in the death of more than 100,000. Four years after the battle, Connor is forced to try and fulfill the promise he made his wife  travel to Turkey, find the bodies of their sons, and bring them home for proper burial.<br/><br/>Director Crowe, working with Oscar-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), delivers a film that looks exceptional  both in its widescreen vastness and beauty, as well as its more intimate moments (though the heavy dose of amber glow is a bit too much early on). Flashbacks play a key role and the battle scenes are brutal and realistic, as is a monstrous sandstorm that engulfs the young sons in a moment designed to convince us that Connor was a protective father, and carries the guilt of allowing them to fight the war.<br/><br/>Connor's trip into Turkey allows for the clash of cultures, as he is truly an unwelcome guest and a proverbial fish out of water. If not for the enterprising young boy that guides him through some tough spots, Mr. Connor's trip may have been short-lived. Instead he struggles through clashes with the British, the Greeks and especially Turkish Major Hasan (an excellent Yilmaz Erdogan).<br/><br/>While the cultural and personality clashes are entertaining, the stereotypes and simplifications are somewhat tougher to accept. A romantic interlude with the hotel owner (Olga Kurylenko) is maybe the most out-of-place segment of a dramatic movie we have seen in awhile. Crowe and Kurylenko are both fine actors, but this makes little sense and distracts from Connor's mission. We can only assume the Producers demanded a little romance to offset the downbeat war segments and cash in on Crowe.<br/><br/>Crowe shows promise as a director, and if the film has any box office success, we can hope he will have a bit more input into what stays and what goes in his next project."

Its a beautiful country and this movies does it justice. The story as well is entertaining and well told. Russell has done a good job with such serious and heavy going subject matter.<br/><br/>Movie goes out of its way to acknowledge and show the Turkish side. Full credit for that especially coming from Australia which often brushes over this. Sadly failed to acknowledge the other allies that were fighting alongside the Anzacs which suffered terrible casualties as well. I appreciate this was about the Anzacs but it made out as though they were the only ones involved so an opportunity missed to truly educate everyone as to exactly what happened. The token British toff thrown in to rub salt into the wound of the thousands of British, french, canadians, kiwis etc that died in the campaign as well. <br/><br/>The overall casualties were shown at the end but no mention that they were not all Anzacs. I appreciate its Hollywood and historical accuracy is not their strong point. But given the outstanding efforts made to show the Turkish side fairly I think this was poor.

","I think Russell Crowe did a good job and found a catchy story that impresses the audience. The story is focused on two geographical locations which are Gallipoli and Aegean regions which were invaded by the foreign armies. Armenian genocide took place in some other regions of the then empire. Actually there were countless Armenian and Greek soldiers fighting in Gallipoli against the Allies. <br/><br/>There are many movies telling the story of the genocide. The peoples of the middle east and Balkans are obsessed with their official history rhetoric. But they should at least understand that whether or not the losing side the Turks lost many people including millions of civilians. Death should not be deemed unfair when only the members of a specific ethnicity dies. The rulers are responsible of the losses of every fighting side.

Cause it was a good film, the flow of the movie was somehow forced, different pieces of the movie could not constitute a whole in my opinion, and it was due to the need to tell as much as possible in a limited amount time. But still acting, the story, scripts were above average. Now, lets talk about haters ""read some history"" propaganda. I am not gonna say Turks were the complete victims, genocide claims are totally empty and so forth. All of these arguments have some valid points from academic point of view.<br/><br/>Ottoman Empire had harbored many nations; although the word ""nation"" and what it represents are very newly formed concepts in history (depends on the nationalism movement in 18th history). Moreover, just read and accept this, nationalism is a sociologically constructed human made concept, it has absolutely no biological foundation. And OK, Ottoman Empire had its faults and different practices during its time history, but seriously consider Europe between 1400-1800, just to say ""the world is a sphere"" was enough to spend you life in jail. So, saying something like ""for like years we were crushed and forced into sudden and unexpected practices"" does not justify brutish approach and it certainly does not mean Turk cannot be victims after.<br/><br/>OK you know International Institute of Social History; it is an archive on social history and an independent scientific Institute founded in 1935. Read ""Turkey. A Modern History"" by Erik-Jan Zürcher if you somehow manage to spare your precious time, he was the head of the institute for 15 years. It is one of the most objective approaches you can find for Turkish history. There, apart from everything else (including Genocide claims of Armenians), you would see that the events in gallipoli war was not really that different from what you see in the film. So, instead of ranting on saying things like ""I am oh so so angry, cannot write, so angry, cannot see, crap this is, ohh very angry, Greeks and Armenians are the victims always, Turks are always the oppressors always, ohh angry"", get out of your high school history books and make real research for once in your incredibly valuable life."

"Likes_Ninjas90","Null","11","27","21 December 2014"," Russell Crowe's emotional performance is often gentle, with lighter shades than expected
","Russell Crowe wants to be loved and accepted. Throughout a distinguished acting career, sometimes marred by off camera incidents, many of his film roles are outsiders looking inwards. The characters he played in Gladiator, Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind are physically and mentally troubled men, detached from their families. Being the part owner of his beloved South Sydney Rabbitohs further highlights his desire for a sense of community and belonging. Perhaps these roles draw from and mirror his transnational experiences, having moved from New Zealand to Australia when he was four. His value for family and community leaves little doubt over why he opted to direct a story about a father in search of his three sons, presumed dead after the First World War. <br/><br/>The Water Diviner is not the masterpiece we were hoping for, or the one the Australian film industry needed, but Russell Crowe's directorial debut shows promise. The film is set in 1919 when Australian soldiers, including Lt-Col Cyril Hughes (Jai Courtney), are aided by Turkish officer Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) to locate the bodies of their fallen men in Turkey. The mental scars on both sides haven't healed yet. At one point in the film Hughes says he can't forgive either side. Meanwhile back in Australia, a water diviner named Connor (Crowe) is living on a property in the harsh, arid desert with his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie). One of his skills is being able to locate water so he can build a well. At home, his wife is in denial about the absence of their three sons, now missing for four years since Gallipoli. Connor pleases his wife by reading The Arabian Nights to the children's empty beds.<br/><br/>Unable to live without her sons, Eliza drowns herself. Connor is not a religious man and Father McIntyre (Damon Herriman) is reluctant to give a blessing to her burial because her death was suicide. Connor vows he will travel overseas to find bodies of his children and bury his entire family together. After travelling to Turkey, he stays in a hotel run by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), a Turkish woman who lives with her son and ageing father. She isn't ready to accept her husband died during the war and is initially hostile towards Connor for being Australian. But she warms to him when he becomes a father figure to her son. He manages to sneak into Gallipoli, a restricted area, and uses his skills to locate the bodies of two of his sons. While devastated, there is hope his third son Art (Ryan Corr) might still be alive. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe's emotional performance is often gentle, with lighter shades than expected. He's playing a good man whose earnestness, not testosterone, fuels his determination to honour his family. But someone must have suggested sanding Connor's edges to counter the narratives darker components. A significant misstep in Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios' screenplay is not providing Connor with flaws or internal drama. Connor's inevitable courting of Ayshe should reluctantly pull him from his wife. They're both people coming to terms with death. But in corny scenes, including one where they splash water in slow- motion, they don't share as much as a kiss. Further, adding magic elements to an otherwise gritty story seems misplaced. The Arabian Nights is a device, justifying Connor's hyperaware, parental instincts for locating his sons. This should have been the major challenge of the journey. Instead, his battle against red tape for entering Gallipoli and travelling back and forth to Marigold Hotel Turkey stifles the pacing. Due to Olga Kurylenko's highly charged performance the subplot involving Ayshe and her aggressive brother-in-law overshadows the main thread with an interesting cultural dissection of Turkish marriage and legacy. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe receives a pass mark behind the camera. The streets of Turkey are densely populated with extras, although it's a mistake casting glamorous, well-known faces like Isabel Lucas and Megan Gale in cameos. But the technical work of cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) impresses. The overhead shots at the beginning of the film are stunning in capturing the expanse of the bush and applying dry, dusty golden textures as colour filters. On occasions The Water Diviner is also incredibly moving. The flashbacks to the battle scenes are brutal and the violence confronting. It's the uncompromised bravery expectant of an Australian feature. What isn't as honest is the film's identity. Its rhythms and scale are disjointed, jumping from slow, intimate moments into Indiana Jones action set pieces, which might be the influence of director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour), one of the producers. Moments like an attack on a train are spectacular and energetic, but typify the inconsistent stylisations. It's an uneven film where anti-war sentiments are shared by both sides of battle. Once the dust has settled people unexpectedly find commonality through grief and loss. The current pain shared by Western and foreign cultures, due to modern warfare and terrorism, is more apparent than ever before. Calling this film contemporary or relevant is a tragedy of our times."

","I really tried to like this film, but in the end, I was left with a flat, empty feeling. The characters failed to engage me, emotionally, and this film was littered with clichés. There were moments of good cinematography, but the scenes seemed to flit about more randomly than a bat on ecstasy. The love interest felt very out of place & forced. I was left with a feeling that the producers were trying to cache in on Russell Crowe's sex appeal. In general, this was a poorly directed film, and even more badly edited. However, it should be noted that this was Crowe's directorial debut, so I guess there is potential for improvement."
"tomm-73670","2","9","21","3 June 2015"," Unreal and egotistical
","Sorry, spoilers are necessary to illustrate why this film is so poor.<br/><br/>The world revolves implausibly around the main character. For example, despite being essentially a nobody, the main character (who we shall refer to as superfarmerdadman) induces the regional British military big cheese to personally attempt his deportation. When the love interest appears it's immediately obvious she will have to fall for superfarmerdadman, because she won't stop staring at him. The romance is flat and without character, something the film maker evidently noticed since much of the courting dialog is muted and replaced with music.<br/><br/>A dramatic soundtrack is often used to cover laughably rubbish scenes, for example the horseback escape from the train ambush - which is just shots of 2 blokes riding across the countryside (with an amusing few seconds where we get to stare at a herd of sheep while listening to the end of the world in classical music form).<br/><br/>To the reviewers who gave 9 stars: what do you make of the scene where the Greek army, during an attack on a village, inexplicably single out him and his son, and chase them across the countryside with artillery? Why, in a complex historical setting, is the world turned moth-like towards the shining light of our superfarmerdadman? It smells of childish fantasy to me. The whole film appears an exercise in placing the lead character (played by the director) into the most flatteringly heroic and tragic role possible."
"hypersonic8999","2","9","21","28 May 2015"," Good movie, very shaky on its historicity
","This is a good movie to watch. The direction is good, especially in the battle scenes and the acting is very emotional and spot on. The plot, though predictable, flows in a nice pace. The music is also very well-chosen. The ending is a little weird perhaps, but it's not completely out of place, albeit when someone tries to kill Russel Crowe and someone else.<br/><br/>However, I am dismayed by two things regarding the historicity of the film. Firstly, at the beginning it says ""Based on historical events"". That should read ""loosely based"" because after a while of searching I found zero evidence that the story in the film actually happened, besides an anecdotal story about an Australian father who went to Gallipoli to search for his son, found in an officer's letter. Everything else is up to the film-maker's imagination. Putting the film in a historical period does not mean the film is based on historical events. This is the minor of the two points though.<br/><br/>The more important gripe with historicity, that I have, is the background story that is going on. The Greco-Turkish War was a continuation of the conflicts that Greeks and Turks had during the late years of WW1. The film portrays the Turks as the innocent victims and the Greeks as the invading barbarians who came to slaughter everyone. The Greeks did indeed commit atrocities during that war, and their own government admits it, but the atrocities were hardly contained on one side. In fact, the atrocities first began by the Turks, who carried out the Armenian genocide a few years earlier (and the film was released on the centennial of the Armenian Genocide), and then moved on to other Christian denominations, primarily the Greeks (who were consisting a very large portion of Turkey's population on the west coasts, where the film takes place). Which in contrast to the Greek government, the Turkish government completely denies, despite numerous condemnations from other nations about this. That camp they mention in Afyon, was a concentration camp used for mass murder, from which several ANZAC survivors say they only survived because of the local Greeks who were with them in the camp who helped them survive.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, but these issues annoyed me so much, that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd like to in the end."

","I went to this film with a completely open mind and with no preconceptions or hang-ups about Russell Crowe. All I knew was that it covered the aftermath of the Gallipoli campaign in WW1. The first section of the film is set in Australia and to my mind is the most effective, dealing as it does with the trauma of a family that has lost 3 sons in the war. Anger, blame and guilt are effectively portrayed and the cinematography is stunningly beautiful. It is only when Crowe sets off to Turkey to try and locate the site of his son's deaths that the film begins to go off track and credulity is stretched beyond breaking point. Enter a sweet boy whose mother is also the most beautiful woman in Turkey and you already begin to realise we are being set up for a romantic ending. Add in stereotypical British cad officer with haughty attitude, rough and ready Aussies, good/bad Turkish locals who sing and dance at the drop of a fez and the palate is full and ready to be splashed all over the filmic canvas. The ensuing hunt and chase is reminiscent of Sapper and John Buchan at their Boy's Own worst and as unbelievable. There was a film here that had possibilities but it eventually got lost in the need to make it an action movie. The denouement shows our hero doing the ""and with one leap he was free"" action - literally. This was marginally better than sitting in and watching the Saturday night telly which is not saying much if truth be told. Would I take time to watch it again when it appears on the small screen? No."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After the death of his three sons in the WWI Battle of Gallipoli, devastated by the loss Connor's (Russell Crowe) wife takes her own life. To fulfill her last wish, Connor travels to Turkey to return their sons' bodies back to Australia, their home. The Water Diviner is both well-acted and filmed. The movie fully develops its character while fairly showing the perspectives from both sides affected by the war. It is not without flaws in that it occasionally adds melodrama to the war drama. Still as a whole this is a solid directorial debut by Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I rarely heard people talk about it and I only found out this movie even existed about a month or so ago. Nevertheless, I went in curious to see what Russell Crowe delivers as a director and mostly I liked what he achieved.<br/><br/>The performances in The Water Diviner are really good. That's not surprising from the talented Russell Crowe but Olga Kurylenko did some of her best work here as well. I always thought Kurylenko was a serviceable actress but in this movie she actually shows some range. Asides from the performances, I appreciated the different perspectives that were shown from the people involved in the war. War dramas can at times fall into the trap of painting the different sides black or white. Fortunately The Water Diviner recognizes and presents the fact that both sides have their guilty executioners and innocent victims just caught in the middle of a senseless war. So the delicate handling of such a subject matter should be commended. Also the cinematography of the movie was quite impressive, capturing the life and landscape of the early 1900s Turkey.<br/><br/>What hindered the movie from being great for me were the moments where the movie got a bit too melodramatic. I can't say much without revealing some of the plot points but these were scenes that clearly Crowe wanted the audience to be emotionally affected. However, the scenes are repeated so often or prolonged for so long that they started to lose their effect on me and felt like I was being begged to shed a tear. On top of that, all too often there are so many coincidences, the movie almost becomes a fantasy rather than a serious war drama. These series of coincidences solve many of the problems that Crowe's character faced, wrapping up in a nice little bow. It diminishes any sense of struggle and as a result I ended up being less invested whenever the characters were in danger.<br/><br/>All in all The Water Diviner is a good movie. I just wish the movie wasn't pandering to our emotions and instead let the story unfold more organically. Nevertheless, considering this is the first feature length film as a director for Russell Crowe I am interested to see what he takes on next.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

"YoungCriticMovies","9","7","16","20 April 2015"," Film Diviner: Crowe's Directorial Debut Proves to Be An Extremely Successful One
","Russell Crowe can direct. The Australian actor has transformed himself in one of Hollywood's best, after consecutive roles for which he was Oscar nominated in The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind (he won for Gladiator). He's continued to cement himself as a quality actor with more recent roles in films such as Cinderella Man, Noah, and most recently The Water Diviner. With The Water Diviner Russell Crowe took on the extra role of directing, for the first time. With Crowe's leadership The Water Diviner turns out to be a quality, greatly paced, and very entertaining film.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner is inspired by actual events. It tells the story of an Australian farmer named Connor (Russell Crowe), who lives with his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenize). The couple lives in an extremely dry part of the 1919 Australia, (Region of Victoria) where it rains every so many years. In order to survive and maintain his crops, Connor resorts to a divine ritual that helps him locate underground pockets of water, which he later transforms into wells. At night we see Eliza persuade Connor to ""read to the kids"" after Crowe finishes a chapter of Arabian Nights the camera pans to three empty beds. We soon learn that Connor's three children volunteered to fight for the British in World War I, but they never came back. The last that Connor had heard of them was from the bloody battle of Gallipoli in Turkey; the army had given them up for dead. However, after a drastic turn of events in Australia, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his sons.<br/><br/>What surprised me most was the incredible balance that the film had, it doesn't rely on one facet to carry out its story: the acting was great, the script was witty, and the length and pace were perfect. A first time director is expected to fall on a cheesy and ""safer"" route; inexperienced directors also tend to make longer movies to ""have more to show."" Crowe, however, managed to put together a great team that stayed true to Crowe's and their cinematic beliefs.<br/><br/>The acting is exceptional. What I most appreciated about it was that it came from lesser- known actors. Apart from Russell Crowe, the rest of the cast was comprised mainly of Turkish and Australian actors, amongst which Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan shine out by playing Turkish military officials. We also have notable performances from Jai Courtney, who adds a bit of star power (is known for Divergent, Jack Reacher, A Good Day to Die Hard, and is in the upcoming Terminator: Genysis) but plays a more minor role, and a fantastic Olga Kurylenko (known for Oblivion) who holds her ground against Crowe with a challenging role of a hotel owner who believes her husband (who was also in Gallipoli) is still alive. The actors give each other space, and Crowe resists hogging the screen, this gives the cast and the film the great balance mentioned before.<br/><br/>The script really surprised me. It could have been easy to take this true story and make it extremely cheesy and tacky for the general audiences (like Unbroken did), but the dialogue ended up being extremely smart, daring even to crack a few original jokes. Historically it's also accurate, which gives me a relief since period pieces sometimes sloth over history research. But what worked really well was the unpredictability that the script maintained. At first you start guessing (""oh he's gonna end up with her,"" or ""oh he's going to find his sons and its gonna be all great""), but the script pulls you this way and that so that you end up doubting your predictions and are on the edge of your seat for nearly the whole film. The script also took a bold move in combining a war story with a road story. The film could have messed up the scale and abused one story theme too much, but, again, the film was able to achieve a great balance that ends up being the key to its success. What I especially liked about the script was how it never takes on one biased perspective. It doesn't frame all the English as good and all the Turks as bad. There is a mix of each (just like in real life), and that balance of perspective not only allows for a more believable story, but it also gives proper respect to both historical sides, something not normally seen in Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Overall the film gives us a peek at Russell Crowe's possible directing career. Could he be the next Clint Eastwood? It's a little too early to make such bold predictions but, nonetheless, he's on the right path."

But I was wrong. <br/><br/>This is not yet another war movie. The story is original, about little known face of WW1 covering two sides, one of which gained nothing and the other lost almost everything in the end. Kurylenko and Bastoni are surprisingly good at Turkish roles (this is the first time I've heard discernible Turkish from foreigners in a movie), spot-on Turkish mimics and gestures. Crowe's and the Turkish soldiers' transition from foe to friends was natural, convincing. Carefully sprinkled humor easing out the delicacy of the subject. Not a historical documentary, which is also mentioned in the movie: ""No records. we're Ottoman, not German"", the scene showing piles of documents being burnt (1920s' Middle East was apparently quite chaotic and gloomy). <br/><br/>Obviously there was a pressure to ""keep it under 2 hours"", and given the fact this is an Australian movie (hence 10 min long father-meets-son scene), some other parts progressed very rapidly, making it look like bad editing. I'll be looking forward to an extended cut, with at least 15-20 min more, if there's any. Overall I'm impressed, very good work deserving a solid 8/10"

","The Water Diviner is a very interesting and beautifully-made film, giving an unusual post-war aspect of the well-known Gallipoli story. The production design, cinematography and acting are all excellent and the story (based on an actual event) is a powerful and moving one. Russell Crowe proves himself to be an able director, and the film is well structured and edited. I agree with other reviewers here that it also offers a sensitive and respectful view of Turkish culture. There is rather a lot of violence, both in the 'present' and in the flashbacks, although I realise that it is difficult to make a movie about war without depicting violence.<br/><br/>But unfortunately the whole film is deeply marred by the schmaltzy, unrealistic and frankly unbelievable 'love story' between the Aussie farmer Connor and an impossibly glamorous Turkish woman at the hotel. For me, this completely ruined an otherwise very good film. Sorry, Russell, but you have caved in to the Hollywood demand for soppy romance at the expense of verisimilitude."

I liked the important message depicting the effects of war on all involved not just our own country. An interesting insight into a Turkey itself during that troubled time. I find Russell very watchable and was gripped by the story from beginning to end. I am not ashamed to say I shed a tear or two at a couple of points during the movie, and the scene with the three sons is gut-wrenching to watch to say the least.

","I remember the impact Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"" had on the audience in the suburban cinema where I first saw it in 1981. That battle is so much a part of the Australian national conscience that the affect of the scenes at Gallipoli was electric. Something we had only read about or heard about was brought to life before our eyes.<br/><br/>Now Russell Crowe has made a film that is a companion to that brilliant film except this one is about the impact Gallipoli had on the families the soldiers left behind - on both sides.<br/><br/>Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) journeys to Turkey to search for the bodies of his three sons presumed killed during the attack on Lone Pine. Although meeting resistance from the British and Australian authorities, he is helped by Turks who were in the opposing trenches during the war.<br/><br/>The big surprise is that ""The Water Diviner"" reveals Russell Crowe as a filmmaker with a poetic vision. He has learnt his craft well during his journey through film. Directing a movie as well as acting in it is a big call, but the effort doesn't show, and he has an instinct for big scenes as well as intimate ones. Although ""The Water Diviner"" heads a bit too suddenly into action-adventure territory about two-thirds of the way through, the film is beautifully made and has something to say about loss and the universality of suffering in war.<br/><br/>Crowe intersperses his story with scenes of the Connor boys during the fighting at Gallipoli - rather than historically accurate, they are more impressions of the fighting. However, the film starts with something we haven't seen before when the Turks attack to discover empty trenches after the British and Anzacs have evacuated the peninsular. Another unusual aspect of the film is the depiction of the situation in Turkey after the war with the British occupation force and the war with the Greeks.<br/><br/>I would never complain about Olga Kurylenko being in a movie, but her role and that of her son seems a little grafted onto the story, thankfully her relationship with Joshua is handled with restraint and even subtlety at the end.<br/><br/>""The Water Diviner"" has the same lyrical quality, sharply observed realism, and feeling for time and place that made Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"" so unique - it's a classy piece of filmmaking that touches a nerve."

The search for his sons (which turns out to be much more complicated than anticipated) is quite an emotional journey.

We also see the war from the eyes of Turkish people, who also lost many loved ones in the war, often to Australians. <br/><br/>On the other hand, many of the scenes don't seem written or staged well, giving the movie a rickety sort of feel.

","Russell Crowe, who also directed (this is his debut at the helm), plays Connor, an Australian farmer whose specialty is finding water beneath the land – thus the title. His three sons have died in 1915's battle of Gallipolli, and after his distraught wife commits suicide, he decides to go to Turkey to recover their bones or at least to know their fate. We are now in 1919, the First World War has just ended, but not for Turkey, who has seen its capital Constantinople occupied by Western forces, while its Aegean coast have been invaded by Greece (Greeks are the bad guys in this movie, in one scene they are shown killing defenseless Turkish villagers and in another they treacherously attack Turkish patriots on a train). The English forces are lukewarm to Connor in his quest for his son's remains, but he finds an unlikely help in a Turkish major (played with dignity by Yilmaz Erdogan) who fought on the other side in the battle and thus has a good idea of the circumstances of the deaths of Connor's sons. While in Constantinople, Connor finds lodging in a nice boutique hotel run by the beautiful Ayshe (played believably by the Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband, we eventually learn, has also presumably died in Gallipolli. Connor and Ayshe starts getting close to each other, though no doubt in deference to Turkish sensibilities, the relationship between Connor and Ayshe is never shown as consummated (and frankly, given the conservatism at the time of Turkish society, would it have been believable for an Australian national to have a romantic relationship with an Ottoman woman during this period?)<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect, but it has many praiseworthy aspects, including a wonderful photography and a careful reconstruction of Constantinople, down to the crowded, narrow streets where veiled women and men in their traditional Turkish hats hassled. The film does hit at least a couple of false notes: one particular scene, that I found jarring, has the Crowe character and Ayshe's brother in law (who wishes to marry her and occupy his late brother's place) get into a fist fight over her. The other scene that I did not like, which I won't reveal in detail, appears near the end and it has to do with the ultimate resolution of Connor's quest for his sons. But despite these particular shortcomings, this is an accomplished debut by Crowe."

History tells us after major battles like this, many fallen men on both sides are lost to the earth, nobody knows whose sons they may be and graves remain unnamed or even unmarked. Slow to start, this is not so much a tale of war, but the aftermath. It is a tale of of a man's desperation to find the truth, but his story is a basis for all the the stories to come out of the horrors of war. Russell Crowe did a good job with this, both in his acting and his directing. The film did not shy away from the distressing scenes brought about by the destruction of battle, but what we saw was essential to the story and set everything in place to direct our attention the the search made by a Father for his sons. Beautifully filmed with some very unusual camera angles from the outset, I felt immediately drawn into the scenes, whether the grand vistas of the Australian Outback or the crowded, smoky souks of Constantinople. A sobering tale, but a story that must be told."

","Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Brilliant story, along with excellent direction and acting put it up with some of the greatest Hollywood classics.

It also has brilliant character development, thanks to the talented actors and screenplay writers who worked together to deliver rich emotional scenes.

","Wonderful movie, beautiful soundtrack. If anyone thinks war is glorious better think twice. No sanitized drone shots in trench warfare, just gruesome hand to hand combat. Nice to see the two sides of the conflict rather than a black/white scenario with a demonized enemy. The filming was gorgeous, especially the scenes in Istanbul and at Gallipoli. In many ways it reminded me of Breaker Morant and the rigidity of imperial organizations vs. the bravery and vulnerability of the individuals on which they are based. The movie also introduced us to the various historical conflicts and trends that were playing out at the time. The battle scenes were gripping, you really felt that you were there. Bravo Russell!"

","The movie definitely could have been better. I am sort of disappointed with the movie due to some unnecessary details (playing cricket on a train car), bunch of clichés and certain editing problems. I also anticipate the patriotic part of the movie for Australians. So I cannot blame them if they like this movie more than others. But honestly, it could have been attracted much more audience if few things should have been taken care of more carefully. For instance, I could for sure live without a love story in the plot. There was absolutely no need to watch Crowe and his war-widow lover having a romantic dinner in a 21 century hotel kitchen which presumably belongs to a guy (her brother-in-law) he punched hours ago. Also, I don't get the significance of introducing dozens of extra characters such as the redhead in the hotel. Why? Editing wasn't intact either; sudden jumps and disconnections in the storyline sometimes made me close my eyes. But overall, all these things are forgivable given the fact that this movie is Russell Crowe's first directing attempt. Not good but promising. <br/><br/>As for the historical glance, I in general like history and war movies and it's always good to see something WWI since Hollywood does not care about it as much as they do WWII (for the obvious reason). Even in the limited number of movies and documentaries you can find on WWI, you usually watch stories having taken place at the western front in Europe. In that sense, it's definitely interesting to watch something about the other major fronts, such this one from the Turkish side. I was also pretty surprised that the movie gave a look at the Greek occupation in Turkey aftermath of WWI (one of the screenwriters, Andrew Anastasios, has indeed Greek heritage). After Turkish army was disbanded in 1918, the Greece jumped and carved its share up in the western part of defenseless Turkey (pounding a man while his hands are tied behind his back is not cool). You usually read these kinds of unpopular facts only in history books and scholarly articles. <br/><br/>Overall, you can watch this movie if you are a history nerd, a war-movie lover or if you have time to kill during a long flight. It's still much better than Mel Gibson's 'We were soldiers'..."

","This film has a lot to recommend it. The beautiful saturated palette, the fact that it gives (rarely for a Gallipoli-themed movie) a good dose of the Turkish perspective (including a salient reminder that ""You invaded us"") and a powerful central theme. Crowe's performance is nicely understated for the most part and it was great to see Jacqueline McKenzie back on the big screen, if only briefly. At under two hours long it is just the right length too. It falls apart in the last half hour however, as Crowe turns all Indiana Jones for no particular reason and the love interest subplot just becomes silly – especially in the final shot of the picture. Could have been better."

","Crowe, making his debut as a director, clearly learned much at the elbow of Ridley Scott, on ""Gladiator."" There, similarly, Maximus was impelled, and made threatening, by the purity of his motive—to avenge the murder of his wife and child. There are touches of Spielberg, too, as Connor learns that one of his sons may have survived; as a result, the latter stages of the new film turn into ""Saving Private Connor,"" as the father, like the hero of a parable, traverses the land in search of his lost sheep. He is aided by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), who commanded Turkish forces at Lone Pine, where the Connor boys were killed, and who himself has many dead to lament; the timbre of the movie owes much to Erdogan, an actor of gravity and charm, whom audiences here will have seen in ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"" (2011). He and Crowe make a strong, unexcitable team, each as wry as the other, and Hasan doesn't even look surprised when Connor saves his life, in mid-fight, with judicious whacks of a cricket bat."

","There's a lot to like about this movie. It has grand themes: Love, Loss, War and Peace. The locations are vivid, the pace is good, the performances un-showy and believable. The farmer's quest for his lost sons is interrupted with short but powerful flashbacks to the gruesome horrors of the battle. The quest has a predictable outcome and introduces a clumsy suspense element into the human story. You also kind of know how how the charming if slightly awkward love-story will end, although, in fact, the climax of this particular story is perfectly handled. <br/><br/>This is a touching, almost noble picture, well put together by Mr Crowe in his directorial debut. But somehow there's a vital element missing: it doesn't feel tragic enough. The epic themes have been diluted to make THE WATER DIVINER a crowd-pleasing pot-boiler."
"krunded","8","8","22","5 January 2015"," Nice family drama with occasional tears
","Contains minor spoilers which won't ruin the plot.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner is a fine example of storytelling. It has nothing extraordinary but it also lacks almost nothing in its genre.<br/><br/>Positives: Supporting cast delivers well. <br/><br/>Yılmaz Erdoğan once again proves himself ready for international cinema. After his success at Palme D'or winner ""Once upon a time in Anatolia"", this is easily his second best work. His character is quite complex with many inner conflicts. He is a former architect with a conscience who is forced (although he believes in the cause) to take part in a terrible war. <br/><br/>Former bond girl Olga Kurylenko also impresses playing a free spirit in a very conservative country. She mastered a rather difficult language flawlessly in what appears to be relatively short time. Most of the people in the theater thought she was Turkish.<br/><br/>Steve Bastoni and Ryan Corr leaves the audience wishing they had more screen time. Without ruining the plot I must say; Ryan Corr's character deserves a movie of its own.<br/><br/>Young actor Dylan Georgiades was the one who impressed me the most. 12 year old actor delivers in so many levels. We may be witnessing the birth of a future star in the Water Diviner.<br/><br/>Story is well told with minor fantasy elements. As with most of the war movies, it tells the story of the people, not the war. Turnoil in Ottoman Empire is shown in the background. It is not given in detail but it makes you wanna take a history book and read. There are many humorous moments in the movie trying to lighten the drama. <br/><br/>Andrew Lesnie, who worked as a cinematographer in LOTR franchise, works his magic with various light plays. There are a couple of incredible scenes for the film geeks like me. He is definitely the right man for this movie.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe does a fine job for his debut, movie has the personal scent all over it. Sandstorm scene shown in the trailers is incredibly well shot, it alone may be worth to see this film. Introduction of his character is rather funny because we see a close-shot of his muscles. Maybe thats why all these actors shoot their own movies ^^.<br/><br/>Negatives: Some plot holes especially in the character developments of some support characters. Turkish Comedian Cem Yılmaz's character makes major leaps which are all not well / properly explained. <br/><br/>What disturbed me the most was how the Greeks were displayed in the movie. They were like the ugly end-boss, all bloodthirsty. Water Diviner was so close not to be a propaganda movie. I doubt thats what Russel Crowe had in his mind but Russell, you can't just condemn an entire race.<br/><br/>One other negative point is the excess drama. There are various scenes I found it to be longer than it should be.<br/><br/>At some scenes it feels like Russell Crowe as a director is trying to tell so many things at the same time, losing the main focus.<br/><br/>Overall; it is a good family drama, nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. You'll learn some history, witness an awful, bloody war, meet with interesting characters from very different, interesting cultures. <br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"Laakbaar","7","5","12","18 April 2015"," After Gallipoli
","This is another Australian movie exploring the legacy of Gallipoli, a First World War battle in which many ANZAC soldiers died and which has become iconic in Australian history. It is set in Australia, and Turkey, and tells the sad story of a man who has lost his sons, and goes to Turkey to find their remains. Flashbacks show the boys growing up in Australia and their experience of the horrors of the battle. This is not a war movie; it's a post-war movie.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this movie shows more of, and is even sympathetic to, the Turkish side. Crowe has succeeded admirably in showing us what Istanbul must have been like during the Greco-Turkish War. <br/><br/>Frankly, it bothers me that this movie demonised the Greek side (even though the harshness of the Greeks is an historical fact). This just seems wrong-headed to me given the genocides committed by the Ottoman Turks against the Armenians and Ottoman Greeks. Sort of like glorifying the Nazis. The fact that we don't understand this immediately is just sad. (I don't mean to slur Turkey itself, which is a wonderful country.)<br/><br/>Crowe is the heart of this movie, and he carries it effortlessly. Kurylenko also delivers a good performance. Jai Courtney (for some reason, billed as the lead actor) is too smoking hot for a role like this, but I thought he pulled it off. What would an Australian movie be without beefcake? <br/><br/>The movie worked for me. I was moved at times. However, the sentimentality and stereotyping was a little too much for me. Yes, we get it, the Australians suffered horribly at Gallipoli. At times the film seemed too simplistic and movieish. The supernatural part didn't appeal to me either. I'm glad I saw the movie, but I could have skipped it."

","David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has always stuck in my mind (and heart) as being a very 'atmospheric' film. An artistically appealing ambiance, tonally transcendental. I had not expected in my lifetime to see another film that had quite the same effect upon me. I was wrong and most pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>'The Water Diviner' is a truly incredible story and most beautifully, atmospherically, lyrically told under the deft direction of Russell Crowe. There is, for the most part, an understatement of drama which entices the viewer to look deeper and find more hidden meanings in the nuanced script and performances. Script which is both intelligent and exceptionally moving without a drop of superfluous sentimentality to detract from the thrust of the story. It is a very, very 'human' story. Never difficult to relate to the various characters at some level, to the extent that I could almost feel my mind and heart were being read. This is really a film of 'audience participation' on so many levels. The acting performances are, without question,superb. Crowe solicited from the actors subtle and almost understated performances that added mystery and momentum to the telling. Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan and Dylan Georgliades are the more pronounced of these.And, of course, Crowe is superb. Yet all the key players have their own beautiful rhythm of realism to add to the telling.<br/><br/>Within the story hide many very human truths and realities. Beware of making any judgement about any character you see portrayed, for the film has a wonderful gift of clarifying, simply and directly, why a character behaves the way they do. It is a marvelous film for any student of psychology!<br/><br/>I give nothing away, except to say - watch the eyes of the actors and actresses.Their immersion in their respective rolls is clear to see in their eyes.<br/><br/>Bravo, Mr. Crowe. A superb film. Truly a masterpiece."

","Russell Crowe's directorial debut casts him as a man trying to find out what became of his son, who fought in the 1915 Battle of Gallipoli. You may have seen Peter Weir's 1981 movie about that battle and how the British Empire used the Australians as cannon fodder. Crowe's movie does sympathize with Turkey, showing how the Turks also suffered from the war, although it's drawn criticism for ignoring the Armenian Genocide (which the Ottomans perpetrated during the battle). Millions of lives on all sides senselessly lost.<br/><br/>Here we are 100 years later and we still see the effects of World War I playing out. A notable result was that the Nazis rose to power due the crippling reparations imposed on an already demoralized Germany. Furthermore, the seeds for the Vietnam War got sown when the rabidly racist Woodrow Wilson refused to listen to a young Ho Chi Minh at the Versailles Negotiations. The current bloodshed in the Middle East resulted from the British and French carving up of the former Ottoman Empire. To crown everything, the Armenians acquired only a tiny piece of land while the Palestinians, Kurds and Yazidis didn't even get their own countries.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a really good movie. There are some intense scenes, as there should be. I recommend it."

"CleveMan66","6","4","9","5 May 2015"," ""The Water Diviner"" is a good (but not great) directorial debut for Russell Crowe.
","World War I and its immediate aftermath is the backdrop for Russell Crowe's ""The Water Diviner"" (R, 1:51), a story about a father's love. You don't need to know much about The Great War to appreciate this film. The script tells you what you need to understand about the history of it all, but if you'd like to appreciate the film even more, you might want to read the next paragraph. (If not, you could just skip to the third paragraph.)<br/><br/>One of the most famous battles in World War I (1914-1918) was the Gallipoli Campaign (1915-1916). It was fought on a peninsula which overlooks the entrance to the Dardanelles. Beyond those straits lay Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. What's left of the Ottoman Empire is now the nation of Turkey and its capital is Ankara, but in late 1915, those changes were several years away and the Ottoman Turks were fighting for their empire against foreign invaders. As a member of ""The Central Powers"" (the Ottoman, the Austro-Hungarian and the German empires), the Ottomans fought against ""The Allies"" which included Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, and, starting in 1917, the U.S. At the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turks eventually forced the invading troops from France and Britain and the colonies of the British Empire, including ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers, to abandon their Gallipoli Campaign, but not before over 100,000 men lay dead and twice that many had been injured. <br/><br/>In this film, Russell Crowe plays an Australian farmer named Joshua Connor. It's 1919, the year after World War I ended, and four years since his sons went off to fight but never returned. Connor busies himself trying to make a living off of the land of rural Australia. Part of that process involves digging wells. He uses a pair of divining rods to help him decide where to dig. It's not an exact science. In fact, much like a Ouija board, a divining rod probably only works because the user wants it to work NEEDS it to work. Finding water with divining rods probably has as much to do with the instinct of the user than anything else. Fortunately for Connor, he has VERY good instincts. Yet, Connor's wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), teetering on the brink of insanity, berates him for being able to find water, but being unable to find his sons. Connor promises Eliza that he will indeed find their boys (Ryan Corr, James Fraser and Ben O'Toole) and bring them home for a proper burial. <br/><br/>Connor makes the three-month journey from Australia to Turkey, which only represents the beginning of his hardships. Upon arriving in Constantinople, a young boy runs off with Connor's only bag. Connor chases Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) and doesn't catch up to him until Orhan has led Connor to the hotel that Orhan's family runs. It is a nice place, but Connor is met with thinly veiled hostility from Orhan's mother, Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband died in the war, likely at the hands of one of Connor's countrymen or their allies. Ayshe's brother-in-law, Omer (Steve Bastoni) – and, if he gets his way, her second husband – welcomes Connor and he checks in. The family (especially Orhan), warms to Connor but figuring out how to find his sons is even tougher. The British consul's office won't give civilians permission to go to Gallipoli, so Conner has to find his own way. When he finally makes it there, he meets an Australian officer (Jai Courtney) and his Turkish counterpart (Yilmaz Edrogan) who are working together on a graves detail at the massive cemetery that is Gallipoli. Connor first has to convince these men to help him, or at least allow him, to look for his sons. Then, it's going to take all his divining talents to find their remains and even more than that to solve the mystery he uncovers.<br/><br/>""The Water Diviner"" is Crowe's feature film directorial debut, and he handles the job well mostly. The flashbacks of the battle scenes are as meticulously staged and gut wrenchingly real as anything this side of ""Saving Private Ryan"". It's also nice to see mostly real Turks playing the parts of Turks and mostly Aussies playing the parts of Australians (although Crowe was actually born in New Zealand and some of the Turkish characters are played by actors from Down Under). The script and the editing tell a very personal story, keep it interesting, and skillfully reveal the film's secrets.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film may not be the most accessible in terms of its setting and its general story. The events depicted all took place 95-100 years ago and the Battle of Gallipoli doesn't mean much to most Americans, while in Australia and New Zealand, the date the invasion began is a holiday akin to our Memorial Day. Also, the movie gets a bit off track with some plot points that feel contrived and by making too much of Connor's special abilities, without ever explaining why he's special. Are his talents supernatural? Is he lucky? Or is he just really, really good? And, why doesn't Crowe make the answer clear? Between Connor's vaguely divine talent for divining and a highly improbable romance, this movie almost seems as much a fantasy as a drama ""inspired by true events."" It's a good first effort, Mr. Crowe, but keep working at it. ""B"""

","First off I'll say that I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews of this film (9's and 10's). This movie was quite predictable, and seemed it lacked serious drama and emotion. I did like the feel of the movie as far as how it looked and felt like early 1900s era, world war 1 turkey. It also has some nice shots of the Hagia Sophia and some beautiful scenes in both Istanbul/Constantinople as well as elsewhere in Turkey and in Australia. Russell Crowe was OK in it but I really don't understand how he was able to find his sons bodies, I mean I realize he can find water with dowsing rods but he wasn't using any to find the bones of his sons and it never really explained that very well. Another minor thing is Olga Kurylanko is almost to beautiful, she is already a knockout but when she looks so flawless it takes some of the believability away from a film in my opinion. I don't mind looking at her as she is stunning but she's almost a distraction from the authenticity of the film. The biggest problem I have with this film is the character development, most notably the sons that went to war. I never felt any emotion or connection with their characters as they are not given much screen time but mostly just some flashback scenes and some minor clips of them at war. It was enough to let us viewers know what happened to them but not nearly enough time to make us care about them and what they go thru. Overall This is an OK film but I wasn't moved by it and it seemed very predictable. Although it tried to make u feel certain emotions or importance in many of it's scenes it didn't seem very organic, it felt forced. Like I said it's OK but I can't really say much more then that, it wasn't awful but it's nothing I'd recommend and I think it's rather forgettable as a film."
"jtindahouse","6","3","6","26 December 2015"," Crowe doesn't have the mastery yet to perfect things
","'The Water Diviner' is Russell Crowe's directorial debut. It's an ambitious film to start your career with. There is a lot going on in this movie and even a veteran director might struggle with some of the complexities of it all. There are battle scenes, a love story, a family story and an underlying message all being intertwined throughout. For a first timer I thought Crowe did a good job, but for the standard we have come to expect in modern cinema it isn't quite up to scratch.<br/><br/>A lot of the battle scenes just don't come across as convincing and thus lose a lot of their effect. When a master like Steven Spielberg directs a battle scene you buy into it, you feel like you're there, and the movie is much better off for it. The love story is probably the best directed element of the film. I wish it wasn't there, as it really does drag the movie down and make it quite dull for a period of time, but regardless it is well developed and executed. The main story of finding his sons (based on a true story) could have been done better. The reason for doing so, a promise to his wife, wasn't milked enough and really needed to be put forward powerfully so that the audience was always rooting for him in a big way. As it was, the motivation to support him in his mission waned a little at times.<br/><br/>Altogether it's a watchable film, mostly due to Crowe's always fine acting. Anyone interested in war films will be certain to at least get something out of it. It's not Oscar worthy stuff but it is a decent effort for a first try by Crowe. I look forward to seeing if he embarks on directorial duties again and if so just how ambitious he is next time."

","This movie disintegrated as it moved along. <br/><br/>Its' starts off well enough with an Australian framer (Russell Crowe) and his wife who cannot face up to the fact that three of their sons (their only children) died in the Gallipoli fiasco during the First World War. It's all pretty somber – and after his wife's death our Australian farmer sets off for Gallipoli to find where his sons died – and bring the bodies back to Australia to bury them next to their mother.<br/><br/>This is the end of the serious phase. We now transition to romance and adventure.<br/><br/>Our farmer arrives in Istanbul – stumbles upon a young lad who brings him to a lavishly furnished inn where our farmer encounters the inn-keeper – the very alluring Olga Kurylenko. Her husband conveniently disappeared during the war. Initially she despises him – but we suspect this won't last too long. So now we have a budding romance. He sets off to Gallipoli to find his sons – and in short order befriends a Turkish general and locates two of his sons bodies. He returns to the inn – beats up an un-wanted suitor of the beautiful inn-keeper. So the romance is progressing – to the point where they examine coffee grains together (there is a lot of superstition floating about in this overly long drama). He sets off on another expedition with the Turkish general to locate the third son. <br/><br/>Father and lost son return to the inn – and all that is needed is to show them blissfully ensconced in the Australian outback farming happily ever after – father and newly found son – with his new Turkish wife and her son. <br/><br/>It all comes off as a wildly romantic adventure and implausible."

","The Water Diviner mixes between history, war, and drama, which is always an interesting blend. It tells a great fictional story that happens after the Battle of Gallipoli. Other than the main story line, the movie also depicts the culture of Turkey during the days of the Ottoman empire and also the results of a true war.<br/><br/>All these aspects put together create a great two-hour movie that is fully enjoyable. You get to see a culture and some war scenes from an area of the world that is not very much depicted in movies. The acting of Russell Crowe, Yilmaz Erdogan, Cem Yilmaz, and Jai Courtney add even more quality to the movie.<br/><br/>However, there are two things I didn't like in the movie. First, the love story between Crowe and Olga Curylenko was useless. It added no significance to the movie. The acting of Curylenko was great even though, she is not really Turkish. Her background story is interesting but sadly, it adds nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>The other thing is the friendship that built between Joshua (Crowe) and Major Hasan (Erdogan). In the movie, Hasan is depicted as a soul- less person that just cares about winning a war and enjoys killing. But then, he becomes eager to help his enemy. It can be argued that Joshua and his children have nothing to do with the war. Joshua's children were just soldiers following their generals' orders so they are not really an enemy. But the way Major Hasan's character was described, he shouldn't care for that detail.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a very good movie worth watching. You get to witness a world that is rarely depicted in movies."

Story centers on the Australian contribution as represented by the three sons of an Aussie farmer. Today, still a significant Australian remembrance.<br/><br/>Negatives: 1. Although a small attempt was made to show that there is always another side in a war, what we get of the Turks is just movie stuff. The real history of this conflict with hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded is poorly treated. 2. A good part of the film is filled with the usual romantic encounter and discord and distrust. The female part in the movie is unrealistically attractive for the role, thus not too believable. Tossed in is the customary plot hook of her engaging young son to reel in the Aussie who, of course, had lost his wife. 3. More obstacles are placed in our hero's search for his lost sons with unusually cold bureaucratic barriers being placed in his way - to be overcome, of course. Again, not believable. 4. Dialogue was inane. Directing was disjointed in that the film used excessive numbers of flashbacks to explain what could have been given at the beginning and resulted in better continuity to the story. Acting was too predictable and a bit stereotyped. Ending also became too predictable."

Russel goes down or getting old or just getting bored.<br/><br/>The only joy from the 90 minutes pain is Olga. She saved some points from my opinion.

"lucasversantvoort","6","4","10","6 May 2015"," It's in the coffee...ugh...
","I'll start by saying I wasn't looking forward to this film. Having seen so many films recently, I'd grown beyond sick of the trailer, not just because of the amount of times I'd seen it, but because it's so terribly made. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought a trailer's job was to pique your interest, not tell half the story. But I digress. The main draw of The Water Diviner is obviously the fact it's Russell Crowe's directorial debut. How did he fare? Well Let's just say that the film's supposed to be a sprawling epic set against the political backdrop of postwar Turkey, but instead it's mostly just sprawling The year is 1915. The story centers on Connor, an Australian farmer whose three sons fought at Gallipoli but never returned. He and his wife have assumed their sons are dead, but while he was capable of retreating into his skill at farming, his wife, unable to deal with the pain, has become a shell of her former self, asking Connor to read to his sons as if they were still there. Eventually, she takes her own life after which he promises to bring their sons home to her (and bury them alongside her). He travels to Istanbul and stays in a hotel led by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko). From there, he not only develops a bond with her, but is also aided by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) in his quest to find his sons.<br/><br/>For his first directorial gig, Crowe certainly went big. While the sense of scale is believable, there's simply too much going on in this story. Despite the focus on finding Connor's sons, there's also the political tensions between Britain, Turkey and Greece, notions of love and marriage in Turkey, etc. They all never coalesce into a satisfying whole, but rather exist awkwardly alongside each other. This is particularly noticeable in the film's handling of the romance between Connor and Ayshe. First of all, it feels completely artificial and predictable. The moment they see each other, you know they're 'meant to be' and all that. Secondly, to give you an idea of how awkward the romance can get, there's a scene where they and her son splash each other with waterin bloody slo-mo replete with happy orchestral music. Thirdly, and most importantly, it lives awkwardly alongside the political backdrop. Nowhere is this more apparent than the last seconds of the film. After Connor and Ayshe look at each other, confirming their love and so on, the film fades to black and we're greeted by some text explaining how many have died at Gallipoli and so onuhh, what? There's also the fact that the romance includes a third party, a Turkish man who seeks to wed Ayshe for honor and all that. This obviously devolves into a matter of marriage out of duty vs marriage out of love. There's a scene where the Turkish man slaps her around and Connor interferes. But Ayshe tells him to back off, since it's none of his business. The metaphor is obvious: the West feels compelled to interfere in other cultures when it perceives something going amiss. But the film can't leave it as obvious metaphor. Oh no, Connor has to say that he (aka the West) was doing the right thing, whereupon Ayshe mockingly spouts that Westerners always think they're doing the right thing. It's not that it isn't true, it's just that it's so obvious and in your face, you roll your eyes out of embarrassment.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I do like how the film adopts several Turkish points of view, those of Ayshe and especially that of Major Hasan, played by a wonderful Yilmaz Erdogan. Even though the film has nowhere near the time required to delve into all the political ramifications of postwar Gallipoli, at least it shows more than just the Western perspective.<br/><br/>The film starts out well, but as time goes on and the scale gets bigger and bigger, things start to feel underdeveloped and you stop caring, wondering when it'll finally be over. There are definitely worse directorial debuts out there though and I think that with the right project, on a smaller scale with characters that are better developed, Crowe can really come into his own as a director."
"ZChrisJ1995","7","7","22","7 January 2015"," A solid directing debut from Russell Crowe, and an effective antiwar statement
","Often I'm skeptical when a prominent actor tries to transition into the director's chair, but luckily Russell Crowe does a decent job in his first motion picture behind the camera (as well as in front of). <br/><br/>What I liked about 'The Water Diviner' was its mostly successful balancing of both the perspectives of the citizens of Australia and Turkey. As opposed to merely painting the Turks as the anonymous ""enemies-in-the- distance"" that appear frequently in many Gallipoli-centered war films, the Turks are portrayed predominantly in a positive light, with Crowe's character forming many close relationships with them. Many vital Turkish cities and landmarks such as the Gallipoli peninsula and Istanbul are utilised well in order to both highlight and give respect to Turkish culture and history. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays basically the same role he does in every other film he's in, a stoic, blokish man's man who relentlessly searches for his sons who went missing in combat in this foreign land. The film is also helped by an impressive supporting cast, with Cem Yilmaz being a highlight as a compassionate Turkish sergeant. However, you can't help but be surprised at certain points why certain Australian and international actors were cast as Turkish characters, though these roles were still executed quite well. <br/><br/>Like many war/postwar/anti-war films, 'The Water Diviner' can occasionally dip into some overly sentimental, melodramatic territory, however these are overshadowed by some truly hard-hitting, harrowing scenes. One in particular, during the last act of the film, really packs a punch (you'll know it when you see it). <br/><br/>Now nearly at the 100-year anniversary of the failed Gallipoli campaign, it seems fitting that 'The Water Diviner' contains a much more retrospective, melancholy depiction of the conflict. There aren't really any winners in war. On either side fathers and sons disappear off the face of the earth, leaving gaping holes in the lives of those that remain. With careful, considerate storytelling and directing, 'The Water Diviner' is able to convey this message."

","Australian farmer Connor's three sons join the ANZAC forces at Gallipoli and never come back. His wife never recovers from their loss and, following her death, he makes her a promise to find them and bring them home. He meets obstacles at every turn before being helped by a Turkish officer who sees a way to atone for the wrongs done – and still being done – by all sides in an ongoing conflict.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's first effort as a director bears the legend ""Inspired by True Events"". I imagine that this probably means that a single element – in this case, the one father who went looking for where his sons fell – is used as the central element in a fiction. This doesn't matter – Gallipoli happened, and this film presents a fair emotional view of its impact on individuals and on the country in which it happened.<br/><br/>There are a number of fairly discrete sections to the film: the Australian section is lyrical; the Gallipoli combat section is harrowing (and the fate of the sons, teased out through several flashbacks, very emotional); the Istanbul section (which comprises both the administrative blocks Connor encounters, as well as a developing relationship with a Turkish widow and her son) contains, for me, the emotional heart of the film, for it shows that, notwithstanding the heartbreak, Connor (and Ayshe and Orhan) can go forwards; the Gallipoli war graves search section is sobering and quietly devastating; and the final section where Connor is accompanied by Major Hasan is fairly standard action adventure stuff.<br/><br/>It is a measure of Crowe's achievement as a director, particularly a first-timer, that these disparate elements are all individually well handled, and the film as a whole hangs together coherently.<br/><br/>I suspect that this film may think of itself as important: it isn't, but it does tell a worthwhile story very well."

The man also stars in a lead role and goes on a journey at the end of WW1 to find his three missing sons in a Galipoli war, known as one of the bloodiest battles in a 20 century.

It's has very involving, intriguing, sad and very well told story, although this story loses a bit at the end. The thing i didn't like was Olga Kurylenko - she's is very pretty but i think she is overrated, i don't have anything against her but it's hard to take it seriously to see model Olga Kurylenko always with a perfect makeup in Turkey during WW1, it's just odd casting. Isabel Lucas had a very small but surprisingly good role. Russell Crowe was OK / good but nothing special. Overall i can recommend this movie because you will definitely will enjoy this for the most part. At running time almost 2 hours this movie never drags, and that is a big plus to Russell Crowe direction."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","11","23 April 2015"," Crowe's directing debut turns out to be an entertaining cinematic package
","After a few establishing montages of a WWI scene, Crowe starts his directing debut with vertical aerial shots of the titular character going about the titular undertaking. In a series of ever so lightly surreal overlapping frames of fade-out and fade-in subjects, we see Connor (Crowe, in the lead role too in addition to directing) the protagonist and his dog walking about carefully, the former manipulating two sticks of thin wire, one held in each hand. This is set in some of the wildest and driest parts of Australia. With unwavering confidence and uncanny conviction, he finally stops at a spot, digs deep, deep, and deep until rising out of the bowels of the earth – no, not Johnny Cash's flames from the ring of fire – but an almost miraculous gush of water.<br/><br/>Pleased with his accomplishment, Connor returns to his farmhouse and is greeted with a smile from his wife who is cleaning a boot of one of his three sons, complaining indulgently that she doesn't understand why they are always so dirty. After dinner, domesticity oozes as the wife urges Conner to go through the nightly ritual of reading their three sons to sleep. The next thing we hear is the loving father's voice reading in the bedroom. As the camera moves into the bedroom we see three empty beds, beds that have not been slept in for quite some time. The gloomy nature of the movie finally unfolds – the three young adult sons have all gone to fight in Turkey, and were killed, all three together, in the Battle of Gallipoli. The next morning, Connor finds that his wife has drowned herself.<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie, set in Turkey (mostly Istanbul), can be categorized as what my summary line intimated: an entertaining cinematic package. The tone is initially gloomy, tracing Connor's effort to acquire permission from hopelessly bureaucratic bodies to get into the military zone to look for the remains (perhaps just a skull) of his sons to bring home to Australia for a decent burial. Romance is offered in rapport with a young Turkish widow Ayshe who runs the hotel in Istanbul where he stays (a stunningly lovely Olga Kurylenko), a relationship that follows an often-seen trajectory of starting with animosity but gradually warming towards mutual empathy. Another often-seen relationship comes as the man-and-kid bonding with Ayshe's somewhat cheeky but generally adorable son. When Connor finally succeeds in getting into the military zone, we get a feel of the ever elusive nature of political alliances: Australia and Turkey, enemies only so recently, are now allies against Greece. Two important characters emerge from this new addition to the dramatic arena. One is a British colonel played by Jai Courtney. You would perhaps remember him as John McClane's (or you can call him Bruce Willis) son in ""A good day to die hard"". The other, an even more important role, is a Turkish Major played by an excellent Yilmaz Erdogen. The pace picks up when after finding of remains of two of the sons, a gleam of hope breaks out that the third one may still be alive. High adventure ensues, with a touch of melodrama that is not unwelcome, after the somber mood that has dominated the movie for the most part.<br/><br/>I am not going to repeat the summary line again but would just add that the movie is shot in an old-fashion style which is a delight to watch."

"ginocox-206-336968","9","4","12","17 April 2015"," An impressive film weakened by supernatural elements
","""The Water Diviner"" is impressive. Defining the film is more of a challenge than describing it. It's part bromance, part road trip and part epic historical drama with a dramatically hollow throughline that, in the finest Hollywood tradition, degenerates into a Western/chase film with the Everyman protagonist transforming into a two-fisted gun-toting action hero. <br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning. The locations, sets and costumes are fantastic. The acting is superb. Even minor roles are detailed and convincing. <br/><br/>The plot is a bit of a mess. The larger, background world-view plot is a Byzantine tale of political and military conflicts, bureaucratic intransigence and cultural conflicts following an epic battle that helped define the national identities of both Turkey and Australia. That part is brilliant, fascinating, and seemingly historically accurate and authentic. <br/><br/>The smaller chick-flick personal plot is an incoherent jumble patched together with a series of improbable occurrences and coincidences, both favorable and unfavorable, and a bit of mysticism. Russell Crowe plays a hardscrabble outback Australian farmer who survives by virtue of uncanny success at dowsing for subterranean water. <br/><br/>Dowsing or divining is a discredited pseudoscience and modern audiences are likely to consider Crowe's character a bit of a crackpot who's clearly been working under the blazing sun far too long. While most of the movie seems highly authentic, its treatment of dowsing tests the limits of the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. I'm no geologist, but I would expect water tables to be relatively large things measured in acres or hectares, not something like buried pirate treasure where X marks the spot and if dig anywhere else you're doomed to failure. There are doubtlessly places where the water is closer to the surface, but those places are more like the dome of a sports arena than the apex of the Washington Monument. If you miss the high point, you may need to dig down a couple of more meters, but you'll still hit water. <br/><br/>Not only does the movie take dowsing very seriously, but this talent morphs into a supernatural ability to visualize past events and distant scenes. Another character also displays powers of prognostication. But the movie isn't about these supernatural abilities or developing them or convincing others that the visions are real. They simply sap the dramatic potential of the plot. In fairness, Crowe's Connor admits that he's dug a lot of empty holes searching for water, but the talent never fails him during the movie. <br/><br/>Connor is up against insurmountable odds. Three armed forces, two government bureaucracies, a resistance group and a jealous suitor are determined to prevent him from reaching a dangerous place where finding what he wants is nearly impossible. Connor reaches the place basically by sneaking in the back way. Once he gets there, his adversaries decide they may as well help him. The dangers never materialize. He uses a bit of magic to find what he wants, but then abandons his original goal. There is a sort of moral about hard work, determination and perseverance, but it is undermined by the supernatural abilities and an improbable coincidence that causes another character to assist at unexpected times. <br/><br/>The water images are nice, but the divination angle detracts from the drama in a manner that isn't at all credible. <br/><br/>The film is definitely worth watching for the background story, strong performances and cinematography. The human story may be relevant to people with supernatural abilities, but less so for the rest of us."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1915, after the end of the Battle of Galipoli, World War One is drawing to a close. Connor (Russell Crowe), a simple farmer who lives in the out backs of Victoria, Australia, is missing two sons who went off to fight in the war. Following his wife's suicide, he travels to Turkey to begin the search for his missing boys, and finds lodgings with the beautiful Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her son. He also finds himself scouring the fields with Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), the army commander who lead the army Connor's sons were fighting against, who's now trying to build diplomatic relations with the opposing forces. As he draws nearer to the truth, Connor must brace himself for a devastating reality.<br/><br/>In the year the world observed the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, Russell Crowe picked a timely moment to unveil his directing debut to the world. He'd spoken about it for many years, and there'd been hints it would be coming here and there, but finally this drama set against the backdrop of the war is finally here. Rather than set it on the battlefront, Crowe has chosen to highlight the raw human drama that unfolded behind the scenes and was comparatively ignored, that of all the soldiers in the various regiments, companies and divisions who were unaccounted for and in many cases, never found.<br/><br/>It seems to incorporate many tones as it goes along, mixing together a lot of haunting atmosphere, light humour, raw human drama and historical narrative pretty much all at the same time. While all of this is very affecting, a lot of the time the pace is a little too slow and has a bit too much of a Sunday afternoon vibe to it, creating a bit of a dull feel. A shame, since the themes it's exploring couldn't be any less toned down, including heartbreak, forgiveness, redemption and hope. It beats with the heart of a lion, but flows with the blood of a sheep, a film with solid themes but the execution of a telly drama, but which still manages to stir and engage.<br/><br/>If you only get one chance to make a first impression, Crowe has demonstrated a generally firm and adept approach to film-making, with a stirring story and tonnes of ambition, but one which maybe just needs to move with a little more fire and flare in it's heart. ***"

"lucasnochez","7","3","8","1 June 2015"," Film Review: The Water Diviner
","In June of 2015 one of my favourite HBO shows of all time will make its debut on the silver screen. While Entourage may not be the greatest television show ever created, it sure does succeed in allowing its main demographic to fantasize about fame and fortune. It is true that the Entourage film has very little to almost zero relevance to The Water Diviner, but its subject matter (a very eager Hollywood star, in this case, the fictional Vincent Chase making his directorial film debut) does. Now you may be asking, what is the point here? <br/><br/>What many won't know is that The Water Diviner marks the directorial debut of famed New Zealand born, Australian loving actor Russell Crowe. Sharing in his immense adoration for the land down under with fellow famed Hollywood actors Hugh Jackman and Hugo Weaving, Crowe directs this film centred around the Gallipoli Campaign, also known as The Battle of Gallipoli, and Australian farmer/water diviner, Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe).<br/><br/>Years after the initial battles, Joshua and his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie) have done the best they can grieving with the reality of losing all three sons to the war. Essentially, The Water Diviner becomes a great cinematic tale about hope, survival, and determination, soaked with an immense amount of inexperience by its very trying but lacking director.<br/><br/>Hope is a big theme within the film, and going back to the analogy mentioned in the first paragraph, the same could be said for many upcoming actors turned directors. While the trend of acting-to-directing is nothing new (Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, and of course, Ben Affleck), it is something that many actors try, gaining knowledge and great aspiration from their confident directing leaders, but fail miserably. Just ask Ryan Gosling and his 2014 Cannes flop Lost River. <br/><br/>While The Water Diviner may be considered anything but a flop, the film does seem quite familiar very quickly. Taking cues from very popular and hailed contemporary war dramas in the last few decades, Saving Private Ryan and Flags of Our Fathers most notably, Crowe's directorial debut is a beautifully shot, but poorly guided historical picture.<br/><br/>High handed melodrama, non-conspicuous zooms during very pivotal narrative scenes and monologues, as well as the oh-so painful use of unnecessary slow-motion, The Water Diviner is ever so slightly taken away from a compelling story of patriarch and redemption. Against all odds Joshua makes his way to Gallipoli, a land labelled as a stretch of Earth saturated with ""blood and ghosts"", where he is greeted by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), a military official who is tasked with helping Lt./Col Cyril Hughes (Jai Courtney in his second straight historical war epic following Unbroken) adequately bury fellow countrymen. While most of the film is driven by blind and unexplainable intuition, Joshua finds two of his sons, Henry and Edward Connor (Ben O'Toole and James Fraser), who remain together. Not knowing the whereabouts of the remains of his eldest Arthur (Ryan Corr), who had been tasked with guarding his two youngest brothers, Joshua never loses faith in the chance of seeing his first-born.<br/><br/>While much of the film narrative is driven by prospect, Major Hasan informs Joshua that he remembers his son in a chance encounter and gives him hope that he may still be alive, leading Joshua to Istanbul where divinely, he finds himself in the care of a recently widowed Ayshe's (Olga Kurylenko) hotel. It is there that Joshua slowly sheds his Commonwealth patriotism of Queen and Country beginning to open his eyes to the customs and lifestyle of the Turkish people, including that of Ayshe and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgides).<br/><br/>While romance never plays a strong influence on the film between Joshua and Ayshe, some of the best scenes are undoubtedly between Crowe and Kurylenko as well as Crowe and Turkish acting gem Erdogan. Many won't be astonished by Crowe's direction but he can rest assured, after the atrocities that were Noah, Winter's Tale and Broken City, that his acting is in top form in The Water Diviner, proving scene and scene again that his talents as an actor are far from finished. Luckily, the casting and acting of the film is undoubtedly its strong point, including former Bond girl Kurylenko who is almost unrecognizable as Ayshe.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe may not be the next Orson Welles, Rob Reiner, or Kenneth Branagh – men whose directorial debuts and first feature films Citizen Kane, This is Spinal Tap! and Henry V respectfully established their talents behind the lens as well as in front of the camera – but there is definitely hope for a very talented and ambitious man who is willing to shed light to some very obscure historical events. Crowe will surely be given a slew of elements in the fight to get his film seen and appreciated. While I won't be one to truly drown The Water Diviner, here's hoping that Crowe's first feature will have greater hope of keeping afloat than sinking quickly, despite its lack of any real cinematic divine intervention."

","I liked it a lot.<br/><br/>I like it when Russell Crowe is on top of his game. He went through a few years were he was an out of shape, bloated, movie star, phoning it in for a paycheck but in his directorial debut he was looking fit and putting his acting chops to work as a father whose boys were killed in war and he goes to Turkey to retrieve the bodies.<br/><br/>Crowe did a fine job as both the director and the star. It's an amazing feet as he attempts to put himself in the same stratosphere with Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. <br/><br/>The film was a Great War epic that had drama and action and was well shoot. The scenery really adds to the vibe of the picture. <br/><br/>Very impressive"

","Russell Crowe might have just filmed a little gem here. <br/><br/>The Water Diviner is in my opinion a masterfully made drama, thanks to good writing, direction, cinematography, a brilliant production supported by an excellent cast with great character development. This film has to be one of the rare ones that actually portray other cultures with a level of dignity absent in cinema today. The Water Diviner has managed to breakdown a difficult subject of war without a biased narrative, in itself an almost rare feat - there are no heroes or villains, but casualties of war.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece."
"loveneverdies-97963","9","4","13","23 March 2015"," The movie is about a father's dedication and sacrifice to search for his children in a foreign & hostile country amidst the chaos of WWII.
","This movie is a must see for the people who loves to search for historical events through the eyes of others. The acting and cinematography of this film is amazing to say the least. It is a must watch for those who love to see Russel Crowe in action. But if you are looking for slick action, you may get disappointed. Russel Crowe will take you into a journey like none other. You will get to see the WWII from a different set of eyes which may make you think about the WWII differently than before. The storyline will make your eyes glued to the screen and you would not want to miss the action for a single moment that I can assure you of. I have recommended this movie to my close ones and I believe you would do the same after watching it."

","WWI movies are still not enough, especially if we compare with WWII movies. So I like this kind of movies and I think they must do more. The movie is good and have a different view. But also its not a very good, some scenes are really simple. However I couldn't understand Greeks and some others angry. First I am a historian so I don't need a history lesson. I can say only in all history, everybody killed someone. Turks killed Greeks, Greeks killed Turks, Germans killed many, British also or French. And always some movies show others like monsters. I believe that Turks or Persians are really mostly unfortunate about that. There are many movies which mentioned badly about them. So please calm down. Nobody are monsters, we are all humans and all of us have some mistakes. So a historical discussion is really meaningless in that point. Also I want to remind if you look national geographic genom project you can see many Turks carry some Greek or Armenian blood and also many Greeks or Armenians carry Turkish blood. So please don't be ignorant. And last some reviews are really very ignorant because first you must learn Turks are not Araps,they have only same religion. But their culture, history and also language are totally different. It is a good say; Don't try to occupy a country which you don't know where it is or Don't try to write something which you don't know anything...."
"Discogodfather9622","5","3","9","18 July 2015"," Simply put... boring.
","Gone are the days where I could watch the news and hear about how Russell Crowe pummeled a random person or threw a phone at the face of a hotel concierge. What we have now is a much more subdued Crowe, so subdued in fact that I was starting to wonder what happened to him. Being once a leading man, he seems to be taking on smaller roles as side characters. That's all changed with The Water Diviner as he both directs and stars in this war film. Loosely based on the book by the same name, Crowe plays Joshua Conner, a simple Australian farmer/ Water Diviner (A water diviner being someone who can locate water under ground with a divining rod.) who is in the process of digging a well on his land. Four years previously, his sons have joined the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps at the battle of Gallipoli and our now presumed dead. Unable to deal with the grief, Joshua's wife commits suicide. Having nothing left, Josh travels to Turkey to bring back his sons bodies and bury them with their mother. Once in Turkey he finds out that Gallipoli is off limits to all civilians as the army is involved in a mass burial of the fallen, but Joshua meets a Turkish officer who takes pity on him and helps with the search. Throughout the film Joshua meets a cast of colorful characters and gets into a few battles all while trying to find his dead sons. Hearing all this you would assume that this sounds like a rousing crowd pleaser, the kind of movie you can take your grandparents to without the fear of a sex scene of too much swearing (Old people, am I right?!) For me, The Water Diviner was a huge letdown. Sure, it's probably a movie that old people will like, not too violent, romance instead of sex, strong family values, but for the younger crowd, I found the movie to be boring and cheesy as all hell. From the music to the acting, this film reeked of cheese, and not the good type of cheese like pepper jack, no, this reeked of Limburger. There's also the fact that the movie is called The Water Diviner, other than the beginning where he is digging the well, his ability to find water doesn't really factor into the rest of the movie. Now, I've talked a lot of smack on the film, but that's not saying the movie is completely terrible. It's beautifully shot and they made great use of Turkey and it's people, the war scenes are nicely done too, but that's where the praise ends. The Blu-ray of The Water Diviner is a little on the bare bones side when it comes to the special features, A ""making of"" and a documentary on the battle of Gallipoli are all that on the disk. The picture and sound is top notch as always being that this is a Blu-ray. At the end of the day, The Water Diviner is a forgettable movie that I'd be hard pressed that anybody would watch more than once, let alone own. Just wait till TNT airs it on television."
"deloudelouvain","5","3","9","5 June 2015"," This everything but a masterpiece like some want to make us believe...
","I don't get why The Water Diviner get such a high rating and I certainly don't get how some reviewers call this a masterpiece. Did we see the same movie? There are way too much things in this movie that make the so-called true story completely unbelievable. No really, a guy that finds a well because of his magic stick I can maybe believe, but the same guy finding the exact spot where his sons died because he feels it... Please, this is completely ridiculous. And then he rides a horse to some city with the enemy and suddenly he knows where his other son is... Come on, you call that a masterpiece? I'm being generous giving this movie a 5 stars rating. I just give it because of the camera work and some actors, but certainly not for the bad script and Russell Crowe. Big disappointment..."
"flingebunt","7","3","9","30 May 2015"," Divining for movie awards
","So Conner is your typical clichéd Australian farmer working land where it might not rain for two years and has the ability to do water divining (find underground water by using a couple of sticks held in his hand).<br/><br/>He has lost his sons to the Gallipoli campaign in WWI and his wife, in her grief, kills herself. So now he heads to Turkey to find the remains of his 3 sons. <br/><br/>On one hand this movie is brilliant. It shows the the war from the side of the Turks, and how they suffered during and after WWI. They also show the Turks are honourable people worthy of respect.<br/><br/>This movie also explores why we need to remember and honour our war dead.<br/><br/>But it also is a little silly where our hero seems to have mystical diving powers, not just for finding water but finding his children. This takes away any real motivation for the character and instead the Conner ""just knows"". This aspect cheapens the story and the movie.<br/><br/>However still a good movie that is worth seeing."
"scottshak_111","7","3","9","20 April 2015"," A good flick that couldn't become great
","Russell Crowe's first big directorial venture isn't a fiasco. It is good, but there are so many things that stop it from being placed amongst the greats.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner is a movie that starts off with exceptional score, awesome direction and then later dwindles into mediocrity in its main course, only to resurrect again in the end. Screenplay is good, sometimes covering great words brilliantly spoken by the cast. Score is enthralling. Plot is beautiful and well directed at times.<br/><br/>Movie is all Russell. Carrying a thoughtful face and wet eyes, he portrays a man in pain perfectly. You can almost feel for his loss, when the plot unfurls with a terrible tragedy that compels you to wear his shoes. With a big fatherly heart, Crowe carries the movie with his sheer emotions.<br/><br/>Olga is a disappointment. Her face lacks the much needed thoughtful lustre. Sometimes you can perceive her forceful put-on acts with a lot of unwanted animation to her features. Even Jai doesn't get enough screen time. His addition to the tale ends up going to waste.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>Some of the greatest bits of the movie lie in its starting act where we see Connor finding water, and then digging a well to find the cold. Even before that, the war bit is also quite beautifully shot. It carries along with it an apt climax that delivers subtly a brooding thought. We are soon thrown into the pits of tragedy when we find Connor reading out stories to three empty beds.<br/><br/>At one point the movie loses its seriousness where the score changes to comic like undertone. Even though grim frames follow, something seems amiss and you cannot take anything that pursues seriously.<br/><br/>The gravity of the movie however lies at the war grounds where Arthur lies in mud along with his brethren, helpless, and also at Russell's brows. The chaotic war aftermath is captured beautifully with all the wailing and crooning that shatters the quiet myth.<br/><br/>Eventually the flick narrowly escapes the jaws of mediocrity owing to the gloomy theme it runs on and revives with Arthur's big conundrum and a happy-ending.<br/><br/>Good stuff! Worth a watch!"
"tamarabmara","9","3","9","18 April 2015"," Beautiful movie
","It's a very very good movie. It has a beautiful message for all the people hurt by the wars and difficulties of life. It's a movie about losing your hope in everything and then finding it again and fighting for it. All the actors played their characters really well and beautifully, especially Crowe and Olga. What surprised me was that i was hoping for a different story, and ended up with a softly and emotional movie really well made. The locations are also other awesome good point in this movie. The music is another great thing in the movie that goes along with the story and the scenes.<br/><br/>I myself highly recommend this movie for all the audiences. I gave it a 9."
"cox526","8","3","9","3 April 2015"," True events? more like Contrived
","The main problem with this movie is it opens with the premise based on true events and that is where the credulity of the audience is truly tested because the only true events is the battle of Gallipoli itself from then on in events take on an unbelievable journey. – The Director and writers must have thought how do I sell this better as its just another war film? I know say its based on true events – its how the Coens got away with making Fargo claiming it was based on a true story which it was later revealed was nonsense. However, like Fargo, the Water Diviner is a well made and well acted piece and worthy of praise for at least having a story albeit contrived. First we have a Father who travels to the Dardanelles to find his three sons presumed killed in action and he his thwarted in his efforts to go officially so unofficially turns up and as the ANZACs go to send him away a Turkish Major whom he later befriends changes their minds. The story then becomes even more contrived from then on in and I feel disappointed that it isn't true because there is nothing more than I would like for it to be so, as it is beautiful shot, there is a degree of realism in the barbaric nature of war. The battle scenes are gritty and a testament to many young men who thought and died for their Country. This film should be remembered for the fact that many men died for many Countries in the First World War and many families never had peace of mind to know whether their sons or Fathers survived as they were lost presumed dead and it is a fact that one such Father did try to establish where his son was killed at Gallipoli."
"davidcameron-20885","8","5","19","23 December 2019"," This shows the greatness of the British Empire
","I thought this film was great, it was historically accurate and although they could've chosen a more entertaining non-fiction story from the time, the one they chose was a blast, very interesting and so meaningful especially considering it's a real story. It was a great story but for it to of been better it should've explained more of the characters backstory so we could know the characters more, I felt there was a slight lack of character development in this film.<br/><br/>I loved how the British man in charge of the British Army's colonial presence in Turkey treated the Australian father, those scenes were my favourite as a Brit. I loved how the British soldier treated the Australian father like a child and was patronising to him as it showed the greatness of the British Empire at the time, the high respect it welded and the authority that they commanded over their conquered people outside of Britain. The British soldier really acted like a strict but caring fatherly figure to the Australian main character, it gives an accurate depiction of the British armed forces of the time. Overall it was a great film, definitely worth watching if you're into history and could've been better if their was more time for the most important and entertaining characters to flesh their personality out onscreen. Also could've been better if it focused more on the people of the time's thoughts on the British Empire, Imperialism and racism."
"William-of-Baskerville","5","2","5","19 January 2018"," Story starts OK, but then quickly disintegrates. Historic dishonesty kills it.
","This movie starts with some beautiful wide shots, then quickly turns sentimental. When the father arrives in Turkey to look for his sons after the battle of Gallipoli, the story seems to hold up, but quickly starts disintegrating into non-relevant elements. Towards the end it's getting weak and very hard to watch. Think soap-opera cheesy. 
I was also very irritated by the attempts at whitewashing Ottoman/Turkish history. First this happens when visiting the Blue Mosque, where the father is so surprised to acknowledge that such a beautiful thing does not exist in his culture. Well, maybe not in Australia, but sitting next to it is the Hagia Sophia, until modern times the building with the largest dome, which was a Christian Church until it was captured by the same Ottomans during their conquest of the Byzantine (Roman) Empire. The Hagia Sophia is thus an expression of the same culture that led to the culture of Australia. Second, during the second half, Greeks are painted as truly evil villains against the noble Turks, whereas during the period of 1914-1922 is known by historians as the Greek genocide: the systematic genocide of the Christian Ottoman Greek population from Turkey, by the Ottoman Empire's government. Third, the movie is also completely silent about the Armenian genocide from 1915-1923 where the same (Islamic) government exterminated 1.5 million (Christian) Armenians, something acknowledged by international scholars, but denied by Turkish government to this day. That same genocide has been the inspiration for Hitler's genocide against among others the Jews during World War 2. He said of it:<br/><br/>""Our strength consists in our speed and in our brutality. Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter -- with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. It's a matter of indifference to me what a weak western European civilization will say about me.<br/><br/>I have issued the command -- and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad -- that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness -- for the present only in the East -- with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?""<br/><br/>Hitler was well aware that denial of the Armenian genocide was a strong signal that his tyranny would not be opposed by the civilized world. It is telling that Russell Crowe sought Turkish approval, and the Turkish minister of culture told him ""I believe in the script."". That's the same minister who's responsible for Article 301 in the penal code, which has been used to prosecute Turkish citizens who have brought the Armenian genocide to the attention of the people.
No wonder Armenian and Greek organizations have called for a boycot of this film."

However, it was gripping, involving, full of 3- dimensional characters and depths of meaning. The cultural authenticity looked impressive to me, although I as no expert.. All I knew prior to this film was that the Dardanelles campaign in WW1 cost many Anzac lives and was regarded as a disaster. For Russell Crowe's family it was the loss of 3 sons, and all that the father could do was go to where they died to find them.<br/><br/>The story builds to a gripping climax and the ending was completely unexpected.

The battlefield scenes were so touching. Him talking about his children. The few flash forwards and the fact that he just felt things he could have never known for sure just really touched me. Now mind you, I am Aussie nor am I Turkish. I am a humble girl from Holland and even though I have loved my history classes (up to a certain extent), here they have never taught us anything about the battle of Gallipoli, just a faint story about Troy, so this was all the more interesting to me as I am just a fan of war stories - not so much a fan of war, just to be clear - and a good flash back in time to make me feel as if I was there, right in the middle of it is just everything for me. To feel every emotion they are feeling and/or must have been feeling at a certain point in, for a certain period of time.<br/><br/>...all that to come to that crappy ending! The synopsis of the ending itself was fine but it just stopped so sudden I just thought ''what in the frock is this.''<br/><br/>I just thought the ending could have ended just a bit more subtle. Now it was just like ''okay well this is the end of the movie and you know it so.. bye bye!''<br/><br/>That just kind of ruined it for me. Especially since it's often the ending that stays with one the longest.<br/><br/>This still should not prevent you from thinking that this is a crappy movie, cause this is definitely a must-see. MUST. <br/><br/>Still, crappy ending."

This movie was starting to bore me until I saw this scene, then the movie took a complete turn and stirred up all the emotion I felt throughout the film that had started to go away. Even though there are scenes with no dialogue that 100% need dialogue to make them great scenes, this movie stirred in me emotion that I've never felt before and don't expect to feel soon again. Russell Crowe does a great job with his acting. He makes himself just emotional enough to feel real, not indulging nor cutting himself short. The Water Diviner really makes you think about what's important in life."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","8","2","5","4 January 2016"," Are you a serious film-goer?
","I have never particularly been a fan of Russell Crowe, although once in a while he has starred in films where he has impressed me (e.g., ""Gladiator"", ""A Beautiful Mind""). But with this film, in my view, Crowe has crossed over into something more than just a good actor...now he is a fine director. I am guessing that Russell Crowe sees this film as his masterpiece. And rightfully so.<br/><br/>That is not to say that this is a perfect film. First of all, it failed at the box office, and the reason is that it is a very complex film. To appreciate this film, you really need to be a serious film-watcher.<br/><br/>Second, Crowe has attempted to tackle a very difficult topic -- looking at the collision of two cultures, and unlike many films about two cultures, this is about two cultures that seemingly can never the twain meet. Although I knew very little about the Battle Of Gallipoli, with only a few battle scenes, the suffering of that conflagration is vividly depicted. Few films have shown the horror of war more successfully than does this one. There are a few scenes -- the railroad scene, for example -- that remind me just a bit of David Lean's work.<br/><br/>It would be fair to call this film epic in nature. The scope is broad, the various settings often stunning, and this is one of the few films I have ever seen where I felt the film should have been longer.<br/><br/>There are times that what we are seeing is confusing, particularly in regard to some of the cultural aspects of Turkey. That's where I feel that a few more minutes might have avoided some of the confusion as to what we are seeing.<br/><br/>I was truly impressed with the acting here,almost without exception. Crowe is superb; perhaps the best he has ever been...now that he is in middle age. Olga Kurylenko, a Ukranian actress, is excellent. Dylan Georgiades, an Australian child actor is as good as I've ever seen. Yılmaz Erdoğan, a Kurdish actor playing a general, is excellent, as well. Ryan Corr as the one son who lived is very good, although we don't see too much of him, even though he is actually the focus of the film.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Crowe, for a very fine effort. A truly touching film."
"jrarichards","9","2","5","19 December 2015"," Very effective juxtaposition of emotions in a visually captivating piece of very good story-telling
","Perhaps it is not a huge achievement to make a good film out of spectacular locations, one of the most notorious battles in history (and the First World War in general), and the histories of Australia and post-WWI Turkey, but - hey - half the battle in the film industry is finding the kernel of a new good story for a movie and actually going on to make something out of it. Notwithstanding the issues of flawed detail that experts rightly take note of, this is a gritty film that looks and feels right, offers an appropriate range of emotions and settings (both domestic and a million miles from domestic), and acknowledges the truth that Turkey in 1919 was an extremely ""fascinating"" place to be. The opportunity to contrast the existence of a small-time farmer from the Outback with the life and culture of a huge city straddling two continents that had half a million inhabitants by AD600 is not lost. There is also a refreshing honesty as regards the balancing of enmity and reconciliation in the wake of a battle that cost the lives of seven times as many defending Turks as attacking Australians and New Zealanders. If there is a flaw here, it is the renewed attempt to portray the Brits (with one noble and notable exception) as starchy, out of touch sticklers quite distinct from the matey and down-to-earth Aussies. This is the kind of thing we have seen far, far too often before, and it is well past its sell-by date. With this proviso, this (British) reviewer was impressed and moved by the beauty, authenticity and simple power of this well-done and mostly well-acted piece of work. Yilmaz Erdogan as the senior Turkish officer and would-be pioneer of Turkish nationalism is the undoubted star of the piece, but Crowe, Kurylenko, Courtney and Yilmaz all give us our money's worth, as does the entirely convincing boy-actor Dylan Georgiades."

His sons are taken away as forceful volunteers in Britain war against Ottoman Empire at Gallipoli where they are killed in action eventually. His wife could not take it and commits suicide leaving Conor in pain and distress. Conor takes a wow at her burial that he will find her sons and bury them alongside her grave. Conor travels to Turkey to find his 3 missing sons. While staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he meets Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), the hotel manager and tries to find a way to Gallipoli. Somehow he manages to reach Gallipoli despite resistance from British Visa office and military officials. There, he finds his two sons but the third is still missing. He has a strong belief that his 3rd son is alive but the military officials at Gallipoli forces him to return to Australia which is not acceptable for him. While at Gallipoli, Conor meets a Turkish officer Maj Hassan(Yilmaz Erdogan)who promises to help him. Ultimately, Conor, flees from Turkey by deceiving British officials and finds his son in Anatolia (which is under attack by Greeks). The movie is well- paced, well edited and doesn't drag. The lead actors were all perfectly cast and they delivered as per expectations. At the start of the 100th anniversary year of the Gallipoli landings, this is a story that was well worth telling. Russell Crowe has done a Great job at his debut film. Few dialogs are worth mentioning like Hope's a necessity where I come from and he is the only father who came looking after his sons.The war scenes conveyed some of the horror without being gratuitous in the violence or gore.

","Russell Crowe is great in this film about personal loss, the horror and futility of war and about friendship that transcends borders and sides. Everything was spot on: acting, directing, sets, editing, soundtrack. Yet it all felt artificial and heavy handed, akin to The Hundred- Foot Journey, if you saw it, albeit with a completely different subject.<br/><br/>There was some interesting commentary about why people fight in wars and what they feel and do when the wars are seemingly over. Also one can learn more about an almost forgotten part of history, when Turkey was still the Ottoman Empire and was fighting Australians and New Zealanders, then Greeks while the British were lording around. But the rest... I felt like someone was taking feelings in bulk and throwing them at me, containers and all, like so many brick in one's face.<br/><br/>Suffering? We haz it! Stoic hopefulness? Tons of it! Cardboard villains? One for each occasion. Love story that made little sense in the plot, especially at the end? Yup. And so on and so on. If it weren't for Crowe, who acted brilliantly, I would have considered this film a failure. As such, I would have to give it an average rating, although I personally didn't like it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it felt like a movie made by an accountant."

The rest is the mix of drama, war, romance, flashbacks, and whether his mission is accomplished or not is the climax that decide.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was a little disappointed. The story was not based on the real, but looked like one. The point is it was a wonderful and inspiring theme, but direction was not convincing along with bad editing. If you look at who's that, it was a direction debut for Russell Crowe, who played the main character in the film as well. Some of the historical facts were wrong, especially showing the Greeks in the bad light was the negativity of the film. Visually the films do not give the impression of the pre 1920s where the story set in. Instead, it looks more of the late 40s or the early 50s.<br/><br/>Since it was set after the war, most of the characters were in a guilt attitude. Can't say whole film was predictable, but the scenes were. The performances were the only things that tried to lift the movie, as well as the music and screenplay in some parts. This, book based movie should have been directed by any top director, not for the freshers to try-out their skills in direction field, because of the powerful stuffs like anti-war elements. One time watchable, but disappointment is ahead of you if you expect greatness from it. Anyway, it was Australia's top gross movie last year in Australia.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"leonblackwood","5","2","5","16 August 2015"," Emotional but way too long! 5/10
","Review: I must admit, this film did feel like it wasn't going to end but the concept was OK and there are some interesting characters, like the couple of Turkish soldiers who helped Crowe to find his sons. I was expecting Crowe's amazing water skills to come into play but they really didn't have that much to do with the film. Its basically about a man who sets out to find his sons who are missing in action. After his wife takes her own life because she can't deal with the fact that her sons are missing, he makes a promise to bring them home, so he sets out on a epic adventure to try and find them, dead or alive. With the help of two Turkish soldiers, he soon finds two of his three sons bodies but he receives information from the soldiers that one of his sons might still be alive. This is were the journey begins and his life soon becomes in danger from various people who make his journey hard to accomplish. Its a extremely epic movie which has a emotional undertone and a great storyline. The main problem that I found with the film is that it was way too long. I liked the scenes with the Turkish soldiers, who tried there utmost to help Crowe but there is a lot of unnecessary material which made the film drag in parts. I was expecting more of an emotional ending, after such an epic journey but it seemed to end quite abruptly. The cinematography was impressive and the cute kid was a nice touch to the cast but Crowe could have brought some more emotion to the main character, especially as he and directed the film. Anyway, is an average movie which did have me gripped in parts and the emotional content was well put together. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although this movie didn't make a profit at the box office, Russell Crowe, 51, should be proud of his first directional debut. After winning an Oscar for Gladiator and being nominated for his roles in the Insider and A Beautiful Mind, he has had a career which has definitely had its ups and downs. From starring in epic movies like Les Miserables, with the awful singing, Robin Hood, we're he was confused about his accent, The Man With The Iron Fists, don't ask, American Gangster, great film and the Insider which was a brilliant performance, he really isn't the most consistent actor but he does know how to pull in an audience. To date, his movies have grossed $1.6 Billion which averages out to be over $54million a film. Pretty impressive! Anyway, the movie might have made some more money if he had some other stars alongside him. That's not to say that the rest of the cast didn't put in a good performance but it could have done with some experienced actors who would have brought some emotion into a film with such a intense concept. With that aside, I did stay interested throughout the movie and there was enough elements to keep me awake.<br/><br/>Budget: $22.5million Worldwide Gross: $15.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/war movies about a man's epic journey to find his sons who are missing in action during World War I. 5/10"
"rodgerw-1","8","2","5","3 August 2015"," Brilliant antiwar movie but for the political innuendo at the end.
","I watched this after a friend in Australia told me how seriously they take the Anzac commemorations. The heartbreaking story would have been replicated throughout the world and the 'cleanup' on the peninsula is arguably the greatest exhibition of the sheer futility of war and the human pain associated with such needless loss. I rate Russel Crowe and his efforts both from an acting standpoint and the physical work were outstanding. The horrific battle scenes were the most emotive I have seen, to see how regular guys can be reduced to such primitive savages will live long in the memory. However the Greek episode could be construed as bias towards the Turks and it lower the tone for me a degree which is sad because it is a stunning anti war effort which goes to the household heartbreak of war."
"kathypig1","9","2","5","25 July 2015"," Gorgeous cinematography and compelling storyline
","Russell Crowe's directorial debut proves he is as capable and gifted behind the camera as he is in front of it. Crowe wisely allows this story to tell itself in visually striking imagery, without allowing it to become overly sentimental, and, though he stars as well as directs this, he avoids the temptation of overweening actor vanity to spoil the narrative. Playing a grieving father of three sons lost in the battle of Gallipoli in 1915, Crowe suffers another tragedy that sets him on a quest to find out the truth about his sons' deaths. There is a big revelation toward the end of the film that could have easily seemed forced and contrived but is beautifully realized by both Crowe and Ryan Corr. Probably an overlooked cinema gem of the year but well worth the watch."
"ahegde3149","6","2","5","27 June 2015"," Heartfelt story of fatherhood
","The Water Diviner is a heartfelt story of a father searching for his sons who went missing during war. Joshua Connor (Russel Crowe) is an Australian farmer whom the title addresses being the one able to find water beneath any land surface. His three sons are speculated dead in the 1915's Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey but no bodies are located or facts are known. Connor decides to go to Turkey to find out fate of his sons as a promise to his wife who commits suicide losing all hope. After reaching Turkey he finds a nice lodge run by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) in Constatinople. They slowly start getting to close to each and the romantic side of the story is quite predictable. Apart from that we have a Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) who for reasons unknown tries to help Connor with his search. <br/><br/>I felt the film was strong with the drama and emotions, also the depiction of intense war scenes made it more engaging. There were many back and forth shifts and flashbacks which may put you off but the screenplay doesn't lose its flow. Some of the flashbacks of Joshua with his sons were heartwarming. The camera work with the Turkish locale and music was simply beautiful! I just wished they didn't dwell that much into romance aspect or they could have made it more authentic. Anyways Olga Kurylenko looked nice. Narrative was straightforward and a few scenes here and there felt clichéd. Despite all that, Russel Crowe gives a master performance carrying the weight of the film on his shoulders all the way with his quest for his sons. The times when the script focused on that it was really good, the rest not so much. Overall, it was a good enough film based on war-drama and fatherhood.<br/><br/>RATING: [3/5]"
"paul-allaer","7","2","5","26 April 2015"," ""You can find water but you can't find your own boys?""
","""The Water Diviner"" (2014 release from Australia; 111 min.) brings the story of Joshua Conner (played by Russell Crowe) and his family. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""inspired by true events"". We are transported to December 20, 1915 to the Battle of Gallipoli, where the Turks are overpowering the ANZACs. We then switch to ""North Western Victoria"", where we see Conor looking for, and finding water (and building a well). At dinner time, Connor's wife is resentful. ""You can find water, but you can't find your own kids?"", she hisses. Shortly thereafter, she drowns in the lake near the house. After the burial, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his three sons, whom he urged to fight ""for flag and country"" and who are presumed dead. At this point we're just 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Several comments: first, it is remarkable that it has taken this long, but this movie marks the directing debut of Russell Crowe. Why he hasn't taken this up sooner, I don't know, but better late than never. Second, the movie makes an almost critical error by not giving a brief historical background note at the beginning of the movie. Do you know who the ANZACs are, and why Australian soldiers ended up fighting in Turkey 100 years ago? I sure didn't. I picked up bits and pieces along the way as the movie unfolded but still, I felt that was an oversight that could've been easily avoided. Third, the script does a good job in providing flashbacks of the Gallipoli battle which eventually reveal what happened to the Connor boys. At the same time, while the movie is ""inspired"" by true events, let's be honest here and just say it outright: this is a historical fictional drama, and quite entertaining, but fictional nevertheless. Last but not least, Crowe leads a cast of mostly unknowns (for me anyway). The little boy who leads Connor to finding a hotel in Istanbul is just delightful, and the little boy's mother is stunningly beautiful. Bottom line: this movie makes for an enjoyable and entertaining historical drama (it won Best Picture at the Australian version of the Oscars this year).<br/><br/>The movie finally opened this weekend on two screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay, and it seemed that the audience was really enjoying the movie quite a bit. This isn't going to see the box office on fire here in the US, but it's a nicely made movie, showing a softer side of Russell Crowe as well as demonstrating that the man certainly knows hoe to direct a movie. If you are into historical dramas, you cannot go wrong with this. Definitely worth check out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

The Water Diviner tells the amazing story of Joshua Connor who, after the death of his wife went to Turky to find the bodies of his sons who died there in the battle of Gallipolli. The plot sounds depressing, but the movie does not follow this sad theme. As a war movie, it portrays the horror of war and does not glorify it. But the romance, that grew between Russell Crowe and Olga Kurylenko makes the plot predictable, though not believable. Who falls in love, while looking for the bodies his own dead sons? There are other bits and pieces of irregularities that catches your eye. You can spot the weak scenes from the stronger ones. Two other weak scenes that I would like to mention is the death of Mrs Connor and the candle light diner between Crowe and Kurylenko."

","Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack, and I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback, well, I waltzed my Matilda all over.
Then in 1915, my country said son, It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done.
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun, and they marched me away to the war.<br/><br/>And the band played Waltzing Matilda, as the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears, we sailed off for Gallipoli
And how well I remember that terrible day, how our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay, we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well. He shower'd us with bullets,
And he rained us with shell. And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.<br/><br/>But the band played Waltzing Matilda, when we stopped to bury our slain.
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, then we started all over again.
And those that were left, well we tried to survive, in that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive, though around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head, and when I woke up in my hospital bed,
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead. Never knew there was worse things than dyin'.<br/><br/>For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda, all around the green bush far and free
To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs-no more waltzing Matilda for me.
So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed, and they shipped us back home to Australia.
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane, those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay, I looked at the place where me legs used to be.
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me, to grieve, to mourn, and to pity.<br/><br/>But the band played Waltzing Matilda, as they carried us down the gangway.
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, then they turned all their faces away
And so now every April, I sit on me porch, and I watch the parades pass before me.
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march, reviving old dreams of past glories
And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore. They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, what are they marching for? And I ask myself the same question.<br/><br/>But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, and the old men still answer the call,
But as year follows year, more old men disappear. Someday no one will march there at all.
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?<br/><br/><ul><li>And the band played Waltzing Matilda</li></ul> Eric Bogle"
"jarth_5","6","1","2","1 January 2017"," An earnest, but flawed, first entry for Crowe.
","One cannot watch this movie without experiencing mixed emotions.This is a well-meaning and earnest film which flaws are the consequence of poorly considered and unbalanced writing and character construction, as well as somewhat simplistic stereotypes.<br/><br/><ul><li>it is not an issue that only 3 women feature in substantial roles in the film; my issue is the positioning of these women. The first is Connor's wife, the mother of his sons, and crucial to the motivation of the plot; we can't expect much of her, given that all we need to know is that the loss of her children understandably induces the loss of her sanity. It is tragic but brief; She rarely features even in flashbacks. The second, Olga Kurylenko's character, is a strong-willed but socially subjugated widow obsessed with her MIA husband; the entirety of her screen time is expended either discussing her missing spouse, the pressure to marry her brother- in-law, her obligations to her son and flirting with Connor; while her character contributes to the story by providing a window into Ottoman Turkish household culture, she really is little more than a love interest for Russel Crowe; the third character is the inn's resident Circassian prostitute - need i say more. It possibly sounds worse than it is. While the female characters are far from purely objectified, they seem to provide little more than support to an otherwise predominantly male film. While failing the Bechdel test, it still manages to be sensitive and relatively respectful, at least at a tertiary level.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>like almost all Australian films that feature British characters, practically every Briton in this film is a cartoon-like, two-dimensional stereotype; the most prominent of which is of course the absolute favourite of Aussie filmmakers: the stuffy, pompous, and insensitive martinet army officer. The only broadly sympathetic British character is a junior naval officer about the right age for a midshipman, but who is bizarrely addressed as a lieutenant, which is very weird. Perhaps predictably for an Australian film about Gallipoli, the real enemy is the Pommie. This adds a two-dimensional and callow aspect to a story which attempts to address a particularly complex period of history; there is absolutely no consideration for depth in relation to any of the British characters whatsoever. </li></ul><br/><br/>-the treatment of the Turkish characters, and Turkish history in this period, is probably the biggest issue,with this film. Australian historiography relating to the Turks at Gallipoli tends towards the respectful and the positive, which may explain the political position of the film, and which by itself is not a problem; but it is the treatment of the Turkish political position in the post-war period that becomes galling; without exception, the Turks are portrayed as the innocent victims of foreign imperialism and aggression; simple, decent and patriotic; every Turkish soldier, for example, is noble and honourable. They are shown as the victim of atrocities committed by the invading Greeks, who feature only sufficiently to identify them as bloodthirsty and murderous monsters bent on genocide and rapine; no mention whatsoever is made of Turkish atrocities against the Greeks, or the Armenians, or anyone else. I don't mean to detract from the quantity of undoubtedly upstanding and decent Turkish men who served their country at this time, but neither do i think that this film's portrayal represents anything like a well- rounded perspective of the period. As a comparison, it would literally be impossible to find a contemporary German film about ww2 which did not feature at least one Character who was a Nazi.<br/><br/>For all its faults, it still manages to project a sense of charm, even while featuring anything as dubious as water-divining. The photography is generally appropriately attractive, the scenery is often enchanting, and the standard of acting is relatively high. The Turkish landscape is wonderfully showcased and the Turkish actors are all competent if not outstanding. If Crowe intends a transition into directing, then this is a strong, albeit flawed, starting point."

","An Australian water diviner, Russell Crowe, loses three sons at Gallipoli in Turkey and after the war travels to the battlefield to retrieve their corpses. I know. It sound lugubrious -- a heavenly choir, the vanquishing of red tape by empathy, as the water diviner divines the skeletons of his sons, one by drawn-out one, and schleps them back home to Australia, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.<br/><br/>Actually, it has plenty of color and dash and it doesn't turn out as expected. Shot in Australia and Turkey, there are some marvelous location shots as we're introduced not just to the battlefield but to Ottoman culture. A stunning shot of the interior of the blue mosque.<br/><br/>Among the Ottoman artifacts is Olga Kurylenko. Somewhere, a religious cult should be established in her honor, its symbol her sternoclavicular notch. What a dish. Body by Bernini, neck by Modigliani. Suddenly, that line from ""Dr. Strangelove"" -- ""toe to toe with the Russkies"" -- doesn't sound like such a bad idea.<br/><br/>The romance is subdued, as is Russell Crowe's performance. He's gained weight and lost definition since ""L.A. Confidential"" and his bulk now resembles that of John Wayne, a kind of massive heft that his brain orders about. He's quite professional as a director too, fond of overhead shots, but not too fond.<br/><br/>The editor should be fired. Sometimes it was easy to get lost. There are flash forwards of whirling dervishes only you don't know they're flash forwards. The whirling dervishes are the decorous public kind, clean and dazed looking, not the Dionysian wild men of the tribal areas. I don't know how they can do it without falling down after the first few minutes.<br/><br/>The film is more sympathetic to some of the Turkish soldiers now occupying the battlefield than it is with the British and Australian graves unit. The villains are Greeks, and there are scenes of battle resembling the perforated train sequence in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and one or two echoes of ""Young Churchill."" The bloody combat scenes are disturbing in that they cause you to worry somewhat about just what the solution to the Middle East is."

The British denies Joshua a permit to Gallipoli. Joshua gets close to Orhan, until one day Ayshe tells her how to get to Gallipoli without permit. Detained at arrival in Gallipoli, Joshua doesn't go back to Istanbul but instead stays on the beach. The ranking officer Lt.Col. Hughes then welcomes Joshua to search for his sons in the field. On an excavation day Hasan walks with Joshua retelling the chronology of a battle night there. It's revealed that Joshua three sons Art, Ed, and Henry are gunned down there. Finding a skull shot at the back of the head, a soldier provoke Joshua into attacking Hasan. Hasan instead then reveal an information that Art may still be alive and was taken prisoner to Istanbul. Back in Istanbul Joshua meets a dead end for more information but he gets closer to Ayshe and Orhan. <br/><br/>Ayshe tells a local fortune telling game of coffee to Joshua, but when the game is done she refuses to tell the coffee's premonitions about him. Joshua steps in to help Ayshe as her husband's brother Omer, who eagerly asks her hand in marriage, starts hitting her. Omer tries to exact revenge but Jemal comes for Joshua. Hasan tells an info that Art maybe taken to Afyon. That night Joshua dreams of Art and knows he's still alive. The British army is determined to send Joshua back home. So Joshua evades capture and joins Hasan and Jemal and the Turk Army to infiltrate to Afyon in the Anatolia. But the group is ambushed by the Greeks on the way. Jemal dies to protect Hasan and Joshua, who then run on horses. They come across a village where Joshua feels Art is, and finally finds him. Art refuses to go with him due to his guilt over his brothers' death. The Greeks have arrive and start to shell the village. Hasan bids them farewell. Art rushes to a hill top to show an escape path to Joshua. Joshua talks to him and Art follows him. Back at Istanbul Joshua finds Ayshe who isn't surprised about him coming back. She says it's in the coffee few weeks back.<br/><br/>The story builds up rather slowly, although with that strong opening sequence. But it nicely presents a solid story about fatherhood, guilt, believe, and redemption. For me it nicely captures a balanced depiction about both sides of the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turks and the ANZACS. The additional romance part nicely stands out without being just a sweetener in the movie. The finale also plays very nicely on emotions with quite a shocking revelation.<br/><br/>The drama feels nicely strong. The movie utilized the back and forth story flow very well in building the memory, character relationships and the common thread for the story. The use of a repeated magic carpet story element that doesn't seem to be relevant to the bigger picture, linked the scenes about Joshua and his sons very nicely.<br/><br/>The depiction of the war has nice enough dose for it. The war does seem intense and real enough although there seem to be more light than needed in the night time war scenes. One thing worth noted is that the choice of the lighting and coloration, especially for the day time scenes, and also the great job in location scouting made the movie feels very much authentic Turkish in it's locations, where instead the movie was shot predominantly in Australia.<br/><br/>The acting overall is surprisingly good in my opinion. Russell Crowe did his most convincing role of a calm Australian father here. His deeper involvement as a director probably drives him for it. Olga Kurylenko also acted out her parts nicely, speaking the Turkce language dialog lines quite convincingly, though I think only native Turk couldn't tell the difference if there's any flaw in the accentuation. The Turkisj cast o Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan also acted their parts nicely convincing. Erdogan can even make his role feels very much emotional.<br/><br/>My say for The Water Diviner (2014) is a score of 7 out of 10. A recommendation goes out as a half-yes from me. But if you're a drama enthusiast, I think this movie will be interesting for you because even I find this quite entertaining."
"diogenes-858-449167","7","3","12","19 March 2015"," Epic First Effort
","Water Diviner, Russ's directorial debut, is a demanding, complex story about an Australian man whose journey is fraught with the consequences of a hard life and the trials of letting his sons go to war. Diviner's production values are top notch. The cinematography excellent. The largely consistent script could so have used a couple more tightening drafts. Having said that, it's possible Russ changed things on set, on instinct and on the fly, as writer Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios's work on this story is obvious and usually impeccable. <br/><br/>I've nothing against romantic elements creeping into a story, but Russ allows too many emotional colors and sentimental textures to bleed together in this story telling. Dramatic peaks suffer from that sentimentality, which shows Russ's inexperience as a director. Some of the dialogue, meant to be innocent or naive, also indulges sentimentality. It's interesting to see these chinks and flaws appear in Russ's judgment in his story telling. Those criticisms aren't to detract from his major achievement in producing an entertaining and watchable romantic war drama. To give Russell his full due, directing and acting in a film epic of this nature was no mean feat. Russ and his crew have done an excellent job. It's just that where Russ's judgement is flawed, so is the film. Had Director Russ allowed himself a mentoring assistant, someone with proved chops in the Directorial story telling department, I have no doubt I would be standing and applauding The Water Diviner. I salvage that kudos and bestow it upon the awesome performance of Yilmaz Erdogan. He gave this story the touch of gravitas and authenticity it needed to be satisfying. <br/><br/>I look forward to supporting Russ's next effort. That he's known to us as Russ, it goes without saying how much he's loved like a brother in Australia and New Zealand for his achievements already."

","The water diviner with his sixth sense and his superior martial skills make this movie pretty bad. Historical inaccuracies and distortions make it plainly disturbing.
The time this movie takes place is very special for the Ottoman Empire. Before WWI the empire was probably the most multicultural country of that time. Gallipoli is the greek name of the city, at least this is shown in the movie, Turks use a different name. After the war, Turkish nationalism and religious fanaticism rose significantly. Hate and crimes towards Greek, Armenian and Assyrian citizens started during the war and reached the point of genocide. All we see in this movie is how the Turkish suffered from the Greek invasion which started in 1919. 6-7 years after the Turks had set in motion their ethnic cleansing. Yes, of course this bred too much hate from Greeks towards Turks. Greeks are shown as a pile of dirty and purely evil criminals attacking ""all innocent"" Turks, no comment, no context.
A couple years later Turks achieved their ethnic cleansing and the Ottoman Empire became Turkey. Turkey still doesn't recognise these genocides, although many countries do, such as Germany and Netherlands.
Movie ending: ""This film is dedicated to all those who remain lost and nameless and who live on in the hearts and memories of their families"" is just too disrespectful considering these."

","This directorial debut from Russell Crowe is an emotional tale of a fathers journey to find his lost sons that is full of love and hope. This movie, for a first time director was mostly well directed and very beautifully shot. The cinematography really engages you in the film both during and away from the action, it adds to the quality and overall enjoyment of the film. Russell Crowe's performance was as always just amazing, he really put a lot of emotion into his character and that showed through his endless efforts to not give up on a promise he made to his wife. The longer this movie goes on the more you realise that this is not only about a search for his sons but a movie showing the determination of an individual who has lost everything and will not lose any more. Apart from Russell the other performances were also well done, mainly by both Olga Kurylenko and Jai Courtney but they never really stood out too much. <br/><br/>One issue i had is that the first third of the film during Russell's introduction to Istanbul, spent too much time focusing on establishing the supporting characters, i wanted it to move on to the main plot rather than spending more time there. Some of his other visits to this location felt more meaningful and interesting, if only they had shortened his initial visit. Also there were some co- incidences that i didn't really buy into during his time in Gallipoli and a potential romance that was pretty predictable right from the beginning, small issues, nothing major. Russell Crowe's directorial debut, despite some minor flaws, was an emotional and at times intense film that hopefully gets recognised outside of Australia. - 7.6<br/><br/>P.S - If you don't tear up towards the end of the film, well then you have no soul."

"rogerdarlington","Null","2","8","4 April 2015"," A very commendable directorial debut
","Since Russell Crowe came to the attention of cinema-goers worldwide in ""L. A. Confidential"" (1997), he has starred in some 25 films and given a series of terrific performances - most notably in ""Gladiator"" - but this is the first film that he has directed. He also takes the lead role as Australian rancher Joshua Connor, who loses three sons in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, so this is clearly a very personal movie for Crowe as well as for Australians generally in the centenary year after the conflict (director Peter Weir covered the battle more directly in his 1981 work ""Gallipoli"").<br/><br/>What makes Crowe's film interesting is that he treats sympathetically the viewpoint of the defending Ottoman Turks underlining their losses as well as those of the ANZAC troops (65,000 Turks dead and 46,000 Allies dead including 7,600 Australians), depicting the rise of Turkish nationalism and resistance against Greek invaders, and providing serious roles for Turkish actors. The battle scenes are well done and the cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>What weakens the work rather is a degree of sentimentality, partly around the powers of divining but more especially around the relationship between the Ozzie farmer and a local woman played by former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko. Also the one British character depicted has an appalling accent and is unfairly stereotypical. But overall this is a very commendable directorial debut by Crowe and augers well for his future career."

","When the story line refers to historical events in an inaccurately dramatised way then the audience of the movie, particularly the younger ones, see it as actual history. This movie unfortunately falls neatly in this category. The Gallipoli campaign was a terrible tragedy. The attempt by the Allies to seize the Gallipoli peninsula from the Ottoman turks and gain control over the strategically important Dardanelles failed in a welter of hubris, blood and suffering. A terrible, solemn, tragedy, indeed. The battle of Gallipoli did actually happen as did the alliance of Turkey with Germany in WWW1. The movie also touched on some unhistorical skirmishes with Greek militia presented like pirates of the Caribbean, but it did not, conveniently, touch on the Armenian genocide in progress by the turks during and after WWW1, and certainly in the days during and after Gallipoli. It is rather perplexing as to why Russell Crow, an accomplished actor, participated in this movie, in a role that seemed to have kept him below average."

The direction on he other hand ... that's up for discussion, unless you argue it was the script that needed improvements.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie is emotional and it does take you on a (literal) journey. It also seems very strong on making a point in showing gray areas in war and laying out blame. To a certain degree that is, because you do get some ""bad people"" to, which is a shame and not consistent to what the message should be about.

","""Are there any more records about my son? We are Ottomans, not Germans. ""<br/><br/>It looks like ""Russell Crowe movie week"" here. After ""Fathers and daughters"" I had to check his directorial debut. And to be honest, I thought this postwar dramatic film was much better than the sugarcoated ""Fathers and daughters"". In both films the father figure plays an important role. In ""The Water Diviner"" however, he's a grieving father whose sons were killed in the Battle of Gallipoli, which took place in Turkey during the 1st World War. A bloody battle, on a piece of land as large as a handkerchief, between Turkish troops and a corps with Australian and New Zealand troops (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps or ANZAC). It's beyond dispute that wars provide disgusting scenes which once again demonstrate the absurdity of such tragedies. The agony of the three brothers on the battlefield was the most unpleasant and difficult part of the entire movie. It was so terrible to watch. I really had enough of it at a given time. The relevance was clear to me. It wasn't clear to me why it had to take so miserable long.<br/><br/>Apart from a few hiccups, I thought it was a fairly successful film. Looking at the technical side of the movie, you could say it was excellent. Perhaps it seemed to be a dramatized travel documentary at times. But the palette of colored fabrics and the interior view of Turkish mosques assured some visually stunning images. The phenomenal scene in Australia, where Connor (Russell Crowe) protects his three sons against an impressive sandstorm, was a breathtaking moment. And this impressive imagery is used throughout this reasonable epic adventure story. It resembled a bit ""The Physician"". In this case it's someone from down-under who gazes at the traditions, the folklore and the beauty of Istanbul. Naturally this leads to intercultural conflicts with a few yelling Turks, who defend their values, and a fleeing Aussie.<br/><br/>The historical side was also fascinating. I don't know that much about the 1st World War. And certainly not about what happened in the Arab part of the world. The Turkish community wasn't happy about welcoming Australian tourists afterwards. This was also presented realistic. At the same time the cooperation between the ANZAC and Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) also didn't proceed so smoothly and the intense hatred again resurfaced. And just let me mention the scene at the beginning with the local priest who has a huge problem with the burial of Connor's wife, because she committed suicide apparently. A strong moment. A proof that the short-slightness and insensitivity remained intact through the years.<br/><br/>Altogether it's a wonderful debut from Crowe. And this combined with a not so bad leading role. The role Erdogan played was also noteworthy. A calm Turkish Major who forgets his grievances and offers his help to identify the tens of thousands of victims without hesitation. And additionally also aid Connor with his search for his lost sons. Dylan Georgiades plays the role of son Orhan enthusiastically. While the ultra-cool Olga Kurylenko gives shape to the widow Ayshe. An exotic beauty who's aloof at first, but as the film progresses her icy attitude slowly melts.<br/><br/>And now it's time for the disappointing elements of this yet fascinating film. The ""station novel""-like love story that was incorporated, wasn't really necessary according to me. The fact that it's about two individuals from two different cultures and each bearing a loss due to the war, sounds plausible. But they should have left it at that. The paranormal talent Connor supposedly possessed, was grossly exaggerated. Sure, maybe he can find water in the bone-dry Australian desert by using a twig. I'm willing to believe that. But him standing in the middle of a battlefield in a sort of trance surrounded by the rotting remains of thousands of victims and miraculously finding the location where his sons are lying, was a bit ridiculous. And then the Indiana Jones imitation in the end, clashed a bit with the rest of the film. But the biggest annoyance was the sound. The dramatic music and sound effects were terribly noisy. By contrast, the conversations were at whisper level. I had a sore thumb afterwards because I had to use continuously the volume button. But ultimately it was still a magnificent movie.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","Surprisingly I enjoyed this historical war drama about a father searching for his sons in the aftermath of WWI in Turkey. The Gallipoli battle scenes are well done and exciting. The locations are stunning and exotic. The Istanbul hotel is charming. Some of the continuity is lacking between scenes and the story seems to progress abruptly in some scenes. The sending of so many British soldiers after one poor old man is ludicrous.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and is well crafted around the historical context. Looking for bodies in the aftermath of battle is quite a powerful anti war statement. Liked the political correctness by showing the Turkish point of view (you invaded us). The weakness is in the message of reconciliation which is a bit too strong - hints of romance between Crowe and the stunning Olga Kurlyenko and between his son and the lady of the night is too much. Russell is too old for Olga. That kind of cheapens the effect and seems like a plump old man's fantasy.<br/><br/>Worth a watch."
"Lejink","5","1","3","2 January 2016"," Joshua fit the battle
","Russell Crowe's directorial debut shows that he has skill behind as well as in front of the camera but ultimately, even bearing the legend ""inspired by true events"", in the end this well-meaning film ran away from itself as the unexpected, coincidental and just plain ridiculous piled up the longer it went on.<br/><br/>The first scenes of Crowe himself show him divining water in the Australian outback which somehow qualifies him to later pick out the long buried remains of two of his three soldier sons at the infamous Gallipoli battlefield. Miraculously, although shot too in battle shoulder to shoulder with his brothers, the third son survives, although not before witnessing his siblings' excruciating deaths and also not without an overwhelming sense of guilt not just because his brothers have put themselves in harm's way by trying to rescue him in the first place but because of the drastic step he has to take to take to ease the pain of one of them.<br/><br/>Crowe also loses his wife firstly to insanity no doubt brought on by the grief over her loss and then to suicide when she finally can't go on. With nothing left to live for, Crowe embarks on his unlikely mission to bring his sons's remains back home to bury alongside their mother, stubbornly defying officialdom as personified by the officer class he encounters in the Australian, British and even the Turkish armies. He also hooks up with a young, pretty, Turkish war widow-hotelier, at her hotel, where he stays, she herself being coerced into an undesired arranged marriage with her late husband's brother. Her young son tricks Crowe into staying at their hotel and it's not too long before he strikes up a friendship with the mischievous youngster.<br/><br/>I liked must of the early scenes, in particular the moving one where Crowe's wandered wife implores him to read from the Arabian Nights to the obviously empty beds of their children. However the narrative starts to lose credibility when he defends the young widow's honour, hooks up with a couple of Turkish vets on the run from their territorial rivals the Greeks and accomplishes a series of death-defying escapes as he homes in on his surviving son.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot and well acted as it is, like I said the only things more clichÃ©d than the action sequences at the end were some excerpts from the dialogue too. Crowe knows where to put the camera to tell his story and is well supported by a convincing cast too. However in the final round-up, I just couldn't buy into the would-be happy endings which while they may be the long-suffering Crowe's just reward, in the end seemed too sentimental as well as unbelievable to, forgive the pun, hold water.<br/><br/>All it needed to make this film work better was a more grounded narrative as it winged its way to an upbeat conclusion. Crowe's attempt at an outback epic in the end though well intended and made fell short at the writing stage."

The closing credits have the common disclaimer that none of the incidents and characters are intended to represent real persons so we must assume it is primarily a fictional story. <br/><br/>The other thing, viewers outside Australia and New Zealand are not as familiar with the Turkish battle of Gallipoli so some additional information is useful. The opening has a scene where ships are sailing away and a caption tells us that the ANZAC troops are leaving. I had to look it up, 'ANZAC' is for 'Australian and New Zealand Army Corps' recruited and fighting on behalf of the British. They were formed in Egypt in 1915 and disbanded in 1916 following the Allied evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, who also directs, stars as Connor, an Australian farmer who had this three young adult sons join the ANZAC and fight in the battle of Gallipoli. When they didn't come home he assumed they were all killed in combat. So many were killed that they were thrown into makeshift graves with no identification. So going over 4 years later to find them would be quite a task, but Connor, after his wife dies of grief, goes over, quite unprepared for what faced him.<br/><br/>It is a bit slow in parts, there is some fighting and action in other parts, but overall a nicely worthwhile movie to see.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Connor is a water diviner back home, we see one instance where he used two rods to find a new well for his livestock and crops. When he gets to Turkey he must befriend some locals, a difficult task because many believed they were still at war with the Allies, but he makes it unofficially to the battle field where, under the supervision of British and Australian officers, were looking for buried dead with the intent to identify as many as they could by the dog tags still buried with them. Connor mills around, has visions, and ""divines"" the location of his sons, they dig, they find two of them but not the third. Connor eventually hunts him down and finds out why he never went home. He was supposed to protect his brothers, instead as they lay mortally wounded he shot his brother in the head to end his misery and that guilt had prevented him returning home.

","No doubt that Russel is a great actor who made many remarkable roles and worked with great directors, in this movie it seems that Crowe learned some things from these directors, there are some positives in Crowe's first film but there are also little mistakes. First the script is good, has many sensational parts enforced with great acting abilities from Russel and his fellas. Soundtrack and music are good and represent the emotions and feeling of the characters, with a mix from eastern and Australian music. The song of the movie at ending title was so good and it was a completion of the musician effort at this movie. The greatest thing for me is cinematography, Andrew Lesnie (The cinematographer of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) showed us a great and marvelous pictures,the colors,the shades and angles of camera. What I didn't like was FLASHBACKS, It was many and the same at every time, Crowe showed it as a memory of the leading character but he wasn't there to have a memory of these events. So how he knew it. The worst thing was visual effects of some fire and explosions, it was poorly done and it looks like as in a cheap Turkish drama(The worst visual effects I've ever seen is in Turkish drama). It was a good start by Russel Crowe behind the camera but he has to avoid the mistakes - which were few- next time, and i really hope for a next time. My final rate is 7.5/10"

A little bit gladiator (The Gladiator), a bit of the gun slinger (3:10 To Yuma), and even a bit of the wine maker (A Good Year). But by the end of the film you see him as the character he plays in this film. His portrayal of an Australian dad in search of his sons does come shining through by the end.<br/><br/>As the films director, Crowe shows the influences of Ridley Scott's mentoring. And that is a good thing because Russell has played the lead character in several of Scotts movies, and they were all good films. So, I would have to give Crowe a big thumbs up on his direction. I do get the feeling a lot of this movie wound up on the floor of the editing room.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it is well written but does get slow a few times and seems to wonder off track a few times. But this should not keep you from watching this film. The ending is a little twisty but the final payoff is worth the sluggish plot line.<br/><br/>Not a true war story, not a love story and not even an action movie but a little bit of all of these.

","Russel Crowe has wowed us with his acting, so he finally took his shot as Director/Actor. I really think he took on a little too much with a historical war drama here. The story, although shot very well, lacks the narrative that in the end is compelling. He hit all the points to make a decent story, but didn't really carry through in a believable way with the film's namesake, ""The Water Diviner."" The opening scene is good with him finding water via a divining rod, and the story sets up well with the main character (father) feeling he let his boys go to war, and losing them. He sets out to find them using his talents spiritually like he would find water. The problem is that concept barely carries through the film, and what ensues is mostly dull scenes in search of his sons that carry little dramatic weight. Historical inaccuracies abound (Gallipoli Campaign backdrop), there is some decent acting, but the film falls flat for more than the second and third act.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a pretty well done little film if you ignore most of things mentioned above, and would like to see Mr. Crowe act in a film. His leading lady does a nice job with what's she's given, and certainly not hard to look at. Mr. Crowe deserves some additional credit for the tenacious self promotion for the film. He's traveled everywhere it's opened, and been very active in social media. The film now is opening across the United States at the time of this writing. I personally would save the viewing for release on DVD etc."

In the beginning we see Connor find water using 2-metal wands (clothes hangers will suffice) and we expect to see more magic along these lines. He gets to Gallipoli and does discover the graves of two of his sons, but not the third son. Hence the magic stops.<br/><br/>In his mind's eye Connor sees, the battle scenes which claimed his sons. These scenes are quite graphic and we see something we never see in movies. We see soldiers wounded and cannot move, but we hear their groans because their pain is so great. Just listening to these groans is upsetting. This showed us a side of War that we don't normally see or even consider. Until now.<br/><br/>There is a love interest for Connor when he sets his base of operations in a Turkish bed and breakfast hotel and here we see Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) who runs the business. Ayshe considers this Australian as the enemy and wants nothing to do with him. Of course, movie magic takes over and she warms to him. This relationship doesn't go anywhere and why it's included in the movie is not clear. A candle lighted dinner later on between these two was a bit much for something that didn't go anywhere. See?<br/><br/>Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) becomes Connor's guide and friend as he leads Connor to a location where Connor's third son may be alive. Along the way we see a battle with Greeks attacking the train Turkish soldiers - including Connor - are on. Keep in mind this is 1919 and the last year of the War to End all Wars. So the War is not yet over. <br/><br/>Overall this is pretty good mostly because of the acting performances by the entire cast and the cinematography which is very good throughout. There are elements of this being an epic, but doesn't quite make it so. We needed more magic and it didn't happen, and maybe more CGI as we saw with a humongous sandstorm in the beginning and lastly the music didn't signal epic-like proportions. This stayed as a simple pretty good story of a father trying to find his sons. (7/10)<br/><br/>Russell Crowe directed this movie. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","The Water Diviner is Russell Crowe's directorial debut for a full-length feature. He takes a father's search for his sons into an adventurous scale. This is meant to be a quest of a man who has nothing left to lose, but suddenly finds empathy towards the people who he should blame. It sounds like a possibly complex drama, but the film chooses the typical direction of what normally results as a glossy cinema. While the star's inspiration from the films he's been does show in his directorial style, the soul rather follows the artificial and melodramatic roots which hardly makes it compelling.<br/><br/>The overall film hardly has any sense of subtlety, while it's obviously building some sentimentality, the first half is quite solid at making things seem bleaker, as emotions genuinely breathes through the scenery. When Connor starts interacting with the locals, it's sort of engaging at first, but these relationships only shines to the conventional extent. It's nice that the story has to play shades of gray with both cultures which are supposed to be against with each other, but these characters aren't given enough interesting, or more specific, fresh characterization. The kid is the typical kid best friend of the hero in many adventure movies and the lead female character is basically the unfortunate one who is getting an unwanted favor, but also hinting a romance to the protagonist. Without the fact that this is a true story or any of the dramatic schmaltz, this film might as well be some generic adventure movie, just with a little less action.<br/><br/>And that theory just keeps getting true. There is one point where the main character plays Cricket with some fellow soldiers on a train, and when they are suddenly attacked by some enemies, Connor happens to defend them with a Cricket bat. It seems more like a comedic moment you would find in a classic adventure film, but these kinds of strange moments that keeps showing up in this film just never felt like it even belonged here. Russell Crowe as a director seems to bring an ""epic"" treatment into this story, but with these choices being put together, it just gone otherworldly compared to its earnest and grounded first half. Moments of levity aren't bad, but it would have been more appropriate if it was more authentic and less contrived than what we saw. The direction is more impressive when the grandness is spoken on the visuals, like the flashback scene where Connor runs towards his children to protect them from a formidable dust storm. The acting is fine, with Crowe does his own thing while manages to invest some charm, but really, all of them eventually embraces the tone in the latter parts.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner is watchable enough, though it just shifts from an engaging bleakness to strange silliness. It somehow comes close to some Hallmark Hall of Fame or something. While the production and acting are at least impressive, it just can't completely gloss over to what the movie eventually become. There is a potential that this is going to involve a compelling theme about war or sacrifice, but what took over is the generic choices towards its characters and sentiments. It just isn't smart enough if it attempts to go through that level, therefore the journey ends up being rather disappointing."

"The_Badger_Man","6","1","8","18 March 2015"," Decent Australian War Drama
","In his feature film directorial debut, Russell Crowe displays his competence behind the camera but not all that much else. This pseudo-sequel to Peter Weir's Gallipoli (1981) covers Joshua Conner's (Russell Crowe) attempt to come to terms with the loss of his family by traveling halfway across the globe for a piece of Turkish beauty and widow, Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko).<br/><br/>The performances are fair. Crowe channels his inner Robin Hood as he travels to foreign lands, draws the hatred then love of a widow of a recently-concluded war, and gets molested by children who he later befriends and adopts. Native Australian Jai Courtney proves to us once again that he doesn't suck at acting, but he can't add much to his films either. Young Aussie newcomer Dylan Georgiades personifies the bundle of joy that children are to their parents as he helps Conner in his quest to win the heart of his own mother. <br/><br/>In all seriousness though, the largest strength of this piece is its display and examination of Turkish/Ottoman culture in the aftermath of The Great World War. We tour Turkey as foreigners and learn its customs through the eyes of Crowe's Conner and its angst during its transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Turkey through Yılmaz Erdoğan's Major Hasan, an Ottoman officer during the invasion of Gallipoli.<br/><br/>One of my bigger problems with the film is the Kurylenko's part as love interest for Crowe. It's unmemorable and feels slightly forced and clichéd following in the footsteps of many romantic comedies that have come before. The direction from Crowe can be too heavy- handed at times as he strives for emotional and spiritual breakthroughs. However, the thing that annoyed me the most was the opening credit's font. It was difficult to read.<br/><br/>I had some ideas on the title as well. I think ""Return to Gallipoli"", ""Gallipoli 2: The Aftermath"", ""Gallipoli: Ottoman 2 Turkey"", ""A Father's Promise"", ""Father and Sons"", ""Source of Hope"" (Croatian title), ""Promises of War"" (Brazilian title), or ""The Promise of a Life"" (German title) would all have made better and more fitting names for the English distribution.<br/><br/>I wish more big films were made about WWI. It was a beast that not many understand (including yours truly). The film is solidly compelling all the way through and provides a very entertaining history lesson; however, it lacks any truly awe-inspiring moments (except maybe the well-digging scene; that was cool). I'd recommend taking a look back at Gallipoli (1981) starring Mel Gibson if you want to see more on Gallipoli (or if you just want a better movie)."

","This film is not as good as some WW1 classics such as 1918, Gallipoli, or Paths of Glory, but it certainly places fourth on that short list. This is a very nice effort by Russell Crowe, with a lot of help from a talented supporting cast and a very interesting script. The one thing about this film I found interesting was the treatment of Turkey and the Turks in WW 1. No other Hollywood film has shown them in such a positive light. Lawrence of Arabia merely showed them in a stereotypical way (they were the BAD guys) and other films have depicted the Turks as just background for WW1 topical films. This is the first film that delves into WW from the Turkish standpoint. I did not buy the romantic aspect of the film, but that was a minor glitch. The primary story is overwhelming enough to overcome that small bump in the road."

"d_carlotaj","10","0","1","4 February 2020"," TWD: A Mock Redaction of Legends of the Fall
","""The Water Diviner,"" (2014). Directed by Russell Crowe. Starring Russell Crowe, Olga Kurylenko, and Yilmaz Edogan. This is a wonderful movie. It is, in fact, a redaction of the mock epic,""Legends of the Fall,"" (LOTF). The writers, Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios, must have analyzed the plot points and determined that some of them needed to be corrected because their impetus was based on faulty humanistic ideals. For instance, in LOTF, the three Ludlow boys go off to join WWI because they feel a patriotism to Germany and their cousins in the war. But in TWD, to Connor, the guiding principle for going to war is to make a statement of principle rather than land acquisition. There are many such dichotomies. Included in the dichotomies is the point of view of the Turks, the invaded country, by a ranking colonel of the enemy forces, played by Yilmaz Erdogan. This film reflects a humanistic, enlightened world view. And it shows us the transformation of the power of familial love. This is a point-of-view movie that will lift the spirit. In the beginning of the movie, we see how geographical empath Connor uses his gift to find water. But as the story progresses, we see Connor develop his spiritual powers to be of service to people who need him. It's a wonderfully uplifting film and touches that which is human in us.
This movie is on Netflix. 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy!"

"fewald139","9","0","1","28 October 2019"," Beautiful film that explores wisps of hope found through countless tragedies
","I try to watch as many movies as I can about war, so I added The Water Diviner to my watchlist as soon as it hit Netflix. A movie set after the action admittedly sounded like it risked being boring; however, this was anything but.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays a stoic, even docile father whose soft-spoken manner doesn't get in the way of his ambition to risk inconvenience, travel, and even injury and death to find the bodies of his sons lost in the Battle of Gallipoli. He knows their date of death and that they died together--nothing else. He travels to Turkey, meeting various characters who either help or hinder his efforts. Jai Courtney (an actor I've been seeing a lot lately who excels in historical roles) is interesting and demanding of attention here in the short time he's on screen. Olga Kurylenko gives a noteworthy performance as Ayshe, and Yilmaz Erdogan's character of Major Hasan was both layered and respectful.<br/><br/>The Water Diviner avoids over-dramatizing for the sake of Hollywood drama (save for the last shot of the film, though its inclusion was understandable after the gut-wrenching affair the rest of the film puts its audience through). One must give credit to the film for showing the nuance and various layers to all sides of the war and its participants. Major Hasan (at one point in the movie blamed for the deaths of the brothers) is a complex and interesting character that, in any other movie, could be portrayed as the simple ""enemy"". Instead, The Water Diviner strives to remain unbiased in terms of war and politics and remains focused on the human condition.<br/><br/>Action scenes are not scarce in the film, either. The movie actually opens up with one, though more are sprinkled throughout the film as both flashbacks of the Battle of Gallipoli and as new struggles Crowe has to get through as a foreigner in Turkey during a time of unrest. It's not as action-packed as some war movies given its subject matter, but regardless, The Water Diviner never bored me. It did make me tear up during one phenomenal scene showing the aftermath of a charge (men bleeding out, missing pieces of themselves, crying and groaning), and that's usually hard to do. I applaud this film for tearing through my heart like a meat grinder; the brutal realities of war are explored in full here, as is the devastating aftermath on the people the dead leave behind.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved The Water Diviner. Full of tragedy and the exploration of the human condition in two cultures on either side of a bloody divide, this was one hell of a movie. I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in history or war and who can stomach its brutal realities."

"classicsoncall","7","0","1","13 May 2019"," ""Because he's the only father who came looking.""
","The story has only a tenuous connection to the title of the movie. Russell Crowe's character, Joshua Connor, who used his divining ability to locate water wells on his farmland, somehow translates this ability to locating the remains of his three sons missing in battle at Gallipoli, Turkey in 1915 during World War I. I'm not sure if that was the best way to demonstrate his resolve in finding his sons, all presumed to have died during that campaign. The film could have been made without the 'water diviner' connection, as the presence of Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) was instrumental in locating the exact battlefield where the casualties took place. The mystical visions Connor experienced at the battle site, now a vast graveyard, were too conveniently effective to establish where his sons were buried, not to mention the overwhelming odds of finding the dog tags of two of the dead sons by his Aussie hosts.<br/><br/>What's effective in the film, as mentioned earlier, is Joshua Connor's resolve to locate his sons as a final promise granted to his wife. Her death is perhaps meant to be purposely ambiguous, as it's called an accident by Joshua, though my thoughts immediately went to suicide in despondency over the family she lost. Which would only be exacerbated if her husband were not to return from his dauntless task. The story also effectively demonstrates how former enemies, Turks and Aussies, could set aside their differences from the war to pay respects to the fallen at Gallipoli. In particular, Joshua, who was not a soldier, was able to suppress his initial hatred for Major Hasan to eventually prove himself a valuable ally.<br/><br/>The hint of a potential romance between Joshua and the Turkish hotel owner Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) wasn't as distracting from the principal story as it might have been. Again, initial impressions served to foster a dislike for each other, with the presence of Ayshe's son (Dylan Georgiades) a mitigating factor. The film doesn't seek closure on their relationship, though one can probably read between the lines well enough. Joshua's discovery of his remaining son (Ryan Corr) who survived the Battle of Gallipoli was handled with some suspension of disbelief, while his confession of battle field circumstances regarding the death of brother Ed the most heart wrenching aspect of the movie."

","First of all the film is beautiful, full marks for cinematography. For me this is Russell Crowe's directorial debut and it shows. the film is good, but I didn't find myself empathising with his character Joshua Connor and even less with the family. Maybe Mr Crowe is just trying too hard for a big blockbuster, but as they say from small acorns and I fully expect that with his first film under the belt he will become much more adventurous. It isn't a bad start, just not great. I found myself more drawn to the Colin Firth character in The Railway Man.
