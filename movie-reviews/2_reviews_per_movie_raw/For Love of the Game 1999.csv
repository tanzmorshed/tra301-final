"Kindo","Null","59","71","12 September 1999"," The real American pastime
","For Love Of The Game<br/><br/>Maybe I'm looking at this film through rose colored glasses. Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, a real talent with visual ingenuity and a penchant for silliness. With last holiday's bleak A SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi gave up his EVIL DEAD past and churned out the most satisfying dramatic thriller of last year. He is certainly growing by leaps and bounds as a storyteller, and his latest film, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, is another surprise for those of us who are fans. A truly elegant, dashingly romantic, white-knuckled look at baseball and matters of the human heart, GAME represents what a true Hollywood soap opera should be, effective.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher for the Detroit Tigers heading for the mound for may be his last time ever. The team owner has sold the organization to a corporation and they have plans to trade Billy. His arm continues to fail him more every time he steps up to thrown. And to top it all off, Billy must deal with his tempestuous relationship with Jane, a woman he met by a broken down car on the side of the road five years ago and has yet to fully commit to. With all these thoughts swirling inside Billy's head, he unknowingly begins pitching a perfect game. Unable to keep his mind clear, Billy thinks back on his life during the game and considers the mistakes he has made and the people he has met.<br/><br/>Told mostly in flashback, LOVE OF THE GAME is first and foremost a baseball movie. While being knocked for his recent professional choices (yeah, I liked THE POSTMAN, say what you will) Kevin Costner seems to have been crowned king of the baseball flicks. Ron Shelton's BULL DURHAM is pure genius, the best baseball film ever. FIELD OF DREAMS is more like GAME, both share a strong heartbeat and retaining a smart enthusiasm for the sport. Costner has been the glue that held both films together. He's always been a good actor, only reaching brilliance once (DURHAM). He has the rare charm the many actors forget to consider. While not technically proficient, Costner knows screen charisma well. GAME gives us a desperate Costner performance, one which lets the actor take his guard down for once. His Billy Chapel is a man used to success, yet unsure how to use it to his advantage. A man who can hardly imagine himself consumed by anything but baseball. It's a great performance from Costner. My only hope is that public opinion doesn't tarnish the acting for the paying crowd.<br/><br/>Kelly Preston has the more troublesome task of shining brighter than Costner. A working actress for sometime now, this new film feels like the first time Preston is really acting. I enjoyed her supporting work in 1998's underrated JACK FROST, and GAME finally puts her front and center. She bounces effortlessly of Costner, and the two - while skittish at first - melt into a nice chemistry that packs more emotion than I expected. The loopy John C. Reilly (BOOGIE NIGHTS) and Jena Malone (STEPMOM) are also quite pleasant in small roles.<br/><br/>Working with even more restraint than his SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi brings to the table his gift for camera placement and visual tenacity. The baseball scenes in GAME are very romantic, the title doesn't lie. A self-professed fanatic of baseball, Raimi's love of the game shows in each shot. With noted cinematographer John Bailey, the two create a pristine looking film. The stadium scenes are both frightening cinematic and realistic at the same time. The look of the film might not register with many people, but I couldn't help but to admire such attention to detail.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Dana Stevens made quite an impression with her spare and warm CITY OF ANGELS remake. What she brings to GAME is the feeling of courtship that I enjoyed in Costner's last film MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. Costner and Preston really show the genesis of a relationship, warts and all. The structure of flashback that Stevens uses to tell the story isn't as unfortunate as it sounds. It's all a rather nice mix of familiar baseball melodrama and a hearty dose of Hollywood soap opera. Stevens proves once again that she has a wonderful ear for romantic entanglements.<br/><br/>Call me a sucker for the obvious, but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME really worked for me. I really was moved by the story and enjoyed all the nuances and quirks. This classy film might not have a hero with a chainsaw for a hand, a crispy scientist with a reliance on synthetic skin, or a quickdrawing Sharon Stone. What it does have is strong emotional resonance. A audience film that the mainstream will love and the arthouse will abhor. I'll take that any day.-------- 10/10"
"Dan1863Sickles","8","40","48","12 October 2006"," Even If You Hate Baseball -- and Kevin Costner -- This Movie Still Rocks!
","Why do I love this movie so much? I'm not a baseball fan. I didn't really like FIELD OF DREAMS. And I hated BULL DURHAM. Yet this movie just captivates me every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Part of it is the tight, real-time structure -- the whole movie takes place in a man's head while he pitches a perfect baseball game on the mound. It therefore combines the tension of a thriller with the poignant emotions of an elegy.<br/><br/>But what I loved most about this movie is that there are no clichés. Kevin Costner's character, Billy Chapel, is not a ""sports underdog."" It's very clear he is a great athlete who has had a great career, and that he can walk away at any time with lots of money and lots of respect. The only reason that pitching the perfect game matters to him is purely for the perfection of his art -- for the love of the game.<br/><br/>At the same time, not all the action is on the baseball diamond. In the romantic drama, Kevin Costner does much more than play the usual Costner ""nice guy."" Billy Chapel can be cold, egocentric, and difficult -- just like any other creative artist. But he always surrounds himself with people who are strong enough to challenge him and help him stay grounded. It's no exaggeration to say that the supporting cast in this film -- John C. Reilly as the catcher, Kelly Preston as the girl friend, and Jena Malone as the girl friend's adorable teenage daughter -- are very much the stars. They really set Costner up for an unusually mature, disciplined performance. Just the way Chapel's team mates set him up for the perfect game! This movie wasn't that well received by the critics. I remember one frightfully cultured fellow at the NEW YORKER sniffing that Costner's character is ""arrogant."" Note well that if an artist or an intellectual is cold and demanding, it's okay. But athletes should be jolly, ape like simpletons, the kind who know their place. This complex, poignant movie is actually quite subversive, since it forces you to realize that baseball is a thinking man's game and that athletes (and their working class fans) are not nearly as stupid as the real simpletons who write for the NEW YORKER.<br/><br/>Shocking!!!"
"wildhart","8","46","57","19 March 2001"," This Film Is About Life
","This film is much more than a beautiful film about baseball. It's about life....about the continuity of life... about moving on... about taking stock of who you are, and who you are going to be. Billy Chapel stands there, quietly, introspectively, doing what he has always done, what he wants to always do, but knowing at the same time, through his reflections and his actions, that things change nevertheless. At the crux of the pennant game for the Yankees, this Detroit pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound, knowing, seeing, the flow of life. His team sold, knowing his days for the Tigers are over, that his catcher will likely not be there again, that his great love is leaving, that her daughter has grown, his friend playing now for the Yankees, even the last pitcher he faces - who began as a Tiger bat boy for the team his father played for, the Tigers - a boy whom the announcers say has no idea of what this moment is, although he does, his team owner watching the last great game of summer... deciding... about the rest of his life. Through his comments, his thoughts, and his reflections, he evaluates not only where he is going, but who he is and what he will be. And at the precipice of the rest of his life, a perfect game in the balance, he finds it... what his life means. This film never fails to make me cry."

","This has to be one of the best movies I have ever watched and watched and... well, you get the picture.It is a revealing account of relationships and feelings and trust. Set during one major league baseball game, a man relives the past five years of his life from the pitchers mound. He realizes, over what may be the course of a perfect game, that his life has been anything but perfect. That the really important things in life are slipping away from him.This movie is full of life, it's sweet. It draws you in and holds your interest. I think the movie was underrated because of the subject matter. A romantic baseball movie? but that's just the surface. This movie goes very deep. If you give it a chance you will see that the reality of the setting and the people are extremely captivating, as well as fun. I can't think of another movie that has made me feel so good and so satisfied at the end. If you like baseball you can't help but love this movie. It's full of the most realistic ball playing I have ever seen in a film.If you like a sweet romance that doesn't have to rely on sex and nudity to tell the story, well, this is it. This has to be my all time favorite movie. I own it on vhs as well as dvd. The spotlight on location is a wonderful feature on both versions. It gives a fun look at the making of aspects. It also shows you interview clips from the professional ball people who were involved in the making of the film. I urge anyone who just wants to relax, enjoy a good story and feel better for watching it, to get this movie ."
"len-21","9","34","45","16 August 2000"," 9 on a scale of 10
","I would have to say that I have seen very few movies better than For Love of the Game. My favorite genre is Romantic Comedy. This wasn't a comedy, but it was feel good. It was light drama and it was extremely well done.<br/><br/>Costner portrayed an aging baseball player with a romantic attachment to the game that reminded me of Robert Redford in The Natural - another movie I rated a 9. The symbolism of the movie was the notion of ending a romance for the game and transferring that romance to a woman. For him, at least, there was room for only one at a time. And, fortunately for her, his career was at the very end. Fortunately for us, we got to see his last game interspersed with flashbacks.<br/><br/>The movie was brilliantly done with respect to the actual game of baseball. I cannot recall having seen a sports movie that did such an excellent job of maintaining accuracy about the game. I honestly could have believed I was watching an actual game. The plays were realistic. The situations realistic. And, Vin Scully was sensational doing the play by play.<br/><br/>I've only rated a few movies as 10's in my life. One of them was Field of Dreams - another Costner vehicle. This movie wasn't far behind FOD. In fact, it was nearly as magical and it was a lot more romantic. Why the reviewers of IMDB only give it a 6.7 is beyond me."

",".......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>""They don't make 'em like they used to!"" As regards ""For Love of the Game"", the above comment applies to both movies and baseball players! Old- fashioned, straight-ahead storytelling, complimented by solid performances, extremely convincing on-the-field action, excellent photography and more than competent direction by Sam Raimi, make for a resoundingly entertaining movie...even if you're not much of a baseball fan! <br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing going for the film is its truly innovative integration and balance of rapid- fire on-going game vs. relationship development flashback elements, allowing the viewer to ""get inside the athlete's head"" in a way no other movie in recent memory does. ""For Love"" thusly manages to put a signature spin on the subjective experience of a great athlete's swan song by sharing and highlighting the stark contrast between the external precision and perfection of the real-world game in progress, and the turbulent, highly personal, inner-world of the passions that drive him. .......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>Kevin Costner, certainly NOT the greatest actor in the world, literally shines in the mother of all tailor made roles. Kelly Preston shows us a highly focused intensity, in just what may be her best on screen appearance to date! John C. Reilly, although cast as the solid-as-a-rock-always- there- when-you-need-him-on-the-sidelines Catcher, plays to the hilt a supporting role, in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>There are moments in ""For Love"", however, that seem a touch too maudlin, trying just a little too hard to jerk that extra tear. A few of these melancholy scenes are drawn out to the point of making the viewer self- conscious and put upon. These occasional excesses are easily overlooked, however, in light of the films many strengths and its overall highly engrossing nature. <br/><br/>8*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!"
"Angelab41","10","21","30","11 March 2001"," Few movies leave me breathless. Fewer still leave me speechless.
","This was one of those rare events where you find yourself clicking through channels and luck upon the beginning of a movie so engrossing that the world completely stops until the credits roll.  This is Costner's greatest performance, with a depth of emotion that we've never seen before.<br/><br/>This is much more than a baseball film.  It's a love story about love and baseball, and life and facing the future when you finally ""grow up.""  It's about the choices behind us and the chances ahead."
"Joe-114","10","20","31","11 September 1999"," Highly Enjoyable Movie...
","I saw a sneak preview of ""For Love of the Game,"" tonight, and I must say, I was thoroughly entertained by it.  And not merely entertained in the respect of some ""purely-made-to-entertain"" movies, but this movie inspired emotion, one thing I think really makes a movie. If a movie makes you feel a certain way, whether it's anger, or happiness, I think it shows something.  ""For Love of the Game,"" did that for me.  Costner's character, excellently portrayed in my opinion, loved baseball, and in turn, I loved his character. I loved the whole movie actually. It was funny at times, symbolic at others, and above all, it was  quite enjoyable.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 10.  Again, this is just my opinion, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
"rossearch","10","13","20","5 October 2006"," Believable look at a Pro Athlete
","This movie is one of the very best character studies of an athlete. The script, the direction, and Costner's performance yield an insightful profile of a driven character. Driven but not a jerk, and so the course of the relationship developed between the athlete and Kelly Preston's character is credible and engaging. The ways in which the other players are brought into the episodes that tell us about the main character resonate for amateur players and other baseball fans. All the performances ring familiar and true. Vin Scully is given the green light on cornball baseball homilies, but just to have Vinny's voice seasoning the movie gives authority and authenticity throughout."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","15","29","1 April 2006"," Baseball & Romance, Costner-Style
","Boy, is this a movie for New York Yankee haters. The lead character is a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and played by Kevin Costner, guy who can play the game at a high level, not just some actor faking it. And, of course, his big pitching effort is against the mighty Yankees.<br/><br/>My only complaint, besides the overuse of the Lord's name in vain, is that there weren't more baseball scenes in it, since they were so well done. The best character of the film was the catcher, played by John C. Reilly. There's a big romance angle in here between Costner and Kelly Preston. Some of that was good, some was annoying. Neither of those characters was particularly appealing.<br/><br/>What was very cool, if you have a good surround system, was the sound of Costner's fastball hitting the catcher's mitt. The loud ""whoosh"" sound was awesome."
"onyx-1","10","8","14","2 December 2003"," Stunning!Captures the true beauty of baseball
","I think this narrowly edges out Field of Dreams as the best baseball movie I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few). The concept here is totally brilliant. Costner's character  pitcher Billy Chapel is been having a bad day, he finds out  that his ex-girlfriend is leaving for England and then finds out that after playing for the Tigers for 20 years the owner is selling the team and he will probably be traded. On top of it all he is playing on a really bad team in the twilight of his career with arm trouble . He has to throw one more game which may be his last ever as he tries to decide whether to retire. The Yankees meanwhile trying to clinch the pennant and the Yankee Stadium crowd is appropriately obnoxious.<br/><br/>And then suddenly he retires the Yankees one after another and is working on a perfect game. This is such a great topic for a movie because a perfect game is so rare that it is one of the most dramatic and exciting things in all of sports but the excitement and tension builds gradually. In the 5th or 6th inning it's no big deal but as you get later in the game the excitement builds and a meaningless game can become more suddenly become more exciting than the 7th game of the world series. I think the star of this movie is really Vin Scully, he has long been my favorite baseball announcer and he really shines here. This is a baseball movie for real baseball fans, you can tell by a lot of little things that they tried to make it as authentic as possible and did a good job. The photography and slow motion are used very effectively and Costner as usual in his baseball movies does a brilliant job of portraying his character. If you like baseball at all see this movie! It will be a classic, 10/10!"
"Peach-2","9","9","17","9 April 2000"," Baseball....movies....cool.
","Although I didn't like For Love Of The Game the way I liked Bull Durham or Field Of Dreams, it's still a very entertaining film. Directed by Sam Raimi in a very subtle style, this is Costner's best film since Tin Cup. Raimi only shows flashes of his visual theatrics, Costner is very solid and I liked Kelly Preston very much. The way the story is told in the film is very fresh for a baseball movie and this is the high point for me. Baseball is just the background to a very touching love story. I hope this film more than anything else shows Hollywood that Sam Raimi is one of or greatest talents behind the camera."

I just wish now that everyone would go and see it, but it still seems that 'The Postman' and 'Waterworld' weigh heavily on Mr. Costner's shoulders."
"ThreeThumbsUp","3","7","14","26 April 2014"," Way too sappy
","This movie didn't take long to get sappy and cheesy. It begins with a montage of Billy Chappel's (Kevin Cosner) life leading up to his final pitching performance in New York against the Yankees. Before the game, he finds out that the Tigers' beloved owner is selling the team and his girlfriend is moving to London. ""There's a job there Billy. A good job. An editor's position."" It gets worse. Before taking the field, he takes a whiff of his old glove and there it is, his first flashback to his childhood; playing ball in the back yard. As he's warming up in the bullpen before the game, his manager wants to start a young catcher, but Billy insists that his buddy Gus start instead. ""If Gus doesn't play, I don't pitch."" OK then. As the game rolls along, he flashes back to his romance with Kelly Preston and everything is just dandy. He's got a perfect game until, wait, what? The young prospect he met before the game that used to be his bat-boy comes to the plate... Only redeeming factor is the actual baseball action. Looks real enough and it was filmed in Yankee Stadium."

A real feel good movie in a world that sometimes doesn't. I guess I must be a romantic at heart as I like it when the guy gets the girl and everything is alright in the end. Kostner has been entertaining me for years with movies like this,Postman, Water World, Dances With Wolves, Tin Cup and many others. His movies are maybe not always award winners but at least to me they are entertaining. After all isn't that why we sit down to watch them. This is also a movie that I can watch every month or two.

"ilovedolby","6","5","11","5 June 2005"," Fork-in-the-Road Story Gives Way To Sappy Love Story.
","""For Love of the Game"" is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career. It is a concept that could have worked if the film had not fallen to the melodrama of its love story. Where it manages to stay afloat is in its portrayal of its principal character, Billy Chapel, played by Kevin Costner. <br/><br/>In one of the opening scenes, Billy is confronted by the team's owner, Mr. Wheeler (Brian Cox.) Wheeler informs Billy that he has sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy. Since Billy is 40 years old and at the end of a poor season, Wheeler encourages him to retire. Not exactly what Billy wanted to hear on an exceptionally rough morninghis girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) never showed up for their dinner date the night before. Soon Jane calls and tells Billy that she is moving to London for a new job and that she can no longer be with him. She tells Billy that all he needs are the ball, the plate and the game to get by. <br/><br/>With that in mind, Billy heads out to the plate in Yankee Stadium to pitch the last game of the season. He throws well but the slightest reminder of the past triggers bittersweet memories, from meeting Jane, the flourishing of their relationship and their ups and downs. Then Billy remembers when he cut his hand in a sawing accident. Thanks to Jane, he manages to get to a hospital and save his hand. But as Billy recovers, he is faced with the notions that he might never throw again. Unwilling to accept this, he pushes Jane away. This is the point in the present that Billy starts to feel the pain in his arm and his throwing becomes a problem. <br/><br/>From the pain his arm, to his regret at loosing Jane, we see Billy struggle to top his career. But he swallows his emotions and pain and remembers the words of his father, ""simply play catch, Billy. Just throw the ball."" With that, Billy manages to pitch the perfect game. But naturally, one thing is missing, Jane and it all leads to inevitable airport confrontation ending. The problem with this movie is not in poor performances, but rather in the sappiness of its love story. Preston plays Jane as the kind of woman who can make the simplest things complicated, but with a genuine tenderness that cannot be denied. She is quirky but cares for Billy. But as the film goes into a montage of their early years, we see just about every relationship cliché play out. She asks him the foreseeable questions""Do you believe in God? Have you ever gotten your heart broken?"" And my favorite, ""Do you like the dark meat or the white meat, because the dark meat is the fatty part and it's not good for you."" Between the rolling of my eyes and my cringing at the embarrassment of these questions, I could not help but ask myself, shouldn't they have established all of this long before now? <br/><br/>The biggest problem is the ending. The two kiss, and Billy says to Jane that he loves her. Jane responds, ""I never believed it."" Billy replies, ""Believe it."" The two kiss some more and fades out. It leaves you with nothing to embrace and the picture becomes instantly forgettable. You simply want to walk away saying, ""Well, there it is.""<br/><br/>What I do like about the movie is that the central character is faced with a life changing decisionending his career, his life's passion. Baseball is what he loves and he cannot let it go. Ironically enough, director Raimi would bring this same concept up in his excellent film, ""Spider-Man 2,"" five years after ""For Love of the Game."" As Peter Parker/Spider-Man says, ""Sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most to do what is righteven our dreams."" That is a tough decision for any person to make when they are part of something they love and for one reason or another, it has to end. In film, if done correctly, this can make for a powerful storytelling riddled with conflict and ultimate resolution. Unfortunately, that is not done here.<br/><br/>""For Love of the Game"" is neither entirely bad, nor entirely good. The concept of facing the fork-in-the-road choices work well, and adding a love story was to be expected. However, the film becomes half chick-flick and half a story about moving on. If it could only find a better balance with improved writing, it could have worked out. **1/2 out of ****"
"jfarrell","5","5","11","19 September 1999"," Costner recaptures ""Bull Durham"" wit, but no love found here.
","Costner once again gives us humorous insights to the thoughts and comments of professional baseball players.  He also has found another sidekick in his catcher who gives a comparable performance to Tim Robbins in ""Bull Durham"".<br/><br/>That being said, Billy Chapel's possible final outing on the mound is the only thing that keeps this film moving at all.  The relationship between Billy and Jane is shallow.  Chapel is allowed time and time again to use this woman for his selfish purposes.  Even if the relationship were to be resolved, we would still would be left with no commitment and thus no true love. I had to wonder why Chapel kept having warm flashbacks of his mother and father watching him pitch through the years.  If he admired his father as much as his memories suggest, why didn't he follow his father's footsteps and commit to Jane?  After all, Chapel said his father loved two things: his mother and baseball.  Billy Chapel only loved one thing, himself.  I tend to think though that the director of this film would want us to believe otherwise.  No hero found here."

","I've watched this movie 2,000 times since it came out 13 years ago and let me tell you, it gets better with age. There are many holes to poke here of course (several sappy scenes that are, quite frankly, severely over dramatic) but there's plenty to love (including the iconic Vin Scully). The best stuff here is the wonderfully authentic NYC moments... Jane's car broken down on the FDR, their discussion on the risers at a north meadow field in Central Park (any New Yorker will recognize that), the shots of old Yankee Stadium (replete with the subway train rushing by the right field bleachers, ruining Billy's concentration), Bob Sheppard announcing the starting lineups (Gus Sinski, number 27, number 27), JFK and the inevitable delays, Vin Scully on the call... all of it priceless if you know what to look for.<br/><br/>You couple that with a terrific score that peaks at exactly the right moment and you have a truly enjoyable film, one that hits the right notes at the right time."
"vranger","7","2","3","19 June 2009"," Interesting framework
","It took a while for me in watching this movie to realize the all the baseball scenes were actually from the same game, and not parts of many games. I had not read or heard of the movie before, and I wasn't actually paying close attention at the beginning.<br/><br/>Once I realized that the entire movie was flashbacks Kevin Costner's character was having during the course of one game that suddenly becomes a real candidate to end up as a ""perfect game"", I got more interested. Not that the baseball result drew me in, the entire idea for the movie happening in flashbacks during a game intrigued me.<br/><br/>The movie is indeed sappy, and contains every cliché, but it works anyway. Romantic dramas are going to have a lot of clichés, there's no way to avoid it. Sports movies are going to have a lot of clichés. So when you put the two together, its a cliché-fest! LOL Still, the performances are engaging and mostly come off as real. The drama at the end of the game has a body of its own. The catcher's promise near the end is something that SHOULD happen in sports, and probably doesn't very often.<br/><br/>Only the last couple of scenes, which happen AFTER the game, break out of the framework of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>So if you don't like romances or sappy sports movies, stay away from this, you won't like it. Otherwise, its a nice film with some good lessons and a satisfying set of conclusions."
"mainefred","3","7","18","16 June 2014"," Too much psychobabble
","The producers were obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of Bull Durham, but this was a bad misfire. 5 percent baseball. 95 percent psychobabble, with Costner and Preston endlessly discussing their relationship, the rules of the game, etc, etc. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan without the humor. And what the Tiger's ace pitcher could see in this messed- up gal is a mystery. At 40 years old, he should have known better. Susan Sarandon was a much more convincing match for him.<br/><br/>If you like juvenile dialog about love affairs, you may find this interesting. But if you're looking for a baseball movie like Bull Durham or Field of Dreams, forget this one. It's a love story, and not a very good one."
"philip_vanderveken","7","3","7","21 March 2005"," Even when you don't know anything about baseball, this movie is worth a watch
","I know that baseball is one of the most popular sports in the USA, but it certainly isn't in Europe. Most of us have never seen a game on the TV or in a stadium and I'm sure that most of us don't know anything about it. This is of course a great problem for a movie that has a baseball player and the events in his life as its main storyline. Many Americans will love this movie anyway, but it is a lot harder to get it sold to the Europeans if the story and the acting aren't excellent.<br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is that it isn't just based on the sport itself, but that it also has a romance to offer for those who don't know anything about baseball. Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is at the end of his career and he has to decide whether he will keep playing, but for another team, and risking to loose the woman he loves or stop his career and save his love life.

In the meantime he recollects all the memories of how he once met her, their first date, the happy times, the miscommunication and all other things that once happened between them. <br/><br/>The movie on itself is OK, without really excelling and the same could be said about the performances of the different actors. They didn't do something wrong, but I've seen some better acting before. All in all this is a decent movie with a decent story and good acting, but without a very good character study. Nevertheless this is still a movie that is worth a watch and that's why I give it a 7/10."

","I was happy to see that they picked the Tigers to feature in the movie as the pitcher's team. Billy says....""I've always been a tiger"". It's neat to see a player portrayed as being so loyal to his team. Not to say that Cub fans are not great or any other team, but Tigers fans are special. It doesn't matter how the Tigers are doing, they still come out to cheer on their team. Detroit may be down and out because of the misfortunes of the auto industry but when it comes to her sports teams, the support is always there. Detroit fans are more like small town fans than urban. You can be in line waiting to enter Tiger stadium and strike up a conversation with a complete stranger and feel a familiarity that is normally reserved for those watching the local Jaycee baseball team at a local park."

","This movie is solid. It's a tribute to baseball lovers with romantic hearts. Both Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston do a fine job and have chemistry. The story is woven around a baseball game and the backstory of a romance that wasn't perfect but had its moments. Like all compelling sports movies you cheer for protagonist. Tastefully and sweetly directed. Costner always likable, Preston equally so.

","For the Love of the Game Sam Raimi throws a curveball and goes for the sports movie/romantic comedy mash-up starring Kevin Costner. The topical aside is matched by something not often seen in the average Raimi movie: subtlety and care. Luckily he pitches it good and it keeps your attention through a decently long playlength and a lot of character. Costner is never all that great and this certainly isn't one of his best roles, but there are moments when he delivers quite well--usually while he's on the sand talking to himself; the love relationship is a very well written one but it sort of suffers from Costner's lack of affect. No biggie there as it's more than made up for a tense building of parallel dramatic arcs that come to their inevitable happy conclusion in a not-unpredictable, but still satisfying way.<br/><br/>You can tell that Raimi enjoyed taking a break from thrillers and splatstick to clear the mechanism and play catch for a little while. Kevin Costner must have enjoyed having his parents play his parents, and for what it's worth everybody else seems to enjoy themselves too.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","""For Love Of The Game"" is an endearing look at a baseball player who might be pitching his last game after 19 years with the same team.<br/><br/>
After successful films such as ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field Of Dreams"" baseball seems to follow Kevin Costner as he returns to the diamond once again in ""For Love Of The Game."" <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film immensely not only because Costner is one my favorite actors, but because he brings his fiery attitude to his character Billy Chapel. Costner is known for this as he brings it to every film he has been in.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi brings a fresh attitude and look to the silver screen as the director of this movie. Raimi did a brilliant job unveiling the sequences as he did as the plot surrounded one game with flashbacks to Billy's on again, off again romance with Jane, played by the beautiful Kelly Preston.<br/><br/>In addition, John C. Reilly who played Gus Sinski was a pleasant addition and surprise as he brought an excellent balance of calm and support to Billy. <br/><br/>The best thing about ""For Love of The Game"" were the ensemble performances given by Costner, Reilly and Preston. These performances personified the very best of a heartwarming and endearing film with so many layers of depth to the characters and storyline.<br/><br/>The only complaint I may have about this film would be the length; I think some scenes could have been edited out or cut down a little because the film shouldn't have lasted as long as it did. <br/><br/>It was an excellent film for what it was, a sweet, lighted hearted romantic drama."

","I was excited about this movie when it first came out, and I loved it. This movie reminds me of Field of Dreams, with respect towards Kevin Costner co-starring in a serious baseball film.  Unlike Field of Dreams, this movie was not a sappy, tearjerker.  I am into sports, and I love baseball.  This movie is appropriately named, and the plot involves Kevin Costner as a lifelong Detroit Tiger pitcher who is basically seen as being washed up. It does not help that he is also having relationship problems with his girlfriend (Kelly Preston).<br/><br/>This movie to me is very realistic (a lot more so than Field of Dreams and having a baseball field in your yard).  My only regret is buying this movie on video and not on DVD."
"displacedbeatnik","8","0","0","5 July 2003"," You Had Me At Baseball...
","Perhaps I'm biased being originally from Detroit and hating the Yankees. And, adding that ""Field of Dreams"" is my favorite movie of all time to the mix and you have a recipe for a very positive, biased review of ""For the Love of the Game.""<br/><br/>While I do see its flaws, ""For the Love of the Game,"" stands out in my mind as one of the greatest baseball movies ever made.  The love story is extremely distracting and obviously meant to appeal to the ""Jerry Maguire"" crowd but even in this, there are moments of intense emotion when the Kevin Costner character is injured and has to choose between concentrating on rehabilitation or the woman he loves.<br/><br/>But, taking out a contrite love story with a predictable ending, the scenes in this movie involving the actual games of baseball are some of the best ever filmed.  There's realism to the game rarely seen (although any baseball fan will be slightly aggravated by the constant three-pitch strikeout so often seen in Hollywood).  I turned off this movie thinking that it had the best technical advisor I had ever seen.<br/><br/>The story is that of an aging baseball player and the decisions he has to go through during the course of trying to pitch in his penultimate game. And, this is where the greatness of the movie lies.<br/><br/>This is a classic person v. self conflict that so few movies rely on since the advent of special effects (in which the idea of Hollywood drama is a perfectly choreographed person v. person gunfight or argument).  The only time a person v. person conflict is brought in is in back story.<br/><br/>You're able to get inside the mind of the protagonist through his trying to accomplish the rarest feat in baseball - the perfect game.  And, baseball situations rarely seen in any baseball movie are there to reflect on.  The relationship between a pitcher and his catcher, a manager having to make the tough decisions, a player genuinely disliking another player, and even what a pitcher thinks about between innings to keep from stressing out about the game.<br/><br/>But, I rate this movie and eight out of ten mostly for one scene that I could watch over and over again.<br/><br/>At one point, Costner's character is pitching against a former teammate he obviously had admiration for.  He says, whispering, ""you look so old, what happened to us, are we really that old?""  The other player flashes him a smile of friendship and he says, almost choked up, ""don't smile, I hate it when you smile at me.""<br/><br/>As a baseball fan and watching a character that cares so much about the game that who's in the opposing uniform actually choked me up.  It's possibly the most touching moment in any baseball film outside of ""Field of Dreams."" And, any movie that can choke you up with a moment that pure deserves a 9 or 10 in my book.  But, this greatness is left on the diamond and it's why this movie only gets an 8.<br/><br/>It's one of the most touching scenes that I have ever seen in any movie, let alone one about baseball.<br/><br/>Is this movie ""Field of Dreams,"" no.  What can be?  Once you've perfected the baseball movie, what can compare?  But, this is a much better movie than the much more predictable ""The Natural"" with its incredibly inaccurate portrayal of baseball (come on, there's hot streaks and all, but this guy would have been on pace to hit 150 home runs and bat .500 (1.000 when he's hot and .000 when he's cold) based on what they show in the movie).<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER<br/><br/>Of course you know he's going to pitch the perfect game in the end, but that's not the point.  The journey that Costner's character has in his mind is the point of this movie.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Someday Hollywood will come up with an ultra realistic professional baseball movie that will satisfy all the fans.  Until then, having to suspend a little disbelief is a lot better than most of the baseball dreck thrown at the viewer.<br/><br/>10 for the baseball scenes, 6 for the non-baseball scenes.  Average = 8 out of 10."

","""For Love of the Game"" is a touching story about a great pitcher's love for the game of baseball and his strive for perfection in the defining moment of his career.  Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher facing the ending of his brilliant career.  Before the last game against the Yankees, the owner of the team tells Billy that he has sold the Tigers and that the new owner wants to trade him to San Deigo.  After speaking with the owner, Billy is told by his long time girlfriend Jane Audree (Kelly Preston) that she is moving to Europe to take a job.  Before the game, the owner sends his nephew down to get Billy's answer about whether he wants to be traded or if he will retire.  Jane takes off for the airport, but when she gets there, she finds that her flight has been delayed and is forced to watch the Yankees game where she sees Billy trying to pitch the perfect game.  She becomes in grossed in the game and decides not to leave.  In the eighth inning Billy writes a message on a ball and sends it to the owner with his nephew. Billy completes the perfect game,  ending his career on a high point.  This movie is well made and follows a story that is interesting to all who watch it .  It is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed with a significant other  and the women will enjoy the romance aspect and the men will love the baseball story.  This movie is very accurate in depicting the game and the ups and downs that are experienced, but in really most careers don't end like that on a high note.  I think this is a great date movie that will thrill the women and entertain the men."
"SamRag","7","0","0","15 August 2002"," For the love of the woman!
","Looking over some past accomplishments by Kevin Costner (Message in a bottle, The Postman, Tin Cup, not to mention Waterworld), I rented this film with some reserve.  I've felt that his pictures are so often about this dark-grey hero, which everyone ends up admiring at the end while he has sacrificed everything for the good of many.  For the love of the Game is similar, as we follow a baseball player at a cross road in his life, and what might be his last game.  However, I did enjoy this film as the story was so much more a love story of an ordinary, often lonely man, rather than focusing purely on the heroic part of the story.  The game sequences were very well done, and for someone like me that doesn't know anything about baseball, nor have I enjoyed watching it in the past, I was swept along, fully capturing the exciting atmosphere of the game.  Having said that, the story line is still pretty thin, and the result could have been disastrous if it wouldn't have been for the good chemistry between the lead actors. The character of Jane Aubrey, played by Kelly Preston, was a bit under-developed from my point of view, and some of her decisions seem to contradict what she stood for, being on one site this independent woman, while at other times being what she herself insisted she didn't want to be, a Grubbier.  The filming and twinning together of the game we watch and the flashbacks into his life are well done and smooth.  You don't have to love baseball to like this film, and if you rent it only because of the baseball connection I'm sure you will be disappointed.  This is a nice little love story where Kevin has toned down his usual larger-then-life character. 7/10"

","I hate it when movies insult the audience's intelligence.  This is what happened in this movie.  I was really enjoying this movie until they went to spring training.  Lakeland, Florida, is the spring training home of the Detroit Tigers and in this movie, it's your typical pristine Florida coastal town.  Except, in real-life, Lakeland is smack-dab in the middle of Florida, about as far away from a sandy beach as you can get in the Sunshine State. I know.  I grew up not thirty miles from Lakeland.  My high school used to play their high school every year in all sports.  Lakeland had the closest Best Buy to my hometown so I always would make the drive to pick up the latest CD or DVD I just had to have.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I think it's great that Polk County finally made it to the silver screen, but come one people, let's get it right.  This totally runied the movie for me. I'm a history major.  I want things done right.  This movie was mediocre at best.  What could have been a great movie was turned bad by a large helping of melancholy mixed with sentimentality.  Just once, I'd like to see the protaganist get to the airport and find the lover had indeed flown the coop. This movie could have been a Sosa-homerun over the bleachers and through a window on Waveland.  Instead, it was just a lazy Raphael Furcal pop-up to the second-baseman."

","Kevin Costner takes a lot of heat for both his acting ability and his choice of movies.  However, no one can slight him in any of his three tributes to the Great American Pastime.  In Bull Durham, he showed us how fun the game can be, both on the field and off.  Field of Dreams was a tribute to the nature of the game itself and how it affected America, the American Dream, and our lives.  Now, in For Love of the Game, the film adaptation from Michael Shaara's second best novel, he again tips his hat to this great game and the way that it inhabits every aspect of our lives and loves. Excellent filmmaking compliments an impressive adaptation of the novel, which chronicles the relationship of a celebrated Detroit Tigers pitcher and the woman he loves almost as much as the game.  The final game of the season acts as the backdrop for the flashbacks of the relationship, and the two storylines are brought together well in the end. Kelly Preston delivers a good supporting role, and anyone who questions Kevin Costner's acting skills should study this film closely.  Once you see Billy Chapel's face when he remembers the mistakes he made and the hurt that he caused Jane, you will never again disparage the man."

The passion to give all you can, even when you are struggling.  Not to give in no matter what adversities lie in your way, whether it's physical or mental.<br/><br/>This same passion, to fight for what you believe in, was also shown by the filmmakers.  As is evidenced by the care and attention to detail that went into making this film.

Anyone who has played the game, or has witnessed, repeatedly, the same plays in a MLB game, can relate to it or relive it, and all the senses that went with it.  Still, it was not a satisfying movie. <br/><br/>
A moviegoer  might get weary of Vin Scully's nasal commentary as the voice of the Yankees, droning on for what seems like 27 innings, repeating his own brand of cliches, onward and onward, for 2 1/2 hours, while Kevin Costner pitches to only 27 batters, three up, three down, in nine innings. If there's one thing that Kevin Costner does well, it's to play The Star.  And baseball players.  But we already know that.  <br/><br/>A viewer could grow weary of the switches from movie camera to the Fox network TV closeups of parts of a player's face, of the cliches in the love story, too, and the non-stop ""product placements"" which buffer the movie's profit margins so blatantly that you find yourself wondering in the sixth inning,  ""Did I just pay $5.00 to watch 2 1/2 hours of QVC?"

","Kevin Costner is fantastic as the aging, but still charming Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel. I believe he is acting even better when he plays guys that feel somehow ""hurt"", like Billy Chappel, Crash Davis(Bull Durham) or Garret Blake(Message in a bottle). He is not like some actor playing a ""hurt"" guy, but he can feel the pain as if it is real. One can see the pain, or happiness, or love in Costner's eyes. And, this is real acting!

","My advice to Kevin Costner:  stick with the baseball movies.  While ""For The Love of The Game"" was not as wonderful as I'd hoped, it's not terrible either.  It's good to see Costner get back to his ""baseball roots"" after lack-luster films like ""The Postman"" and ""Message in a Bottle"".<br/><br/>First of all, if you go to theater in anticipation of seeing a baseball movie, you'll probably be very upset.  This film, much like the other members of the Costner Baseball Trilogy, is not about baseball.  Baseball is only used as the underlying metaphor for everything else that goes on in the film:  love, friendship, growing old, life.  And Costner and company do a good job with these aspects of the movie.  I felt more moved, for example, by the relationship between Costner and Kelly Preston's screen daughter Heather, than I did when Costner finally reaches the highlight of his career, which is supposed to be the pinnacle of the film, but doesn't reproduce the emotions felt when witnessing the real thing.<br/><br/>
All in all, the film is a good date movie and brings me back to the classic Bull Durham, where a reviews says ""The desire is for the game, not the money"" - a concept that is very similar to the image this movies tries to portray.  It's not for money, it's not for women, it's not for fame - it's just for love of the game."

The Natural, Bull Durham, and Field of Dreams are all great baseball movies, and this one tries. Told in flashback, an aging pitcher views his life while pitching what starts as a possible final game, and becomes a possible perfect game.  While it conveys Ramis' obvious love of the game, there's no final punch which would give this movie the powerful ending needed to compete with the movies listed above. Kevin Costner is a great actor, though he has had some terrible flops.   His character in For the Love of the Game is immediately likable, but difficult to empathize with.

","I'm not a sports fan, but I was pleased at how director Sam Raimi made the sport interesting for those who don't normally watch it.  I wish more care had been taken on making the romance part of the story stronger.  Chemistry between Costner and Preston was not spectacular enough to make their characters' romance stand out enough.  The romance should have been as breathless as the baseball game.  Preston (Jane) is an appealing actress, however, and the camera seems to love her face.  Costner (Billy Chappel) did a great job of portraying the weariness and confusion of a man in mid-life. It also helps that he looks like a real-life ballplayer.  Raimi has some great sequences that show Chappel blocking out everything to concentrate on the game. The Chappel character is the only one that's really fleshed out. The audience doesn't learn much about his friend Gus (good job by John C. Reilly), Jane (even after some secrets about her are revealed) or the rest of the ballplayers, other than what Chappel thinks about them.  Jena Malone is effective in her small role.  There is another actor who is shown commenting on the game while watching it on tv in an airport bar.  The guy is so annoying that if I was sitting next to him, I would have slapped him. While not the greatest of Costner's baseball films, this is an welcome antidote for adults sick of the entertainment that geared towards teenagers."

I've got no problem with mainstream directors, they make some great movies, and ""For Love of the Game"" was a very good movie. I guess I was just expecting a little more from Mr. Raimi as a follow-up to ""A Simple Plan"", then a somewhat predictable Hollywood romance/baseball movie.

","It is not very often that a movie can have the tension and feel of game seven of the world series.  For Love of the Game provides that tension. Caught in the crossroads of a brilliant career, Billy Chapel takes us on a 5 year journey through the course of a ball game.  Not only a ball game, but perfection.  A feat rarely achieved on any level.  Luckily, GAME takes us on this journey with Billy.  We feel his anguish as he gains, loses, gains, loses, gains, etc Jane.  We also feel his anguish as he almost loses his career from a freak accident.<br/><br/>
At the end, I found myself rooting for Billy to obtain perfection as I would at a real baseball game.  Aside from his off the field struggles with Jane, we see his on the field struggles.  Billy is not only battling the Yankees, but also the changing face of baseball.  This epic battle of respect for the game and the brash, arrogance of youth is culminated in one last batter: the son of a former teammate of Billy's so long ago.  Chapel has to exorcise the demons of the Yankees as well as the demons inside which make him contemplate retirement for love of the game.<br/><br/>For Love of the Game is one of the best baseball movies of all time. Whereas it does not even touch Bull Durham, or The Natural, it reaches new height with its style.  An incredible movie that kept me riveted for the whole time.  Are you sure it was 2 hours long?

","I liked all the other Costner sports flicks a lot (It is his forte), but For the Love of the Game is tops! Bull Durham was a whole lot of baseball with a dose of romantic comedy. Field of Dreams was 100% baseball fantasy-drama. The current effort is a perfect mix of baseball and romance. It is really two movies woven skillfully into one which accounts for its relatively long runtime(137)for a film of this genre.<br/><br/>This is easily Costner's best effort in a long time and Kelly Preston is perfect opposite him. It's funny but every time I see Bull Durham again, the fact that Sarandon is now ""with"" Tim Robbins destroys the Sarandon-Costner chemistry for me. Fortunately Travolta is nowhere to be seen, so the Preston-Costner mix plays very well, especially since it is heavy on romance and very light on sex.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies I walk out of wondering what it was that caused it to be PG-13.  No drugs, not a hint of violence, and no nudity.  In retrospect, I suppose there was a gratuitous swear word or two at most and what romance doesn't have a suggestion of sex.  For my money this is more G rated than what you see on network sit-coms these days, especially Fox. Take the family and enjoy!!!"

Portraying fictional life-long Detroit Tiger pitcher, Billy Chapel, a not larger than life character, but just a normal man, despite his media-intensive career, is a great breath of fresh air.  There are great performances abounding in his film, including the two main supporting players, John C. Reilly, as Costner's pitcher's stalwart catcher, and Kelly Preston, as the conflict and caring love interest.<br/><br/>The film moves a terrific pace, interweaving the five-year relationship of Costner's Chapel and Preston's Jane Aubrey with Chapel's possibly final and oh-so-perfect game in Yankee Stadium.  It works on numerous levels, and left me with a lot of on-screen memories.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is a downside.  I fear too few people with see For Love of the Game, and most that did see it will soon forget it.  Will it revive Costner's sagging career?  Probably not.  It is a great movie, though?

The baseball (ME!) and relationship (My Girlfriend,Darlene!) elements balanced each other fairly well, and we both ended up with tears at some point.

","Although many of the Hollywood films have a very ""American"" feel to it, ""For Love of the Game"" practically defines the United States. This movie shows almost every aspect of the American culture and their obsession with sports but beneath this baseball exterior is a movie about how an individual deals with change.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Billy Chapal (Kevin Costner). Billy is the star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and has spent his entire career with the team. We meet Billy late in his long but distinguished career and it seems that time has finally caught up with him. His body is starting to show signs of age and in the final game of the year against the New York Yankies, circumstances dictate that he must decide whether he wants to continue to play (possibly on another team) or retire. Throughout this final game, the movie flashes back to snippets of his life revolving around his career, friends and a woman named Jane (Kelly Preston). Jane is a woman that Billy meets 5 years prior to this time and these flash backs show the relationship between the two of them and the role that baseball plays in Billy's life.<br/><br/>This is possibly one of Kevin Costner's best performances. Although he has done many different roles, baseball seems to be one that he's most comfortable in. This is his third baseball movie and I have to say that I found this one to be his best. In many of Costner's movies, I have always found that he sometimes has a very unemotional or ""stoney"" performance but this is not the case with this movie. In many instances, I found his display of emotions very true and on occasions you get a lump in your throat. Kelly Preston is exceptional in this movie as Chapal's girlfriend and we definitely see chemistry between the two actors. This movie is not only about Chapal's life. There is enough development by the director to give insight into Preston's character and her life that you feel what she feels. The peripheral actors also give very good performances, especially John Reilly who plays the Tigers' catcher and Chapal's best friend.<br/><br/>The one drawback to this movie is that it does feel long. It's approximately 2.5 hours but it feels more like 3 hours. There were also instances that I think some scenes were cutout. The trailers and commercials show some scenes that weren't in the movie that I thought would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie, even if you're not a baseball fan, which being from Canada, I'm not but nonetheless I liked it. There is much more going on than baseball and the director uses some beautiful images as symbolism. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone....9/10."

","I consider this is a love story.  Love for other persons as well<br/><br/>as for a thing, the game of baseball.

Since I am not a baseball fan, I<br/><br/>cannot speak to the authenticity of the game shots, though my<br/><br/>experience suggests that they might be inauthentic.  To be<br/><br/>truthful, I find watching baseball boring; the baseball scenes<br/><br/>in the film were not boring to me, so likely they are not<br/><br/>authentic.

I appreciated Billy Chapel as a character -- all male, all<br/><br/>masculine.  Surely Kevin Costner could have played him softer,<br/><br/>but he didn't and I'm glad.  It is an act of courage (and surely<br/><br/>""love"" as the title suggests) that Billy Chapel pitches in spite<br/><br/>of the pain in his arm.  This character is the epitome of<br/><br/>male-masculinity -- tough, courageous, self-centered, and<br/><br/>needing lots of extra time to acknowledge his own and others'<br/><br/>feelings.  He is mystified by the femininity in both Jane Aubrey<br/><br/>(Kelly Preston) and her daughter, Heather (Jena Malone) as well<br/><br/>as pushing away the caring of his friend Gus (John C. Reilly).<br/><br/>Considering the overall quality of the film (which I considered<br/><br/>high), I was surprised at several technical problems:  music<br/><br/>with words so loud they competed with dialogue, confusion on<br/><br/>time/flashbacks, and lack of clarity about passage of time (ie,<br/><br/>is this a minute later or two days later?).<br/><br/>I left feeling satisfied as a movie viewer.

The supporting cast of Jena Malone Kelly Preston and John C. Reilly are totally believable in their respect roles which saves the movie from being dropped into a below average status, in my opinion. Vince Scully, the voice currently of the L.A. Dodgers, adds drama throughout the movie as the play by play announcer. Cinematography and editing are outstanding and give us the feeling of actually being on the field at Yankee Stadium.  If you like a serious love story you will really enjoy this effort. If you love baseball, that would be an added bonus."

","FOR LOVE OF THE GAME Summary: Billy Chapel is an almost 19 year veteran starting pitcher for the downtrodden Detroit Tigers franchise. He is scheduled to pitch the final game of the regular season against the New York Yankees. Chapel begins pitching the best game of his career, and in-between innings he thinks about his rocky romance with women's magazine writer Jane Aubrey, his friendships and memorable moments with players on the team, and growing up playing baseball. He contemplates the biggest decision of his life: will he give up baseball and go after Jane, who could be his true love, or should he stay with the sport of baseball, his true love for most of his life?<br/><br/>
Cons: -Poor script: the romance unfolding can be predictable many times, Jane Aubrey character not written well, and some of the lines are just plain bad -Poor execution of the big ""emotional"" moments of the film--Costner and Preston seem more awkward than tear-jerking -Poor baseball atmosphere: Yankees stadium is supposed have the loudest, rowdiest crowd in baseball...but the crowd's chants and cheers and jeers lacked volume and sounded pretty weak -Glaring errors: the baseball announcers say the Tigers have two hits while the game scoreboard says they have none, people say Chapel pitched in the 1987 World Series while a flashback shows a banner saying he was in the 1984 World Series...um, what happened during post-production?  Didn't someone catch these??? <br/><br/>Pros: -Costner's acting during the baseball scenes are great, and the rest of the cast plays their roles well; Kelly Preston did what she could with her Jane Aubrey character -Movie recreates TV coverage of the baseball game perfectly, with good play-by-play announcing and fine presentation -Besides the glaring baseball errors and the poor crowd noise, all of the baseball scenes are very well done and seem almost real at times -Cinematography can be very good and very interesting, although a little uneven and overdramatic at times<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Poor script ridiculed by overused twists and cliches for the big romantic and emotional portions make the film seem bland and it hurts the movie a lot. The poor crowd noise and glaring baseball errors are just mind-boggling and unforgiving to me...thankfully Costner's passionate performance as a player, as well as the fine execution and presentation of the baseball scenes save the movie from sinking like the worthless rock it could've been. It's worth a rental, but nothing more. In fact, if you want a good baseball drama, please go rent FIELD OF DREAMS instead!!!<br/><br/>

"Ken-209","Null","0","0","17 September 1999"," For Love of the Game drew applause from both a group of young teens and and elderly couples when I saw it. Everyone left the theater satisfied.
","The film is about baseball and about growing up and finding out that your talent is not enough to make you human. Costner is believable as a protagonist who takes us on a light journey through both of these topics because his character can be trusted. The flashback technique of the film is obvious but works anyway.  There are some unbelievable sequences in the film but this isn't a film about realism, it's about the possibility of magic happening one more time for someone who once had it at his disposal. Costner's acting in the film is good. We pause with him nd reflect when he reflects. The musical score is outstanding. It is good fare and well worth seeing. Not only would I see it again but I'll buy it on video."
"Watcher-37","10","0","0","11 September 1999"," A magnificent film
","Just got back from the sneak preview of this movie, and I loved it! Kevin Costner is Billy Chapel, pitcher for the Detroit Tigers. He finds out that he is moved up in the pitching rotation to pitch in the last game of the season, and then also learns that the team has been sold, he is going to be traded, and his girl friend is breaking up with him. All in all not a good day. As he takes the mound to pitch, he begins flashing back to one day five years previous when he meets Jane Aubrey, played by Kelly Preston. So begins his relationship with her. It's a tentative thing at first but it grows over the period of flashbacks as Billy continues to throw a masterpiece of a game. He meets Jane's daughter Heather played by the very good Jena Malone.(The only problem I really had with this movie is that she wasn't given a whole lot to do, and she has the ability.) Billy isn't put off by Heather as Jane expects he might, and the three begin to grow close as they spend more time together. John C. Reilly(from Boogie Nights) continues his winning streak of great character parts as Gus, the Tiger's catcher. The manager of the team played by JK Simmons wants another catcher to be behind the plate at the beginning of the movie, but Chapel refuses to throw to anyone but Gus. His career is ending and he has a decision to make about when exactly it will end, the way he lets the owner know is very appropriate. Meanwhile, the perfect game is going on and Jane is watching from the airport where she purposely misses the flight to London where she is to begin a new job(she's a writer) to see the end of the game, and Heather is in her dorm at USC also watching the game. I got the feeling that while she may have been just friends with Chapel, she would have liked it just as much as if he had been her father. The ending of the movie was satisfying and Costner is now 3-3 in his baseball movies. It isn't often that they do sequels to sports movies, but this is a movie I'd like to know what happens to the characters involved after the credits roll."

","I saw this movie at a sneak preview over the weekend and I loved it. I can't believe that the critics have anything bad to say about it. It is so obvious to me after watching this movie that anyone who is speaking badly of it is doing so only because they have been looking forward to the opportunity to bad-mouth Kevin Costner. In reality, Costner gives a terrific performance in this movie, I am not a big fan of his but, after seeing this movie...I have to admit that I have kind of become one! So much so that I felt compelled to write here. This movie is really good, it's a very traditional, straightforward story and the direction is absolutely beautiful. It seems to me that Sam Raimi knew exactly what this film needed in order to be a great movie and he did what needed to be done and more. I have not been able to get this film out of mind since I left the theater and I think that in and of itself is a huge statement because, after all isn't it the job of any movie to make an impact on its viewer? This one makes a huge impact in the best possible way and I think it is well worth seeing."

","I loved this movie!  I've come to really like KC;  he's so laidback and open in his interviews.  He really strikes me as ""the guy next door"".  IMHO, it's hard not to like someone like that.  My view of KP was kind of biased after watching Jerry Maguire so every move she made looked sexy and seductive to me!!!  I like the openness KC portrays as Billy Chapel in the movie...I'll never forget his emotions in the hotel room after ""the last game of the movie"" [no spoilers here!!]  The only thing that left me a little puzzled was how well Jane Aubrey (KP) dealt with Billy and the masseuse (sp?).  I don't know how realistic that was.  <br/><br/>Anyways, this movie is a GREAT date movie and I give it a 7/10.  I think this movie hits home with KC more than others and you can tell by the acting.

"Mephisto-7","9","0","0","17 September 1999"," Yet another great work by some very underappreciated talents
","I have to start off by saying that this movie is far better than what a lot of people may tell you.  So many may go into this film with a few preconcieved notions, namely about Costner's acting ability and whether or not the director of ""Army of Darkness"" can handle a dramatic film.  Rest assured this movie puts such questions to rest.  ""For The Love Of The Game"" may very well be the most finely crafted and executed film about baseball since ""The Natural.""  I think that to even call this a ""baseball movie"" is to seriously undermine all that this film encompasses. <br/><br/>     ""For The Love Of The Game"" exceeds on so many levels that it is difficult to describe the admiration it deserves.  This is so much more than a movie about baseball.  It's about relationships, making difficult life decisions, and looking back on those decisions wondering if they were the right ones.  It's about so many aspects of our lives: finding love and losing it, making mistakes, and making amends.  It's about needing someone, knowing you don't go through life alone.  Of course, it is also about the great game of baseball, the players, the teams, and the fans.  All of these elements come fluidly together thanks to Sam Raimi's brilliant direction. Raimi deftly utilizes multiple elements such as focus, sound, and framing to thouroughly enhance the story.  It has always been obvious in Raimi's work that he knows that style must serve the story, NOT the other way around as so many up and coming directors seem to think.  He uses his bagful of clever tricks both technical and stylistic to wrench emotion out of every scene and craft an unforgettable movie-going experience.  If anyone had any doubts about his ability to spin a complex dramatic tale even AFTER the brilliant ""A Simple Plan"", those doubts will noiselessly fade away roughly three minutes into this film, never to return.      The other major reservation many people seem to have is the erroneous belief that Kevin Costner isn't much of an actor.  This is another falsehood burned to cinders by this film.  Costner creates in Billy Chapel a character who is equally charasmatic and enigmatic.  Enigmatic in such a way that spurns us to discover his identity throughout the film.  What makes him do what he does or say some of the things he says?  What decision will he ultimately make?  He is a man loathed by some but revered by many.  But for all the fans and fame, we see that he is still human.  Raimi reminds us of this bipolar aspect of his persona throughout the film, by the presence of autograph hounds and the attention he recieves contrasted by his emotional needs.  Costner reminds us as well, playing up Chapel as a volatile celebrity, but in essence a compassionate husband and father figure.  He is Superman and Everyman.  He experiences what we experience, and feels what we feel, only he is forced to do it in front of thousands of screaming fans. <br/><br/>     The film also contains a well-executed soundtrack and heart-wrenching/leaping score by acclaimed composer Basil Poledouris.  The use of sound in the film is dynamic and extraordinary, with Raimi cleverly arousing our senses as well as our emotions.  The film also contains a highly appreciated cameo by Sam Raimi's brother Ted, who has appeared in a number of his brother's films such as ""Darkman"", the ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy, and the Raimi-produced John Woo film ""Hard Target.""  Ted Raimi is undoubtedly best known however for his portrayal of Joxer, a recurring character from the Raimi-produced television series ""Xena:Warrior Princess."" ""For The Love Of The Game"" is a film that not only brings some long overdue respect and attention for one of our great actors and one of our premiere directors, but will bring to its audience a finely crafted emotional experience they will remember and cherish for a long time to come."

","The audience stands and cheers and, as Billy Chapel steps to the mound, the crowd goes wild... and I realize now that this audience/crowd is that of the movie theatre.

The acting was amazing as Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston and an unforgettable cast put out an amazing story.  The story; incredible and well-written.  The characters; unforgettable...it's one of those movies you never forget. When I finally left the theatre, I noticed that everyone was in the same state I was in...utter awe.

"litprof","9","0","0","15 September 1999"," From now on, Kev, just act!
","I saw a sneak preview of _For Love of the Game_ this week, and I was happily surprised.  It immediately goes into my list of Top Ten Baseball Movies, along with (in no particular order) _Field of Dreams_, _Bull Durham_ (a Costner to Costner to Costner triple play!), _Eight Men Out_, _A League of Their Own_, _Bang the Drum Slowly_, Fear Strikes Out_, _The Bad News Bears_ and three others of your choice.  (Anyone who nominates either Babe Ruth biopic, with William Bendix or John Goodman, will be ejected immediately and banned from the game for life.)<br/><br/>Costner plays an aging Tigers pitcher named Billy Chapel with very few strikes left in his sore arm.  It is a couple of days from the end of the season, his record is 8-11, (though with an ERA in the low 3's, which would have made him an All-Star in the real major leagues this year!), he is starting a game at Yankee Stadium that means a lot to the Yankees and nothing to Detroit, and he has just been told the team has been sold and he will be traded once the season ends.  Costner is athletic enough to play a baseball player convincingly (although they use a stand-in for some shots), and his acting range is better than he is given credit for these days.  He can be romantic, funny, self-absorbed, and angry, though his most comfortable persona is stoic with just a hint of sarcastic spine, and this role seems written for him.<br/><br/>Perhaps surprisingly, I would say that less than a third of the film deals directly with baseball.  Baseball is the framing story (literally -- the whole film is a series of flashbacks during a single game) for what proves to be an unconventional but believable romance.  This is a great date movie: the guys will love the baseball scenes, and the gals will love how our sympathies are always with Kelly Preston's Jane (the love interest), at least after the relationship has begun in earnest.<br/><br/>Preston is fine as Jane, but the other supporting actors are better.  Jena Malone (_Contact_, _Stepmom_) is superb as Jane's daughter Heather.  John Reilly (_Boogie Nights_) has some of the best lines as Chapel's long-time friend and catcher.  And J. K. Simmons (_Oz_, _Law & Order_) does his usual fine job making a small role utterly convincing as the Tigers' skipper.<br/><br/>The film uses special effects very well.  When Chapel focuses on his pitching, the stands blur and the obnoxious fans (this is New York, after all) are suddenly muted.  We really get the sense of what it means when athletes say they ""block everything out.""<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very satisfying film. Yes, the odds of a 40 year-old pitcher carrying a perfect game into the late innings (no spoilers here! you'll have to see it if you want to know if he gets that 27th out) are slim.  But the odds of any pitcher throwing a perfect game at any time are astronomical.  Baseball is the most serendipitous of sports, which is why it makes the best movies.  In any case, Chapel's performance is far more believable than the superficially similar but oh-so-ridiculous one by Steve Nebraska in _The Scout_ (what was Albert Brooks thinking?).<br/><br/>A final note, and the explanation for my title.  Costner truly is a fine actor.  He is *not* a good writer or director.  When he just acts, we get films like this.  When he tries to do more, we get _Waterworld_.  Curse the Academy for ever convincing him otherwise by rewarding that cheap knock off of _Little Big Man_ called _Plays with Camera_.  I mean, _Dances with Wolves_.  Please, Kevin, stick to acting -- For the Love of the Movies!"

He is now 40 and just found out that he is being traded, his girlfriend is leaving him for a job in England, and he still has pitch a game later today.  He is in the loneliest place on Earth right now.

","Kevin Costner is a delight in this movie, and so are the scenes of the ballgame. On the field, there has never been anyone better at portraying a baseball player. Off the field, Costner's terrific at portraying a man at the crossroads. If there is one sour note in this movie, it's Kelly Preston's weak portrayal of his girlfriend. A stronger actress who had better chemistry with Costner would have improved the situation. So would getting rid of the awful scene where Costner's character injures his hand and is taken to a clinic. Otherwise, the movie is pretty good."

","Frankly, Kevin Costner isn't one of my favorites. I liked ""No Way Out"", ""Field of Dreams"" and a couple of his other outings; and although I loved ""Dances With Wolves"", I found his acting to be one of the weaker points of the movie.<br/><br/>But Costner is nonetheless good at baseball movies, and Sam Raimi is a great director, so some good had to come out of it. And it did.<br/><br/>Sure, it's long and drawn out at times - but so was ""The Natural"" (and so is baseball itself, for that matter). And it's emotionally overwrought at times, but then so was ""Field of Dreams"". Still, I found the balance of love story and baseball movie more satisfying than I expected. Costner is a little too much of a jerk at times, and Kelly Preston is a way too forgiving of his faults, but the emotions are realistic enough otherwise.<br/><br/>It is hard to categorize though - with elements of both a typical ""guy movie"" (almost incomprehensible love of sports) and ""chick flick"" (love story, realistic emotionalism and hurt feelings), it's hard to pin down into one genre. But no matter where it belongs, I still find myself watching it whenever it's on cable. Score: 8/10."

","This movie borrowed a lot from Major League.  Veteran guy's guy with diminishing skills has on and off relationship with bookwormish girl who used to be wild while an evil owner looks to replace the veteran, a one-dimensional upscale arty man appears in one scene looking to steal the girl and a boorish Yankee villain threatens the pitcher on the field.<br/><br/>What it doesn't have that Major League had was a great supporting cast of characters, real dialogue, chemistry between the lovers, realistically crass on the field behavior (on the field scenes were so corny in For Love of the Game) a ton of great humor and just being an overall good movie.<br/><br/>One more thing, maybe I missed something... but the Costner cutting his hand scene was one of the most laughably ridiculous scenes I've ever seen in a movie.  I once cut my hand with a chainsaw, wrapped a glove over it, got driven to the hospital, stood in the lobby waiting three hours because its obviously not at all life-threatening or critical, then got stitches and left.  Costner is cut on the pouch of skin between his thumb and finger by a table saw.  He then stammers back toward the house losing consciousness.  He is rushed to the Hospital where he appears delirious as Kelly Preston makes the most embarrassing rant I've ever scene in a movie because no one will help him.  He is then taken by helicopter somewhere else (no one in that hospital can stitch a cut?) and on top of all that he has oxygen tubes?  How ridiculous is that?  It was as if he'd been shot 3 times in every vital organ when instead he has a one inch cut on his hand."
"wrdiggs","Null","0","0","12 March 2001"," It was....""Perfect""
","I have always loved baseball.  I have always loved the movies.  Somehow, a marriage of the two has never worked,  with the exception perhaps of A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN.  Even Kevin Costner's two previous highly rated diamond films BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS struck out with me.<br/><br/>Other baseball films, such as THE BABE, make me cringe to think a whole generation of kids are growing up believing one of the greatest athletes of the twentieth century was only a stumbling, bumbling, overweight slob who, everytime he came to bat, wound up on his ass with two strikes on him, only to somehow get back up and hit the ball out of the park on the third pitch.<br/><br/>FOR LOVE OF THE GAME finally delivers the goods to make a film about the national pastime believable.  Even if it were not about baseball, the dramatic, romantic story of Billy Chapel, played by Costner, and his love interest, Jane Aubrey, played by Kelly Preston, is intriguing.<br/><br/>Chapel is a 39-year-old pitcher, in the twilight of a Hall-Of-Fame career, pitching for a beleaguered Detroit Tigers franchise that, like Chapel, has seen better days. As a long, frustrating season winds to a close, Chapel learns the team has been sold and, as part of the deal, he is being traded to the San Francisco Giants.  On the same day, Aubrey, Chapel's long-suffering girl friend who has stood by him through his ups and downs for five years, announces she is leaving him.  Chapel has always put baseball first throughout their relationship, never giving Jane the same commitment he has given the game.<br/><br/>As he pitches against the Yankees in his last game of the season, Chapel ponders his fate.  Will he go along with the trade and continue his career with another team?  Will he retire and call it a career, going out on top? What about Jane?  All during the game, told through flashback, Chapel remembers how he met Jane and what she has meant to him over the past five years.<br/><br/>But something else is developing.  As the game reaches the 7th inning, Chapel realizes he is on the verge of something only 16 pitchers in the history of baseball have ever attained....he is pitching a perfect game. The tension builds with every pitch as the game reaches a climax, and the outcome may well determine what Billy Chapel decides to do about the rest of his life.<br/><br/>A great supporting cast of John C. Reilly as Tiger catcher Gus Sinski, Jena Malone as Heather, Jane's rebellious teenage daughter, and Vin Scully, probably the greatest baseball announcer ever, playing himself, give this film credibility.  The Yankee Stadium shots are stunning.  But it is the performances of the two leads, Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston, that makes FOR LOVE OF THE GAME a winner.<br/><br/>Even if you don't like baseball, you'll like FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.  If you do enjoy the game, don't miss this one.  See if you don't agree it is the best baseball movie ever made."
"quin1974","7","0","0","6 February 2001"," Baseball, love and Costner
","Baseball, can there be a greater game in the world? To my opinion, no. Baseball has been America's favorite pastime ever since some schmuck had the nerve to hit a ball with a stick. This is what Sam Raimi has tried to portray in this movie. A sleugh of other movies have come before this one trying to depict what goes on on the field during an important game of baseball, and what happens outside it during the off hours. But never has an entire game been presented during the span of a single movie.<br/><br/>This is what makes For Love Of The Game special. As an audience you are sitting next to the players and in particular Kevin Costner while they go through an entire game of baseball. Here's the premise:<br/><br/>Costner is Billy Chapel, a veteran ballplayer who, on a fateful morning, has his girlfriend leaving him, his boss telling him he is selling the team (Detroit Tigers, yuch) and he gets the news that if he doesn't quit he is going to be traded to the SF Giants (even more yuch), and to top it all off he has to play an important game against the New York Yankees (YEAH!!!) that same day. During this game he pitches he reflects on his life as a player and as a lover.<br/><br/>This is unfortunately where the movie goes wrong. The images portrayed in the baseball match are so vivid and compelling that when Costner thinks back to his past the lovestory takes the back seat and you want nothing else than go back to the game and see if he can really throw the Perfect Game. Kelly Preston as the girlfriend just doesn't cut it, she is never a match for the power of the game and that's a shame.<br/><br/>Costner has to by now acknowledge the fact that he is made for just two movies: Sports movies (Bull Durham, Tin Cup) and Political Situation movies (JFK, Thirteen Days). He is great in this pic, his athletic abilities are absolutely convincing when he performs this role of a pitching star nearing the end of his career at 40. Geeze, he pitched all the balls himself, no CGI was involved there. Although he lulls into some melodrama at times during the love story sequences, but this is more the fault of the script then him.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast was great. John C. Reilly was brilliant as ever as buddy catcher Sinski. Even little Jena Malone pulled off a good performance considering the material she was given. A lot of the players on both the home and the away team were real ballplayers, this gave an authentic feel to whole.<br/><br/>The baseball sequences were shot exquisitely by John Bailey and directed to near brilliance by Sam Raimi. It was nice to for once see into the heads of these players, the mechanisms they use to filter out the audience and to hear the ball hit the mitt with such power was exhilarating. I have never had the pleasure to even see someone pitch a Perfect Game, but this came real close.<br/><br/>There is just one fact that bugged me entire: since when do the NEW YORK YANKEES lose to the Detroit Tigers? It was painful to see my team lose like that.<br/><br/>7/10"

"meridiansmith-2","Null","0","0","20 June 2000"," Raimi's Return
","After `A Simple Plan', many felt it was time to throw in the towel for Sam Raimi.  It seemed apparent that the director/genius who brought us `Darkman' and the `Evil Dead' series seemed as though he was trading in his signature B-movie look & feel and abandoning his quest to further blur the lines between the comedy & horror genres for a more `serious' style of film.<br/><br/>As it turns out, nothing could be further from the truth!  Raimi is back, and the relieved sighs were heard Â‘round the world from his fans upon release of `For the Love of the Game'.   While not quite embracing the B-movie look & feel as he once would have, Raimi has still shown us all that comedy and horror are not the strange bedfellows that some of us have come to expect.<br/><br/>Raimi managed to secure Kevin Costner to play the lead villain in a movie about a falling star.  Mere minutes after the film's opening scene, Raimi flashes us back to the day Costner's character and the female lead meet; her car is broken down on the side of the road, and he happens to be driving by in a Porsche.  In true Sam Raimi fashion, he shows us how truly evil the villain is right away: Costner stops, approaches the young & seemingly stranded woman, and threatens to make her watch a baseball game. Callous acts like this would normally terrify some viewers, but Kevin Costner's expressionless face make it easy to repeat to oneself that `it's just a movie'.<br/><br/>Later, in an effort to brighten the `creepy' backdrop painted with a constant barrage of baseball images & Kevin Costner's face, Raimi pays homage to two of the greatest films of his career: `Evil Dead 2' and `Army of Darkness'.  He does this by having Costner's character injure his pitching hand with a table saw, a moment of sheer comic genius.  The excessive use of blood, Costner's inability to make it back to his house (from what appeared to be the garage), and the idea that a major-league pitcher would be careless enough to allow this to happen at all make this one of the funniest moments of the film. For Raimi's die-hard fans, however, this scene carried with it some sentimental value; a reminder of Raimi's glory days, when Bruce Campbell was forced to chop off his possessed hand with a chainsaw and later build a replacement out of armor.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this movie was considered a disappointment at the box-office, Raimi's return as the king of horror-comedies and Kevin Costner's expressionless, monotonous villainy make this a hands-down winner. I'd recommend this film to anyone who carries even the slightest degree of appreciation for Sam Raimi, and would also recommend it as an excellent introduction to his classic style."

","When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't expect it to beat Field of Dreams as the best baseball movie ever.  At the end of the movie, it blew Field of Dreams out of the water.  Kevin Costner is the King of Baseball movies.  Bull Durham was great, Field of Dreams improved on Bull Durham, but For Love of the Game was Costner at his best.<br/><br/>Costner as Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher who doesn't know if he will pitch again nevermind where, is thrust right into an introspective look at his life when he finds out that his on and off girlfriend Jane is leaving for London.  This makes Chapel think about the last five years with Jane, and as he is thinking about this, he is unwittingly getting deeper into a rare feat in baseball: the Perfect Game.<br/><br/>Chapel is then faced with two big mountains.  The perfect game and Jane. He figures he can do nothing about Jane, however, the very competitive Billy Chapel wants to get the perfect game at all costs, and the will and fight he shows is impressive.  But the difference with Billy Chapel and all the other characters Costner has played is that Billy Chapel is very human.  He is flawed, but he has one thing that he loves, and that is the game.<br/><br/>For Love of the Game is inspiring.  Its the story of a man who is faced with incredible adversity, and its the story of a man rediscovering himself, its a must see, and you'd be a fool to miss out on a journey as incredible as this."

","Actually Kevin Costner was not bad at all in this film,  I think by and large he works in baseball films nicely.  He did a good job in this film....the story was fine...well o.k, it was good enough....but the characters..specifically Kelly Preston's Character Jane Aubrey just did not work for me.  For example I remember thinking what a wonderful poignant and powerful addition Glenn Close was in Natural, How integral she was to that story.  Kelly Preston's Character in this film to me was like a canker sore on a gum boil, after the second scene with her one wondered if ....  Billy Chapel (Kevin Character) was a pseudo masochistic....and by the end of the movie her character had pronounced elements of several degrees of psychological in balance....and I found myself thinking...""Hmmm that's just what he needs after quitting the game he loved for 19 years, is a wife he can go to therapy 3 times a week with....What a retirement plan huh?   Anyway, some of the characters were interesting, but ""Jane"" wasn't one of them and I found myself grinding my teeth toward the end of the film.  It should ah been a whole lot better film.  It could ah and would ah been perhaps if they had cut Kelly (Jane)s part, and perhaps left the young girl, that actress who played her daughter....written her perhaps as Kevins daughter?  She was just as complex with out the angst and far more believable, or at least a nicer less disfunctional feast for the pallet."

","Alright, I'm going to preface these comments by stating that: 1.) I grew up a Detroit Tigers fan, and 2.) I am a fan of Costner, so if you are expecting harsh criticism, stop reading now. That said, after hearing of this movie some time ago and keeping up with the production details and pre-release information, this movie had a seemingly insurmountable level of hype to live up to in my mind and it is a testament to the film that it did so and more. Raimi has successfully woven together two storylines that you actually care about. You aren't anxiously awaiting another flashback while Billy Chapel is on the mound, and you aren't pining for the baseball storyline when Chapel is reliving his failed romance...each are enthralling in their own ways.<br/><br/>With the ninety-minute romantic comedy almost extinct, this is a two hour film that I really didn't want to end when it did. So, again, take my comments with a grain of salt. This movie may not automatically jump into your all-time top 5 as it did for me, but if you are a romantic-comedy fan, prepare to be impressed. My only problem now is that I have to wait another two weeks before it is released in theaters."

","The baseball sequences are as good as any I have seen in a movie, but the rest is as bad as any movie I have seen.  Unfortunatley the baseball part is not enough to make this a movie which could be recommended.  I have read the book and thought it too was a good book though not great which concentrated on the character of Billy Chapel as a baseball player and as an individual. The relationship with his girl friend was not as elaborate or complicated as that shown in the movie, but did depict him as someone who was dedicated to his baseball career, and though a decent human being did not really need anything or anyone else.  I saw this movie on DVD and the best part was the extras added about how the movie was made and the short film about Babe Ruth.  It did not seem to have any connection with the movie, but to a dedicated old time baseball fan was quite interesting.  What surprised me most was the fact that Costner did all of the pitching himself and in this manner aquitted himself as a good baseball actor though his acting in the other love sequences was not as convincing."

I can't disagree, but that's like saying that some nice, new baseball park doesn't stack up to Yankee Stadium or Wrigley Field -- it's an impossibly high standard.<br/><br/>In ""Game,"" Costner plays an aging pitcher trying to pitch a perfect game in Yankee Stadium. But while he's doing so, he keeps thinking back to his relationship with Jane, played by Kelly Preston. His flashbacks to important moments in his relationship with Jane are woven almost seamlessly in with the baseball action.<br/><br/>So if you don't like baseball, you might wonder why anybody would love this movie. But if you do ... give it a shot. You won't be sorry."

","As a complete sucker for baseball movies (the game is so inherently dramatic), I loved this film.  It was a real weepie for boys, with no heartstring untugged.  It is too long by half an hour, and the structure doesn't help--when you are starting to tire, and you know that the game still has three innings to go, the movie seems longer.  Moreover, too many loose ends are tied: the dud fielder has to make the dramatic catch, the dud catcher has to hit the important run, the heroine has to delay her flight--there is this certain grim inevitability in the story.  So what a dud flick!  And how much I loved it!  For positives, Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston and J.C. Reilly perform splendidly; the bit players, like the underutilised Brian Cox are all good; the camera work and especially the sound are great (the loneliness of the long-distance pitcher is cleverly evoked by use of silence); and the film taps into the mythic quality of baseball, with all the history and sentiment that makes grown men cry.  I can understand bad reviews for this one, but I am looking forward to seeing it again."

","This film is an endearing look at a baseball player who might be pitching his last game after 19 years with the same team. <br/><br/>After such films as ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field Of Dreams"" baseball seems to follow Kevin Costner as he returns to the diamond once again in ""For Love Of The Game."" <br/><br/>I enjoyed this film immensely not only because Costner is my favorite actor, but because he brings firey attitude to his character Billy Chapel. Costner is known for this as he brings it to every film he has been in.<br/><br/>
Sam Raimi brings a fresh attitude and look to the silver screen as the director of this movie. Raimi did a brilliant job unveiling the sequences as he did as the plot surrounded one game with flashbacks to Billy's on again, off again romance with Jane, played by the beautiful Kelly Preston.<br/><br/>In addition, John C. Reilly who played Gus Sinski was a pleasant addition and surprise as he brought an excellent balance of calm and support to Billy. <br/><br/>The best thing about this film was the monologue Billy carries with himself throughout on the mound. <br/><br/>The only complaint I may have about this film would be the length; I think some scenes could have been edited out or cut down a little because the film shouldn't have lasted as long as it did. <br/><br/>It was an excellent for what it was, which is a sweet, lighted hearted romantic drama."

Whether Costner is a great actor is up to debate, but he is usually very likeable on screen. He plays a similar role in TIN CUP--the down-and-out, sliding-into-middle-age athlete--there Kevin was charismatic and fun to watch. Not so in FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.

It's the best I've seen Kevin Costner in recent memory, and Kelly Preston is just excellent. These are not walk-throughs: both Costner and Preston under Raimi's direction are thoughtful and real, and a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The writing is clear-minded and witty, but always observant proceding from the characters and their mien and the situations in life they've been cast in and never steps out to be wise-upon-itself independently of the film. My kind of writing.<br/><br/>Men are going to like this film because it digs into some aspects of the sport and the relationship that a pitcher has with the batters in a touching way that is seldom addressed in motion pictures, showing a true competitive spirit. Unfortunately, the theatrical trailer doesn't quite sell this point right, but that would be very hard to do in a 3 minute period.<br/><br/>Women are going to like this film simply because it is a very 'real-like' 'real-life' type of romance. And it shows men for what men would really like to be: not just romantic about their women, but in love with a part life that allows us to be what we really want to be, and to be loved and admired and respected by our women for that special affection that we have for another part of life.<br/><br/>This is a ""movie"" movie, and I would like to see more like it.

","Kevin Costner plays a handsome, famous baseball pitcher who can have any woman in the world, and for absolutely no reason, he chooses Kelly Preston, a bespectacled, mousy, problem-ridden, ordinary girl. Straight out of the Every Woman's Fantasy playbook, a role Costner has shouldered several times over the years. In his own words, she's ""a bummer""—that line is my favorite part of the movie—but he just can't live without her? <br/><br/>At two hours and twenty minutes, For Love of the Game is far too long. I kept fast forwarding to get to the ending. She's unlikable, he's unrealistic, the pseudo-sad piano music will drive you insane, and there's not enough baseball to make it an interesting sports movie. Then again, since it really isn't intended to be an interesting sports movie, there's altogether too much baseball, adding to the boredom that sets in as soon as Kelly Preston shows up.<br/><br/>Unless you're angry with someone and want to torture him by sitting him in front of this movie, there's really no reason to rent it. I know that's harsh, but I'm still trying to figure out why anyone, after reading the script, agreed to make it in the first place."

","This is a romance disguised as a sports movie. And the romance part sucks. Also the sports parts suck.<br/><br/>Before I delve into my reasons for hating this movie, I want to mention something: The original title for this movie was, ""For the Love of the Game"" Why? Because that's how the phrase goes. Simple logic there. But, for some reason, they took the first ""the"" out of the title. Why? To make the title shorter. Why? Who freaking knows? Because some fat lady in a focus group likes short titles. I hate Hollywood.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is about a baseball player played by Kevin Costner who is pitching a perfect game on what might be the last game of his career. While he pitches, he has flashbacks. Some of his flashbacks involve his romance with a woman played by Kelly Preston. Preston, who I usually like because of her uber-hotness, plays one of the most annoying female characters of all time. Basically, her thing is, ""I love you but I'm scared and slightly mental so I'll push you away over and over again."" Very endearing. Plus her acting stinks in this movie. Other flashbacks involve Costner's character interacting with his teammates. This where the movie tries to pull at some manly heartstrings. It fails here too but manages to lay down some foreshadowing that would allow any idiot to predict what happens to the characters later in the movie. There are many other reasons why this movie sucks. The attempts at humor fall flat. The ""inspirational"" dialogue is cheesy. It has none of Sam Raimi's usual great touches. Costner cries. I could go all day.<br/><br/>Please- skip this. If you want to see a movie that is both about sports and romance and actually manages to do both well, see Jerry Maguire. If you've already seen it - see it again. It's very rewatchable. And Kelly Preston is way better (and hotter) in it."

","How many more flops will Kevin Costner be involved in before his career finally ends? ""For Love of the Game"" is just another step in that direction, after such recent bad films like The Bodyguard (which shockingly made a lot of $$$), Waterworld, and The Postman. <br/><br/>First of all, at 135 minutes, FLOTG, is WAY too long. Part of the beginning scenes are followed by a flashback that reappears later in the film. Kevin Costner gets involved with Kelly Preston in a relationship that cannot be better described than puppy love. It's stupid and ridiculous how these characters shift back and forth from being together and then splitting apart, and/or having their feeling hurt. I mean, when a relationship is this much of a roller-coaster ride, I'm sure its a strong bet that it won't work out in the long run. But the main problem is that neither one is these two is willing to *commit* to each other. <br/><br/>Then there's the whole matter of the ""final game"" in which Costner is determined to pitch the perfect game. But will he? Becuase he's so ticked off about being traded by his team, etc. I seriously couldn't care less, but since I was stuck in the theatre, I decided to make up some suspense of my own. <br/><br/>That moment came went a rookie player came up to bat. There was a brief scene in which Costner and this guy had a brief, but pleasant conversation. I was wondering since Costner was retiring, he would shift all the fame to this young rookie, who would *maybe* be the only player to make a hit in the game. Oh, the suspense of what he might do! <br/><br/>One thing though about Costner, is that he seems to be playing roles that cry out to the audience ""Look at me! I'm this hero! Love me! Please, love me!"" Whatever. We will only love Costner when he starts to make films again like the nonstop suspenseful No Way Out, where not only he is the MAIN attraction."

","This movie is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long, and that's not the worst of its problems.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst of its problems is that it tries to be two very different movies.<br/><br/>On the one hand, it tells the story of a great major league pitcher, as he recalls the last several years of his life while pitching what starts out as an unimportant game and ends up becoming the most important game of his career. It is the story of a man who triumphs over adversity - pain in his shoulder, etc. - to pitch a last, great game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's the story of a man who, off the field, becomes involved with a woman who only causes him trouble. She wants him to NEED her, and by the last scene, though he has pitched a perfect game, which is enough to put most men on cloud 9 for the rest of their lives, he tells her that he NEEDS her, they kiss in what is supposed to be a very romantic public kiss, and one imagines that the producers thought that would win over large audiences of middle-aged women.<br/><br/>I can't watch this movie as a stereotypical woman - that's not how nature made me. I can only say that, for me, the romance was constantly aggravating, because the protagonist allowed himself to become and remain involved with a woman who constantly wanted him to choose between her and his real passion, baseball.<br/><br/>But do many women really expect men to subordinate their non-romantic passions for them and tell them that they NEED them? Not that they love them, which is completely understandable, but that they NEED them? I don't know.<br/><br/>So this is what the movie is about, and it keeps going on, and on, and on, with more incidents. The story simply does not merit going on over 2 hours about this.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a baseball movie, this is likely to disappoint you.

If you even exist."

","For Love of the Game is a film about Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher who may be pitching the last game, and perhaps the best game, of his career. This is happening on a day when he has discovered that the owner of his team is selling the team and the new owners want to trade him away. He has also discovered that his girlfriend of several years is leaving him to take a job in London. In short, at the beginning of the film, Billy Chapel is having a really bad day. Throughout the nine innings of the game that form the narrative core of the film, we experience various flashbacks that take us into the personal life of Billy Chapel.<br/><br/>One of the things that must be said at the beginning is that For Love of the Game is derivative, formulaic, and filled with cliches. This need not be a fatal flaw. The same could be said of some of Shakespeare's best work (e.g., Romeo and Juliet). In fact, For Love of the Game provides Kevin Costner with his best starring role since Dances With Wolves. There must be something about baseballs. Two of Costner's better films from the past are Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. The basic role is similar to Costner's role in Bull Durham, the aging but wise team veteran. In its symbolic view of transcendent moments and meaningful relationships, For Love of the Game has more in common with Field of Dreams.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Michael Shaara. Shaara previously wrote the book that was the basis for the film Gettysburg (""Killer Angels""). The screenplay adaptation is by Dana Stevens whose previous writing credits include City of Angels. While it may seem like a weird combination for a baseball film, with Director Sam Raimi at the helm this film really works. One of the reasons it works is that, like Field of Dreams, this is not really a baseball film.<br/><br/>This is a film about the human spirit and our longing for transcendence. Years ago, I played on a softball team in league competition. It's the bottom of the ninth, men on second and third, two outs, and I'm at the plate with a 3-0 count. I'm ready to take the walk. I was a pitcher, I knew the strike zone, and that year I was leading the league in walks taken. My older, and occasionally wiser, brother was our coach, and he pulled me aside and told me to go for it. I was batting .750 that year, and the guy behind me in the line-up was struggling. Frankly, I would have preferred the safe way out. Let the other guy take the heat for losing the game. Inspired by my brother's confidence in me, I swung at the next pitch, and hit a double to win the game. That was more than twenty years ago, but I remember that moment to this day, because it was someone else's confidence in me that gave me the courage to reach for the stars.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, that's what this film is about. Baseball becomes the context, but the theme is the yearning of the human spirit for transcendence and meaning. What makes this film worth seeing is its emphasis on camaraderie and espirit-de-corps. In many films like this (e.g., The Natural) the hero finds his strength within and triumphs against the odds by superhuman effort. Billy Chapel's saving grace is his brokenness. It is his willingness to acknowledge his need for others that allows him to triumph in the end. While there are clearly elements borrowed from other films here, the final product is fresh, inspirational, and fun."

","Considering the fact that ""Field of Dreams"" (also starring Kevin Costner and about the national pastime) is my favorite sports film of all time, I watched this film with high expectations. For the most part, this movie lived up to those expectations.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot centers on Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel, who finds himself nearing the end of a very long and very successful career. However, when the owner of the Tigers tells Billy that the team no longer can afford him, Billy must make the biggest decision of his life (be traded or retire), all the while putting up zeroes on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard on the final day of the baseball season.<br/><br/>This aspect of the film (Billy's tumultuous decision) really works for baseball fans in a couple of ways. First is the use of flashbacks (think LOST) that show Billy's career up until the present, including his long road back from injury and a burgeoning (yet complicated) romance. Secondly, the vocal talents of Vin Scully (the real-life voice of the Dodgers) will remind all viewers that this movie truly is meant to appeal to pure baseball fans. As Billy pitches deep into his remarkable game, all the while recollecting the earlier events of his life, the film's climax is superbly narrated by Scully.<br/><br/>About the only ""knock"" I have on this film (and thus why it isn't five stars) stems from the fact that Billy's romantic issues tend to be a bit too contrived to create the highest form of believable drama. Perhaps Costner was trying to portray a very conflicted Chapel, but to me it came off as a bit confusing how Billy could have his ""affairs on the side"" and still be involved in a touching romance.<br/><br/>All told, though, this is a film that baseball fans will almost certainly love. Even if you don't completely fall for the romantic aspects, you will be cheering on Billy Chapel as he struggles to achieve the pinnacle of baseball greatness for a pitcher. Once again, as in ""Field of Dreams"", Costner proves that he truly does know how to capture the essence of what makes the game of baseball so dramatic."

","For Love of the Game is a sports drama movie that was based on the novel of the same title by Michael Shaara.The film stars Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.The story follows the a perfect game performance of an aging star baseball pitcher as he reminisces about his career and his relationship with his on-and-off girlfriend, while pitching his final game.The screenplay was written by Dana Stevens and it was directed by Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>The story centers on Billy Chapel,who is the star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium in his last game and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski. However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane is planning to leave him.But guess what,something else happens.<br/><br/>After finishing the perfect game, Billy sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, he weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane. The next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane has missed her flight so she could watch the end of his perfect game. Finding her there waiting for her plane, they embrace and reconcile.<br/><br/>The movie is clichéd,contrived and predictable just like most sports movies and apparently most romantic comedies.As one well-known critic was quoted in his review of the film,""Thinking back through the movie, I cannot recall a single thing either character said that was worth hearing in its own right, apart from the requirements of the plot."" I totally agree with the said movie reviewer.<br/><br/>But what made the movie work is Costner and Preston's convincing professionalism and chemistry together that kept the audience involved and engaged all through out the movie.<br/><br/>In the end,it is still worth the view ""for love of the game""."

","Imagine you wake up one morning and start your routine, only to remember it is your last day to do this routine. You head to the shower as you have for every work day in the last 20 years. As you walk into the bathroom you begin to relive your career. The first day on the job and how excited you were. When you feel the water hit you, it hits you, the first time you met your better half. As you dry off and stand in front of the mirror you remember the first time you got the big promotion and how you shared it with your then girlfriend. You finish dressing and as you walk out the door to the car, you think of the first time you met your boss, the owner of the company, and how he took a liking to you right away. Then the car door slams and you turn the key, still unaware of your surrounding as you relive moments, even seconds, and how they changed your life. You turn onto the expressway for what you have come to know has the hour and half drive to work. It has just begun but you have done it so many times it come to you as second nature. You have learned to turn the blare of the horns off, the sounds of your surrounding just disappear, and you can concentrate on the task at hand. For 20 years now you have done this. Day in and day out it has been your routine. You begin to think back to the first time you stepped into your new office, the one on the top floor, the one with the window, you smile. Then you realize that although this your last day, it is also the biggest day of your career. you have a chance to close a deal that only a few in the history of your company have done, heck in the history of the whole business have ever done. Your focus returns and you go back into auto pilot, as you have done a thousand times. We can all imagine this situation, maybe not for a 20 year career, but for something. The last day you spent at home before heading off to college, knowing you would never again live in the house where your mom made all those great pancakes. Never again have your dad teach you to ride a bike or throw a ball. Maybe it was prom or graduation. Knowing that the twelve years you had spent is now ending and you are not a kid anymore. Life and new choices await you right outside that door. We have all been there, all had that moment to IMAGINE. It is the story of professional baseball player, Billy Chapel (Played by Kevin Costner), and the history of his life and career in the span of one nine inning perfect game. We watch as he pitches the game of his life after a 20 year career, all the while reliving his greatest hits so to speak. He relives his first love, baseball, his real love, Jane Aubrey (Played by Kelly Preston). He relives the injury that almost cost him his career. All this takes place on his last day of ""work"". While he is pitching the only perfect game in his long and illustrious career he lives all of it. This is what makes him realize that in the end it was only a job and the relationships he has built and the choices he has made are what made him, not just the ""Love of the Game"" This movie touches the soul and also allows us to get into the minds of the fans that love the game. As we watch him relive his life, it reaches into our hearts and pulls. As we watch him pitch against the New York Yankees, it brings out the fan in all of us and we watch even the harsh Yankee faithful fall for this guy who is pitching a perfect game against their team. If there was ever a sports movie that could take us everywhere we wanted to go and to the places we seldom admit we need to go, this is it. So the next time your team is rained out and the reruns season is in mid run. Go to the video store, or turn on the laptop and download it. I enjoy it every time I get a chance to see it. I always walk away feeling better about my choices and knowing that life is the same way. We have to imagine and we have to live it for the love of the game."

","Maybe this is not the greatest cinematic achievement in movie history; maybe Kevin Costner is the worst actor (according to the razzie); maybe isn't Lawrence of Arabia or Casablanca, but somehow this films project your imagination to a world where integrity and innocence are true.<br/><br/>The beauty about sports is those are simple, are moral and ethics, if you tray really hard and follow the rules, the best should win. In real life is not so simple, interest beyond the sport it self keep the ideal away from the reality.<br/><br/>According to George Carlin in his masterpiece comic sketch, baseball is a pastoral XIX game; his objective is to go home safe. In the end baseball is about the meaning of live, to find a reason to end your turn and in the end finishing safe. That's way all the great movies about baseball are about life it self (Bull Durhan, Major league, Field of dreams, etc), baseball is balance, in baseball you win when you control your safe, not when you defeat your enemy.<br/><br/>In the end every body in a park in his home or home field love this film for the love of the game."

","Having grown up in baseball and having been to Yankee Stadium many times (albeit a Mets fan) having raised a son who played through high school and for a few summers with either or both VFW and Legion .... let me say that this film is so well crafted in its accuracy, style and depth. The baseball side of the story is fit so well into the love story through the directing. Both Kevin and Kelly are obvious professionals but I think Kelly really shined in this movie. Look at her facial expressions, she is amazing. Gus plays the perfect match to Billy on the baseball side, but then catcher and pitcher should have that special match. The subtleties all around are excellent and too many to mention. Do yourself a favor if you like baseball or a good love story or just great writing and acting. A class act, no fluff here. Enjoy a true classic."

Costner does a great job dealing with the pressures of a deteriorating relationship and a career that is just about finished. This movie ranks up there with Pride of the Yankees, Field of Dreams, and Bull Durham. The supporting cast does a nice job of selling the story. Preston plays Costner's love interest in the movie and you can feel her pain as she has to decide between her love of Chapel and her career. Another outstanding supporting actor is John C.

"mocrash","5","1","2","21 January 2007"," Half of a good movie
","It the movie were truly ""For Love of the Game,"" then it would have dispensed with the love story and focused on the baseball, which is the most compelling element. Hollywood, of course, couldn't do that: the demographic appeal is too narrow.<br/><br/>The romance between Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) and Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) is plausible, and the couple's screen chemistry is good. However, it was in these segments that the movie dragged and, while the paradigm -- celebrity ballplayer meets beauty arts writer uninterested in celebrity -- isn't hackneyed, the trajectory of the relationship is. In addition, while Preston does a solid job, the writing for her character is dreadful -- written with a man's sensibilities and emotionally overblown. For her to have a moral crisis on what is a casually-arranged second date makes little sense; it was though she was making the decision of a lifetime rather than merely getting to know someone.<br/><br/>It is in the baseball, the ""crossroads of his career"" as brilliantly-utilized TV announcer Vin Scully describes it, that makes the plot most interesting. Flashbacks to his baseball past, as well as with the relationship to Jane, are easy to follow and provide context. Much more should have been done here -- maybe to the glory days of his career as well as to his rehabilitation from a career-threatening injury. The baseball scenes were realistic, except for the voiced self-instruction to ""Clear the mechanism"" to shut out the crowd (such an announcement was not needed; simply fading the noise would have revealed the focus of a pitcher entering ""the zone""), and could have been developed on their own.<br/><br/>Even with the relative drag of the romantic sub-plot, the movie has a nice, moderate pace. The melodrama of all the conflicting pressures on Billy is excessive -- facing the potential end of the line and what that represents to him would have been sufficient -- but this is not a poorly crafted film. Quite possibly it all depends on one's perspective: a baseball fan would want more of that, those in need of romance could probably have done without much of the sports.<br/><br/>This is Costner's third baseball-themed movie, and the overall weakest of the trio -- although credit goes to Costner for not reprising one of his previous characters from ""Bull Durham"" or ""Field of Dreams."" If anything, this is closer to ""The Bodyguard,"" although superior in terms of believability, acting and pacing."
"mdk0","10","1","2","3 July 2006"," Comments about comments
","As an ex ball player (for years and years but, never professionally), this movie, to me, accurately depicts exactly what can go on in a players head during a game. I read a comment that a man in this position (the perfect game possibility) would not be thinking about his ex-girlfriend leaving him but, after watching how their relation was built and how they interacted, this was pretty realistic to me. Granted, I never played at the pro level and I might under-estimate what is going on in a pro player's head but, I don't think so. This movie will always be one of my favorite movies of all time. Generally, I do not like to watch baseball or baseball movies (because they are not real close to reality for me) but, this one has both an incredible romantic story tucked into a great, non-boring baseball movie. Some comments I have read kind of plaster Costner or Preston for their roles in this movie but, I absolutely disagree. I think the ""jerkiness"" and the ""uneasiness"" in the beginning was by design - not an acting issue at all. Granted, I am not a professional movie reviewer but, I know what I like and what entertains me and what can pull me in and be believable and this movie does all of that for me. Watch this movie a few times a year - at least - it is worth it!"

","""Game"" is a truly entertaining movie. Part sports story, part soap opera, it is more true to life than many ""heart warming"" films every accomplish.

I wonder if the poor box office ""Game"" produced was a backlash from the extremely schmaltzy, poorly directed and generally lousy ""Message in a Bottle"" This movie deserved better. It was very well directed and filmed, and the chemistry between Costner and Preston was exceptional. Since box office was disappointing, I believe this film should and will become a DVD classic."

That means, out of more than 100,000 games, less than 1/10 of one percent were perfect.<br/><br/>What is a perfect game in MLB? That means that no batter made it to first base! The pitcher gave up no base runners to hits, walks, or errors! That is VERY hard to accomplish! Kevin Kostner was perfect and Kelly Preston was perfect.

"ray-280","9","1","2","14 August 2005"," For Love Of The Cliché
","Kevin Costner brings the armchair sports fantasy to life yet again in this movie, only this time, unlike ""Tin Cup,"" he plays a has-been rather than a never-was athlete. One gets the impression that Costner is exorcising his demons by repeatedly injecting himself into sports heroism roles that he certainly never played in real life. Despite this, the movie somehow manages to work brilliantly even when the entire cast (save for Vin Scully) did not.<br/><br/>On the last day of the season, Billy Chapel was having a bad day: he had a fight with his girlfriend (Kelly Preston) the night before, leading to a breakup, he's on the verge of retirement, a shadow of his former self, and to top it off, he's a half-hour late to the ballpark, where he proceeds to have a midlife crisis. We get to experience this crisis juxtaposed over the perfect game Chapel begins tossing, as the action shifts back and forth from the game to the flashbacks of his great yet still somehow unfulfilling life. If Chapel were 18 and female, he would have been a good candidate for the show ""Starting Over."" In this film, however, he's stuck on the mound.<br/><br/>As Chapel goes over the past five years of his life with Jane, and her daughter (played by the overrated Jena Malone -- an award nomination? get real!), and as we are tortured with Kelly Preston's impersonation of a leading lady, no one seems to notice just how well he's pitching until he asks late in the game ""Has anyone been on base?"" The visuals are excellent, as we see him enter ""The Zone"" by tuning everything out, and only announcer Vin Scully (who does not do east coast games in real life) seems to pick up on what is going on.<br/><br/>We learn that Chapel has come back from a horrific hand injury that should have been his ticket into retirement, and that he's still got a few -- if only a few -- good pitches left in him, but we also learn that he is playing the role of spoiler, doing his job to make it as difficult as possible for the hated Yankees (replete with stereotypical Yankee fans that remind me of those I've seen at the games) to make the playoffs.<br/><br/>The final few innings of the game are the heart of the plot: will he complete the ""perfecto?"" Will Jane turn around and come home? Will his hand injury obstruct his destiny? The most compelling message of the film is that we often meet one destiny while on the path towards another. There are no great moral messages, just a man trying to leave one last mark on the game, hoping for a ""last hurrah"" that rivals the three home runs (of six that year) which Babe Ruth hit on May 25, 1935, at the age of forty.<br/><br/>Despite one of the worst casting jobs of all time, I still recommend this movie, which while clichéd, still manages a few original twists and makes for an entertaining respite."

You see how a fading ballplayer looks back over the ups and downs of his career and slips you get a peak into his future. John Reilly is a treasure, adding to whatever he appears in. I highly recommend this film to anyone approaching middle age and wondering if they should have done things differently. The scenes from Yankee stadium are stunning, with the high night shots making the stadium look more like a cathedral than a ballpark. Jena Malone turns in another fine performance showing everyone her performance in Stepmom was no fluke."
"kerm","9","1","2","16 April 2005"," More a romantic drama than a baseball movie...
","I know what you're probably thinking... Kevin Costner in ANOTHER baseball movie?? To be fair, while I like Field of Dreams and Bull Durham, I know that I would have been more receptive initially if this wasn't another movie about ""America's Favorite Pastime,"" but I have to admit that this is probably my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>This is less a ""baseball movie"" than a movie about a baseball player. While the movie prominently features a baseball game (perhaps the last in Billy Chapel's storied career), it is much more about Chapel looking back on his long career, and especially his love affair with Jane Aubrey, a magazine writer that he stumbles into one day while in New York.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, it's the end of a losing season. Chapel finds himself in the worst day of his life: his team is about to be sold and he is about to be traded from the only team he has ever played for. To compound things, his longtime girlfriend tells him that she can't handle being the second priority in his life behind baseball. So as he takes the mound in the last game of the season, and perhaps the last of his career, realizing that his whole life is about to change, he spends the time thinking about his relationship with Jane. And on this day when nothing else is perfect, maybe Billy can salvage something from his life before the day is through.<br/><br/>This movie also surprised me for a few other reasons. Sam Raimi, the director, is better known for his ""Spider-Man"" movies, which he made later, and for his ""Evil Dead"" movies. He leaves behind his action sequences for this touching film about life and relationships. What surprised me more was that the film was based on a story by Michael Shaara, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ""The Killer Angels,"" which should be required reading for all courses dealing with the Civil War (and which was made into the film ""Gettysburg""). The manuscript was found in his desk after he died, and published posthumously.<br/><br/>Having read the book, and seen the movie, it is clearly a labor of love. Costner, Raimi, and Shaara clearly love the game of baseball, and yet all three recognize that there are more important things in life than a game."

","Kevin Costner has been dubbed the king of all baseball movies, and very simply, because he is. He just does it so well, it's obvious that he enjoys playing the baseball player/fanatic, and does it very well. I know because I am one. I am a HUGE baseball fan and a HUGE movie fan. When baseball movies come along, it is always a treat. <br/><br/>     This one was very different from other movies, it all takes place during one baseball game, and unlike other baseball movies, it is about the last game of the season, and Kevin's team has no shot at the playoffs, so this game does not mean anything. But to Costner, it does. It is nearing the end of his career, and his life is falling apart, his team is thinking about trading him, his arm is beginning to fail him, and his girlfriend is leaving him. Needless to say it isn't his best day to go out and pitch. But he still does, he badly wants to. <br/><br/>     Costner is having flashbacks all throughout the game; in the dugout, on the field, before the game. We slowly get his whole life, and the father into the game we get, the farther into his life we get up to this point. His main focus is on his girlfriend just about to leave him, she tells him this just before the game. <br/><br/>     This movie is very different and much better than other baseball movies because never have they only focused on one baseball game, usually it is the whole season, or just the playoffs or world series. It is just a useless game for the team. That is what makes this movie so much better than other baseball movies, it is hard to really capture the real intensity of baseball when you show each game in five or six minutes. It's just not possible, this is a two hour movie, practically in real time. This really portrays the way you get into a baseball game. Never have I heard the audience clap in the theater, as if they were at the game, until I saw this movie.<br/><br/>     Somehow, the movie is able to show the Chapel's entire life and career, while at the same time showing this one, very important game.

"billm-4","Null","1","2","28 September 1999"," Overlong and poorly written
","This film has three massive strikes against it - its length, its confusing flashback structure and its abysmal character development. For non-Americans like me, there is the fourth strike of its cultural parochialism. This is one basketball movie which will leave non-enthusiasts completely cold, unlike the superb ""Bull Durham"", which provided ample enjoyment even for people who cared nothing about the game. But then ""Bull Durham"" had a much shorter running time (105 versus 137 minutes), a razor sharp script, a straightforward linear structure and understandable, if sometimes caricatured, characters. Both films enjoyed good performances from very appealing actors, though you have to admit that Kelly Preston cannot hold a candle to the superb Susan Sarandon.<br/><br/>The ponderous buildup towards the inevitable happy endings, both romantic and sporting, seems to take forever. Because it is a ""serious"" film, these happy endings look doubly forced and unlikely - an aging, injured player achieves a perfect day's pitching against top-notch Major League opponents and an aging philanderer declares true love to a woman who knows he has cheated on her. The corresponding double happy ending in ""Bull Durham"", even though it is a superbly tongue-in-cheek comedy, looks that much less unlikely and more realistic. A ten years younger Costner hits a record score in MINOR League before retiring gracefully, and he and the gleefully promiscuous Sarandon character establish a tentative relationship, in which neither has any confidence of a lifetime's endurance. <br/><br/>The unlikely behavior of the leading players is continued in the treatment of Preston's daughter -  whose very existence is not mentioned until deep into the film. The delightful and talented Jena Malone is provided with the feeblest of excuses for running away from her devoted mother to her uncaring dopehead dad. Her character's limited presence is a mere sideshow to the main story and she could usefully have been deleted altogether to shorten the excessive running time. Other characters are present for some limited, much needed comic relief, or to provide background to the aging god struggling to achieve a dignified and long overdue exit from the game.<br/><br/>The countless flashbacks confuse both story and character development - most of the time you have little sense of when they occurred relative to the present, there is very little sense of what happened between these episodes and there is even less sense of the leading characters' motivations - e.g. why Preston's character hangs onto this Lothario or how deeply the Costner character feels about her from episode to episode.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the disastrous box office should kill any hope of a sequel, and Kevin may be forced to act his advancing age and seek more appropriate roles and better written scripts."

","I am amazed and horrified by the praise other IMDB users are heaping on this movie!

There was never any feeling that they had any sort of passion between them... it seemed like they hardly saw each other, and when they did, Preston babbled on annoyingly while Costner acted like a selfish loser.  YAWN.  And that montage where she supposedly ""got to know"" Costner by asking him inane questions like whether he liked dark meat or white?  OH MAN, WAS THAT LAME!!<br/><br/>Finally, any movie that uses the ENTIRE Bob Seeger song ""Against the Wind"" during the film should immediately be put in the scmaltz hall of shame."

","I'm not a huge fan of baseball (I tune in to a few games a year and the World Series) so I approached this movie with some apprehension, but was pleasantly surprised. This is an interesting and moving story.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is excellent as Billy Chapel, a 19 year veteran pitching the last game of his career as a Detroit Tiger at Yankee Stadium. Once a star, Chapel has been plagued by arm problems, and before the game his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) informed him that she was leaving. With all these conflicting emotions, and in significant physical pain, Chapel manages to string together the best performance of his career, shooting for a perfect game. As the game progresses, Chapel reflects on his life, his up and down relationship with Jane and the struggles in his career.<br/><br/>I warn you - the love story is a bit sappy in places, and the whole ""last game might be a perfect game"" scenario is perhaps a bit too romanticized. The ending is also quite predictable. Having said that, it's an enjoyable movie; maybe the best baseball movie since ""Pride of the Yankees.""<br/><br/>I rated it 8/10"

","Kevin Costner's streak of poor movies continues with this disappointing baseball film about a veteran pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and what could be his last game as a pro.  The Tigers are out of contention, the owner is going to sell the franchise, and Costner will likely be traded after the season.  Now they are in New York trying to beat the Yankees and Costner is trying to give one last glimpse of days past to himself and baseball fans. He is pitching a perfect game and as he does so he thinks back to everything that has happened since he met the one true love of his life (Kelly Preston).  As the game progresses, more memories come to Costner and he realizes that as much as he loves baseball, he loves Preston even more. ""For Love of the Game"" is a movie that wants to be good, but falls due to movie cliches.  Many times the flashbacks are more distracting than anything else.  Costner and Preston are the only two performers who really have substantial parts.  They both do pretty well, but the direction is never quite clear.  The screenplay was going for something like ""Field of Dreams"", but ends up playing more like a sub-par baseball film from the 1940s or 1950s.  Overall a film that is only fair at best.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

Where to begin? Well, as someone mentioned earlier, why must Hollywood always make these cliched, lazy, ""baseball is a metaphor for life"", films?  Kevin Costner:  A man who displays as much range of emotion as a wooden cigar store Indian. Kelly Preston:  What, did Meg Ryan cost too much?  The screenwriters:  If the story starts to sag, just dream up some new crisis and we'll go from there...(Kelly's unknown daughter runs away from home and Kevin must rescue her from a bad neighborhood; Kelly catches Kevin getting a ""massage"" from another woman; Kevin slices his hand wide open on a buzz saw and hurts Kelly's feelings in the process; Kelly gets tired of waiting for Kevin and finds herself an artsy-fartsy playboy to sleep with.  And Vin Scully....Vin, I hoped they paid you a lot to make this, because your reputation really sank in the estimation of a lot of us baseball fans.  Is your memory starting to go Vin?  How could you say that you hadn't seen a perfect game since Don Larson's in 1956, when you very famously called Sandy Koufax's perfect game on September 9, 1965 against the Mets.....remember?  (""Swung on and missed, a perfect game!"")  Ah well, Hollywood loves to crank out these formula love stories, and I'm sure with home video rentals, overseas sales, rentals to airlines, etc., this will make a nice pot of dough for the studio.

The whole premise was Chapel and Jane's relationship.  They hate each other, then they love each other, then they hate each other ... throughout the movie, all I saw was Jane getting used continuously, and yet she still stays with him.  Gimme a break.  This is the '90's.  She should know by now that you don't need a jerk to complete you or anything, yet that seems to be the underlying message.  She came off as completely whiny and needy.<br/><br/>Though the movie plays almost entirely by flashbacks, it all begins (and ends) at one fateful baseball game, the last of Chapel's career.

It's one thing that it's a Kevin Costner movie, which in and of itself carries a certain formula that can take down director and ship with him. Maybe there might be some even die-hard baseball movie fans out there (baseball itself is cool, the movies from that can either hit or really miss) who might appreciate this film, but as that and as a romantic melodrama it's just, well, a shamble of formula, over-sentimentality, and over-wrought dialog. Some of the supporting acting isn't too terrible, as John C. Reilly and JK Simmons are usually hard to disappoint. But it's practically humorless, and (this is a bit subjective here) can be somewhat incredulous against Yankees fans. The premise itself could've worked- aging baseball pitcher does a perfect game while his romantic life has a checkered past. But Raimi isn't able to breathe that much life into the script, and the Hollywood feel of it just adds to its, well, blandness. It's not one of the worst movies of 1999, but it's a definite yes that I would not only not recommend it, but would steer clear of it if it came on TV again. Maybe as a piece of fluff it might just be a below satisfactory effort, but from Raimi it's emanates from me a big ""huh?"""

","I'm a fan of sports romances as a genre, especially for date movies, but in ""For Love of the Game,"" the baseball is better than the romance as the relationship just doesn't make a whole lot of sense, though it is hard for a perfect game attempt to be made visual.<br/><br/>I did enjoy how oblivious the women in the movie were to ESPN, because if I didn't live with baseball fanatics I'm not sure I'd notice details of the season. I'm not sure all the other parts of the females' lives made sense (I'm the kind who worries about who's with the kid when the mother is off on a romantic weekend).<br/><br/>Kevin Costner still doesn't understand that if he's going to insist on marketing himself as a close-up, big screen sex symbol then he has to put as much time into working out on his body as women movie stars have to, cruel as the camera is, though the list of credits was full of ""Mr. Costner's trainer"", ""Mr. Costner's hairstylist"", ""Mr. Costner's coach"", etc. I still like his so-American dialog delivery, but it's his too-long, pensive, tortured close-ups that don't work as well, except towards the end where manliness has to deal with emotion and he was quite effective there.<br/><br/>(originally written 9/26/1999)"
"Latheman-9","3","1","3","6 April 2003"," Game called on account of pain.
","The viewer's pain, that is. This hybrid of chick-flick romance and male sports weepie is the epitome of formulaic Hollywood movie-making, a film made solely to generate box office receipts by appealing to the most bathetic elements in these genres. The plot and writing are so predictable that there were several occasion when I was able to say an actor's next line out loud before s/he did and hit it right on. Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner are well matched in that both are mediocre actors on their very best days; the wonderfully wooden Costner received yet another Razzie nomination for Worst Actor of the Year. At least he looks like a ballplayer, having played at the University of Southern California, a traditional collegiate baseball powerhouse. This also probably has much to do with his predilection for making baseball movies.<br/><br/>There were several highly unrealistic aspects in this film. Costner insists that his regular catcher, played by John C. Reilly, start the game, but then he continually shakes off his pitch calls. This is not the sign of a battery that is in sync. Kelly Preston's character makes a reference to ""when the Tigers and Yankees play in the series."" Certainly not the World Series, since both teams are in the American League. Yet she hardly seems to know enough about major league baseball to be referring to a league championship series. The Yankees manager sends to the plate a rookie without a single major league at bat as the potentially final out to break up a perfect game? Puhleeze! The ridiculous hand injury & hospital scene has already been noted by a previous commenter.<br/><br/>The film did feature the wonderful Brian Cox, a highly talented but criminally underutilized actor who deserves to be in far better films than this one. And also Vin Scully, the best play-by-play baseball announcer in the country, bar none. I had frequent opportunity to listen to his broadcasts of Los Angeles Dodgers' games when I was growing up, and he's still the best. These two are the only bright points in an otherwise thoroughly dismal film that drags on for well over two hours. And throughout it all, Sam Raimi was at the helm?! What was he thinking?! I have to believe that he made the same mistake David Lynch did with ""Dune"" (1984) -- he made the movie the way the producers wanted it made. After ""Dune"", Lynch swore he would never concede artistic control over a film again. Let's hope Raimi has similarly learned his lesson. ""For Love of the Game"" is definitely the low point in Raimi's directorial career.<br/><br/>As a sports movie, this one never really takes the bat off its shoulder as it goes down on called strikes. On the other hand, the gooey romance that constitutes half the film may lend it some redeeming utility as a date movie for those who are tired of only getting to first or second base and want to finally hit a home run. Rating: 3/10."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","3","8 April 2000"," utterly tedious romance film
","Getting ready to watch a Kevin Costner movie is like preparing for a siege: one needs to stock up on a hefty assortment of supplies because, if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's that we are in for a very long haul. Actually, as Costner movies go, this 138-minute film is relatively short - though its glacial pacing makes it seem eternal anyway.  For sheer, unadulterated tedium, this movie is, at the very least, a match for Costner's previous romantic opus, ""Message in a Bottle.""<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi, ""For Love of the Game"" seems like a film caught in a movie genre limbo.  Half reverential baseball movie and half sappy romance, it seems catered to satisfy two widely disparate audiences that wouldn't be caught dead standing in the same line at the local cineplex.  Perhaps, this is a pitch to come up with the perfect date movie (though ""Titanic"" beat them to it - romance for the ladies, sinking ship and mass death for the boys).<br/><br/>Costner, in another of his near-catatonic performances, portrays Billy Chapel, a 40-year old, soon to be over-the-hill pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who, in a single day, learns that his team has been sold, he is about to be traded to the Giants and his girlfriend of five years is leaving right that very moment to start a new career in London.  This set-up might have resulted in an incisive study of a man caught in an age-limited career learning to cope with the inevitable trauma of saying farewell and moving on.  Instead, the writers settle for a stale movie romance, with Chapel standing on the mound, pitching his final game and flashing back like mad to the happier days of ballfield triumphs and blossoming true love.  The film is ostensibly concerned with Chapel's success on the diamond but he soon learns that even pitching a historical no-hitter and being carried around in triumph on the shoulders of adoring team members and diehard admirers is mere ashes without that one true love to share it with.  The screenplay, in fact, is so heavily weighted in the direction of the affair he is having with Jane (Kelly Preston) that baseball fans are sure to feel slighted - until the very end.<br/><br/>Even in the ballpark, though, the film is a failure.  Why do so many movies, including this one, treat baseball as some sort of holy rite, some sacred mission replete with corny imagery, nauseating pep talks and cliched, slow motion views of tear-soaked faces amid the euphoric masses?  The detrimental effect of ""Field of Dreams"" cannot be overestimated.  Just once couldn't we see a film that treats the sport for what it is - a fun pastime, completely devoid of sentimentality?  <br/><br/>I will say one thing for this movie though:  in comparison to itself, it does make baseball look like a fastpaced sport!"
"baumer","5","1","3","10 October 1999"," A good baseball movie, a subpar romance
","Baseball always seems to be a little more mystical than the other American sports, a little more religious than football, hockey and basketball, to Americans that is.  A great baseball player is referred to almost religiously.  Pitchers are like Moses, and comparisons to them pitching a great game are often spoke of in the same way that religion speaks of parting the red sea.  For Love of the Game is like that.  There are so many ""heroes are us"" comments about making the sun shine one more time on some guys's storied career and blah blah blah, that it made me want to puke.  But then again, baseball and even sports in general, makes me want to puke sometimes.  Overpaid crybabies that go on the injured list because of a hangnail or a stiff eyelash are not what I would call role models.  Having said that, For Love of the Game was an enjoyable film and I was actually rooting for Costner's character ( his name is Chapel, see what I mean about the God complex baseball has? ) to pitch his no hitter even though I knew at the beginning of the film that he probably would.  But what I didn't enjoy was the romance between the two players.  Kelly Preston is a hottie and I really enjoyed her in her teen roles like Secret Admirer and Mischief, and even in her sexy adult roles like Twins and Jerry Maguire.  But I did not enjoy her in here as she was an annoying, indecisive, winy crybaby.  Let me see here, what is not to like about a guy that seems to be totally head over heals in love with you, is ridiculously rich and gets along with your daughter?  Nothing, and that was the problem with the film.  I didn't buy the dilemma that she seemed to concoct for herself.  The baseball part was hokey but fun but the romance was forced and silly.  This is one film that I'm glad that I saw before it left the theater but I will never be inspired to watch again.  I do give it a 7/10 and I also recommend that if you decide to see this it should be in the theater, it works better that way, but if you miss it, don't worry too much about it, there are better films out there."

If I was a filthy rich actor, I might just do the same thing. Dress up in a Yankee uniform and live out a childhood fantasy. But I wouldn't film it, and then palm it off as a motion picture. Im being extremely hard on a film that is technically ok. The storyline is a sappy overworked one but not too badly written, the acting so so, and the attempt at realism above average. Licensing fees were shelled out to use actual major league clubs and stadiums and even announcers, and the camera work almost convinces you that Costner is out there pitching. So what am i complaining about? It comes down to the self indulgence of Mr. Costner whom Ive never met but have to suppose owns the largest ego ever to be captured on film. I don't see a baseball movie, I see a horrible actor getting off on watching himself pitch against the Yankees. By the way, that's another unforgivable part of this move. the anti Yankee, and anti New York sentiment that runs throughout as subtle as a tornado weather alert crawl on the bottom of the screen.

"dfranzen70","5","1","3","11 April 2000"," Ah, spring - when a boy's fancy turns to bad baseball movies...
","Kevin Costner has been down the baseball-movie road twice before, with Field of Dreams and Bull Durham. His latest foray, For Love of the Game, doesn't quite approach the magnitude of those two; it's kind of a mixed bag. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a 40-year-old baseball pitcher at the end of a brilliant career. His team, the Detroit Tigers, has just been sold to corporate investors, and the old owner thinks it's time for Billy to call it a career. There's only one game left in what's been a miserable season for Detroit, against the dangerous New York Yankees, who can clinch their division with a victory. Chapel's on the mound of course, making what might be his final major league appearance. While Chapel pitches his game, scenes depicting his life up to that moment - specifically his relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine writer. Jane's beautiful and headstrong, but she and Billy have a love-hate relationship, since he is unable to love her more than the game of baseball. While Billy struggles on the mound, we see how their relationship develops, and the struggles he feels while pitching starkly mirror the tribulations of their relationship.   This is not an unflawed production, however. For one thing, Costner has been rumored for years to only cast women in his films who are either less-talented than he is (no mean feat!) or who are less overstated; in other words, actresses who may steal the film from him need not apply. Kelly Preston falls into the former of these two categories. There is no single scene in which Preston's Jane offers anything sincerity. I kept getting the feeling that he was acting - ok, I know, she IS acting, but it's not supposed to look like it! Preston's not terrible, but she would have looked a lot better if her male lead had been a little more commanding in his performance. The book on Costner for years has said that he's an actor who continuously underplays his roles. There isn't much expression on his face - which is getting more wrinkly by the second, it appears - has he ever heard of Retin-A? - and his emotions are about as deep as a shot glass. Maybe with a better actor, the overall affect of the movie would have been more pronounced. As it is, the movie's a little lackadasical. That said, the directing itself is masterful; Sam Raimi (known mostly for his Evil Dead movies!) shows off his talent in his most mainstream movie to date, and he is much more of an asset than Costner. So what else is wrong with it? Well, the film is manipulative to a degree - although if you allow yourself to be manipulated, I guess you're just as much to blame. I myself am proud to be manipulated! I say, ""Manipulate me, O Lords of Cinema!"" Even so, I felt a creeping feeling that my emotions were being toyed with. Did I really give a damn about these characters? Not when I saw how they behaved. Also, the score was a little presumptuous and overbearing. But that's just nitpicking."
"mercuryix","Null","1","4","19 June 2000"," For Love of the Lame
","Spoilers Ahead:<br/><br/>If I had to choose between watching For Love of the Game or the Postman twice in a row, there would be no contest. At least the Postman had characters you can empathize with and dialogue from this planet.  Costner plays a highly-successful 40 year-old pitcher whose team owner tells him his team has been sold and Costner has been traded to the Giants.  This first scene is played with intense melancholy, as if the audience is expected to have empathy for him; it's hard to forget the fact that his character is a highly successful lifetime pitcher for a major league baseball team (how much $$ does a lead pitcher make over the years?), and who has had a career most would envy.  I wanted to go ""AAwwwwwww!"" in the theater.  I wondered how many single parents on welfare would have felt sorry for the lug. Kevin's 20-something girlfriend dumps him over the phone, but in the next two scenes he befriends another 20-something, an attractive if angry woman whose car won't start on the side of the road, and without saying much more than ""aw, shucks- want to go to a baseball game?""  has changed her from yelling ""go away"",  to sleeping with him in the next few scenes.  She makes a speech about respecting each other's space, then surprises him in his apartment later, only to be surprised to discover he's been sleeping with his personal masseuse (guess when you're the pitcher it comes with the massage), another 20-something perfect 10 who is more attractive than the love interest.  I swear, there must be something about turning 40 that turns men into babe magnets among the under-30 crowd.  If Costner was portraying a magnetic type of Casanova we could understand, but he is played like a manniquin.  Again, Kevin is given a huge closeup in slow motion as we are expected to feel sorry for a millionaire who gets laid every 30 seconds. This would be tolerable if there was a plot, but there isn't one that I can discern and the dialogue is so incredulous you wonder if the writers care if the audience is actually listening.  ""You want to come to a baseball game? A game. Do-you-want-to-come-to-a-game...with me."",  No, I want to throw a baseball at Kevin for saying these lines, and sue the ""writer"" for mental cruelty.  <br/><br/>I don't know what happens after Kevin is sent on an errand to retrieve his girlfriends errant rebellious teenager daughter from a bad party; I walked out at that point.  I hear that some baseball actually occurs later in the movie, some well-choreographed scenes in fact.  If the movie had started with this and been about this, it would have been an enjoyable, if not deep, movie. As it is, it's completely contrived with random ""plot twists"" thrown in without rhyme or reason;  Two more relevant titles for this movie would be ""For the Love of Money"" (explaining why it was made), or ""For the Love of Costner"".  Costner fans won't be dissappointed or care about the plot, as the closeups of Costner are slow and sweet. To us guys, they are slow and sickening.  I didn't intend to be this vitriolic about an actor who has done mostly great work.  I have to wonder what Costner really thought of it?   <br/><br/>

","Great story line and acting. I like how the movie describes the realism of a major league pitcher: a fundamentally- fantastic player but with a far-from-perfect record. I like how the movie climactically wraps his career up after all the ups and downs he's been through with a potentially perfect game to show the world who he is. I would've rated this a 7 (a rating for a solid movie) if it wasn't for the following conversation Billy has with Jane. Jane: ""So, how does this work? When you're AWAY, I do MY own thing and YOU do YOURS? What I do has nothing to do with what YOU do and vice versa? And none of this 'Why didn't you call me?' crap?"" Billy: ""You said that perfectly."" Then when they're away from each other, he becomes interested in having his masseuse over to hang out, Jane suddenly shows up and flips out, and he goes, ""Well what about the deal?"" Jane: ""What deal??"" Billy: ""Ya know, you do what you do, I do what I do."" Jane: ""You believe that??"" She and the audience knew exactly what he's talking about because we're all watching the movie. Whether it's right or wrong is beside the point; she shouldn't have had that reaction, making him explain it, because we all know what he's talking about. A better dialogue would be to omit that and just go right to her coming back with, ""You believe that??"""

","For a lot of Americans baseball is life affirming. There are even people out there--and at times I confess that I am one of them--who go to high school baseball games just because watching a game where the outcome doesn't matter to you is even more relaxing than watching a game you actually care about.<br/><br/>To some people it might be strange, but to others, hey, it's baseball and there is really no better way to spend an afternoon is there?<br/><br/>Some Americans understand it to be an addiction. Even now, as I write this, if I look out my apartment window I can see the softball diamond that played a key role in why I chose this cramped little hovel over so many other options. In the summer, when I get off of work, I can play a game of Frogger and risk my life crossing a busy street to see a game.<br/><br/>So when a movie about baseball comes out, no matter how good or bad it is, we feel compelled to go and see it.<br/><br/>And there a pluses and minuses. This film came out in September. There should be a law requiring all baseball movies to come out in the winter, in those long months between the crushing defeat of the Cub's last lose and the new spring hope that this year the curse might be broken.<br/><br/>As they say in Boston, ""good luck to you and your team.""<br/><br/>But then, it was just broken wasn't it? The end is nigh and Chicago is still here. I thought for sure that it would be destroyed in a riot worse than anything soccer has ever produced.<br/><br/>But that is another story.<br/><br/>The fact is that there are good and bad baseball movies.<br/><br/>Most of the good ones star Kevin Costner don't they?<br/><br/>Bull Durham<br/><br/>Field of Dreams<br/><br/>For the Love of the Game<br/><br/>The Sandlot (which didn't star Costner)<br/><br/>The title really explains everything you need to know about it. It's a movie made for people that love baseball. One about a perfect game.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that it is a movie about baseball and though it isn't as good as ""Bull Durham"" it is still about baseball. If you love it you love it. If you don't, well, it's still a good movie, but not as life affirming, not as wonderful, not as beautiful, not as...well, not as summer."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to For Love Of The Game.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Before an unimportant last game of the season, Billy Chapel (KC) a 40-year-old pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, is having a bad morning. He wakes up with a hangover and learns (a) the owner is selling the team, (b) he's being traded, and (c) his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is leaving him. As he pitches the game he thinks back on his relationship with Jane. <br/><br/>This is two movies, it's a rubbish love story, with a good baseball movie trying to get out. I love all the baseball aspects of this movie. Everything is spot on, especially when KC zones out the crowd. But the love story leaves me cold, KC has next to zero chemistry with Kelly Preston. Both have been much better, with other actors in different movies, and they had better chemistry with other actors in the movie. As for their characters he is grumpy and self obsessed and she is moody and insecure, and to make it worse, both are selfish, and are pretty unlikeable at times.<br/><br/>I still get chills when Chapel realises what he is about to achieve, and he admits to his catcher, he didn't think he had anything left, and I feel a lot of pleasure in seeing Chapel get ""more than a little help from his friends"". <br/><br/>For a sports movie, it's surprisingly different, Chapel is not an under dog, he is a great athlete, who has had a wonderful career, who just happens to be in the twilight of his career and the game being played is ""a throw away, that means nothing"" as described by John C Reilly (who may just be my favourite character in the full movie) as catcher Gus Sinski. As for the rest of the supporting cast Jenna Malone is OK, whilst JK Simmons and Brian Cox also offers solid support as the teams coach. <br/><br/>Before watching it today I would have rated this 9/10, but now it's reduced to an 8/10"

","I would have to say that I have seen very few sport movies better than For Love of the Game. This is a feel good movie. It was light drama and it was extremely well done. You can clearly see that every one who has worked on this film, had real passion for their job, the story and the overall quality of the film<br/><br/>Costner portrayed an aging baseball player with a romantic attachment to the game. The symbolism of the movie was the notion of ending a romance for the game and transferring that romance to a woman. For him, at least, there was room for only one at a time. And, fortunately for her, his career was at the very end. Fortunately for us, we got to see his last game interspersed with flashbacks.<br/><br/>The movie was brilliantly done with respect to the actual game of baseball. I cannot recall having seen a sports movie that did such an excellent job of maintaining accuracy about the game. I honestly could have believed I was watching an actual game. The plays were realistic. The situations realistic. And, Vin Scully was sensational doing the play by play.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for any Baseball, sports fan or general movie goers. Trust me when i say this, but you will not be disappointed."
"chadlund","3","0","1","19 April 2016"," A valiant performance by Costner for a forgettable movie
","****************** ATTENTION SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***********************<br/><br/>The movie is supposedly a baseball movie and simultaneously a romance. The lone protagonists are Costner and Preaston, but the movie is actually exclusively centered around Costner. Which could be criticized for poor character development, but at the same time, besides Costner, the rest of the cast delivers meaningless contributions. Well first because the story is cheesy, much too clichè, to the point where you can actually fill in the lines because you know anticipate the dialogue. Then, the movie is really bailing water: it's not a sports movie, it's a bad romance because the relationship is not believable, it's only centered around Costner's flashbacks in the middle of a game. Wow, seriously ? And he manages fine until his hand and his shoulder give up, which for x & y reasons, is weird. In reality he would take a PCR shot but it would not enable him to throw so consistently well at his age. <br/><br/>Costner is a chameleon, and I get that he did this movie to cover up for his divorce lawsuit. But this script is too uninspired and incoherent for him to lift it up to a decent level. The whole green eyed blond mom at 16 with a job that seems to pay well yet her job is not clear, since she is part time but doesn't have her own car, the sudden interaction between her daughter and Costner out of nowhere, the goofy Sunuski who keeps calling Costner 'chappy' (so overdone), the manager who steps down to a player's orders, the owner who sells the team because he doesn't believe in baseball which actually would be because the team stinks fails to reach the playoffs and it leads to bankruptcy, there are so many elements that make it unwatchable. It takes a lot of poise not get irritated by them."

","For Love of the Game (1999): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly, Brian Cox, Jena Malone: Drama about loving something enough to give it up. It regards a man searching for where he wants to be and where he should be. It regards decisions and regrets and stars Kevin Costner as a baseball pitcher of nineteen years who may be pitching his final game due to an arm injury. His mind is on his girlfriend who is leaving for Europe for a better job position. Costner reflects upon their relationship through the entire game. Predictable with some unnecessary elements. Despite clichés the baseball footage is fantastic with director Sam Raimi pulling off suspense with regards to the fate of the leads. This is an interesting departure for a director known for creating the Evil Dead movies. Costner's wrestles through frustration for what matters most. He is in position to give up one love for the greater gain of another. Kelly Preston is well cast as his girlfriend whom he first encounters having car trouble. While the leads pull through, the supporting roles are typical and flat mainly placed for cliché moments. Among them are John C. Reilly and Brian Cox who can do better but get reduced to under written roles that take second fiddle to the leads. With that one complaint aside this contains strong themes regarding love for what matters most. Score: 8 / 10"

","Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a worn-out 40 year old former ace pitcher for The Detroit Tigers. He's given the start of last game of a disastrous season against the Yankees in NYC. The Yankees are looking to clinch the East with a win. Tigers' owner Gary Wheeler (Brian Cox) has just sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy to the Giants. His best friend is his catcher Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly). His girlfriend Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) tells him that she is taking a job in London. He has the best game in awhile pitching a perfect game. The movie flashes back and forth from the present to his life courting Jane and reconnecting with his daughter Heather (Jena Malone).<br/><br/>The movie tries so hard with every baseball cliché. It doesn't add anything original that other Costner movies and The Natural doesn't already have put out. Every pitch is striving for sentimentality. The baseball stuff builds to a pretty compelling ninth inning. That's kind of what happens in a real baseball game. The bigger problem is that the romance is as bland as it gets. The romance lacks any bite or surprises. It's the least compelling thing in the movie. At least the baseball stuff works a little even if it is cliché."

","I've gotta give this 5 stars because I liked it just as much as I did when I saw it (way) back in 99. It's stood up well. Kevin Costner is excellent as ageing Detroit Tigers pitcher 'Billy Chapel' and looks just like one of the pro's out on the field.<br/><br/>Told for the most part through flashbacks, this starts at the end and then goes back, as Billy ""clear's the mechanism"" and begins pitching in what could potentially be his last game, as his team has just been sold and the new owners have plans to trade him. Throughout this game he reflects on his life, 18yr career and on-again-off-again relationship with 'Jane' (Kelly Preston) which has also reached a impasse. For the most part this is baseball movie and it gets super exciting as Billy unknowingly nears a perfect game, debates retirement and Jane winds her way through the airport on her way to England.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the critics ever thought of this but I thought it was fantastic; great story, told in a clever way, sweet well portrayed romance and just a classic sports movie.

","'For Love of the Game' combines two stories: One I had a genuine interest in and the other a tired wheezy old genre piece that I've seen a million times. Sad thing is, it's the latter that eventually takes over completely.<br/><br/>The movie stars Kevin Costner (who until now had never been in a bad sports movie) as Billy Chapel, a 40 year-old pitcher who's game has seen better days. He's close to retirement and as the movie opens he has set an elegant dinner for his girlfriend who never shows. Even worse (and these things just conveniently happen on the same day) he has been traded and the team has been sold.<br/><br/>I might have been genuinely interested in the story of an over-the-hill pitcher and his struggle to hold onto the talent that he once had and that alone is what drew me to the movie. But director Sam Raimi hammers together a tired old love story complete with all the nuts and bolts that no bad love story is ever without.<br/><br/>There is the obligatory scene in which the two meet-cute in an unusual place (by the roadside when her car breaks down). She doesn't know who he is and knows virtually nothing about baseball (would it be too much to ask the screenwriters if the hero could fall for a sports nut?). The fall madly in love before she loses confidence in him and a huge misunderstanding leads to one of those big emotional scenes in which it looks like she will leave him forever to take a job overseas. Does she? I guarantee that you have seen this movie before and know the outcome.<br/><br/>The movie is a surprise to me. Costner has starred in plenty of bad movies but until this movie he has never starred in a bad sports movie especially baseball after gems like 'Bull Durham' and 'Field of Dreams'. He's made his mark as box office poison in the sci-fi genre but I hope this doesn't mean that that reputation is moving over to the sports movie arena.<br/><br/>I'm also surprised that this movie comes from Sam Raimi. In 1998 he made the hard-edged 'A Simple Plan', the story of three men who find $4,000,000 in a plane crash and struggle to keep it a secret which leads to distrust and tragedy. That movie was about human nature and never for once did we anticipate where it was going.<br/><br/>There are two scenes in 'For Love of the Game' in which Costner is on the mound and is able to block out everything around him by 'Focusing on the mechanism'. Perhaps that logic should have been applied to the screenplay."

Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio...some pretty great players-people plus too many more to name here. As a female, I would never be allowed to play in the majors so must do it vicariously. Billy Chapel allowed me to do just that. As I watched the movie I was on the mound, in Billy's head, It was I who stared down at the batter and said ""it's between you and me, ugly"". I found the relationship part of the story believable and worth watching. I love all of Kevin's baseball movies and really enjoy Kelly Preston (What a Girl Wants is one of my favorites) I keep hoping it will be released on Bluray.

Preoccupied with both these facts and an ailing shoulder, Costner doesn't realize he's playing the game of his life...<br/><br/>Costner and director Sam Raimi do very well with the sports-related segments, as excitement builds during the proverbial big game.

We expect the flashbacks to cover Costner's life, yet the focus is on his relatively recent love story; we're left wondering what he was doing the rest of his life.

"s_kc","8","0","1","19 April 2012"," For the love of a good movie, watch this one!
","First of, let me say that I don't understand how most people rate a movie. Not that they are doing it wrong or anything like that - it's just that I seem to think different than most people on such things and this movie brings it out so perfectly. 6.2 avg rating? I rate it 8 to 8.5 at least. To my mind, it's in the same league as Casablanca. No, it doesn't have the same noirish feel, it isn't set in the background of a war (atleast not in the conventional sense) and it certainly isn't a life or death situation. And yet...<br/><br/>It's also not a movie with your typical cliché headline - no one will write phrases like ""their life changes for ever"" or ""a coming of age story"" etc. about this one.<br/><br/>What it is, to my mind, is story of one man, Billy Chapel, living in the limelight as it's fading and his war with time and with his own emotions. We all fight this war sometime (I'm on the wrong side of 40 myself); most times it's mainly in our heads with occasional interludes by people near & dear, but there's generally no audience (which is a good thing). If you happen to live in the limelight at such a time, you unfortunately have to fight on two fronts, a public one and a private one. This movie walks us through one such war and it's poignant and heart-warming mainly 'cause Kevin Costner plays it with such understated vulnerability that you root for the character even when he appears a bit clueless.<br/><br/>Not the world's greatest movie, no special effects, no nothing other than simple human emotions. But that holds up well thru the 2.5hrs making it a wonderful watch. What could be better than that? Of course the end of the game was a bit too theatrical, but hey! even the movie guys are human, right?"
"Bravesfan17","8","0","1","9 January 2012"," What goes on in a pitcher's mind as he is in the game?
","Sam Raimi, who is probably most famous for the Spider-Man films and the Evil Dead films, shows that he can do more than action and horror films with the baseball drama For Love of the Game. He proves that he is a good storyteller.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner stars as Billy Chapel, a pitcher in the nineteenth season of his career, all of it spent with the Detroit Tigers. He is in New York to play the Yankees in a series in what may be the last game of his career.<br/><br/>As he is playing at Yankee Stadium, at many times on and off the pitcher's mound, Chapel flashes back to many moments in his past. The majority of these flashbacks involve Jane Aubrey, Chapel's on-again and off-again girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston. She is a magazine writer who gets offered a job in London. Unfortunately for Billy, her plane leaves for London during his game.<br/><br/>The best parts of this story is the mix of the current game Billy is in and the flashbacks he has. Not sure what he has ahead of him, he is making history with this game against the Yankees.<br/><br/>Costner gives a rich performance as Billy Chapel. To me, his character as a baseball player makes me think of pitchers like Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Randy Johnson, and Pedro Martinez, all of who I watched pitch when I was a kid. When he is not playing, he does great at taking his memories and later using them in the game. The biggest part of Costner's performance is on thinking about if he should try to keep playing, hanging up his cleats, or go after the woman he loves.<br/><br/>Preston also gives a great performance here as Aubrey. She does a good job of showing Jane as an independent woman, yet also trying to keep a stable relationship with Billy when they are dating. It may seem like the typical girlfriend role, but she is there to support him at his low points and high points of his career.<br/><br/>Also giving a great supporting turn in this film is John C. Reilly as Billy's catcher, Gus Sinski. Both on and off the field, Gus is always looking after Billy, and saying that he's got his back. On what seems like a small role, Reilly knocks it out of the park at being the guy Billy can always turn to, even when he's drunk.<br/><br/>If you enjoy baseball films, this is well worth it. I like to think of this, Field of Dreams, and Bull Durham as a trilogy, even though the only things they have in common are that they are baseball films starring Kevin Costner. If you are not a baseball fan, you should still check this out because it is more than a baseball film."
"pjfuller","8","0","1","12 September 2011"," Good flick - needs a few changes
","A couple of quick points. First, John C. O'Reilly was really, REALLY miscast in this movie, There's no way he should have been cast, but he played the character as a sentimental sap....most catchers are hard-ass, get-it-done now guys who know the game well - but not overly sentimental. This really affected the baseball aspect of the movie. Second...the trade to the Giants. The trading deadline is done by this time of the year, and the waiver-wire deals are also done, so there's no way he'd be traded - especially to name the team he'd be traded to. That's a call for the GM. A better plot line would to be that the new owners want to commit to a youth movement and will move Chapel in the off-season for a prospect or two...but either way, he's done in Detroit. But Costner & baseball are a good fit - bad fitting uni's and all..."

","This movie was on AMC this morning. At the time it played in theaters, most critics called it dull and predictable, but as a baseball fan and a fan of good movies, ""For Love of the Game"" should get credit for emotional performances from Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston and an engaging, well-structured storyline.<br/><br/>A movie that combines baseball and romance has two strikes against it before it steps up into the batter's box because there have been so many middling or downright poor baseball movies made. ""For Love of the Game"" stands out because it is about love, sacrifice and commitment first and baseball second.<br/><br/>The relationship between Billy and Jane is believable. During a flashback she goes to a game to see him and sits with all the player's wives. When one of them asks her ""Who are you with?"" and she tells them, a few of them snicker to themselves, one remarking ""Blond of the week."" And Jane tells Billy later that she doesn't want to be a groupie. Billy works hard to convince her that he really loves her.<br/><br/>The baseball action is 95% accurate and realistic, including the scene where an outfielder takes one off the head and it goes into the stands (and how he atones later). Congratulations to the producers on coaxing Vin Scully into doing the play-by-play, though purists may scratch their heads and say ""Huh? He's a Dodger's announcer."" The angles for the action look great, as well as the gorgeous emerald checkerboard field.<br/><br/>To be nit-picky, some of Kevin Costner's pitches looked like lob jobs that would get crushed by even an A league rookie. Mostly, through deft editing and camera work though, he looked like a major league pitcher. And it would have been nice to have had a few more shots of him in his home whites pitching in grand old Tiger's Stadium (which was still standing when the movie was made).<br/><br/>In all, ""Game"" is a worthwhile movie that might wring a tear or two with its emotional story and all the excellent acting. Supporting players John C. Reilly (as a personal catcher) and Jena Malone as Jane's daughter stand out also."

"tjphelan-970-439195","9","0","1","6 February 2011"," One of the Most Intriguing Movies I've Ever Seen
","When I first saw this movie I probably would have given it a rating of 5-6 at best . . . maybe a 4-5 on merit, plus an additional 1/2 point for some great musical scores and another 1/2 point for sentimental value to this baseball fan.<br/><br/>It wasn't until my third viewing of this movie that I realized how extraordinary it really is, and yet I can understand why so many critics and viewers have panned it. So many of the metaphors and so much of the symbolism of the movie are so subtle that they are easy to overlook. It's not until they are put in the context of the entire movie (especially the flashback scenes) that the masterful weaving of the characters and different story lines becomes clear. This is a baseball game woven into a love story, but it is a baseball movie nonetheless . . . and by that measure it stands on its own as the best of all time -- without the supernatural elements of ""Field of Dreams"" and the aspects of ""The Natural"" that push the limits of credulity.<br/><br/>The 8th inning scene -- from start to finish -- is one of the best you'll see in any movie. As the lights flicker on at Yankee Stadium, the camera shows the setting sun off in the distance over the left-field upper deck, then pans back to a wider angle that includes a view into Yankee Stadium from beyond right-centerfield. This is one of those elements of this movie that keeps the viewer focused on a real baseball game in a real place, being played in the midst of all the parallel story lines of the movie. This scene was probably filmed from the Bronx County Courthouse, a building whose upper floors peek into Yankee Stadium from a few blocks east on 161st Street (this building can be seen occasionally during the movie looming beyond the Diamond Vision screen and the giant Budweiser advertisement in right-centerfield).<br/><br/>The scene is beautiful on its own, but the symbolism brings a whole other dimension to it. The skyline in the background in front of the setting sun is in northern Manhattan across the Harlem River. Even many die-hard baseball fans may not know that the group of similar-looking brick buildings closest to the stadium across the river are the tenements that were built on the former site of the old Polo Grounds where the New York Giants baseball team had played before moving to San Francisco in 1958. The metaphors in this short scene may have been unintended, but they're amazing to me . . . the sun setting on a glorious fall day, on the late innings of a historic baseball game, and on the career of a great pitcher whose personal life is facing a wrecking ball just like those old Polo Grounds. Time moves on and changes all, and among all of the characters in this movie only the sun and the great game of baseball will endure.<br/><br/>By the third time I had seen the movie, I decided that the portion of the 8th inning from the 3-1 count on Davis Birch through the last out of the inning was one of the most remarkable segments of any movie I've ever seen. The climactic at-bat of Davis Birch, the majestic musical scores, the heroic efforts of hard-luck rightfielder Mickey Hart, and Jane Aubrey's decisive ""moment of truth"" in JFK International Airport are all woven together perfectly over several minutes. Vin Scully's play-by-play during this scene came across as background noise of sorts the first time I saw the movie, but after listening closely I realized that he would be a major character in this movie even if his face were never seen. The timing of his play-by-play and the content of his broadcast at the moment of Jane Aubrey's decision in the airport -- and their influence on her decision -- were subtle and brilliant.<br/><br/>The work of director Sam Raimi and the rest of the crew may be overlooked by many viewers, but what should come across as the defining characteristic of the movie is that it is filmed as a REAL game, with so many elements that are easily taken for granted in an age of high-tech filmmaking. The interspersing of ""live"" baseball scenes with the more grainy TV and Diamond Vision views gave these scenes an aura of credibility that is missing from most sports-themed movies, and characters like Vin Scully, legendary Yankee Stadium announcer Bob Sheppard, the obnoxious but somehow likable Yankee fans, and even Yankee Stadium itself, all played key roles in this movie. The film would have been substantially diminished without these characters, and could never have been filmed anywhere but ""the great ball yard in the South Bronx.""<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, and I think anyone who HAS seen it should see it again with a more attentive view of some of the very subtle elements that make it extraordinary."

The chemistry between Costner and Preston is remarkable, she outshone him considerably... but he more than held his own. If you watch the movie with a mentality to look for the flaws, you will definitely find them... but if you choose to truly experience it through the main character's eyes... you will be laughing, crying and applauding when it is all said and done.

"jehaccess6","10","0","1","4 May 2008"," Effective Hybrid of Chick Flick / Sportsmovie
","I really began to resonate when the beautiful Basil Poledoris score opened this film. The man is a musical genius, in my humble opinion. He can make a real turkey of a film into a much more enjoyable experience. In this case, he only enhanced an already great film.<br/><br/>I approached this film with low expectations. After 'Water World', 'The Postman', and the perfectly dreadful 'Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves', I wondered how Kevin Costner could appear before the camera with a straight face. Fortunatly, he found the perfect script, supporting players, and director to redeem his career.<br/><br/>'Billy Chapel', Kevin's character, is totally absorbed in his career as a professional Baseball pitcher. Billy has excelled at Baseball all his life. Unfortunately, he has mostly failed as a human being. Here is a man nearing 40 years old who has never established a stable relationship with any woman. He has been content to trade on his fame and wealth to enjoy the party scene whenever the loneliness of his existence threatens to enter his awareness. Somehow, the example of his father and mother having a loving and stable marriage never seems to penetrate his awareness as a desirable state for himself.<br/><br/>We see that the closest relationships 'Billy' has are with his team mates 'Gus Sinski', 'Davis Birch', and the owner of his Baseball Team. Billy feels such loyalty to his team that he passes up more lucrative opportunities with other teams to remain a Detroit Tiger. When 'Davis Birch' succumbs to the lure of a higher salary with the hated rival New York Yankees, Billy feels great anguish at the loss of a friendship of a man who will now become a rival player.<br/><br/>Sadly, the Detroit Tiger franchise is saddled with less than stellar players. The owner is unable to compete financially with the richer teams to hold onto his better players. Billy's buddy, 'Gus Sinski', is probably playing his last season. He is hitting too poorly and runs too slowly to keep his position on the team. Only Billy's intervention with the manager is able to keep 'Gus' on the starting lineup for the last game of the season. The owner of the team realizes that the only way the Tigers will become competitive is to sell the team to a corporate enterprise with pockets deep enough to pay competitive player salaries.<br/><br/>Kelly Preston played a magnificent role as 'Jane Aubrey'. Here is a woman of obviously humble roots who has clawed her way into the fringes of the high fashion world. She starts out as a pregnant girl of 16 abandoned by the boy who fathered her child. Somehow she has been able to build a career and a home for her child. But mother and daughter both still long for a relationship with the right man to complete their lives. There is no mention of 'Jane' having any parents or siblings, so that part of her life is left blank in the film.<br/><br/>'Jane' meets 'Billy' when he stops to offer help when her car breaks down on an expressway while she is starting out of town on a vacation. She resists his help at first, but he persists and invites her to attend a baseball game as his guest. 'Jane' is deeply attracted to 'Billy' and winds up sleeping with him on the first date. 'Jane' agrees to meet 'Billy' on his next trip to New York, but is deeply conflicted about the relationship. 'Billy' and 'Jane' continue to meet whenever his team is playing in New York.<br/><br/>There is no mention of 'Jane's' daughter 'Heather' until late in the film. 'Heather' had a more prominent role in deleted scenes that would have made more sense being retained in the film. How 'Jane' could be going on a vacation in her car without 'Heather' is difficult to understand. 'Jane' visits 'Billy' in Florida training camp, again without 'Heather'.<br/><br/>'Jane' and 'Billy' fall out after she encounters him with another woman in his apartment at training camp. 'Jane' finally contacts 'Billy' in desperation after 'Heather' runs away from home after a fight with 'Jane'. 'Billy' looks up 'Heather' in Boston and brings her home to her mother in New York. ""Billy' and 'Jane' reconcile and 'Billy' starts to develop a real affection and relationship with 'Heather'.<br/><br/>I watched the film in disbelief at the stupidity and insensitivity of 'Billy Chapel'. On the few occasions when he actually took the time to connect emotionally with 'Jane' her face showed such angelic love and devotion, any fool would have worked like crazy to keep the magic alive. Instead he often stepped on her heart in his self-centered way. 'Billy' had to hit rock bottom emotionally before he would face the fact that he needed a woman's love to fill his empty heart. Why any woman would retain any desire to stay around after being hurt so often is hard to understand.<br/><br/>The baseball portion of the film is very beautiful. We see how 'Billy' and his team of second-raters rise to the occasion to play the perfect game. These players on a team with a losing season determine that they will go out on a blaze of glory. On sheer willpower they frustrate the godlike Yankees in their quest to clinch victory in their division. The Yankees will have one more opportunity and will no doubt claim the prize. A heart warming scene in the film was when the rabid Yankee fans were forced to acknowledge the magnificent accomplishment of the Tigers in defeating their team. They knew that the ultimate victory would soon be theirs anyway.<br/><br/>I suppose I love this film because it shows the power of the human spirit and that there is hope for even the most stunted personality to grow to maturity and find happiness."

","Eighteen-year veteran major league pitcher Billy Chapel(Kevin Coaster,big surprise)has played for--and only for--the Detroit Tigers. He is in the twilight of his career and facing the very real prospect of either being traded(something he is dead-set against)or forced retirement(something he wants to forestall as long as possible).His last start of the season is against the storied and hated New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium,and as he faces a hostile crowd and a formidable opponent,Billy proceeds to pitch the game of his life:namely,a perfect game(for non-baseball fans:no hits,no walks,no runners.Nada). With only his catcher and friend Gus(the always strong John C.Reilly)and his sturdy,grumpy manager(J.K.Simmons)as his confidants,he weathers this storm alone with his thoughts.<br/><br/>His thoughts bring him to review his most recent relationship with a pretty divorcée(Kelly Preston)who doesn't follow baseball and her painfully normal daughter(Jena Malone). At this juncture,they're at a bit of a break,and there's no telling if they'll be a couple again.<br/><br/>Directed by(of all people)horror/action movie wiz Sam Raimi,For Love of the Game teetered dangerously close to being a sappy love story OR a overly sentimental Baseball movie,but it manages to avoid either if but barely. The rhythm of this film impressed me the most:with each laborious inning of pitching,you the viewer are walked through the event as if you were out there on the mound with Costner's character. I've grown past weary with Costner's career over the fifteen-plus years since he won the Oscar for DAnces With Wolves,and whenever he tries to stretch past being the handsome jock-turned-hero-next door,it can be any degree of painful/laughable to watch(try Waterworld,The War or Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves for examples). But here,he's perfect as the beaten but proud athlete,and the parallels between his game,his career,and his life in general(particularly his love life)are well plotted,which may be as much a credit to screenwriter Dana Stevens and(in part)the novel by Michael Sharaa as it is the actors and directors.This movie requires some patience,but when given,this will more than likely draw the viewer in."

","I really liked Kelly Preston's role in this, it's the first time I've seen her perform. She played off Costner very naturally. She does wonderful things with her face. KC's character was less understated than usual, with a sensitive portrayal of emotion. The supporting cast was great, especially J. K. Simmons as the Tiger's manager. The flashbacks worked well as a plot device, and provided good character development.<br/><br/>In my opinion this was a better love story than a baseball story. The ""Yankees"" were boorrring (though not the stadium). They could have been written into the plot enough to make them real people. Somehow KC doesn't look like a pitcher to me, although he threw plenty of great pitches, and made some good plays. He was a little too buttoned down.<br/><br/>For overall thematic excellence, I'll take Field of Dreams (never seen Bull Durham) but for romantic spark, I'll take FLOTG. My favorite KC flick is ""A Perfect World"". DWW was OK too."

"eaglejet98","10","0","1","23 July 2006"," Superb acting by Costner and Preston. Great Baseball film.
","Most people are aware that Kevin Costner is an avid baseball fan, as he has made four movies where he was either a rabid fan, active or retired player.<br/><br/>He understands baseball and must have been a fairly good amateur player himself, as his movements on the field are realistic, so his baseball movies are believable even without dissecting the plots.<br/><br/>In For Love of the game however, the underlying love story between Billy Chapel and Jane Aubry (Costner and Preston), enhances, but does not overshadow the baseball theme. In fact, without the love story, the film might be a flat, plot less story.<br/><br/>Some critics say the plot and particularly the ending, where we all know Chapel will pitch a perfect game, detracts from or imparts an artificiality to the film. But I would refer those critics to the 1984 film, The Natural, with Robert Redford. That film was predictable, yet its predictability was the stuff of Saturday morning matinées at the movies, where the good guy in the white hate defeated the bad guy. Same with For Love of the Game. Its predictability, which actually only becomes apparent near the middle of the last game, adds to the overall effect of the film.<br/><br/>Costner is superb, not only as a ball player, but as a man who is obviously falling in love with something other than baseball, for the first time in his life.<br/><br/>The best surprise of all is Kelly Preston. This is, by far, her best performance. She is totally believable as a vulnerable, insecure single mother, who is afraid of having her heart broken as a sports groupie.<br/><br/>As an avid baseball fan, I loved this film for its reality in depicting an aging baseball player's plight. But as a guy who isn't into ""chick flicks"" I have to admit that I was swept away by the love story.<br/><br/>I loved it, even though I am a die hard Yankee fan!"

","That's how I feel about this movie. Costner (I'm NOT a Costner fan) takes it so close to schmaltz so many times in so many movies and then actually crosses the line into overdone enough times for me. But he does have a certain charm in some situations, portions of this included. I think Kelly Preston is a fine actress and beautiful in a very natural way, but I'm not buying the Costner/Preston thing in the least. Unfortunately, this movie is chick flick first with baseball a pretty close second. For me the romantic ups and downs are almost physically painful to watch. But the baseball concept is so great and so well done - the old warhorse coming out and throwing one last heroic game - that I am willing to skip or zone through the relationship dreck (it worked to DVR it and zoom through the bad stuff). Reminiscent in its own way of Seaver's 300th win, a truly great sports moment. The always urbane Vin Scully sets the mood perfectly along with a fine musical score, and there are times when I really get choked up. The last two innings of the game are about as good as it gets in sports movies, I mean it. A qualified thumbs-up, just wish they would have reordered their priorities."
"The_Void","6","0","1","15 June 2005"," Sentimental love story misses all three strikes
","Sam Raimi has made something of a name for himself in modern cinema for his comic book styled movies. The Evil Dead Trilogy was, of course, his first masterpiece; but other good comic book styled movies in his oeuvre include Darkman, The Quick and the Dead and more recently, the Spider-Man films. For some reason, he decided to make a shift from comic book to drama in 1998, with the excellent thriller A Simple Plan. I'd have been happy for him to go back to what he does best after that, but he wasn't - and he went on to make this film. For Love of the Game is a film that mixes sporting action and romance, and tries to parallel to the two through it's central character, played by Kevin Costner. Simply put, the film doesn't manage to do what it sets out to do. The romance and Costner's love for the game are no doubt touching, but the film lacks the fundamental element of inspiring feeling for the characters from the audience, and this is why it falls down. This sort of film only works if you can tap into the character's thoughts and feelings; and the screenplay for this movie ensures that you cannot.<br/><br/>As this movie stars Kevin Costner, it is very cheesy. Most movies with Costner in them work in spite of him, but since this movie doesn't work anyway; his presence doesn't hinder it. I'm still unsure as to why he continues to get roles, however; he's so false it's impossible to do anything but snigger when he's on screen. This film features many moments of cheese - especially the ending - so Costner is right at home here. An awfully sentimental musical score runs throughout the movie as well, which again hinders it. The characters on display are largely cold, and it's hard to feel for them because of this. None of them develop and the messy way that the film is plotted doesn't help matters either, and as we continually jump into moments of the protagonist's past, we become less connected with his plight rather than more so as it should be. The worst thing about this movie is the final thirty minutes. To say that they drag would be a vast understatement, and this mixed with far too much fake sentiment make it a very painful climax. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't a total dead loss as some of the scenes and ideas are good; but there isn't enough 'good' to ensure that the finished piece is such."

","At age 40 Billy Chapel has a strong baseball career behind him as a Detroit Tiger and he still believes he can continue for a few more years of playing, even though he is not at his best and his shoulder is aching. On the day before the last game of the season Chapel learns that his one-time lover Jane Aubrey is leaving to go to London and the owner of the Tigers has sold them to a consortium that seek to trade Chapel to another team. Retirement seems the best option for him but he does love the game and doesn't feel ready to give it up just yet. These things weigh on his mind as he pitches against the Yankees and he thinks back over the career and life he has had up till this point.<br/><br/>Short of adding another hour to the running time, you really couldn't lay the clichés any thicker on this film  even the opening credits are the formulaic mix of home movies and sentimental memories. If you can accept that, then you still have another obstacle to get passed  sentimentality. The whole two hours plus are spent wallowing in sentimentality in regards the present game, memories of baseball, memories of relationships and any other way it can wallow. For the majority it is very cloying but at times it shows what it could have done if it had managed to avoid these problem; occasionally the baseball game is enjoyable, occasionally the characters are realistic and their relationship interesting and engaging, occasionally the film isn't plodding. Occasionally. Sadly for the rest of it, the film does very little.<br/><br/>The plot jumps between Billy's memories, meaning that they exist as fragmented parts of a story  making them feel even more clichéd than they already were and preventing us seeing the characters develop over the time. This still could have almost worked if the film had avoided painting the whole thing with sentimentality but it doesn't; instead it runs deep through the film be it via the music used, the dialogue, the little speeches on the mound, lots of little things. Sadly it doesn't and it turns this Hollywood sports movie into the type of sentimental melodrama that clutters up the daytime TV schedules  in fact this film had its UK television premier on a Saturday lunchtime. It is a classy daytime melodrama but it is a soapy melodrama nevertheless. Seeing that the director was Sam Rami, I was a bit surprised but then I suppose that this genre is hardly his forte.<br/><br/>The cast can barely rise above the material although Costner comes the closest, hardly surprising since he has done this sort of role several times before. He is grizzled, does a far-off stare when he has to remember things and does look at home on the mound. He still can't do much in the face of so much sentimentality and he cannot carry the clunky lines he has to say, but he is good if you like him (although many people seem to dislike him). Preston is pretty poor and I think it is because her character is supposed to be a ""normal"" person and she can't do that. Reilly, Cox and Simmons make the support feel classy but none of them actually have anything to do. The cast might also have some real players, commentators etc but, like the vast majority of the world, I don't know any baseball celebrities and have no real interest.<br/><br/>Overall this is a daytime television melodrama dressed up in expensive Hollywood clothes. Although it is quite enjoyable on this level, the plot is overflowing with clichés and the film is scripted, directed, scored and acted with sentimentality flowing from every pore. The end result is an average sports film that will be enjoyed by those seeking a cheesy melodrama but not many others."

","This is an excellent baseball movie and a decent romantic entry as well. Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.<br/><br/>The story unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect game. <br/><br/>
The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing, the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us an authentic look at how athletes get `in the zone', filtering out all the noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although only the best can achieve it at will.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's direction on this film was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he did a superb job on the baseball scenes. The combination of on the field action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league game in progress.<br/><br/>The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the scene in the hospital where she screams out `Is this America?  Is baseball still the national pastime.' Overall though, she played the part of the torn lover very well.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the game scholastically.   So overall, I would have to rate his performance here as very good.<br/><br/>John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.<br/><br/>I love baseball and this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8/10. Anyone who enjoys sports will probably enjoy this film."

Kelly Preston playing an older' woman with a daughter already in college (she had the child when she was 16) - I can't swallow that but replacing her with Alicia Silverstone, now that would make it believable<br/><br/> 9.Pushing FOX Network salaciously throughout this movie - one bit of backfired irony: the movie plot of a family-owned team being sold to a syndicate and having to get rid of its star player - sounds very similar to what a certain Mr. Murdoch did.<br/><br/>8.  Picking on poor Detroit - again.  Given that the film was made one to two years ago and the filmmakers had to find a bad baseball team that would still be bad when the film came out, but how about Kansas City, Minnesota, The Cubs?<br/><br/>7.  Billy Chapel didn't realize that he had not allowed any baserunners until the 8th inning!! How many years has he been in the big leagues?  19, and going to the Hall of Fame?<br/><br/>6.  In this sacred cathedral (i.e. Yankee Stadium) we now have a chapel' and more sappy voice-over from Vince Scully.  Be careful, Vinnie, John Sayles is looking for a make-no-sense announcer for ""Eight Men Out"" - the sequel.<br/><br/>5.  Does Anybody Care About America's Favorite Pastime?' - good rhetoric but a below-the-belt swipe at Emergency Rooms that ignore people bleeding<br/><br/>4.  Calling Prince Billy in Boston - pick up my daughter, bring her home, and I have some passion lovemaking waiting - and other incredibly contrived scenes<br/><br/>3.  It can't be a love story because Billy and Jane see each other only during Spring Training and when the team is in town - or am I missing some March to October romance here?<br/><br/>2.  It can't be a baseball story - all the players look like cutouts, the 9 innings are the longest any movie fan will have to endure (Harvey Keitel did a lot better job with the 9 innings he had to work with in ""Bad Lieutenant""), and the opening scene with the walking teammates in double-breasted suits is a poor rip-off from ""The Right Stuff""<br/><br/>1.  Why can't Kevin Costner clear the mechanism' of all gimmicks and cliches and make a decent movie about an over-the-hill pitcher who still loves the game' enough to pitch his best game?  (Oh, you mean he did that already? Was that before or after ""Waterworld""?)"
"DTL","4","0","1","25 September 1999"," For the love of your sanity tale the walk on this one!
","I saw the much awaited and ballyhooed FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME starring Kevin Costner in his third baseball film. This time he is an aging veteran pitcher which should not be confused with the aging catcher that he portrayed in the superior BULL DURHAM or surely should not be confused with aging outfielder played by Robert Redford in the much superior THE NATURAL. I guess, like the character Costner played in the third baseball film, FIELD OF DREAMS, film makers believe that if it's baseball and Costner makes it ""they will come.""  If they do it will be unfortunate.  I admit I am a nut for baseball films. The before mentioned NATURAL, EIGHT MEN OUT and Ray Milland's golden oldie IT HAPPENS EVERY SPRING are among some of my favorites.  I looked forward to this new one with eager anticipation and I was unfortunately greatly disappointed.  A pitcher throwing a perfect game (retiring 27 batters without anyone getting on base) is a rare feat indeed. The premise of this film is that Costner late in his career, late in the season in a meaningless game to his cellar dwelling Detroit Tigers facing the Yankees about to clinch their pennant, he throws one. Preposterous you might well say?  This is Hollywood do not forget and baseball is the stuff from which dreams come.  I suppose that this premise is no more or less ridiculous than a man building a baseball diamond in an Iowa corn field to give the 1919 Chicago Black Sox a second try or a professor of chemistry discovering a chemical substance that makes a baseball avoid wood.  So I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief that this could and as I knew, would indeed happen. What made the story unique, I thought prior to viewing it, was the fact that Costner relives in his mind, his life, while he is pitching the BIG game.  I still believe that this premise could work.  The problem with FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME is Costner's life away from the diamond is a big drag. Kelly Preston as his on again-off again girl friend is the biggest problem.  We simply don't give a damn about her.  She is such a neurotic, little whining fool, we want her to just get on the plane to England and get out of the movie. Their relationship is stupid, terrible and we keep saying why would they want each other. <br/><br/>The baseball scenes are terrific, but hardly worth the seven bucks.  I can only hope that Costner, like the aging baseball pitcher he plays, retires from making anymore baseball movies at least ones like FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME."

","During the last 30 minutes of this exceedingly snail-paced, derivative, predictable, poorly scripted cornball flick, I found my mind drifting to thoughts like ""Seeing a perfect baseball game is indeed a rare occurrence.  Seeing a genuinely GOOD movie these days is almost as rare!"" The last one I saw was ""Life is Beautiful"" and one year later I am still reliving those unforgettable scenes in my mind. To Hollywood producers, directors, and screenwriters: You are in a position to create works of art. Concentrate on the art; let nothing else distract you."

","What more can I say! Do you think it is possible for Kevin Costner to make a movie that is less than 2 hours long these days?  This is a story about Billy Chapelle (Kevin Costner) and Time, as well as a love story thrown in there for effect, the only problem is that the love story consists of 3/4 of the movie.  The baseball scenes are realistic, and well done.  If director Sam Rami (A SIMPLE PLAN), had shortened the love story of Kevin Costner's character, and Kelly Preston's character to about 45 min, and made the rest of the movie about baseball, it would have been much more better! When I went to the movie, I found myself dozing off into dreamland, several times, and I wasn't even tired!  The movie jumps back and forth through time, and is very frustrating to say the very least! If you like Kevin Costner,and you like baseball movies; check out BULL DURHAM, or FIELD OF DREAMS. My rating on a scale of 1/10 I would have to say 3, for the baseball content!  Definately a first date movie."
"Phil_H","4","0","2","18 September 1999"," Long, overwrought, uninspired.
","First, let me get this off my chest: I hate baseball. Really. To me it's a dull thing to watch. A movie about baseball, to me, is about as exciting as getting a rigid sigmoid-colonoscopy.<br/><br/>It's a darn good thing that this movie really isn't about baseball, rather it's about relationships, loyalty, love, and the difficulties that come along with them.<br/><br/>I must admit that this film *almost* works.  Costner, is getting more back on track after such dismal films as ""The Postman,"" and ""Waterworld,"" but he's still not back to where he was with the perennial favorite ""Field Of Dreams.""  If the love interest could have been more believable; or if the film would have been more interesting to watch on the whole, it would have been superior.  <br/><br/>This film could have become a great ""end of summer"" release, sadly it falls just short of acceptible instead.  Almost as if this film ""settles"" for second best.  Pity."
"MoviDude","2","0","2","18 September 1999"," Sluggish, like a wet sponge
","This movie stunk. There. I said it. I'm not going to give in to peer pressure and say, ""Oh, this was a well-acted wonderful movie that is one of the best of all time and features great performances from Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner."" No. Maybe what would've saved this garbage is if Kevin's full-frontal scene would have been left in. No, even then it would've stunk. The acting was atrocious by the two leads--Preston only gets recognition because she's married to John Revolta and Costner hasn't been in a good film since JFK. There were some awful bits of dialogue(""I'll remember you the most, Scarecrow."")and incredibly overdone soppy scenes. I thought I would need an insulin shot just to remedy all the sweet sappiness and sugar that I had just been injected with. It was awful. Scenes were badly staged from left to right. I went to the bathroom, figuring I wouldn't miss much, and I was right. I came back, and most everybody was slumped in their seats, nearly asleep. Okay, okay, I'm not a coldhearted individual here; I like a good romance just as much as anybody, but this was ridiculous. Each time the two leads would come close to kissing, Costner would stiffen up and remain wooden for the rest of the scene. It was excruciatingly awkward. Some good things(and there are a few): The supporting cast is good--I've always thought that Jena Malone is one of the most talented young actresses out there, and she acquits herself nicely. John C. Reilly has some good lines as Billy Chapel's buddy. Sometimes, the cinematography/photography was pretty good. But, for the rest? It stunk. Miss this one at all costs.<br/><br/>One star out of four."

","FOR LOVE OF THE GAME (1999) **<br/><br/>Starring: Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly, Jena Malone, and Brian Cox Director: Sam Raimi   ??? minutes   Rated PG-13 (for language and sensuality)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	Sam Raimi has proven to us that he is a very capable director with movies like ""A Simple Plan."" The same goes for Kevin Costner, who has acted beautifully in movies like ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" and ""Field of Dreams."" Also, Kelly Preston (""Jack Frost""), John C. Reilly (Never Been Kissed"") , and Jena Malone (""Stepmom"") are all fine actors on the rise. Not to mention, this production is one of the most anticipated of the early fall movie season. With all  this going for it, ""For Love of the Game"" should have been one heck of a drama...but, unfortunately, it's not. And it is a real disappointment considering the potential involved with the production.<br/><br/>
	""For Love of the Game"" reunites the popular romantic star Kevin Costner with the Baseball genre that affected audiences so immensely in the 1989 wonder ""Field of Dreams."" This movie may  have struck big with audiences as well, if only, it  had more Baseball in it. The film has one main game of Baseball included in its story, and oh, what a wonderful game it is. The tension arises with Costner being the soon-to-retire, forty year old pitcher named Billy Chapel, who is right in the middle of throwing a perfect game for the team of Detroit at what might just the end of his career.<br/><br/>
	Also accruing: Chapel's long time girlfriend, Jane Aubrey, and her daughter, Heather, are leaving him to go to London for reasons entirely prepared by the writers in order to create an internal problem as well as Chapel's presumed retirement serving as an external problem. Pretty standard structure so far--if the filmmakers were  to continue with this almost perfect beginning this movie would have lived up  to its possibilities.<br/><br/>
	But no. Right in the middle of the intriguing Ball game Billy is pitching for, his wondering mind propels a series of flashbacks that literally kill the production's hope of existing even as a half price video rental. It does three things that screw up the movie's overall point of view:<br/><br/>1)  Billy's flashbacks tell of the love story between him and Jane--a subject that happened over five years ago. Shouldn't that be before the ball game taking place in present day? If you're going to develop a relationship between two characters, it should transpire in a logical, easy to understand order of events. Costner got this correct when he starred in this year's much better romantic journey ""Message in a Bottle,"" but that film had little romantic chemistry. Here, he seems to be a puppet of the plot, but he and Kelly Preston are bursting at the seems with likable chemistry.<br/><br/>2)  The flashbacks are somewhat irrelevant and disturb the intense tension that the Ball game contains; I was begging that Costner would focus long enough on  present day to allow us to become involved in what is interesting--no luck here.<br/><br/>3)  The scenes add too many complications like:<br/><br/>A)  Jane's runaway daughter who leaves her overly-protective mother after they have a big fight (which we never see, thus no empathy can relate). She runs off to her fathers, a junkie who is said to be stoned ninety percent of the time (whom we never meet, thus no reason to compare or take sides with the characters). These events are prepared for us by the prop department who obey the writers' commands. In this case, the filmmakers need a reason for Jane and Billy to see each other again. Instead of developing romantic chemistry by adding confrontations with Jane and Billy, they give us irrelevant coincidences. <br/><br/>B)  During most of the flashbacks, Jane and Billy are not being developed, but fighting, arguing and destroying their relationship like a married couple. The sub-plots involved  with these flashbacks should develop their relationship, not mutilate it. <br/><br/>C)  There is a major accident involving Billy and his hand. This incident is also prepared by the props department due to a need to trigger an effect that will have dastardly effects on Billy and Jane's relationship.<br/><br/>
	Most of the film has chemistry and reason to its happenings and events. They just don't happen  in the right order to make the film fit together like an actual story offbeat love story. The beginning and the end are great--but  the middle is a disaster. Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston do what they can to keep the script in active motion, but even they are no match for poor screenwriting. It even goes for a desperate bookend sequence (if you don't know what a ""bookend"" is, E-mail me) that is supposed to trend the scenes together, but that is way off whack. The closing scene is of the best I've seen all year; the sneak preview audience that I attended with was cheering happily for the characters. I was thinking to myself that this is a movie is too ridiculous to recognize the emotional power of its closing--and that its conclusion belongs in a better production. <br/><br/>Brought to you by Universal Pictures."
"Kinikia","Null","0","1","14 September 1999"," My Review for ""For Love of the Game""
","I absolutely loved the film. It is Costner at his greatest. The audience loved it; they laughed and cried, cheered and jeered. They loved Billy Chapel and loved to hate him when he was being self-centered and selfish. John C. Reilly, who played Chapel's close friend and catcher, Gus Sinski was a great addition to the movie. Kelly Preston was absolutely magnificent, and will be envied by Costner fans worldwide. Jena Malone, as Heather was a wonderful treat. <br/><br/>The early pictures and film of Kevin was the perfect touch. You could feel the pride of his parents bearing down on you and you shared their pride.<br/><br/>
In real life, we have all seen Kevin laugh as we share his successes. I'm sure when he's had his solitary moments, he has cried and we have shared his defeats. At time people saw him as self-centered, selfish, and difficult but I believe, like Billy Chapel, he was only looking after the one thing he loves the most apart from his family, his movies. The Yankee fans (the critics) booed him, but his teammates (his true fans) stuck by him. And as in the movie, in the end the Yankee fans (the critics) will cheer him and his team (his true fans) will be with him 100% and they will be awesome for him. <br/><br/>""Tag your it Mr. Costner, It is your turn to stand in the spotlight.""<br/><br/>Kinikia"

","This movie was so slow moving and predictable that I was actually counting the seconds as they ticked off of the clock waiting for it to end.   On the surface it seemed like a good rental choice.   I like baseball, my wife likes Kevin Costner.  Within ten minutes, the entire plot was clear.  There was not a single surprise or unexpected twist.  I give it a three, only because it was about baseball, and the trailer and box at the rental store got me to rent it.   If you need a sleeping aid, then this movie is for you, otherwise leave it on the shelf."
"Monika-5","Null","0","1","5 March 2002"," Fouls out
","As a baseball fan, and a fan of a good love story, I expected to enjoy this movie. But I'd take the baseball game story line over the dull romance any day. Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston had NO chemistry, and the ""love"" story made me snooze. I did enjoy John C. Reilly in a supporting role. I've yet to see a movie that can truly, deftly combine a sports story and a romance. This isn't it. Avoid."

","Kevin Costner is really a good fan of baseball. Acting here makes three the number of films on baseball where Costner acted, only equal to Charlie Sheen. The plot is really good, a pitcher who finds a lady and fell in love with her, but his love for baseball is often stronger than his love for the lady. The film passed while he is pitching a no hit against NY Yankees (never happened in the reality as far as I know) and at the same time he is remembering each step of his life and of his love for Jane. If you understand and love baseball you will not be disappointed to see such a film."
"andjwil","3","0","2","7 October 2001"," Very boring
","I like baseball movies of all kinds--even sappy ones. I was ready to like this one. But...the use of the extended (and I mean extended) flashbacks was distracting and incredibly boring. It took too long to get back to the baseball story. It seems like they wanted this to be about anything but baseball. I wanted it to be about baseball. Go watch Bull Durham if you want a better Kevin Costner baseball movie, or watch The Natural if you want to see a better sappy baseball movie."
"markguszak","5","0","1","2 August 2001"," I really wanted to like this film.
","I tried, I tried hard. However, after flashback number 97, I started to get a little irritated. This is a film that is supposed to pull on those heart strings and it tries to pull on them in every scene. Watching this film, I could not help but be reminded of ""Jerry MacGuire."" The film just wants to be so sentimental, so often. It just gets tiring. The story revolves around a 40 year old pitcher, who might be pitching his very last game. He is played well by Kevin Costner. Costner's character is your classic throw-back ballplayer, he lives and breathes baseball. He is also very loyal to his Detroit Tigers. However, as his career winds down, he starts to see that there are other things in life that are important. Moreover, he starts to see that he is going to have to start making some huge decisions, soon. The problem is, we can see the decisions he has to make pretty quickly, Costner's character cannot seem to grasp the obvious around him. The flashback scenes of his developing romance just start to become tedious. Moreover, practically all of the characters in the movie are undeveloped. You really don't know anything about Costner's relationships with other people and players. However, the movie pretends that we all know the history. I hate to say it, but the movie starts to get real sappy. It is just too simplistic. The same old points that have already been made, baseball is great, we should all love baseball, why don't you love baseball? I think the film should have concentrated on the baseball angle or the love angle. However, it trys to do both and we are left with a somewhat uninspired, paint by the numbers, novel to movie. ** out of ****."
"Sloke","3","0","2","20 November 2000"," Big goose-egg
","Pretty boring film that, like a pitcher wondering whether to throw to home or first on a suicide squeeze, suffers from a fatal case of indecisiveness. Is it a romance or a sports yarn? So it tries to do both, and fails. Too bad ""The Lou Gehrig Story"" was already done. Ostensibly about a pitcher trying to end his career with perfect game, it develops no excitement about this prospect up until the eighth inning. Before then, we get flashback after flashback, sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks, documenting what is, except for the celebrity of one of the participants, a pretty desultory romance.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is quietly effective, though perhaps too quiet to wake up viewers lulled by the drony dialogue. Kelly Preston has a big vein on her forehead, and not much notable screen presence besides that. Even John C. Reilly is forced to spout some howlers (""We'll be awesome for you!"") And Vin Scully! How did they make you utter a line like ""A Chapel pitches a gem in the Cathedral of Baseball""? That wasn't thunder in the sky; it was the sound of Mel Allen groaning."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","13 September 2000"," I really like this movie, for a sports fan, 8 of 10!
","This movie, ""For Love of the Game"", spans one complete baseball game, Detroit at NY Yankees, last game of the regular season. In a series of flashbacks Costner's character, the aging all-star pitcher, reminisces over the past 5 years, particularly in his relationship with Kelly Preston's character. In the process, about 2/3 through the game he realizes that he has a perfect game going. In 120 years of baseball, only 18 perfect games have been pitched. So, the drama mounts as we see whether he will succeed, or, as he did in ""Tin Cup"", hit it in the lake on #18.<br/><br/>If you generally like Costner, like I do, then you will like this movie. The writing is very good, and unlike many modern ""action"" movies, this one does a lot of character development. One memorable line - ""No matter what happens during the next 5 minutes, I want you to know my heart lept when you showed up at my door. My heart lept in my chest.""<br/><br/>As you find out from the DVD ""extras"", real professional baseball players and real major league umpires were used to film the game. For 30 days in Yankee Stadium, just after the season ended, they filmed the action. For that reason the ball play is very realistic, very game-like. Overall a very fine movie."
"bryant52","3","0","2","30 June 2000"," I've seen better soap operas
","Bull Durham & Field of Dreams:  two excellent Costner baseball films.  For Love of the Game, which had the potential to become the 3rd jewel in the crown falls painfully, lingeringly flat.  They've managed miraculously to almost totally remove the suspense associated with a pitcher's attempt to throw a perfect game.  By the time the conclusion is reached, you just don't care.  The romance, which was the driving force behind Bull Durham is less than 2-dimensional, and, as with the outcome to the game...by the time the romance winds to the credits...the audience has managed to reach a state of almost total indifference."
